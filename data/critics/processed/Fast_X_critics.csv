"Mar 6, 2024","Fast X has many inconsistencies. It has plenty of mediocre performances and egregious attempts at fan service, too. But it doesn't matter. No one who pays money to see the TENTH installment in The Fast and the Furious watches the film for these reasons.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2023",The entire movie is an intellectual nightmare... This franchise peaked long ago. ,NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2023"," Fast & Furious se acerca a su final y se nota. Dos décadas después de haber comenzado, la franquicia se encuentra en un punto donde su identidad está perfectamente definida y justo eso es lo que ofrece Fast X, la undécima entrega: pura acción, explosiones y un toque de locura en el que te tienes que dejar llevar. Esta undécima entrega lleva todo lo que define la saga de Vin Diesel y lo lleva al extremo. La cinta marca el inicio del esperado desenlace y toda esta avalancha de guiños y referencias, sin duda, encantará a los fanáticos, pero puede resultar alienante para los recién llegados. A esta nueva aventura se suma Jason Momoa en el papel de Dante Reyes, el villano que amenaza a Toretto. Es uno de los puntos fuertes de la película y brilla con carisma propio. Es un psicópata con la habilidad de torturar con una sonrisa en el rostro. Un cambio fresco para una saga que se las sabe todas. Fast & Furious X mantiene los ingredientes clave y los lleva al extremo. Dos horas y media repletas de explosiones y persecuciones que hacen de la película dirigida por Louis Leterrier un espectáculo cargado de adrenalina no apto para espíritus sensibles.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2023"," “Mission: Impossible—For Dummies” continues, gaslighting action movie fans as it delivers garbage and labels it fun, taking extreme stupidity as seriously as possible and mixing it with an awful sense of humor and a belief that cliches and platitudes are moving explorations of family bonds. The main characters are always exceeded by the supporting ones, which really creates emotional investment as you itch for this annoying person and then that annoying person to go away. If you’re still reading, “Fast X” finds Dom (Vin Diesel) and co. squaring off against Dante (Jason Momoa), who is obsessed with revenge and suffering and played by an actor who feels like he’s in a different movie than everyone else. At least Momoa’s performance lends scenes a degree of impact and pizzazz; whether it’s an over-the-top action sequence that just feels like a stunt team overcompensating and makes you aware of the CGI-enhanced impossibility you’re watching (rather than a smooth, impressive display that brings you into the movie) or a conversation between characters for whom sentences are not a strength, “Fast X” (which apparently is just the first of the two-part finale here?) is tiresome in all the ways it should kick ass. From the mediocre banter between Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris “Ludacris”) to Letty and Han again contributing nothing (it’s not too late to recast Michelle Rodriguez and Sung Kang, nobody would care) to Dom’s perpetual dopey intensity, it’s just hard to understand what about this is supposed to be entertaining, or even watchable in the slightest.  It’s not all lousy, of course. A few set pieces are genuinely cool (including John Cena as Uncle Jakob and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son Brian escaping a plane in a different aerial vehicle), and all the family family family family talk occasionally stumbles into an OK moment of close bonds rising above petty squabbles or even city-destroying mistakes. But even the presence of Brie Larson as the daughter of Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) can’t account for the film’s exhausting inability to create momentum or weave together its narrative pieces, disconnected around the world. As a result, “Fast X” feels like it goes on forever, as (for the most part) everything the good guys do works and nothing the bad guys do does, regardless of how deliberate or insane the idea. When one of the heroes in a movie does something impressive, you should feel awe, and when a wild action sequence is accomplished, it should make you say “whoa.” In all areas, the reaction “Fast X” elicits is just “nope.” Matt’s new book arrived Sept. 27, 2022, and Richard Roeper raves: “Matt Pais deserves four stars for reintroducing us to many of the greatly talented but often unsung heroes of 1990s film. This is a terrific read.”",NEUTRAL
"Sep 8, 2023",Roman and Tej have their banter&#44; and Cena&apos;s Jakob brings some much needed self-deprecation&#44; but Momoa&apos;s Dante is a delightfully catty bitch&#44; and really saves Fast X from getting bogged down in the franchise&apos;s combo of gonzo idiocy and weepy telenovela&#46;,NEUTRAL
"Sep 7, 2023"," Fast X devours every iteration of the franchise and spits the biggest, fastest, and most ridiculous parts back at you, sometimes without chewing. The film, most likely the first entry in a three-part conclusion, performs like a Saturday Night Live skit with a $300 million budget and is the official opening of summer blockbusters of 2023.  The audience in my screening laughed at serious scenes and chuckled at the jokes that were actual jokes. About 45 minutes into the screening, the movie laughed back at us by being self-referential; then, and only then, was everyone in on the joke: this series is a cash cow and we’re all here for a good time. Most of the stars continue their usual, which makes it pretty easy for new-comer Jason Momoa to steal every scene he’s in except for one. Even though his approach to his villain may not be for everyone, the film surely delivers on its promise of family and extravaganza. One thing about The Furious Saga is whether you’ve seen all of the movies, none, or every other one, the script is going to catch you up with exposition disguised as dramatic dialogue very quickly.  This entry in the franchise sees Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) gather his family, friends, and enemies to protect them from new villain Dante Reyes, played expertly and curiously by Momoa. Dante has studied Dom ever since the death of Dante’s father, Hernan Reyes, in Fast Five. Dante knows every move Dom will make and takes advantage of Dom’s protective nature, purposefully putting each piece of Dom’s family at risk because Dante knows whenever someone is in danger, Dom will react. Dom struggles to save everyone, but still tries, which only intrigues Dante more and leads to the question of who Dom will save if the stakes are raised again? The returning cast is staggeringly large. I won’t ruin some of the surprises, but at a minimum, we have Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Brie Larson as Tess, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges as Tej Parker, Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce, Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey, Sung Kang as Han Lue, Charleze Theron as Cipher, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, and Alan Ritchman as Aimes. Any other reveal would ruin the surprise or be an outright spoiler, but just know that’s only half of the cast. Momoa is the main newcomer, among a few others, that brings life and spice to the production. People have called him pure villainy, chaos, the Joker, and a goblin, but he’s channeling more than that.  He’s already a Hawaiiain and Polynisian actor playing a Portuguese and Brazilian man, but when he adds on other layers, it feels like a step backward rather than a step forward. I had to double check myself, so I ran the thoughts by a friend finishing their doctorate which clarified my fears that not many blockbusters are relying on villainized queer identity right now, so this move for the character definitely came as a surprise, though most audience members loved it. The action in Fast X is what you expect and what you’re here for: classic and souped-up cars and motorcycles, heavy-duty and military grade explosives, all mixed with a few surprises. As per usual, the movie abandons logic and science, but at least the film speaks to this head-on. In one of the funnier moments, a character recounts the teams’ history, going all the way back to their street racing days. He doesn’t seem impressed by their antics and basically acknowledges how crazy the stunts are. This gave the audience the opportunity to laugh at the movie at an appropriate time, which relaxed the rest of the movie for me.  Momoa is the main character that brings the humor. Ludacris and Tyrese, paired with Nathalie and Sung, do the rest of the lifting here. There’s plenty of action and decent fight scenes, but it’s the pace of the film that really keeps the momentum. We’re almost literally working with 5 minute discussions alternating with 15 minute action sets, either hand-to-hand or on wheels. The stunts are always either impressive or grandiose, so they work, and even when they don’t, the film quickly moves on to the next. If the post-credit scene hasn’t been ruined for you yet, stay off the internet until you see the movie. It’s the perfect ending for the direction of the series and fits in line with its style perfectly.  And if you already know, it’s still worth it to get on the ride. The post-credit scene probably got the second or third biggest pop of the night. Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 6, 2023"," Once upon a time there was a little film released in 2001 titled The Fast and the Furious which was essentially a riff on Point Break with street racing, not surfing, and small heists of consumer electronics, not bank robberies. A young LAPD officer, Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrated Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) racing world, fell in love with Dom’s sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and became part of the ‘family.’ From those humble beginnings one of cinema’s most profitable franchise was launched into the world, and by Fast 9 into outer space. The high-octane action series abandoned all sense of reality somewhere around the fourth instalment (possibly earlier depending on your tolerance) and went from a bunch of good-hearted petty crooks indulging in illegal street racing to Toretto’s family basically becoming a black ops group running espionage missions. There really isn’t much point recapping the series as audiences who are up for Fast X have been along for the ride for a long time. It is important to note that the events of Fast Five are essential to understanding Fast X, as the main antagonist Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa in high camp mode) is the son of drug dealer Hernan Reyes who Brian and Dom brought down with the famous cars dragging safes on a highway scene. Fast X recreates that set up and scene with the inclusion of a young Dante and the audience watches through his eyes. The past has consequences, and a time of reckoning is upon the extended Toretto family just as Dom is truly settling down into family life with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). From the action sequence that begins the film we watch as the Toretto family, led in prayer by Abuelo Toretto (Rita Morena) have one of their famous cook outs. A surprise visitor appears at the door, Dom’s sworn enemy Cipher (Charlize Theron) who warns him something far worse than her is coming for his family. From that moment on Fast X tries to balance its action sequences (one mighty set piece in Rome involving a bomb shaped like a mini–Death Star) with Dom’s concerns about the safety of his son. Dante Reyes isn’t interested in just killing Dom and everyone he loves; he wants them to suffer and seemingly has the resources to make that happen on an epic scale. Almost everyone returns for Fast X (Brian is of course at home babysitting the kids, vale Paul Walker). Tyrese Gibson as Roman and Ludacris as Tej spend most of the film bickering an “reacting to shit” as is their wont. Nathalie Emmanuel is back as the tech genius who created God’s Eye. Helen Mirren’s Queenie turns up for about a minute. Han (Sung Kang) gets to face Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who killed him but didn’t kill him. Jakob Toretto (John Cena, one of the better performances in the film) who is back in the family’s warm embrace takes on caring for Little B. There are some new additions. Brie Larson plays Tess, the daughter of former Agency head Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell who is ‘absent’) and Alan Ritchson plays Aimes, the new Agency head who has no time for Toretto and his group. Daniela Melchoir appears as Isabel, a Brazilian street racer who has ties to Dom. If that all sound like there are too many characters to keep track of it is because that is what is happening. Dante’s grand plan is to separate the family and make them outlaws ensuring they can’t help each other. His other plan is to obliterate them once he’s put them through enough pain. Fast X is another globe-trotting adventure (no outer space) which sees various characters all over the world. Few of them interact and there is only one character arc that is of concern or interest. Knowing the franchise even when the stakes are high they’re also quite low. It’s impossible for most characters to stay dead (there is a baffling resurrection in Fast X which the sequels are going to have to go to great lengths to explain). Sure, there are some fantastic action set pieces but writers Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin (based on a story by Mazeau, Lin, and Zach Dean) do little to give the audience new reasons to care. Dom telling Letty that he’s afraid every day that something will happen to his family is as deep as it gets. Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter) is a serviceable action director and keeps to the F&F formula without much deviation. The Fast and Furious franchise has been mostly undemanding fun. Fast X is a little more demanding because with the exception of Jason Momoa’s fantastic and often hilarious villain, there isn’t a lot of fun. There are street races, big explosions, cars being dropped by planes, helicopters exploding, planes blowing up… the standard fare. The problem is there is nothing to weight all the action. Vin Diesel’s Dom is particularly monosyllabic and earnest (Vin does takes these films very seriously) but mostly the rest of the crew turn up in scenes that are so disparate that it’s hard to connect with them. Mia and Letty get to kick some ass (amazing how Mia somehow became basically a professional martial artist somewhere along the way), Shaw is there until he isn’t, and the audience is treated (?) to a Pete Davidson cameo. Fast X ends on a massive cliff-hanger which is no surprise as audiences were aware that there was going to be a Fast Eleven. It has recently been revealed that Fast X is the first in a trilogy within the series, and one has to wonder if the franchise really has enough gas left in the tank to keep it going? After saving the world from a potential nuclear war at one stage, and reiterating, going into outer space, what more is there for the extended (and continually growing) Toretto family to do? Maybe we just all need to strap in for Vin Diesel’s superhero with a car fantasy and go along with it, or maybe, possibly preferably, we get out of the vehicle now.

"Aug 12, 2023"," AKIRA KUROSAWA’S DREAMS (1990). One of Akira Kurosawa’s first loves was painting, and his affinity for art has never been more apparent than in this late-career entry he helmed at the age of 80. He uses the screen as a giant canvas, filling it with an array of colors and images. The film is split up into eight segments: “Sunshine Through the Rain” and “The Peach Orchard” concern childhood encounters with, respectively, human foxes and human dolls; “The Blizzard” and “The Tunnel” deal with ghostly apparitions; “Crows” offers a meeting with Vincent Van Gogh (entertainingly played by Martin Scorsese); “Mount Fuji in Red” and “The Weeping Demon” provide nightmarish visions of the future; and the final episode, “Village of the Watermills,” is a nostalgic piece that serves as the calm after the storm. Akira Kurosawa’s Dreams certainly comes nowhere near to matching his earlier accomplishments, masterpieces like Rashomon and Ran, and that’s largely because his abilities as a storyteller are placed on the back burner here, with the filmmaker content to offer a series of fractured musings. Still, despite an occasional aloofness, it’s an enchanting piece, from its visual splendor to its thoughtful embrace of the natural world. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition consist of film scholar audio commentary; a 150-minute making-of documentary from 1990; 2011’s Kurosawa’s Way, in which filmmakers (including Scorsese, Eastwood, and Miyazaki) discuss his influence; interviews with assistant director Takashi Koizumi and production manager Teruyo Nogami; and the theatrical trailer. ASTEROID CITY (2023). The latest exercise in quirk from Wes Anderson finds the writer-director in a typically playful mood. The time is 1955, and the plot is twofold: It’s about the creation of a teleplay, and it’s about the events that take place within and around the teleplay. Meta to the max, it finds a TV host (Bryan Cranston) explaining how the latest from playwright Conrad Earp (Edward Norton) is set in a desert town where brainy kids and their parents gather for a Junior Stargazers convention. Personal dramas initially command center stage, such as when a photojournalist (Jason Schwartzman) despised by his father-in-law (Tom Hanks) has to explain to his kids how their mother (Margot Robbie) died three weeks earlier, while a talented actress (Scarlett Johansson) must contend with an overriding sense of ennui. But everything turns wacky once an alien (a combo of CGI and Jeff Goldblum, here tackling an otherworldly entity far different from the one he essayed in Earth Girls Are Easy) briefly drops down for a visit, inspiring military intervention and mass quarantines. As someone who generally enjoys Wes Anderson films — heck, I even dug The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, a movie despised by many — Asteroid City unfortunately qualifies as a disappointment, with too many actors wasted in bland supporting roles and too much leaning on the whimsy (which is saying something for an Anderson flick). Still, it earns a modest recommendation on the strength of the dazzling color palettes employed by Anderson as well as superlative turns by Schwartzman (probably his best work) and especially Johansson. ENTER THE DRAGON (1973). While Bruce Lee was already well-known around the world, it was the blockbuster status of Enter the Dragon that made him an enduring legend stateside. This excellent actioner finds him playing a character also named Lee, who’s asked by the British government to travel to the island fortress of Han (Kien Shih), a Dr. No-like figure suspected of dealing in drugs and prostitution. Han regularly holds a martial arts competition on his island, which is how Lee is allowed entrance; while there, he meets Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly), two ex-army buddies who also surmise that something’s not quite right about Han’s operation. Martial arts experts Angela Mao (as Lee’s ill-fated sister) and Bolo Yeung (as the muscular, murderous Bolo) are allowed to deftly show off their moves; ditto Saxon and Kelly, who are also given a few opportunities to develop their characters. Yet there’s never any doubt who’s the marquee attraction. Lee, who also choreographed the fight sequences, exudes charm and intensity in equal measure, relying on the former during the more sedate sequences and the latter during the action scenes. And what action! Lee’s astonishing to behold, and the climactic battle set inside a room full of mirrors caps a series of exemplary fights. (For a note-perfect parody of Enter the Dragon, check out the “A Fistful of Yen” segment in 1977’s Kentucky Fried Movie.) The 4K UHD release contains the theatrical version and the special edition containing slightly more footage. Extras consist of audio commentary by producer Paul Heller and scripter Michael Allin, and an introduction by Lee’s widow, Linda Lee Cadwell. FAST X (2023). Just as surely as the Earth circles the sun, there are some certainties to be found in the Fast & Furious franchise as it hits #10 in the series. 1) Pretty much every character who appeared in a past installment will eventually turn up in a later entry, be it Scott Eastwood’s Little Nobody, Bow Wow’s Twinkie, or the third mechanic from the left in the second race featured in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. 2) With even greater frequency than a George Romero zombie, pretty much every dead character who appeared in a past installment will eventually turn up alive in a later entry, be it Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty Ortiz, Sung Kang’s Han Lue, or … well, no fair telling, since it provides the “shocking” ending of Fast X (with yet another character brought back during the mid-credits sequence). 3) Villains (or at least antagonists) in past entries will eventually come to the aid of Vin Diesel’s Dominic “Dom” Toretto. That probably won’t be the case with the new baddie, Jason Momoa’s psychotic Dante Reyes, but it did turn out to be the case with Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, John Cena’s Jakob Toretto, and now a heinous villain who inexplicably adopts an “enemy of my enemy” stance. 4) To paraphrase a line from my The Fate of the Furious review, Dom will continue to yammer about “family” with even more frequency than any given Walton, Ingalls or Ewing. 5) Even the dipsticks and crankshafts will give better performances than Tyrese Gibson as tiresome Roman. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include audio commentary by director Louis Leterrier; a making-of featurette; scene breakdowns; a pair of music videos; and a gag reel. FERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF (1986). Over the years, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off has arguably sprinted to the top of the list as the most championed of John Hughes flicks. Beloved by conservatives for its unapologetic embrace of the Reagan-ruled “Me-First Decade” (no surprise to learn that Hughes was a Republican) and presumably adored by liberals for its flouting of societal rules, it seemingly hits the sweet spot for everyone. Well, almost everyone. Matthew Broderick plays Ferris, who feigns illness in order to skip school and hang around Chicago with his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and his best buddy Cameron (Alan Ruck). The only two people who see through his ruse are his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who resents how he gets away with everything, and Vice Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who’s incensed that he has already missed nine days due to various manufactured sicknesses. Bueller’s smugness and superiority would be insufferable in the hands of another actor, but Broderick makes him charming and thus bearable. But Sara’s Sloane is a colorless character, while Ruck’s Cameron is a poorly written mass of tics whose ultimate transformation isn’t believable for one nanosecond. Some individual scenes shine, a few Ferris monologues connect, and I enjoyed the turns by Grey, Jones (a great foil), and even Charlie Sheen in his brief appearance. But the picture is ultimately too surface-skimming and scattershot to have such delusions of greatness thrust upon it. Extras in the 4K UHD steelbook edition include audio commentary by Hughes; a making-of featurette; interviews with cast members; and a piece examining the title character. INVALUABLE: THE TRUE STORY OF AN EPIC ARTIST (2018). He may not be as well-known as fellow makeup and effects artists Ray Harryhausen, Dick Smith, and Rick Baker, but Tom Sullivan will always maintain his own corner in horror film history for his contributions to the 1981 classic The Evil Dead and its sequels, 1987’s Evil Dead II and 1992’s Army of Darkness. Invaluable is basically a love letter to Sullivan, with director Ryan Meade bypassing the larger names connected with the franchise, director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell, to focus on a less publicized MVP. While the documentary does touch upon the tragedies in Sullivan’s life (the death of his wife as well as his own car accident), it’s mostly a celebration of the man and his art. Although Sam Raimi is MIA from the newer interviews, most of the other principal players are on hand, including Campbell, Ted Raimi, and The Evil Dead actresses Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, and Theresa Tilly, the latter three describing Sullivan as their gallant protector. It’s always nice to see a shout-out to Famous Monsters of Filmland (Sullivan grew up on the magazine), and this interesting doc even contains footage of the 8MM stop-motion films he made as a boy. Blu-ray extras include a 1989 interview with Sullivan; an interview with The Evil Dead cinematographer Tim Philo; Other Men’s Lives, a bonus documentary about filmmaker and Raimi friend Josh Becker, featuring appearances by Campbell, Sullivan, and actress Lucy Lawless (Becker had written and/or directed a few Xena: Warrior Princess episodes); and two short films from Meade, 2011’s Cosmos Locos and 2013’s Bong Fly. ROMAN HOLIDAY (1953). A star was born with Roman Holiday, as the unknown Audrey Hepburn became a household name with the release of this utterly disarming romantic comedy. She’s cast as Princess Ann, who, bored with her lot in life, escapes during a goodwill tour to Rome and takes in the sights of the city. She’s accompanied in her escapades by an American reporter (Gregory Peck) who feigns ignorance as to her true identity in the hopes of landing a great story. Naturally, the pair fall in love. The chemistry between Peck and Hepburn is palpable (they remained lifelong friends), and there’s a riotous supporting turn by Eddie Albert as the newspaper photographer who aids Peck’s journo in his covert assignment. The “Mouth of Truth” scene is a genuine classic, but the film is packed with equally delightful interludes. Although Dalton Trumbo was the film’s principal writer, the heinous Hollywood blacklist meant that his name was nowhere to be found in the credits; it wasn’t until 40 years later that his contribution was officially acknowledged (and even longer before his name was added to the on-screen credits). Nominated for 10 Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Director for William Wyler, and Best Supporting Actor for Albert), this earned three statues: Best Actress for Hepburn, Best Motion Picture Story for Trumbo (whose widow accepted the award on his behalf in 1993), and Best Black-and-White Costume Design for the legendary Edith Head. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include a conversation about the film with critic Leonard Maltin; pieces on Hepburn and Trumbo; and a featurette on the costumes. STOOGE O-RAMA: THE MEN BEHIND THE MAYHEM – AND EVEN MORE MAYHEM! (2023). To quote that eminent philosopher Curly Howard, “I’m trying to think but nothing happens!” — or, more specifically in my case, “I’m trying to think of something to write but nothing happens!” Frankly, the overall excellence of this three-disc Blu-ray set left me momentarily speechless. Aimed at knuckleheads into nyuk nyuk nyuks, this is a collection of specials, shorts, and other goodies relating to The Three Stooges: Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, and all the others who were ever slapped, rapped, or whapped as part of the outfit. The “feature attraction” (so to speak) would be the hour-long, 1994 A&E Biography episode “Stooges: The Men Behind the Mayhem.” Also included are outtakes from home movies and newsreels, movie trailers, archival interviews, TV commercials (including the boys plugging Instant Simoniz car spray in 1960 and Larry promoting his autobiography Stroke of Luck in 1973), and more. As a lifelong fan of entertainment artifacts from earlier eras, my favorite inclusion was the photo gallery of Stooge memorabilia, including board games, comic books, and a toy movie projector — there’s also a previously lost theatrical featurette, 1937’s Surprise, Surprise, in which the trio tell kids how they can get that projector (equipped with Stooge shorts, of course). Indeed, the only reason this doesn’t receive a perfect score is because of the inclusion of some wince-inducing modern-day material involving Stooge descendants and other comedians (who the heck are Shwartzy and Panaga?). ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976). Film fans argue all day over whether certain remakes/sequels/updates/etc. are opportunistic rip-offs or sincere homages, but to my knowledge, no one has ever saddled John Carpenter’s Assault on Precinct 13 with a derogatory copycat label. This film is pure tribute, a fond salute to Howard Hawks’ 1959 Western masterpiece Rio Bravo (reviewed in this column last week) with the structure of George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead thrown in for good measure. The setting is the mean streets of Los Angeles, and the members of the gang Street Thunder are on the prowl, killing citizens as they see fit. After one particular slaying — still to this day one of the most shocking murders ever put on film — the guilty party is himself gunned down, inciting the rest of the mob to exact their revenge. This leads them to an L.A. police station that has officially closed down and is now populated by only a handful of people, including one cop (Austin Stoker), two secretaries (Laurie Zimmer and Nancy Loomis), and a pair of convicted killers (Darwin Joston and Tony Burton). Perhaps Carpenter’s best film next to The Thing, this is a model of low-budget filmmaking, with a tight script, appropriately tight-lipped actors, and atmospheric location shooting. In addition to writing and directing duties, Carpenter also composed the excellent score (one of his best, up there with Halloween and Escape from New York) and served as film editor under the pseudonym John T. Chance (John Wayne’s character name in Rio Bravo). Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne starred in a lame 2005 remake that was nothing more than an attempted cash-grab.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 11, 2023"," “Fast X” Grade C-: The multi-car pile-up that is “Fast X” is either an example of how there are no original ideas left in a franchise that ran out of gas five films ago or just the fact that no one cares anymore because they know moviegoers will buy tickets even if the film is a total wreck. In the case of this clunker, it is a bit of both. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen “Fast Five.” A major part of “Fast X” features flashback scenes, characters talking about how those who have been fast and furious have escaped the law and an endless string of cameo appearances. If anyone even walked across a scene in one of the nine previous movies, they are back like a celebrity game of Whack-a-Mole. This franchise has gone from a tale anchored in a reality dealing with street racing to a point where the action sequences are more unbelievable than the Coyote’s efforts to catch the Roadrunner. A certain degree of improbability is acceptable in a massive action film but eventually the laws of physics do trump everything else. “1921: Season 1”: The streaming series tells the story of a multi-generational ensemble as they fight for their legacies to endure and hope that those they depend on will return to the places and people they call home. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”: Spider-Man is catapulted across the Multiverse where he encounters a team of Spider-People. It will be available on DVD and Blu-ray on Sept. 5. “Asteroid City”:  Junior Stargazers and Space Cadets assemble for the annual Asteroid Day celebration, but the competition is upended by world-changing events. It will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on Aug. 15. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Aug 7, 2023"," When The Fast and the Furious first premiered in 2001, I don’t think anyone would have expected to still be writing about it in 2023. Not only that, but to also see it as one of the largest soap operas in modern cinema, powered by imagination and a giant heap of NOS. Before it would be given the prefix The Fast Saga, they’d solved crimes, stolen millions from a drug kingpin, prevented the theft of a high-tech spycraft, and even waged a vendetta against the man who killed their friend Han (Sung Kang). With the release of The Fate of the Furious (2017), audiences could finally declare what we’d suspected — logic is a thin thread holding together a tapestry of absolute ridiculousness. Not only that, Fate, the eighth installment, made it clear that everyone gets a second-chance, even if they don’t deserve it. With rumors suggesting that The Fast Saga is nearing its end, the latest feature, Fast X (pronounced as either, Fast X, Fast Ten, or “fasten”), pushes the envelope on everything, reason be damned, resulting in the high-octane excitement you expect, though it makes the least amount of sense out of the entire series. Whatever you think of the film, Universal Pictures brings to the home release eight featurettes, two music videos, a gag reel, and a feature-length commentary track from director Louis Feterrier (Unleashed) to help extend the glory that is Team Toretto in action. Clockwise L-R: Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Han (Sung Kang), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Dom (Vin Diesel), Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), Abuelita (Rita Moreno), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Tej (Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges, back to camera) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson, back to camera) in FAST X, directed by Louis Leterrier.

They started off as a street team that stole VCRs off trucks and managed to turn themselves into freelance spies working for a covert U.S.-based organization.

Now, though, there may be no protection possible for the rage that burns inside Dante (Jason Momoa), the son of Brazilian kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who Dom and the team stole from in Fast Five (2011). Separated by continents, with the law after them, too, Team Toretto may finally be out of gas. Though there was no spoiler-free theatrical release review of Fast Ten published on EoM, what follows will be entirely spoiler-filled in order to address some of the visible and present issues of the film. It’s a weird thing to acknowledge, but the *ideas* of these films are often better than the films themselves. More often than not, they forget what made them engaging in the first place and become a parody of themselves, espousing “family” at every opportunity, leaning into heavy CG, and trying to replace meaning with logic-defying moments. These work sparingly (Letty’s not dead!?!?), but begin to lose their steam over time (Han’s not dead?!?! Gisele’s not dead?!?! Hobbs is back?!?! Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody is constantly referenced as “missing” when he was seemingly killed in 2021’s F9 – he is not dead?!?!). One can hand-wave away the fact that the Toretto family is of questionable background (Italian? Mexican? Cuban? Dominican?), though I’m not sure who Little B’s (Leo Abelo Perry) supposed to be the child of as he looks nothing like Dom or Elsa Pataky’s Elena Neves (still dead), because we love the ever-expanding cast and the characters who get to play in this world. One can hand-wave away the fact that this team gets bested in ways that either suggest they weren’t as good as believed or they got too relaxed in their success (the latter more plausible than the former), except that they keep getting played over and over. With Fast Ten originally the first of a two-parter (jury’s still out if it’s going to be the first of three instead), it makes a certain amount of sense that Team Toretto would be on their heels for much of this film, but to the degree at which they are behind Dante makes less sense against their history. These films have a tendency to re-write their own history, seen in instances like making Tokyo Drift (2006) a future story in the main Fast Saga timeline versus when it was released, bringing Letty back and then Han. They’ve even found a way to make the enemies-to-lovers pipeline a way to extend their ranks to a varying degree of entertainment. But even soap operas need to provide logic that doesn’t defy itself (But Calculon! I thought you were dead!). An example of the good: Little B expresses to his uncle that he doesn’t like planes, a possible nod to his mother’s death or Deckard Shaw’s (Jason Statham) aerial fisticuffs saving Little B as an infant during Fate. Helen Mirren’s Magdalene Shaw appearing in Italy to advise Dom on his situation, a playful nod to the characters’ connection from F9 and a way to explain why Dom would still be in Italy when he’s a wanted man (she provides the info on Letty’s location after being arrested). Speaking of, where the hell is Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) in all of this? This is not the first time the operative has had a relative in the thick of things and hasn’t gotten involved. It’s not that Hattie *has* to appear, but we know she exists, has been demonstrated to be a character that *would* get involved, but isn’t mentioned at all. But what doesn’t make sense is having two different films include a narrative thread of Deckard looking for redemption for what he did to Han only to then immediately attack Han when the formerly-deceased appears on his doorstep, especially when *twice* Han displayed no intent to attack. It doesn’t make sense for the team to ever side with Cypher, even if Dante is a greater threat, as it would betray Elena and Little B, yet there’s a general sense that the Toretto Sunday dinner is about to need an extra chair. There’s no argument that more Charlize Theron in a film is a good thing, especially when she gets to chew the scenery in a role like Cypher, but even by soap opera standards, this feels low and dirty. I would understand some rehabilitation on the part of Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) since we know he was being manipulated by Cypher (and it would be great to see all three Shaw siblings on screen together kicking ass), but Cypher feels like a bridge too far. The script was reportedly at the heart of the problems that led original Fast X director (and savior of the series) Justin Lin to leave the project. Given the choices made throughout, the surprises that try to up the emotional ante, it makes sense that there are larger inconsistencies throughout the film. Granted, it should be viewed as one part of a two-film story, so it’s fair to acknowledge that Part Two could effectively course correct some of the issues present in X, but it would be hard to do. For instance, it’s canonical that Elena was after Hernan Reyes, so she would’ve known and therefore told Dom that Dante existed. This should’ve been known info during Five and the handling here creates a few holes. Some could be avoided by simply having Dom say something instead of, say, Daniela Melchior’s Isabel Neves, Elena’s never-seen-before sister providing the exposition. Just a few tweaks in who says what, a few switches in scene order to smooth the flow, and less reliance on CG for the action sequences, Fast X could really be something. When you couple all of the inconsistencies with a series of action sequences that lack the tangibility of the previous films, one begins to believe less in the power of Dom and more in the inevitability of 101010101s to design action sequences. It’s a shame, because Fast X likely would be able to be as memorable for audiences as the emotional arc in the film wants it to be by relying less on special effects to make the action great and engaging. The good thing is that Universal Pictures didn’t skimp on the bonus features, a practice becoming more and more scarce lately for some unknown and frustrating reason. Whether you’re a casual fan, someone who could write a guide to Fast Saga newbies, or you just like to learn about movie-making, the home release includes roughly 87 minutes of behind-the-scenes materials. Want to learn how they staged and shot the stunts? Covered. Want to hear from the cast regarding their feelings on making the movie? Covered. More of Momoa being deliciously dastardly? COVERED. You get the sense that there is a lot of blue screen work done on the film, but when it’s done well (like on the bridge in Rio vs. the rolling bomb sequence in Italy), we get to appreciate how the Fast Saga can really tell strong and engaging stories when they want to through the magic of cinema. Fast X certainly has its moments, and I’d like to think that the reason so many of the things which bother me about the script (the absence of characters, even by mention; the inclusion of others) is because the prior nine films inspired a sense of ownership of the world and here, it’s clear from what’s on screen that there’s an attempt to make everything memorable, everything heavy with intention and emotion, yet it forgets in its attempts to tell this larger mythos to go back to what made it strong in the first place. Perhaps with Part Two a conclusion can appear that will see Team Toretto come together like the Avengers post-Blip, pumping NOS and blasting Marky-Mark and the Funky Bunch in Jakob’s (John Cena) honor, driving down on Dante like Heaven’s angels on a mission to end all missions. As cool as that would be, I’d settle for a story that didn’t rely on soap opera tropes that didn’t undercut years of character investment. This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn’t exist.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023"," Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of an old foe, comes crashing into the lives of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) with a mission of revenge. Swearing to make Dom suffer before killing him, Dante sets off to hit Dom where it hurts most: his family.  Reviewing - and certainly rating - the Fast and Furious movies is something of a challenge. None of the F&F movies are actually any good as movies, but many of them are really, really good at being F&F movies. ""Good"" and ""bad"" mean very different things in Fast and Furious movies than they do to virtually the entire rest of cinema. ""Good"" usually doesn't involve things like good acting, smart storytelling or giving a stuff about the willing suspension of disbelief, but ""bad"" has almost nothing to do with being silly, over-the-top, or far-fetched. Well, almost nothing.In truth, F9: The Fast Saga (or Fast and Furious 9, which is, I believe, its proper title in South Africa) actually was ""bad"" in both the traditional sense of the term and bad for a Fast movie precisely because it actually took that silliness, that over-the-top-ness, that far-fetched-ness that has been the series' stock in trade since at least Fast 5 and pushed it well beyond its breaking point. Having our heroes literally drive into space may have seemed like a hilarious inevitability considering how each film in the series since the soft reboot of Fast and Furious (aka. Fast 4) has been upping the ante on ridiculous set pieces, but when it finally did happen in F9, it mostly just felt... lame. Ditto when Dom literally swings a car across a canyon with a barely there tightrope or brings down a whole building Samson-style.            There's a fine line between silly and just stupid, and the generally tired and tiresome F9 found the series treading all over that line, all while well and truly running out of steam. It didn't help that Jason Statham and the Rock were nowhere to be found, so the whole thing rested on the far-too-earnest shoulders of Vin Diesel, or that it all looked that much worse with its fake and weightless CGI set pieces coming in the wake of the latest John Wick and Mission Impossible films – and, of course, Top Gun: Maverick.So, where does that leave Fast X (or, again, as it is actually titled in this country, Fast and Furious 10)?  Well, it's pretty bad. Obviously, but the good news is that it's only pretty bad as a regular movie. As a Fast and Furious, though, it's easily the best since at least the 7th one, possibly even the 6th.The problems are obvious. Vin Diesel is still more wooden in this than he is as Groot. The film has more characters than it knows what to do with. There's no sense of actual jeopardy as the series has resurrected so many dead characters that we may as well treat the Fast gang as immortals. The action set pieces are less realistic than a roadrunner cartoon – and have roughly the same fidelity to the laws of physics. And if you want to be catatonic before the end of the first act, have a drink every time someone says ""family"" in this ridiculous cliché-ridden script.It's total crap, but in the best Fast and Furious tradition, it is super enjoyable crap. Fans can breathe a collective sigh of relief after the 9th movie seemed to lose even the most die-hard of them because this is what we want from the series.Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) steps into the director's chair, replacing series regular Justin Lin – who is still around as co-writer with Dan Mazeau – and he breathes some new life into the action sequences. They're still ridiculous, and they're still CG-heavy, but they're propulsive and less over-edited than some of the other instalments in the series. They're also on just the right side of ridiculous, so while you may laugh, for example, at the idea that almost no one died during the film's first proper action scene involving our heroes trying to stop a gigantic runaway bomb from destroying the Vatican by all but entirely destroying Rome, the action itself is still – well, okay, it's completely ludicrous, but it's ludicrous within limits.It also definitely helps that though the film's revenge-centric plot is hardly new for the series, it junks the more convoluted spy stuff for something much more stripped down. Admittedly, with this many characters to serve (along with established faces, we also have even more new additions in the form of Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson and Daniela Melchior), the film is still massively overstuffed. Because most of our central characters are split up across the globe for most of the movie, it constantly has to shift focus between each one of them to give each their time in the sun. It's good bang for your buck, but it doesn't exactly help the film's breakneck, but still sometimes weirdly plodding pace.What really sets Fast X apart, though, is its ace in the hole: Jason Momoa. As a direct counterpart to Vin Diesel, who still seems like the only one in the cast still taking any of this remotely seriously, Momoa has quickly shot to the top of the list of series bad guys by being just as over-the-top as he can be. His preening, mincing, dancing, moustache twirling, flamboyantly camp Dante is just a total scream, and Momoa is clearly having more fun than everyone else in the film combined, relishing as he so clearly is, the chance to play completely against type. He's technically one of the Fast gang's deadliest baddies, but he's such a ham (in a good way) that he never disrupts the overall camp comic-book tone of the rest of the film for a second.    I wasn't overly looking forward to Fast X after its lacklustre predecessor, but it's such a blast that I can safely say that it's not just the multiple cliffhangers that the film ends on – think Avengers: Infinity War but dumb - that have me really eagerly looking forward to Fast XI and, presumably, Fast XII. Because, of course, this wildly out-of-control franchise is going to need three films to wrap itself up. I would almost be disappointed if it didn't.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," I'm never going to apologize when a movie makes me smile from start to finish. Even the most ludicrous (pun intended) of premises, mixed with stunt casting, is worthy of praise. For a franchise like that of ""Fast & Furious"" to keep reinventing the same tired concepts and making them feel fresh is a feat. The tenth installment, ""Fast X"" gives the series of films a much needed boost, thanks in large part to nostalgia combined with Jason Momoa.  ""Fast X"" opens with an unlikely introduction: The climax of ""Fast Five"" in 2011 in Rio de Janeiro, where our fateful heroes Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) see the end of drug lord Hernan Reyes during an action-packed chase scene that leaves Reyes dead. Unfortunately for the franchise heroes, they made a new enemy in Reyes' son Dante (Jason Momoa) who witnesses his father's demise and vows to make Dom pay for his actions. Cut to ten years later, and Dom receives a visit from a sworn enemy, Cipher (Charlize Theron), who informs him that a war is coming and its leader is Dante Reyes seeking revenge on Dom's family of misfits. In a series of unfortunate events, Dom's crew is split up for most of the film, and it's a race against time to save every one of them before Dante has his way. The Agency that Dom has devoted most of his days to has also been compromised, throwing a wrench into an already complicated scenario. But Dante's mission isn't apparent until halfway through ""Fast X,"" when he makes it evident to Dom that his target is Dom's 8 year old son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). To protect his son from Dante and the Agency, Dom calls in a favor to his brother Jakob (John Cena), who takes young Brian on a roadtrip to outrun the assassins hot on their trail. Meanwhile, Dom and his crew are scattered throughout the globe, traversing the catacombs of Rome, street racing in Brazil, and some find themselves in precarious situations in London, Portugal, and even Antarctica. New allies form, and several old enemies resurface in surprising ways. ""Fast X,"" like so many of the movies in this tongue-in-cheek franchise, is chock full of adrenaline and speed. Vin Diesel's Dom is unquestionably the star of this vehicle. Still, a substantial amount of screen time has been devoted to Jason Momoa's Dante, an unhinged, flamboyant peacock of a man who has clearly lost his marbles. Whatever person Dante was before his father's infamous death is no more. Momoa plays Dante as a remarkably sarcastic, bombastic swashbuckler that rivals any Bond villain to the extreme. It works on many levels, and sometimes it's just plain silly. But, silly is what fans of the franchise keep coming back for, and there seems to be no end in sight. Thankfully, ""Fast X"" provides its franchise devotees some much needed rejuvenation in the form of new additions and some familiar faces. Brie Larson injects some stability as Mr. Nobody's daughter Tess, a new ally for Dom and his family. A Brazilian street racer named Isabel (Daniela Melchoir) who gets caught up in Dante's michigas. The Agency's new leader Aimes (Alan Ritchson), gives masculinity a new name as he emerges from the shadows to help where he can. But the backbone of ""Fast X"" comes from the family Dom has cultivated for several decades at this point, including reappearances by Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, and Helen Mirren. Several cameos work very well (Rita Moreno as Dom, Jakob, and Mia's grandmother) and some are unnecessary scenes that attempt comedy but fall flat (Pete Davidson). Much has been written about some other cameos from mid-credits scenes and the movie's climax, but I won't spoil the surprise for longtime viewers. What needs to be known about ""Fast X"" is that it leans heavily on the absurd, as many of the movies in the franchise do. The action from director Louis Leterrier is top-notch, but the screenplay leaves much to be desired. The cast does their best to liven up the mood, even when Vin Diesel tries to wax poetic with speeches about family and honor. Despite all of this, the films started as just a story about street racing and morphed into a high stakes revenge plot involving government agencies and multimillion-dollar payouts. But the characters in ""Fast X"" make fun of these facts throughout the movie, so everyone is in on the joke. ""Fast X"" sets up a new series of movies that will tie many of the old characters we've come to know and love with new additions to the franchise. Leterrier gives longtime fans easter eggs throughout, placing characters in many of the same scenarios they once found themselves stuck in in past movies. There are sequences that are almost shot-for-shot the same as other movies in the franchise, but with different characters. This is clearly on purpose and meant to evoke nostalgia for a series entering its third decade onscreen. There's no telling how many more of these movies Diesel and Company have up their sleeves, but at least this one tries its best to set the stage for a new trilogy with a befitting villain. Momoa is having the time of his life with Dante, bringing menace and intrigue to an otherwise animated Big Bad. With a runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's not the most concise entry into the franchise, but time isn't felt in a place like this. With some of the internal fighting between crew members cut, the movie could have been streamlined. There are way too many characters to count at this point, and not all of them are necessary to the story. But it's a fun flick with outstanding climatic sequences and a colorful Jason Momoa that's worth the price of admission.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023"," Fast X is a homecoming. This 22-year-long journey is packed full of stars and cars, with the loosest of plots tying it all together. As one watches Vin Diesel somehow manage to pull two helicopters behind his car in this tenth installment, it’s easy to forget that this franchise started out as an adaptation of a profile of a New York City street racer. Long gone are the simple days of Dom Toretto (Diesel) illegally racing through the streets of Los Angeles. Now Dom has a family and a (mostly) legal career helping out various law enforcement organizations via fast cars, races, and heists. Throughout Dom’s saga, he has made some friends and a lot of enemies. One of those enemies is Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of a man who died at the hands of Dom in Fast Five. Dante and Dom are fueled by the same central idea: family. In Dom’s case, his love of his family is personified by his deep desire to act as a caretaker to anyone he cares about. Dante, however, has taken the loss of his father as motivation to not only watch the world burn, but to be the one who lights the match. Dante wants Dom to suffer because of what he did ten years ago, and will rest at nothing to make sure Dom experiences pain like he’s never known before. There’s plenty to love in Fast X. It’s quite impressive that the franchise has managed to make the car chases and fight sequences new in every installment. You want to see Vin Diesel knock a massive bomb through the streets of Rome like a real-life Rocket League? Fast X has that. Have you ever seen pictures of a massive dam and thought, how cool would it be to drive down the length of the dam? Look no further than Fast X. Sure, these stunts defy gravity, but this is also the franchise that sent a car into space in F9. The laws of physics are a little different for Dom and his crew. Fast X desperately wants to be a fun popcorn summer flick. The film manages to achieve that status quite a few times, but the runtime is so sprawling, the script so nonsensical, and the action sequences so drawn-out that it cannot sustain the levity. At times, it’s almost endearing how much the film has doubled down on the idea that the love of a family is the single most important thing in the world. At other times, it’s comical how often Dom gruffly says “family” as the answer to any question posed to him. It’s like the film takes itself out of the goodwill it creates. There’s also the matter of the villain. Momoa plays Dante as if he studied at the Johnny Depp Pirates of the Caribbean school of acting. It’s clear that he’s having a blast, wearing clothes that look like they were stolen from Harry Styles’ wardrobe and gleefully skipping to and fro as he detonates bombs. Dante is the nastiest, most ruthless villain of the franchise, and it’s refreshing to see Momoa play against type and embrace this different style of masculinity. Strangely, the performance feels uncomfortably queer-coded. There’s a long history of film villains characterized with stereotypes of queer people that creates harmful misconceptions and perpetuates homophobic ideations. In a film where this queer-coded guy is against a bunch of traditionally masculine car dudes who are governed by their faith, something doesn’t feel quite right. No matter what is said about Fast X, there are two more films in the franchise. Fast X ends in a blatantly unnecessary cliffhanger, but it’s unlikely anyone is on pins and needles about what the next installment will hold. As exciting as it is to watch these cars race through historic streets all around the world, Fast X is missing a feeling of tension. There are no real stakes in the franchise. People assumed to be dead can return (and have), so perhaps that’s why the cliffhanger doesn’t hold any water. In any case, as long as there are new and exciting ways for cars to race and explode, people will show up for Dom and his family.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Not the best Fast &amp; Furious film but the fact that the film goes back to the basics and forgets about things like going into space makes it a worthy addition to the franchise&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," If you don't believe that Fast X will be one of the Fast and Furious franchise's last films, which you shouldn't, then it's time to face a different realisation. Now 22 years old, this family-, street racing- and Corona-loving ""cult with cars"" saga — its own words in this latest instalment — might one day feature every actor ever in its always-expanding cast. Dying back in 2013 hasn't stopped Paul Walker from regularly appearing a decade on. He's the first of the core F&F crew to be seen in Fast X, in fact, thanks to a flashback to 2011's Fast Five that explains why the series' flamboyant new villain has beef with the usual Vin Diesel (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3)-led faces. Playing said antagonist is Jason Momoa (Dune), who adds another high-profile name to a roster that also gains Brie Larson (Ms Marvel), Rita Moreno (West Side Story), Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad), Alan Ritchson (Reacher) and Walker's daughter Meadow this time around. It's no wonder that this 11th flick in the franchise (yes spinoff Hobbs & Shaw counts) clocks in at an anything-but-swift 141 minutes. It's also hardly surprising that living on-screen life a quarter mile at a time now seems more like a variety show than a movie, at least where all that recognisable talent is involved. There are so many people to stuff into Fast X that most merely get wheeled out for their big moment or, if they're lucky, a couple. Some bring comedy (the long-running double act that is End of the Road's Ludacris and Morbius' Tyrese Gibson), others steely glares and frenetic fight scenes (The School for Good and Evil and Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves' always-welcome Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodriguez, respectively), or just reasons to keep bringing up Walker's retired Brian O'Conner (which is where Who Invited Charlie?'s Jordana Brewster still fits in). When more than a few actors pop up, it feels purely obligatory, like the F&F realm just can't exist now without a glimpse of Jason Statham's (Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre) scowl or getting Helen Mirren (Shazam! Fury of the Gods) going cockney. Do too many drivers and offsiders spoil the Point Break-but-cars hijinks? Not completely, but the high-octane saga's jam-packed cast is now a roadblock. It certainly can't have helped screenwriter Justin Lin, the director of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, F9 and initially Fast X until leaving a week into production, and his co-scribe Dan Mazeau (Wrath of the Titans). Their script sports an overarching plot, with Momoa's Dante Reyes avenging the death of his drug-lord father five films back, but it's really about servicing the required parts. Oh-so-many folks require some screentime; all the usual heist, chase and race antics have to drop in; everyone needs to jet between the US, Italy, Brazil, the UK, Antarctica and Portugal; family must be mentioned approximately 423,000 times; and Diesel's Dominic Toretto demands a few of beats to act as if Brian is dead even though he remains alive in the series' storyline. That's the to-do list that Lin, Mazeau, and Statham's The Transporter and The Transporter 2 filmmaker-turned-Fast X helmer Louis Leterrier tick through — and tick they do. Dom and the fam, including his abuelita (Moreno) and son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry, Cheaper by the Dozen), get an early backyard barbecue, waxing lyrical under the Los Angeles sun about the ties that bind. Then Roman (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang, Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel, The Invitation) go to Rome for a job that goes wrong, and ex-adversary Cipher (Theron) shows up bruised and bloody on Dom and Letty's (Rodriguez) doorstep talking about the devil. The common factor: Reyes, who has declared war on the extended Toretto brood without them knowing he exists. They should've expected him, though, given that battling family members — of past enemies and, when John Cena (Peacemaker) joined in F9 as Dom's brother Jakob, their own — is another box-checking saga staple. Almost every newcomer to the franchise, both here and in general, is related to someone else. That's how deep the series' family values go. And yet, for a saga that started embracing its ridiculousness when Dwayne Johnson (Black Adam) jumped aboard — also in Fast Five; you can't have Diesel, Johnson and later Statham bashing their sweaty heads together without having a sense of humour about it — it plays the soap opera-esque parade of kin (and the well-known actors being them) too straight. Fast X knows how outlandish it and its predecessors are with stunts, even if no one rockets to space this time. It says cheers over Mexican beers to its established cliches as well. And it joyfully has Momoa get giddily OTT as the scrunchie-wearing, ""awesome!""-spouting, Joker-esque Dante, visibly having a ball doing so. But the so-earnest-it's-playful deliriousness that should always hum through these tales of petty thieves-turned-international spies is often revved over by needing to shoehorn in another character, then another, then more, whether they've been fam since day one or they're making their debut. It's doubtful that it's on purpose, but Fast X practises what Dom preaches, making its audience appreciate the simple things. There's nothing uncomplicated about the movie's hyper-stylised stunt choreography, with its giant pinballing bombs and reggaeton drag racing — the latter soundtracked by Daddy Yankee's 'Gasolina', of course — but the film is lighter and livelier when it strips itself down to its pedal-to-the-metal and fist-throwing basics. That's when there's an energy to now seven-time F&F cinematographer Stephen F Windon's whooshing and whirling lensing, too, especially when he's gliding through windshields while engines are purring in a Rio-set moment. Smartly, Theron and Rodriguez are gifted an impressively staged fray that screams for them to have their own spinoff. And when helicopters are being flung at each other by a Dodge Charger, it's pure dumb action-flick fun. While those choppers are swooping and crashing, revhead-in-training Little Brian can't help exclaiming with excitement. Fast X isn't ready to usher the saga's big-screen entries into Fast and Furious: The Next Generation just yet — it will eventually, sometime after this chapter's one confirmed sequel and likely second follow-up get motoring, although animated Netflix series Fast & Furious Spy Racers got there first — but that glee is exactly what Diesel and company want their audience to share. This is a thrill ride in fits and starts, however. At its worst, including with its stop-mid-scene cliffhanger, it's franchise-extending filler that never-ending sagas like the Marvel Cinematic Universe have made the gear-grinding norm. But when Fast X pumps the gas on turbocharged vehicular lunacy rather than playing connect-the-dots and spot-the-famous-face, giving four Oscar-winning actresses too little to do and dropping in hardly surprising guest appearances, it's an entertaining-enough spin down a well-driven road.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," A fascinating case study in the huge and profitable landscape of the intellectual property franchise system is the Fast films. No other series commands this level of bulletproof resistance in the face of logic, the laws of physics, basic storytelling, and perhaps, even death itself. Its most prominent leading man, Vin Diesel, has built a product that has immunized itself against conventional wisdom, and asks in each succeeding installment: “How can we make this more unbelievable?” instead of the opposite. Crazy inhuman feats, gravity-defying car stunts, bald muscular heroes in their 50s punching each other with contracts stipulating they cannot lose a fight — and lest we forget — beer chugging and burger-flipping in the backyard while Pastor Dom gives his homily about family. The Fast movies have built a religion through its unexpectedly long tenure, and each one of them has pushed the mythos around the idea that family plus cars equals mindless adrenaline-fueled spectacle. It has gone on for so long, in fact, that it even reached the final frontier in its ninth film through Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej’s (Ludacris) outlandish trip to space in no less than a car. Now, the Fast films are set to end, and what once was supposed to be a two-parter has recently been revealed to actually be a trilogy. This marks Fast X as the first of three concluding chapters, which should already tell you that coming into this one expecting a complete story will not really be smart. But, also, this is the franchise that tells you cars can jump over three buildings. When has it ever begged its audience to be smart? Starting off with an opening that plays through the franchise’s most inspired action set piece, the bank vault heist from Fast Five, it becomes crystal clear in the first few minutes that Fast X is about honoring itself. Each story beat, choice of location, and action set piece is inspired by, or in other cases, a complete recreation of a previous installment’s creative decision. No other aspect of the film best reflects this than the film’s villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), who is retroactively inserted into the fifth film to artificially generate years’ worth of resentment towards our lead characters. His motivation for revenge? Dom wronged his family. Cool. And also, he’s kind of a crazy terrorist who’s obsessed with blowing up national landmarks and creating some biting philosophical quandaries for Dom to make him doubt his family-coded morality. Nice. Asking the question “Why?” seems to always be a futile and rhetorical question when directed towards this franchise, because far too often the answer is just “Yes.” Lots of questions can be made like, why did Dante wait for this long? Why isn’t he obsessively mad at Brian too? How can he just hack money with a couple of keyboard clicks? Or, what’s the point of creating a global terrorist rampage over your vendetta against one man? But I realize that asking these questions is like trying to catch the wind in a net. So, instead, I wanna ask: What is the piece that Jason Momoa is conducting in this film? Is it a chaotic symphony? Drawing from the psychopathic tendencies of the Joker and Green Goblin? Or, is it a tormented, misunderstood sonata? A character study of someone who actually hides behind humor to shield himself from insecurities (I was reminded of Noho Hank from the HBO series Barry for some weird reason). Or, maybe it’s just Momoa doing a carefree acting gig that screams “I’m going to get paid a huge bag so I’ll do whatever makes me happy.” No answer is truly going to satisfy me, except for the fact that I am 100% certain Momoa saw the 2022 Netflix film The Gray Man, and instead of forgetting about it a week later like the rest of the general population, he used Chris Evans’ uneven, slapstick joke of a villain performance as his bread and butter. It’s safe to say that my annoyance at Momoa’s character will only grow from here on out.  It’s tough to really mention anything groundbreaking about the characters of Fast X because they are given barebones development and have reached the point where the jokes are doing much of the heavy lifting. Everyone is motivated by family and it does not get any deeper than that. Honestly, that’s fine by me. Jason Statham shows up in the film and is reluctant to join the crossfire, but when his family suddenly enters the picture, *gasp*, the horses have been set loose. In fairness to the Fast family, John Cena’s portrayal of Jakob and the reformed, good uncle side of himself that he shows Dom’s son was a welcome spinoff film inside this bloated mess. I would’ve loved to see more of that if only for Cena’s pure and uncynical performance.  There’s too many characters in the film, and they are all over the place — literally. There are people we should take note of in Los Angeles, Brazil, Paris, Rome, and even goddamn Antarctica. And it isn’t simply that they go from one place to another; it’s that they are all in these places at the exact same time, creating huge disconnects from one scene to the next. For instance, a simple, classic street race in Rio de Janeiro is then quickly upended a few seconds later by an action scene in a futuristic robotic prison with James Bond-like lasers and advanced technology. An explosion in a highly populated city is then followed by a secret The Incredibles-looking lair, introducing us to Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson, agents whose sole purpose is to give us exposition while footage of (better) Fast films play in the background. With all of these in mind, I still think there’s a lot to enjoy about Fast X. In fact, a little rewiring of expectations and having an open-mindedness to absurdity is crucial in having a good time with these types of films. But I’ve found it increasingly hard to find genuine interest for this one because the stakes have been severely hampered, to the point wherein seeing someone die means absolutely nothing, after seeing plenty of characters from the grave making their return in subsequent sequels. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023"," “Fast X” contains all of the ridiculous elements that create a “Fast & Furious film” – Vin Diesel mumbling all of his lines, zero existence of science (or physics), enough explosions to make Michael Bay shed a tear, howl-inducing villains, and a barbeque for the whole family of racing enthusiasts. But, just like the previous installment, this addition to the cinematic junk food action franchise doesn’t have amusing set-pieces that catch the audience’s attention. Nor does it have any coherence both in front and out of the camera, ending as a forgettable, albeit chuckle-worthy baffling, popcorn flick. “Aunque digan que soy. Un bandolero donde voy. Le doy gracias a Dios Por hoy estar donde estoy. Y voy a seguir con mi tumbao’ Y con mis ojos colorao’”… those were the lyrics of Don Omar and Tego Calderon’s track “Badoleros” that graced the screen back in the days where the “Fast & Furious” franchise was just about racing cars… and family (the “core” of its existence). Ever since the Rob Cohen film from 2001 that introduced us to the likes of Dominic Toretto, Letty, and Brian, each film gets further away from what it once was, for better or worse. I think the franchise reached its highest point with “Tokyo Drift” and “Fast Five;” the rest of them range from bad to utter trash. These films are multi-million-dollar action pictures with lackluster direction and set-pieces scattered throughout their first lengthy trailer. It removes the surprise factor of their audacity when you see it on the big screen. The last time we got a “Fast & Furious” film, aka “Fast 9,” John Cena joined the crew as Dominic’s brother (although that, by itself, isn’t believable). And, most importantly, they went to space, smashing a satellite in the process. The crew thought that to add some fire to the ridiculous narrative, they had to strap rocket engines onto a modified Pontiac Fiero and make it fly high into the sky. But, of course, we knew that would happen at some point, so it didn’t shock us. Now, we are at the “final” stages of Dominic Toretto’s family adventures, where Newton, Galilei, and Kepler don’t exist. One may call it the last ride. “Fast X,” the eleventh installment in the franchise (counting the spinoff “Hobbs and Shaw”), begins with a flashback from “Fast Five,” the bank heist that culminated in a high-speed vault chase on a bridge. We are seeing a different perspective this time around, from the eyes of this film’s big baddie, a mustache-twirling, knife-licking, song-singing Dante Reyes (played by Jason Momoa in the most pantomime of fashions, feeling like he’s in a very different movie from the rest of the cast, for better or worse). Like ‘Sting’ in the WWE hanging in the raptors, Dante has been watching Toretto’s moves all along. He’s playing hidden chess to know the precise moment to strike his vengeance. It seems like a lazy plot contrivance to make him be involved since the very beginning of Toretto’s hijinks. The main point of this film is to be the first piece of a closing trilogy to end the franchise — until the studio needs out of quick-pumping cash, which won’t be long enough. After that sequence, we return to the present, where the whole family is reunited in the only way they know: having a barbecue, drinking Coronas, and delivering some mediocre quips (with terrible line delivery). Everything went fine until Toretto receives an unexpected visitor late at night. Cipher (Charlize Theron) is knocking on his door, all filled with bruises. She warns him about some forthcoming dangers, the already-seen Momoa. Soon after, without any haste or explanation, we are dragged to another country. Explosion-filled action sequence awaits us. All of them show the worst of Louis Leterrier’s B-movie-like directorial skills. These scenes are a lifeless debauchery of mindless gimmicks, zero tension, and Xbox-360 graphics, leaving the audience bored out of their minds. It is time to switch things up. The people involved heard you. And they came up with something that will make the experience worse than imagined. The “Fast X” crew takes on an “Infinity War”-like approach to deal with the enormous threat of Jason Momoa’s way-too-campy villain. They have decided to dive the family into teams — the comedic one led by Jakob (John Cena), the constantly bantering duo of Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese), the female badasses (Theron and Michelle Rodriguez), and the lone wolf (Vin Diesel) — to fight the Thanos-like evildoer. The best groups out of the entire bunch are John Cena’s and the Theron/Rodriguez combination. The former has the wrestler-turned-actor presenting why he’s a likable actor to watch. His comedic chops and line delivery are sharp. And although the sloppy script knocks him down a few times, Cena finds his soft landing on a funny quip. The latter is so ridiculous and baffling in all aspects that it managed to keep me entertained for the little time it lasted. However, this division hurts the film more than it thinks. The cast has worked together for so long that they bounce off each other quite nicely, even if it’s repetitive. So, separating them into groups causes the dynamic to switch; the actors need to find ways to make each group hold its own weight. None of them, even the better ones, stay afloat. You tune off immediately because everything, from the action set-pieces to the visual effects, is terribly and uninspiredly done. Sure, a handful of moments catch you off guard because of their excessive ridiculousness and physics-law-breaking sequences. But, the cinematic junk food that these films had in the past has been lost through its eye of only making millions instead of having audiences entertained. Add all that with its lack of stakes (or tension), and the viewer is left with anything impressive to seek out in this film or the ones that follow it. What is happening to this franchise is the same thing that the MCU is going through. At this point, anything they do won’t cause any reaction from this audience because we have lost interest. We only hang on to these films and watch them at the theater to see their curtain closer. We have seen all of them. Why not suffer for a few minutes to see how it will finally end (although it isn’t)? “Fast X” is mediocrity at its finest and an action blockbuster at its lowest. On a positive note, Jason Statham is getting some big bucks… which is excellent!

"Jul 19, 2023"," Cuando la primera 'The Fast & The Furious' llegó a nuestros cines en un ya lejano 2001 bajo el subtítulo de 'A todo gas' y con la forma de una suerte de remake apócrifo de la fantástica 'Le llaman Bodhi' de Kathryn Bigelow en clave tunera, fue completamente imposible sospechar que supondría la primera piedra de una franquicia cuya evolución podríamos etiquetar, cuando menos, de sorprendente. Con el paso de los años y las secuelas, lo que empezó como un thriller de acción al uso —horteradas dosmileras aparte— y con los pies en la tierra fue abandonado progresivamente lo terrenal hasta terminar alcanzando literalmente la estratosfera; abrazando sin pudor el absurdo y desafiando las leyes de la física hasta convertirse prácticamente en una suerte de autoparodia. 22 primaveras después de su debut, las aventuras de Dominic Toretto y compañía enfilan su última carrera con una 'Fast & Furious X' que marca el inicio del fin llevando aún más si cabe al extremo la deriva que empezó a tomarse en la determinante 'Fast Five'; brindando un fascinante y divertidísimo pastiche a medio camino entre el cine de superhéroes y el thriller de superespías más internacional. El resultado, como no podía ser menos, son 140 minutos con regusto a despedida y que reúnen todas y cada una de las señas de identidad que han hecho grande la licencia, incluyendo su gusto por el melodrama de saldo y las setpieces más delirantes,  y que se enriquecen por dos elementos determinantes: su desquiciado villano y una narrativa que no escatima en efectismos para mantenerte pegado en la butaca. A estas alturas de la película, tanto la licencia 'Fast & Furious' como sus responsables saben perfectamente a qué juegan y, lo que es más importante, qué líneas han cruzado previamente que les impiden volver atrás. De esto modo, después de robos en rascacielos, batallas contras submarinos nucleares, viajes espaciales y otras lindezas, lo único que queda es volver a abrazar la autoconsciencia, jugar a la metarreferencia casi rompiendo la cuarta pared y jugárselo todo a una sola carta. Así, esta décima parte, tras un farragoso primer acto que pone sobre la mesa la hilarantemente solemne ñoñería marca de la casa con frases lapidarias sobre la fe y la familia extraídas de un libro de autoayuda, reinventa una de las secuencias más míticas del ahora decálogo; abriendo la puerta a su trama más ambiciosa hasta la fecha en términos de escala y de saltos mortales con triple tirabuzón que, increíblemente, logra aterrizar sin problemas. Reuniones imposibles, parentescos inesperados, sucesos traumáticos, alianzas forzosas, cliffhangers casi televisivos, giros de telenovela... el repertorio de conejos que saca 'Fast X' de la chistera para atraparte y hacerte salivar por devorar su continuación es casi infinito, y se ve potenciado por unos personajes tan encantadores como de costumbre. Mención especial para el Dante de un Jason Momoa totalmente desmadrado; un antagonista a medio camino entre el tropo bondiano y el Joker de marca blanca que cumple con su rol de gran amenaza para el clímax de la saga. Pero está claro que aquí no se viene a ver diálogos propios de Aaron Sorkin ni arcos dramáticos propios de una tragedia shakespeariana. Si algo te lleva a sentarte ilusionado frente a una cinta de los rápidos y furiosos son sus escenas de acción, y 'Fast & Furious X' cumple sobradamente con las expectativas arrasando ciudades europeas, desatando el caos en autopistas y apilando cadáver en peleas y tiroteos mientras tira por el desagüe las enseñanzas de Sir Isaac Newton sobre la ley de la gravedad. El desembarco de Louis Leterrier en la dirección como sustituto del veterano Justin Lin ha sido impoluto. El francés, curtido en el género con filmes como 'Transporter', ha moldeado unas setpieces vistosas, vibrantes y caóticas; no estando esto último reñido con un magnífico sentido de la causalidad que las hace funcionar como complejas máquinas de efectos encadenados al servicio de la destrucción y del disfrute del público más entregado a la causa. Los aplausos y las carcajadas están asegurados. 'Fast & Furious X', entre codazos y guiños cómplices, y sin ser necesariamente la mejor de la serie —tampoco importa— es un sueño hecho realidad para los que, como un servidor, hemos entrado en el juego de la saga y disfrutado su mutación hacia un tono y un estilo que entiende la esencia comiquera mucho mejor que muchas adaptaciones de la viñeta a la gran pantalla. Y es que, probablemente, estemos ante la mejor película de 'Los Vengadores' con cochazos, camisetas sin mangas, olor a gasolina y superpoderes de andar por casa que podamos llevarnos a la boca. Si lo que está por venir tras el coitus interruptus de su tercer acto va a mantener este nivel, bienvenido sea.",POSITIVE
"Jul 5, 2023"," I’m perplexed that a brain-dead action film like Fast X, the latest installment in a series of films that began twenty-two years ago with The Fast and the Furious, could give me such existential angst. On the one hand, it’s an absurd soap opera of a film where a fake-looking muscle car falls hundreds of feet from a fake-looking plane to land on a highway where it wipes out an enemy convoy of fake-looking SUVs. On the other hand, after theaters were shut down for the better part of two summers by a global pandemic, don’t audiences have a right to their big, bombastic CGI silliness with a side of popcorn and Junior Mints? By all means, in this crazy world we live in, feel free to escape to a nice chilly theater and watch this absurd cartoon of a film. All I’m asking is: Do summer blockbusters really have to be this lazy? After reveling in the adrenaline rush of Top Gun: Maverick in May 2022, it’s hard to watch Fast X without laughing at the ineptitude filling the screen. The entire cast with the exception of Jason Momoa (Aquaman) sleepwalks through the film. The film sags every time he disappears from screen. Is everyone else bored? Or simply playing it far too earnest for a film this ridiculous? In the opening moments of the film, we revisit the infamous “vault theft” from Fast Five where our protagonists literally hook a steel bank vault to their cars and blow town with the vault in tow. Their escape turns into bloody mayhem as they attempt to elude their pursuers on a bridge. The scene has been re-edited to blend the original footage with new inserts showing that Dante Reyes (Momoa) was present during that caper that killed his father. For ten years, Reyes has planned his revenge, and that unfolding plan forms the plot of Fast X. Over the years, this franchise has gone from gritty to glossy, and it’s much the worse for it. The Fast and the Furious tapped into the love of an old-fashioned car chase. From Bullitt (1968) and The French Connection (1971) to Ronin (1998) and We Own the Night (2007), movies have long celebrated practical stunt driving. The Fast and the Furious tapped into that vein and was one of the pleasant surprises the summer of 2001 had to offer moviegoers. [For car chases, my personal favorite is found in the lesser-known crime film The Seven-Ups from 1973. How anyone walked away from the end of that scene I’ll never know.] Since this promising beginning, the franchise has steadily valued CGI-rendered actions sequences over the driving skills of talented humans. The Fast and Furious films have morphed into a combination of video games and cartoons with cars launching out of skyscrapers and plunging off mountains. No one dies and the wheels on the muscle cars keep turning even if they look worse than the Chrysler LeBaron driven by John Candy and Steve Martin in Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987). They are spectacles with no stakes, and even the spectacles are computer fakery. Fast X also feels the need to give every star from the history of the franchise their own action moment. Charlize Theron, Jason Statham and John Cena all have hand-to-hand combat moments that made me think of their far superior work in Atomic Blonde (2017), The Transporter (2002) and The Suicide Squad (2021) respectively. The clunky cinematography and choppy editing certainly don’t help their attempts to beat some life into their, uh, ... beatings. The four John Wick films have served to expose every camera and editing trick employed by mediocre action films, and Fast X is no exception. The bright spot in the film is Jason Momoa who plays Dante the Villain like a male model from Zoolander who can’t help but kill the people who stand between him and what he wants. He’s a fun-loving force of chaos — think Health Ledger’s Joker with painted toenails instead of make-up. Momoa understands the film he’s in and turns the campiness up to 11. This franchise jumped the shark six films ago, and Momoa knows he really can’t go too far at this point. Fast X was originally promoted as a two-part finale to the series and ends on a cliffhanger. At the film’s international premiere in Rome, Vin Diesel hinted that it may be the first in a three-part finale. A nine-film series that “ends” with a trilogy of films is the perfect meta commentary for this bloated franchise.",POSITIVE

"Jun 16, 2023"," As the years go on, the Fast and Furious movies become bigger, louder, and in most cases dumber. They’re more crowded, and even more unmoored from the laws of physics, as well as any qualms that may have once existed about bringing characters back from the dead. Now there’s Fast X, the first in what’s promised as the final trilogy of Fast films. Once again starring Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and his usual gang of drag racers-turned-international super-spies, Fast X extends almost all of those recent trends, bringing its cast well into the dozens, including cameos from both familiar characters and new faces played by recognizable actors. Fast X has a lot going for it: a plot that builds on Fast Five, which is the best film in the series, and the best villain these movies ever had. The car chases are first-rate, still finding creative if not plausible ways to hurl cars at people, off mountains, and sometimes at each other. The film’s consistently hilarious, although only some of the humor is intentional. One character gets a fantastic speech about the series' tendency to take its antagonists from previous movies, especially when they're law enforcement, and add them to the team of good guys in time for the next mission. That’s the case here with John Cena, the previous film's supervillain, who’s back on Team Famil. Diesel gets to deliver his usual intense dramatic monologue about the importance of family, and… it's hard not to laugh. On the other hand? The hand-to-hand fight scenes are entirely  shaky-cam style, and it's awful. The extreme car chases are filmed clearly, with a strong sense of space, so why not do the same thing when it's just two people having a fistfight? And the film’s messy and over-plotted. Longtime fans likely remember 2012’s Fast Five, in which gangster Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) kept his money in a giant safe, a la Scrooge McDuck's money bin, and Dom and Co. dragged it through the streets of Rio and killed Reyes for good measure. Dante Reyes is his son, out for revenge, and played by Jason Momoa in a flamboyant fashion that recalls Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Fast X begins with the team drawn to Rome for a mission, and falling into a trap laid out by the villain. It later jumps all over the globe, from Los Angeles to Rome to Rio to Portugal, as well as the obligatory ""Undisclosed Location,"" although by the end the location is disclosed. It's established that Dante has a penchant for kidnapping the children of his adversaries, indicating that Dom's 10-year-old son Brian (Black-ish veteran Leo Abelo Perry) is going to find himself in serious peril. That kid suffers enough trauma over the course of just this movie  including the part where he's essentially used as a child soldier—that it would likely keep him in therapy for decades. Alan Ritchson, the enormous actor from the Jack Reacher TV show, shows up as a secondary antagonist and breaks the previously unattainable record of having the biggest muscles of anyone in a Fast and the Furious movie. Fast X was directed by Louis Leterrier, the French director of the Transporter films, as well as Now You See Me and Clash of the Titans; he stepped in for the franchise's signature director Justin Lin, who was originally slated to direct but stepped away.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023"," It's the 10th installment of our adventures with Dom and the Family, but how many more will there be? Is the franchise....RUNNING OUT OF GAS? Let's talk all the one-liners, car destruction and surprise cameos that FAST X had to offer.",POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023"," And by dark magic, we mean fierce negotiations by stars’ agents to ensure their clients nab decent real estate and size among a large ensemble cast. When you’re one of 14 people on the sheet, you want to be the most prominent. So, yes, Vin Diesel looms large and centre over all his compatriots, including those more famous than him. As the star and producer of the Fast movies, Diesel has considerable control over the lucrative franchise and that includes not just his position on the posters but also how he’s framed on screen. There’s the infamous shot in Fast Five where Diesel, in a confrontation with Dwayne Johnson, is eye-to-eye with the former wrestler, who is at least six inches taller than him. Diesel, and his onscreen alter ego Dom Toretto, has to be the premier hero of the story. And yet, Dom is always the least interesting character in any given Fast movie. He has two facial expressions – glowering and slightly less glowering – and monosyllabic dialogue so generic it’s as if it was written by AI during a writers’ strike.  For the record, there was no writers’ strike during the production of Fast X, the level of cheesy mediocrity in Diesel’s lines must be intentional. There is no other explanation for why it would be so awful. When Dom intones, “How does someone born so rich choose the poorest path in life,” the only reaction is mocking snorts. And surely that wasn’t the goal? Diesel may be the off-screen driving force behind the Fast movies, but onscreen, anytime Dom attempts to emote, the momentum stops dead in its tracks. After 22 years and 10 movies, it’s expected. It’s just as well the franchise has so much else going for it that diehard fans have been willing to forgive all the endless expounding about family and family and family. And Dom’s exhausting hero complex – all in the name of family, of course.  Because at least the cars go vroom and boom. Cities blow up, things that shouldn’t fly do, and all the genuinely thrilling, eye-popping stunts have told gravity to rack off. Plus, everyone besides Dom is very watchable, even if there are more nepo baby characters here than you can count at a Kennedy reunion. Because, family. When a movie is as overstuffed as Fast X, there are bound to be elements that work. So here’s what does: Jason Momoa is a masterstroke in casting as the villain of the piece, as the deranged Dante, the heretofore unseen son of the Fast Five antagonist Hernan Reyes. Dante is out for revenge for his dad’s death at the hands of Dom and his crew, and he’s vowed to make him suffer. Momoa is deliciously fun, a ball of psychotic energy that is part Jack Nicholson’s Joker, part hulking Bond baddie and part Eurotrash tragic. The return of Charlize Theron as Cipher, John Cena as Jakob and Jason Statham as Shaw are excellent, as are the cast of supporting characters played by Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Sung Kang, Nathalie Emmanuel and Tyrese Gibson. It seems like everyone is in this movie. Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, Rita Moreno, Pete Davidson and Alan Ritchson have joined the franchise – the latter, unfortunately, is saddled with dialogue even worse than Diesel’s – while Helen Mirren, Scott Eastwood and Jordana Brewster have pop-ins.  And there are a couple of cameos you’ll want to stick through to the end for. It’ll make for the fact that Fast X doesn’t have an ending – it’s part one of what was to be a double act and is now apparently a trilogy. Considering the multitude of characters, director Louis Leterrier has deftly balanced all the competing subplots. The pace at which it jumps from one aspect of the story to another is well calibrated.  None feels underserved or overstayed – except, of course, for Dom’s slice of the narrative because it’s never not boring, unless Dante is there to bring some much needed pizzazz. Stay on Dom too long, and you’re begging them to switch back to Theron or Cena. That character is done, he has no more arc to play – he loves his family and has a martyr complex, that’s Dom’s limit. The Fast movies are always going to be burdened with that sentimental earnestness, and maybe it wouldn’t be a Fast film without Dom the energy vacuum. Some fans even like it, although this is baffling to the rest of us. While Fast X still delivers on propulsive stunts and fan service, and is actually pretty fun, as the 10th instalment and with the promise (or is that a threat?) of at least two more, it’s starting to run out of road.  Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2023"," The Gist: We open with a repurposed sequence from (plumbs the decrepit depths of my memory; double-checks Wikipedia) Fast Five – you know the one, where Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his FAM’LY stole a big-ass safe from a bank in Rio de Janeiro by shooting it with harpoons on cables and dragging it behind their automobiles. TEN YEARS AGO, a subtitle blares. The money in that safe belonged to the Reyes family, and the insane violence that occurred in the wake of the heist resulted in the death of the patriarch – and the guy’s son has been really P.O.’d for a decade. His name is Dante (Momoa), and he’s just now finally executing his revenge scheme, which is so convoluted and covers all the angles and bases and thinks ahead so many steps, it should’ve taken two decades to concoct.  But before we get to that, we catch up with Dom as he teaches his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), nickname Little B, how to drive. Well, not just to drive, but to leave smoldering rubber figure-eights on the pavement of a parking lot with Dom’s signature slate-gray Dodge Charger. The kid’s like, seven years old or something, but it’s never too early to learn how to tear ass. Tearing ass has saved Dom’s life dozens of times, as you’re all too aware. Then they gather for a barbeque with Dom’s wife Letty (Rodriguez) and Crew peeps Rej (Bridges) and Roman (Pearce) and Ramsey (Emmanuel) and Mia (Brewster) and Han (Kang), and also Dom’s grandma (Moreno), who arrives to deliver heavy-handed speeches about FAM’LY. Now we know where Dom gets it.  That night, there’s a knock at the door, and it’s Cipher (Theron). Yeah, she’s a bad guy, but she’s in rough shape and she manages to talk Dom out of finishing the job. She got the tar walloped out of her by Dante and his goons, and she’s here to enlist Dom’s help – the enemy of my enemy, and all that. Thus begins the most overwrought snaking winding tangled pretzeled contortion of a revenge plot ever put to celluloid, one that busts up Dom’s crew for the whole damn entire movie, so consider that a warning (they’re prolly saving the big reunion for 12 Fast 12 Furious 12, due somewheres around 2027). Roman and Ramsey and Han and Rej go to Rome for a gig only to learn it’s a trap, resulting in a maniacal chase sequence in which they barrel through the city in a Paw Patroller with Dante’s giant bomb in the back and Dom tears ass and Letty rips it up on her motorcycle and the bomb gets loose and rolls and rolls and rolls and rolls like it was on top of spaghetti before it explodes and nearly destroys the Vatican, and the whole escapade wraps with Helen Mirren saying to Dom, “It ain’t no Roman holiday, and you ain’t no Gregory Peck” as they look upon the smoldering wreckage of Rome, to which I can only respond, good Christ. This is all rather nuts, but par for the F/F course. It’s all downhill from here, I’m afraid. The plot eventually enlists Dom’s brother Jakob (Cena) to babysit Little B when he becomes Dante’s kidnapping target, and puts American gov’t agents Tess (Larson) and Aimes (Alan Ritchson) in the middle of the brouhaha, and rubber gets burnt from Yuma to Antarctica and many points in-between. There’s a great bit where Aimes sums up Dom’s crooks-turned-heroes crew by saying, “If it rejects the laws of god and gravity, they did it twice,” which is soon rendered a lie, because there’s a third and fourth and fifth time – at least – yet to come in this movie. And after that, it’ll cliffhang us and make us wait two years for some resolution. Performance Worth Watching: So, so many paychecks being cashed here. But I will say Theron stands out as someone who takes this shit very seriously without taking it very seriously at all, if that makes sense, and Cena’s upbeat-goofball tone is disarming and funny. Between them, they draw a few effortless laughs in a movie that otherwise tongue-in-cheeks itself to death. Memorable Dialogue: Cipher drops this doozy while still bleeding from Dante’s assault: “Fought the devil tonight. Honestly, I always thought it was me – kinda disappointing.” Our Take: All the Fast X hype’s been about Momoa’s nutty, out-there performance as the flamboyant villain, but remember, context is everything; in comparison to the other performances here, it’s definitely… different. Colorful. Campy in the opposite direction of Diesel, a true foil for Dom’s poker-faced man of few grunts, words and/or grunted words. Yet by any reasonable criteria outside the Fast and Furious bubble, Momoa’s grandstanding is annoying tryhardism that begs comparison to Johnny Depp’s more grating roles. It’s memorable for all the wrong reasons. Maybe some will find it amusing, but it’s just more sand in the jockey shorts of haters (he said, looking for the nearest bidet). I understand why Leterrier and Momoa make the decisions they do, because it’s clear after nine noisy OTT action-smash outings, this series needs a shot in the arm. It peaked creatively a few movies ago and has since devolved into repetitive spectacle and something I like to call rampant franchiseism, where you need to know all the ins and outs of the previous films to comprehend the new one. If you’re not up to snuff, you either have to put in the work ahead of time or sit back and watch a nonsensical blur of faces and color and explosions. It ceases to be dumbass entertainment and becomes more stultifying than your 11th-grade teacher’s monotone lecture on The Agony and the Ecstasy.  Structurally, Fast X consists of a handful of subplots that Leterrier tosses into the playground like marbles. They roll around here, and there: There’s the one where Dom ends up in a street race against Dante in Rio (a return to the series’ dopey-ass roots), the one where Letty wakes up in a secret prison next to Cipher, the one where Jakob and Little B ram around in a flying kayak, the one where Rej and Roman and Han and Ramsey fart around and end up reacquainting with an old frenemy, the one with Brie Larson and the other agent guy, the one with Mia that abruptly stops. Sometimes, the subplots turn up familiar faces from past movies, and eventually, a couple of them intertwine but never reach anything resembling a satisfying conclusion. Taking into account that Fast X isn’t a complete movie, but rather one-third of a larger whole yet to be finished, lack of resolution is a given, but getting to the to-be-continued dots-of-ellipsis ending should be more enjoyable. There’s one shot here in which Rodriguez’s motorcyclist stunt-double pulls off a badass maneuver – probably with the help of CGI, the visual lifeblood of this movie – that inspired a big laugh and broke me out of a stupor, but for the other two hours and 20-and-three-quarters minutes of this movie, I was bored out of my skull.  Our Call: Out of gas. Spinning its tires. Stuck in the ditch. Slid too far off the road. Grinding its gears. Crashed and burning with one wheel spinning. Insert your automobile cliche here. SKIP IT.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 5, 2023"," The Fast & Furious franchise is a one long running series in cinema that has brought old and new fans racing to theatres. The latest instalment, Fast X, is a ridiculous but extremely entertaining joy ride that will keep fans happy. Fast X opens with a flashback to Fast Five’s heist when drug lord Hernan Reyes was killed, leaving behind his son Dante (Jason Momoa), who has been holding a grudge against Dom (Vin Diesel) for years. When Dante steals Cipher’s (Charlize Theron) tech and leaves her for dead, she goes to Dom’s door and warns him of who’s coming for him. In the meantime, the rest of the team is on a mission in Rome: Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang), which turns out to be a set-up. When his family members’ lives are on the line, Dom gets the crew together to fight against a dangerous Dante. The plot in Fast X isn’t the strongest compared to its predecessors, but one charming and worthy addition knocks it off the tracks. That is, of course, the villain: Jason Momoa steals the show. His comic timing is incredible as he plays to the flamboyant goofiness of his character. He crushes with his one-liners and crushes the “family” with his bonkers kill plan. He’s perhaps the most entertaining villain in the Fast family in recent years. After 10 films and a spinoff, fans who’ve been along for the ride will find this joyride a blast with scenes that feel like throwbacks to their favourite characters, locations, and car chases. There is an undeniable nostalgia that comes crashing as one sits on the edge of one’s seat and explore the Dom and fam adventure. It’s fun and entertaining with solid laughs (courtesy Momoa) along the way. The script might be a tad weak but the all-star list of actors, ridiculous stunt choreography, and fun cameos all add to the experience — the hoots, cheers and applause, that filled the theatre was proof that there is room and demand for more Dom family time.

"Jun 5, 2023"," It’s been more than 20 years since the first movie in the “Fast and the Furious” franchise of action films rolled off the line, and while it may seem at this point like the films are destined to keep going forever, the plan really is to wind them down sometime soon. “Fast X,” the tenth installment in the main series starring street racers turned international spies, is billed as the beginning of an epic story that will conclude the saga of the Toretto family and their many allies and enemies, setting up the conflict that will ultimately lead to the franchise hitting the brakes. That means, theoretically at least, that “Fast X” needs to do things that other installments in this series simply don’t. It needs to establish stakes for future movies and build a whole micro-universe of conflicts, setups, and payoffs, all while also working as a crowd-pleasing standalone action spectacle at the box office. It’s a lot for any film to tackle, as we’ve seen more than a few times with series that feel like they’re spinning wheels a little bit on their way to the end. There are certain obvious pitfalls to such a story, and while “Fast X” definitely still feels like a fun ride, it can’t help but get caught up in doing too much at once, which is really saying something for a film in this franchise. This time out, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew of friends and collaborators are facing the wrath of Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of a drug tycoon the team defeated five movies ago. Dante’s out for revenge in the most glorious fashion he can think of, and that means both luring Dom’s team out into the open and working to dismantle them any way he can. His mission, ultimately, is to do nothing less than Dom did to him: Take his family, and his legacy, away.  It’s more complicated than that, of course, and in true “Fast” fashion the film takes a number of detours for guest stars and big action movie beats that keep the film feeling jam-packed and lightning fast. But the main idea here is to make the Toretto crew feel knocked back on their heels, scattered across the globe while someone does his best to pick them apart. It’s not the first time someone’s tried this in the series, but it is the first time the filmmakers have really taken it this far, and that brings a certain exhilaration to even the clumsier moments in the film.  And there are, sadly, plenty of clumsy moments. Characters can cross the globe at a moment’s notice, then suddenly end up trapped in a single location. Action sequences spring up with expected regularity, directed with a solid eye by Louis Leterrier, then vanish as the film hopes to another location to give us another update on what a different character is up to. It’s all a bit of a whirlwind, and that would be fine if it was in service to a larger arc, particularly since Momoa is there to command the whole narrative and steal every scene. The problem is that “Fast X” loses its way somewhere, and forgets that it needs to satisfy as both as a single narrative and as part of a larger whole. One of the great joys of these movies is that just about anyone can jump into them at any time and basically grasp who’s who and what’s going on. They’re crowd-pleasers through and through because they never lose sight of the satisfaction of a single action movie narrative while also peppering in loads of continuity that fans can keep exploring. “Fast X” isn’t that. It’s a stepping stone movie, a film loaded down with so much table-setting that the main course never gets to the table.  That all makes the film a poorer experience than it perhaps could have been, as it leans too hard into promising bigger and wilder things in the installment that’s meant to come next. Still, there’s fun to be had here, and even if the franchise has to swerve a little along the way, it’s definitely not slowing down just yet. This content was contributed by a user of the site.

"Jun 5, 2023"," As the film opened to a replay of a sequence from ‘Fast Five’, I couldn’t help but think how much the ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise has changed since its introduction in 2001. What started as ‘Point Break’, with underground street racing, has turned into a superhero series; not only does the franchise now try to up the stunts with each entry, but it also adds another huge star to its already massive cast. Furthermore, it even rivals Marvel with the number of characters that return from the dead, the most recent being Han (Sung Kang – Obi Wan Kenobi, Fast & Furious 6) who returned in F9. And, whilst the franchise is ridiculous, it’s a lot of fun and the latest entry is no exception.  ‘Fast X’ continues the fast-paced lives of the ever-growing Family lead by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel – Bloodshot, Guardians of the Galaxy). But a new psychopathic villain threatens to tear Toretto’s life and family apart.  The franchise is also good at retconning its own narrative. The scene where a vault is dragged across the highway by Dominic Toretto and Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker – Fast & Furious 7, Hustlers) is shown to have been owned by a ruthless drug lord and his newly revealed son Dante (Jason Momoa – Aquaman, Dune) who serves as this entry’s villain. And, while other aspects of the film shine, Momoa is the best part of ‘Fast X’. With each entry, the focal villain either grows crazier or sillier and Dante is the former in the best way. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job at portraying a psychopath who wants revenge for what previously occurred, and he’s clearly having fun here. While he gleefully drives through the 2-hour 20-minute runtime like a child in a sweet shop, he’s also the first villain in the franchise to actually appear threatening. This is something that is welcomed in a franchise filled with resurrected characters, crazy and impossible stunts and cartoon-like villains. Plus, the threats that he gives to Dominic and his Family are shown more than told, further enthusing how much of a threat Dante can be. There are real stakes here compared to previous entries and it was a welcome aspect.  And Jason Momoa isn’t the only new addition to the franchise: Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) also makes an appearance as a new member of the Agency HQ, the organization that was previously led by Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell – Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Escape From L.A.). But, while her character has potential, the writing doesn’t give her a lot of screentime unfortunately. Brie Larson is a fantastic actress and her character arc of going behind Agency HQ’s back and helping the Family is interesting. But, with the multiple side plots throughout the film, Larson doesn’t get enough screentime to truly become an important, or meaningful, part of the story which is a shame. This issue also extends to Roman (Tyrese Gibson – Morbius, Fast & Furious 9) and Tej (Ludacris – 2 Fast 2 Furious). While these have been divisive, I always found them charming and a fitting comic relief. But, once again, these two characters barely have any screentime, making their scenes appear pointless. This is especially a shame considering both characters have been a Family member since ‘2 Fast 2 Furious’. The film tries to develop Roman’s character, this time as a leader, but it is ultimately forgotten about.  An aspect I did enjoy regarding the Family was Agency HQ’s newly appointed CEO and his opinion of them. Played by Alan Ritchson (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire), the new CEO Aimes takes over after Mr Nobody’s disappearance and immediately calls the Family out as terrorists and a danger to the general public. This was the best way to execute this plotline and essentially hold a mirror up to the main characters. While the franchise is filled with enjoyable car chase sequences and a ton of action scenes, the Family do also endanger lives with their dangerous driving, something that has received backlash for a long time now. So, this was a well-executed plot that ultimately served as Aimes’ story arc to an extent: to stop the Family from causing more destruction.  And, while I could talk about the acting, the fight and car chase sequences themselves, they are a staple within a franchise that has been speeding along for 12 years. Therefore, a certain quality is to be expected and that expectation certainly delivers. While there weren’t any notable stunts that were crazier than the ninth entry (where does it go after putting a car in space?!), the action scenes are extremely enjoyable. It is a shame to see Brie Larson, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris pushed to the side-line, but this is ultimately Jason Momoa’s opportunity to truly shine, and he easily steals the show. If you’ve stuck with the ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise for 12 years, then this is just as enjoyable as the previous entries.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Jun 5, 2023"," The Fast Saga continues with Fast X! Here we are at the tenth entry, eleventh if you count the spinoff, in the never-ending series about cars and driving them fast. If you’re coming into a Fast & Furious movie you pretty much know what you’re getting into. Dom and the family get involved in some kind of convoluted plot revolving around one enemy or a specific device and the cars go fast. Seems basic but that is how most of these movies tend to go. This time around they go toe to toe with the son of Hernan Reyes, the villain from Fast Five, Dante (Jason Momoa) as he is out to get revenge on Dom and the crew for the death of his father. This series has seen its ups and downs but there’s one thing that always seems to stay consistent, insanely over the top action sequences that defy any bits of reality. There is no shortage of that here as we get a car pulling down two helicopters at the same time as well as a car driving down an exploding dam. Louis Leterrier takes over as director here and he’s no rookie when it comes to directing action movies. While it all is ridiculous there’s never a dull moment throughout the movie and Leterrier makes the most of his time in the director’s chair.  It’s easy to dismiss these movies as just dumb and ridiculous but ever since they started embracing that mentality in the movies themselves is when this series has really started to find its groove. Sure, there’s entries that don’t work as well as others but if you know what you’re getting into you know at the very least that you’re going to be entertained to some degree. There is a lot to like here but it starts and ends with Jason Momoa. His performance as Dante is one of the most insane performances, I’ve ever seen but it works incredibly well. He is menacing and diabolic but at the same time he’s flamboyant deliciously cheesy. How Momoa is able to pull off this performance is beyond me, but it is definitely the biggest highlight. The rest of the cast here are essentially what they normally do in their roles. These characters are what they are at this point, and everyone is still playing them well. Vin Diesel does get some emotional moments to shine his dramatic skills off a bit more and that is a nice side of the character to see. Joining the cast for this go-around, outside of Momoa, are Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson, both of whom are welcome additions. While this is a highly entertaining movie and a step up from the previous two entries it is not without its flaws. The runtime does go on a bit too long. Pacing isn’t much of an issue but there are so many characters that the movie does struggle juggling them all around. Most of the action set pieces are done practically but there is quite a bit of CGI used here as well and there are moments where it doesn’t look too good. After the announcement that this movie will be the first part of a trilogy to end the franchise, it does feel like the overall arc of the story is going to get stretched too thin. There is an easy point to end this movie on but because it will be a trilogy the movie ends on a rather large cliffhanger that may anger some audiences. This feels like an Infinity War type set up for the next two movies and only time will tell how it plays out. Fast X does everything you want to see out of a Fast & Furious movie. The action sequences are top notch, the dynamic between the characters works well and we get a noteworthy performance from the likes of Jason Momoa. Despite its flaws there is plenty here to enjoy and get audiences excited for what’s to come for the end of the franchise. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Jun 3, 2023"," I am not, historically, a fan of the Fast/Furious movies, especially the last few since Paul Walker’s untimely death. They have become too serious and small, overly invested in Dominic Toretto’s boring life outside of racing cars. Vin Diesel is not a compelling leading man, especially without a more charismatic scene partner to balance him out, but, well, that’s where Fast X got me.  The tenth entry into the Fast/Furious franchise has all of the previous films’ problems: Dom is a boring protagonist; Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have no chemistry and I do not believe for one second that they even have sex; it’s too long (141 minutes); too loud; and while the action is great, Charlize Theron STILL hasn’t driven a car—but then Jason Momoa shows up. And I. Was. SOLD. Momoa stars as Dante Reyes, the latest villain spawned from the events of a previous Fast film. His backstory is basically the same as Jason Statham’s Shaw: Dom and the #family—they say “family” twenty-eight times in this movie—harmed HIS family, and now he’s out for revenge. In this case, Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) killed Dante’s dad, Hernan Reyes, in Fast Five. Now, Dante is seeking vengeance, determined not to kill Dom, but to make him suffer. And hoooo boy, is that FUN to watch. Dante is wildly charismatic and genuinely creepy in equal parts, and Momoa gives the most viscerally thrilling villain performance since Heath Ledger’s Joker.  Dante is written to be the Joker of this franchise, in one scene even coming close to Joker’s famous “Here…we…go” line, but Momoa infuses the character with a breeziness and a flirty edge that turns a knock-off concept into something that feels fresh and unexpected. Dante is obsessed with Dom, but he doesn’t bring dour murder vibes to it, Momoa plays that obsession like a tween girl screaming at a boy band concert. There is an unapologetic femininity in his performance—not just his scrunchies and nail polish but in his flowy, coy persona. That edge of androgyny in a figure that presents as classically masculine as Momoa is interesting and exciting on screen, a modern twist on a classic villain archetype.  It’s a more successful attempt than Silva, Javier Bardem’s queer-coded bad guy in Skyfall, mainly because Fast X doesn’t queer code Dante in the archetypical sense. His queer features are just part of his character, they’re not functional to his villainy, and thus those features don’t become part of his threat level. Typically, queer coded villains like Silva—or Jafar, Ursula, or any Disney villain, really—are sneaky and underhanded and thus, their queerness becomes entangled with these negative traits which conflates to suggest that queerness itself is negative. Queer coding is a harmful trope with a bad history in cinema, but there is a deftness in the way Dante is presented that neatly side-steps these narrative traps. While Dante is unquestionably evil, he’s not sneaky, or underhanded, and, crucially, all his villainy is contained within his bad deeds. He flirts with Dom and gets mani-pedis and wears makeup and ladies’ blouses, but none of these things are ever conflated with his actions. There is a clarity of presentation, a suggestion that somebody somewhere was aware of the queer coded villain trap and deliberately worked to sidestep it. And Momoa’s frankly joyful performance just gooses that along, with no sense of shyness or shame about embracing Dante’s flamboyance and playing up his gender-bending traits and style with enthusiasm. Yet Momoa is equally fierce in depicting Dante’s rage, which is what makes him so unpredictable. There’s no sense of warning when the switch flips, he goes from cheerful teasing to murderous rage in a split second, which makes watching him enormously fun. Every second Momoa is on screen is electric, you genuinely do not know what Dante is going to do next, and every twist and turn in his plot against Dom feels justified by both his backstory and his present-day nihilism. Dante believes in nothing, but instead of becoming morose in the face of the void, he embraces living in a way that makes him particularly volatile.  Of course, the downside of this is that every second Momoa isn’t on screen is some combination of overbearing and/or boring. There is only so much Sung Kang, Jason Statham, and Brie Larson, actors who understand the assignment and deliver plenty of style and cool vibes of their own, can do to offset Diesel’s heavy-handed, portentous posturing as Dom.  If it weren’t for Jason Momoa, Fast X would be as unbearable as the last few Fast films, but thank the gods for him, because he is the shot in the arm this franchise desperately needed.

"Jun 2, 2023"," The solid rating I’m giving this is not just for Momoa, though. There are some eye-popping action sequences here too that make this a great summer getaway. Is it smart? Are you kidding? This is the franchise that’s bent the rules of physics several times in its action scenes, and it doesn’t shy away from doing that again. Back again is Vin Diesel as Dom, with his crew – you know, the characters who make up his family – including the constantly bickering frenemies played by Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and Tyrese Gibson – which is mentioned over and over. Of course, not all the characters are considered to be family. Charlize Theron is back as Cipher, for example. But back to the villain who steals every scene he’s in. Momoa is Dante Reyes, who survived the slaying of his crime lord Dom from a prior flick.  Dante wants to avenge his father’s death. And he’s not out for merely blood. He wants his enemies to suffer. With his painted nails and eye-catching ensembles to add to his dramatic flair and seemingly infinite patience, Dante toys with his targets while he announces his intentions. Momoa’s performance is just magnificent. I’d put him up against any other actor I’ve seen so far this year. He has a broader range than I ever imagined, and I hope this role lands him a chance to play a major role in a serious movie. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Jun 1, 2023"," 
Fast X is a two-hour, 21-minute volley of action scenes and set pieces designed around hand-to-hand combat, souped-up cars and flying machines that hops between Los Angeles, Rome, Rio, Portugal and London. Director Louis Leterrier makes the most of his budget and playgrounds, launching a spherical bomb into Rome which hurtles through the streets. As cars and drivers try to avert the explosion, the bomb is like a ball bouncing off objects and riding along ramps in a pinball game. A gigantic vault is dragged through Rio in another crazy scene that is sure to be a fan favourite. Still, there’s nothing nearly as outlandish as launching a car and a couple of characters into space as they did in Fast 9.  The opening scene of Fast X reverses 10 years to present a patchwork backstory that yanks Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) out of domestic bliss with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and their son Little B (Leo Abelo Perry), setting him on a collision course with Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of drug lord Herman Reyes. Fiercely protective of his family, Dom’s past deeds, particularly a theft in Rio De Janeiro, are now catching up with him, making his family most vulnerable and rattled by the unpredictable and unhinged Dante, a maniac thirsting for vengeance. He’s camped up, amped up and blows things up with glee.  After 20-plus years (the first Fast & Furious film released in 2001) the recurring cast seems neither as fast nor as furious. Momoa, with his painted nails and cutesy hairstyles—imagine Johnny Depp’s Captain Sparrow styled by Zoolander—infuses this sequel with a burst of energy. Fast X is a set up for key characters from the last nine episodes to make a reentry and for some new stars to make unexpected debuts. John Cena as Dom’s brother Jakob Toretto, Charlize Theron as cyber terrorist Cipher, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw and some other old favourites make surprising appearances, along with the addition of new faces such as Brie Larson as Mr. Nobody’s daughter Tess. The surprise returns and new players keep the engines revving in anticipation of the eleventh film (due in 2025), slated to be the concluding part of the Fast franchise.",POSITIVE

"Jun 1, 2023"," *** Is Nicole Holofcener’s cup half-full or half-empty? Both, judging by You Hurt My Feelings, which she wrote and directed. This witty, perceptive film explores everyday dichotomies between truth and lies, encouragement and abuse, haves and have-nots. Beth (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who proves again she’s adept at serious comedy) and Don (Tobias Menzies) are a long-married couple so cozy with each other they don’t mind licking the same ice cream cone. But when Beth, a writer, overhears Don say he doesn’t like her newest manuscript (even though he’s repeatedly told her he loves it), she loses her trust in him and her own abilities. The film asks how much harm we cause by telling well-meant white lies; has Beth, for example, put too much pressure on their pot-selling son by cheerfully insisting he’s destined to do great things? As the daughter of a man who called her “stupid” and “shit for brains,” though, she’s still lacerated by the memory of her late father’s slurs. All the characters in the film get tangled in webs of self-doubt, while also recognizing their privilege in a melting world, as Beth’s sister, Sarah (played by a splendid Michaela Watkins), says. Still, private dramas matter, and when Beth cries over her husband’s betrayal, the psychic pain on her face is as real as any physical wound. R. LINDA FERGUSON.

The film embarks on a four-decade journey with Pietro (Lupo Barbiero), whom we first met as an 11-year-old city kid in 1984. His family has rented a house in a small mountain village for the summer. There, he’s introduced to the only other child in town, Bruno (Cristiano Sassella), who lives and works with his aunt and uncle. Each summer, Pietro returns, cultivating their friendship until they’re separated by diverging paths not of their choosing. Then, the boys reunite several years later, with unspoken envy frustrating any efforts to recapture that idyllic childhood connection. As the film progresses, the captivating imagery washes away, revealing a gruff reality resulting from the characters’ inability to communicate and the hidden traumas caused by their fathers. The oscillating nature of their friendship gets tedious over the two-and-a-half-hour runtime, but the film movingly explores family and identity, asking, “Can we truly ever go home again?” NR. RAY GILL JR. Cinema 21. *** In this 10th Fast & Furious film, Vin Diesel neutralizes a bomb with a construction crane, John Cena disguises a spy plane as a canoe, and Jason Momoa paints the toenails of a corpse. Yet the real insanity was happening behind the camera. A week into filming, longtime Fast director Justin Lin quit the film, reportedly declaring, “This movie is not worth my mental health.” It was Lin who solidified the series’ signature blend of working-class vengeance (destroying a bank with a vault!), absurdist action (Ludacris and Tyrese in space!) and impassioned melodrama (family!). His journeyman replacement, Louis Leterrier (The Transporter), was never going to match Lin’s idiosyncratic flair, but he has made an appealingly sincere spectacle. This time, Dom Toretto (Diesel) and his family of street racers/de facto special forces agents are pursued by Dante (Momoa), a preening psychopath who vows vengeance on Dom for reasons too convoluted to explain here. Automotive insanity ensues, much of it rote; it’s touches of tenderness that make the movie—from a vignette about a grieving hotshot driver (Daniela Melchior) to a mid-car-chase testament of love from Cena’s Jakob to his brother Dom (“thank you for showing me the light”). There will never again be a Fast & Furious flick as gonzo and glorious as Tokyo Drift or Fast Five (even devout fans can sense the wind is no longer at the franchise’s back), but the series’ movingly messy humanity is intact. Which is another way of saying that Leterrier is at the wheel of a car that Lin built. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

The early ‘90s was when Disney perfected its formula for animated blockbusters, and works like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King remain indelible touchstones for a generation of filmgoers. 1989′s The Little Mermaid is no exception, and while its modern update holds up better than most, it still struggles to find its own identity. The story remains a bowdlerized version of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale—a mermaid princess (Halle Bailey) goes against the demands of her overprotective father (Javier Bardem) and makes a Faustian bargain with a sea witch (Melissa McCarthy) to become human and win the heart of a handsome prince (Jonah Hauer-King)—with most of the film’s resources going to rendering the most vibrant and lush undersea world since Avatar: The Way of Water. Bailey’s performance is a stunning, starmaking endeavor, revealing her as a vividly talented name in the making (and her chemistry with Hauer-King helps sell the story). Plus, the filmmakers faithfully re-create iconic moments from the original in beautiful CGI, but it all can’t help but come off as a facsimile of a modern classic rather than anything experimental, challenging or bold.

What drives such discipline? When we see the swastika tattoos covering Narvel’s back, we begin to understand. Once a white supremacist, Narvel turned on his fellow neo-Nazis. Now sequestered in a witness protection program, he quietly and diligently tends to Gracewood Gardens, the verdant estate of the imperious Norma Haverhill (Sigourney Weaver). Racially insensitive, sexually ravenous, and baffled by the internet, Norma is a crude caricature of a wealthy old white woman—just as her drug-addicted grandniece Maya (Quintessa Swindell) is a crude caricature of a disenfranchised Black millennial. Director Paul Schrader’s illustrious career (from writing Taxi Driver to directing First Reformed) clearly hasn’t taught him much about women, but the deeper he digs into Narvel’s broken soul, the more persuasive Master Gardener becomes. “I was raised to hate people who were different than me,” Narvel says. Determined to nurture life instead of destroying it, he embraces gardening as both a path to joy and an act of penance. Can it lead to redemption? A radiant, hallucinatory image of Narvel surrounded by pink blossoms gleaming in the night offers hope. Master Gardener may not fully earn its tender conclusion, but its faith in the power of both plant and human life to radically transform is profoundly moving. At 76, Schrader has learned what many of his filmmaking peers never have: that dreaming up a happy ending, not unlike gardening, is hard and worthy work. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

The film reteams director Jalmari Helander and actor Jorma Tommila, who previously worked together on the Christmas horror film Rare Exports (2010). Tommila plays Aatami, a man of few words and many scars, who discovers a gold deposit during the Lapland War in 1944. He then comes in contact with a platoon of Nazis, led by the ruthless Bruno Helldorf (Aksel Hennie), who defies orders and sets his sights on Aatami’s gold, even after learning that Aatami is a former Finnish soldier nicknamed “The Immortal.” Most of Sisu finds Aatami killing off the Nazis in a variety of brutal ways as he protects his riches. He manages to outmaneuver the soldiers at nearly every turn; he even sets himself on fire at one point in order to stop a dog from attacking him. The last 20 minutes of Helander’s film gets a bit too ridiculous as Aatami reaches an almost superhero level. For much of its runtime, though, Sisu remains just believable enough to go along with as Helander keeps the creative and bloody action sequences coming. R. DANIEL RESTER.

It features fire and charm in its dialogue and performances, with Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson an electric pair to watch. Director Calmatic’s remake, on the other hand, is a pale imitation of Shelton’s movie. Rapper Jack Harlow plays Jeremy, a basketball hustler who teams with Kamal (Sinqua Walls); the latter blew a chance at a professional career 10 years earlier, and the two enter basketball competitions in Los Angeles together, even as they confront crises on the home front. The basic framework of the original film still remains, but the screenplay is more conventional and many of its jokes fall flat. Walls turns in a solid performance, but Harlow is more hit and miss in his debut acting role, while the majority of the supporting cast plays characters who are cartoonish (though the late Lance Reddick is strong in a small role as Kamal’s father). And though some of the game scenes are impressive (Tommy Maddox-Upshaw’s cinematography gives the imagery a sun-kissed look), you’d be better off watching Shelton’s film instead if you’ve somehow missed it.

"May 31, 2023"," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Universal’s Fast & Furious movies began as high-stakes action thrillers about people doing spectacularly batshit things with sexy cars, but the franchise’s transition into telling big, bombastic, family-focused parables is what’s really given it staying power over the years. In Fast X — the 11th overall film in this series — you can see director Louis Leterrier trying to tap into as many of the themes that define this nos-filled world as humanly possible, and it’s an admirable effort. But while Fast X’s heart is in the right place, that heart’s also enlarged in the “stressed beyond capacity” sense.  You don’t necessarily need to have seen any of the previous films to dive into Fast X, but this latest chapter of Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) life makes a lot more sense the more familiar you are with Justin Lin’s Fast Five. Though it’s been years since Dom, his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and his best friend Brian (Paul Walker) robbed Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), Fast X tells the story of how Reyes’ cartoonishly unhinged son Dante (Jason Momoa) emerges from the shadows to avenge his father’s death by trying to destroy what Dom loves most. If you’re reading this, then you should know what that thing is. On the off chance that you don’t, though, Fast X makes a point of telling you while dropping the f-word so frequently that it almost feels like the movie’s script was penned with drinking games in mind. One does not simply attack Dom Toretto’s chosen family of highly skilled street racers turned professional criminals head-on because, at this late stage in their careers, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) are all too familiar with how many villains out there want them dead. But with Dom and Letty now trying to settle down in order to give Dom’s son Brian “Little B” Marcos (Leo Abelo Perry) a semi-normal life, the Family’s moving a little differently these days, and one of the bigger ideas running throughout Fast X is what it really means for people who live fast to try to slow down and breathe a little bit. That idea could have been somewhat interesting. Fast X quickly lets it fall to the wayside as it sets to bring back virtually every character you know from these films in a series of convoluted twists and turns that have a way of making the movie play like an exciting but airless telenovela that only works if you’re deeply invested in this world. As terrifying and larger than life a presence as Cipher (Charlize Theron) was in The Fate of the Furious and F9, the way she just shows up on Dom’s doorstep is almost as unintentionally comical as the way Momoa can’t quite work his mouth around a consistent Brazilian accent. In bringing characters like Cipher, Queenie (Helen Mirren), and Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) back into the picture, Fast X means to illustrate how effective Dom’s been at working through his beefs with former enemies and growing his family in the process.  Because there have been so many of these movies to call back to, though, Fast X’s supporting characters often feel more like souped-up cameos meant to remind you of the past rather than figures organically existing in the present — especially when they just pop up out of nowhere, which happens more often than you’d expect. Unfortunately, this also holds true for many of Fast X’s newcomers, like Agency nepo baby Tess (Brie Larson) and the shadowy organization’s new leader Aimes (Alan Ritchson) — both of whom spend a surprising amount of time standing in screen-filled voids like something out of Evangelion. As you watch Dom and Dante’s drama unfold across the globe in a series of stunts meant to frame the Family as the ultimate terrorists in the public eye, you can see Fast X returning to the classic Fast formula that sets mortal enemies up to become friends down the line. But Universal also clearly greenlit Fast X with the intention of it being something akin to Avengers: Infinity War — the beginning of the end of a major chunk of this franchise — which has a curious way of making this movie’s attempts at establishing fresh dynamics  between people feel half-hearted. On some level, Fast X means for you to take seriously the grudge that Dante — a Joker-esque sociopath who Momoa plays with an effete quality that smacks of gay panic more than insanity — holds for Dom. But between Fast X not exactly doing the best job of differentiating Dante from your typical Fast villain and Diesel really embodying a Dom who feels like he’s been through the wringer a few times, their conflict ends up feeling like something that was mapped out on paper but not crafted tightly enough to sing on-screen. Thankfully, many of Fast X’s vehicular stunts are inspired — divorced from our reality’s physics as they might be — and the movie’s very good about having a sense of humor regarding how patently ridiculous the Fast world tends to be when directors cut loose. For every exhaustingly ham-fisted sentimentality play Fast X goes for by reminding you how much Dom loves — loves — his family and Jesus, the movie also knows that what Fast fans love is seeing these character whip cars around like they’re extensions of their bodies. More often than not, Fast X feels like it’s in too much of a rush to be the kind of full-bodied joyride that it could be, which is disappointing but perhaps somewhat intentional on Universal’s part. As big two-parter movies go, Fast X ends on a series of cliffhanger-ish beats that aren’t exactly the most thrilling. What they are, however, are reminders that there’s yet another one of these movies coming out in the very near future, and it’s then that diehard fans of Fast & Furious are probably going to get the epic payoff they’ve been waiting for.",NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2023"," He also has a flamboyant swagger little seen in this world of impervious biceps. With a scrunchie in his flowy mane, satiny purple shirt, and purple slacks that match his Chevy Impala, Momoa sashays up to gearhead Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) and cocks out a hip. “I’m Dante. Enchanté,” he says.  As usual, grounding the zaniness is the cast’s cheerful camaraderie, this time on display at a backyard barbecue in the opening moments. Dom and his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), are happily raising Brian, a.k.a. Little B (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish), the child Dom had with a government agent a few films ago while Letty was thought dead. Dom’s sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster, Simulant), is still married with kids to ex-cop Brian (the late Paul Walker, alive offscreen). Between the banter, the crew sets one more place at the table for the Torettos’ grandma, played by living legend Rita Moreno.  At first, Dom is glad to stay home while Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) jet off to Rome to steal some tech for the Agency, a government entity that previously enlisted their help. Privately, Dom confides to Letty that he worries about protecting everyone they love.  That fear materializes on the couple’s doorstep in the form of Cipher (Theron), a cyber-terrorist who toyed with them in the past. She’s wounded from Dante ambushing her to find Dom and company. And that trip to Rome? It’s a trap he’s set.  Letty and Dom hightail it overseas, where a set piece with a giant rolling bomb bound for the Vatican gets the tight-knit crew on the world’s most-wanted list—all part of Dante’s plan to make them suffer. A flashback to Fast Five, along with new footage inserting Momoa into the action, reveals that losing his dad and having a brush with death knocked free whatever loose screws he had.  The globe-trotting script from Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, who directed 2021’s F9: The Fast Saga, bounces along so swiftly that viewers have no time to wonder how Dante pulls various threads together. Or why cars explode in some moments and not in others.  Director Louis Leterrier (The Takedown) uses plenty of wide shots and drone shots to orient viewers, then drops them close to the action. He also adds some amusing closeups of Dom’s beloved Dodge Charger, silver crucifix, and hands shifting gears.  Leterrier unfortunately also incorporates the usual booty cam for the background babes during a drag race. The Fast films have always had a weird dichotomy around women, giving those in the extended family much to do while reducing the extras to body parts. In a Los Angeles Times in a story. Rodriguez and Brewster  said how they’ve fought to give the series’ women more of the action. Here, Letty rides a motorcycle and pulls no punches in a fight with Cipher, Mia wields a mean kick and a frying pan, and Ramsey mediates Tej and Roman’s squabbles while trying to crack computer codes. While all that’s fun to see, the twerking closeups are evidence of lingering sexism that’s squirmy and unnecessary.

"May 29, 2023"," “Fast X,” rated PG-13, is the tenth movie of the series. The fast cars and crazy stunts are all back, along with a new villain, Jason Momoa! Vin Diesel, and Michelle Rodriguez, star. With flashbacks to a robbery heist and murder of a former villain, his son (Jason Momoa) is out for revenge. Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me), he’s new to the franchise and written by Dan Mazeau. Fast X is an outrageous cat-and-mouse game with Dom and his team—Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Sung Kang. Typical scenes are Dom’s gang chasing after Dante or Dom’s gang being attacked by Dante. Dom’s 8-year-old son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), is Dante’s prize as he wants Dom to suffer for killing his family. “Fast X” also has the return of Jason Statham as Shaw, Helen Mirren as Shaw’s scheming mother, John Cena as Dom’s brother, and Charlize Theron as Cypher, who is now working with Dom & Co. against the much tougher lousy guy. You’ll see her and Liddy duking it out in far too many scenes. The buzz from the girls in the show—they want to drive more and show their skills; the fights are repetitive and dull. Yes, let the girls show their driving skills in “Fast Eleven!” The bottom line is I’ve seen all ten films, and you know exactly what you’ll get with these movies—they are family-centered, outrageous cars, eye-popping visual stunts, and wild rides. If you go in with that expectation, you should be entertained, I certainly was, and I love the new sassy villain, Dante; Jason Momoa has found a new calling.",POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023"," As a longtime fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, it pains me to say this: The series should have ended with the seventh movie. The eighth installment, The Fate of the Furious (2017), appeared to have only the most superficial grasp of the series’ characters, but I had high hopes when director and writer Justin Lin returned to course correct with F9: The Fast Saga (2021). Unfortunately, those hopes dwindled with the news that Lin stepped down from the project just days into shooting Fast X. But going into this movie with low expectations still didn’t prepare me for the messy slogfest that doesn’t seem to know what to do with its large, talented ensemble or the camaraderie the series has built over the past two decades. Dom’s (Vin Diesel) usage of the word “family” has been a long-running joke for the Fast series, and although the word is apparently uttered 56 times in Fast X, I still can’t tell you what the film was actually trying to say. Fast X is bloated with empty platitudes and plotlines that lead nowhere, except to ostensibly make excuses for pointless cameos, such as one with Pete Davidson. In another, the aptly named Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) from Furious 7 (2015) appears for about five minutes, has no impact, and then disappears without a trace. On that note, Fast X seems determined to bring every single character from the series back along with its new talents, including Brie Larson and Jason Momoa. One of the Fast series’ strengths has been the joy of getting to know its eclectic crew, but in Fast X this core team has to jockey for screen time. They’re mostly shunted to the side so that Dom gets to shine even more than usual. This is a pity for several reasons, primarily because time slows to a glutinous pace when Dom takes over the screen. And yet, he’s the savior of the story: No one can do anything without him, and everyone worships him. These flaws would be somewhat forgivable if the action was entertaining. But you become numb to the explosions within the first thirty minutes. The driving scenes consist of dull cuts between drivers stiffly wrestling with the gearshift or the wheel. The triteness is surprising from director Louis Leterrier, who has previously directed action flicks like The Transporter (2002). It doesn’t bother me that everyone somehow can throw fists like a UFC contender; it bothers me that the ceaseless fighting gets boring. Ultimately, Fast X limps along, relying on the strength of its previous films. In one supposedly emotional scene, the soundtrack plays a piano version of the song from the end of Furious 7, which marked Brian’s (Paul Walker) departure from the series. The Fast X scene has nothing to do with Brian at all, but my tear ducts welled at the memory even though what was on screen was devoid of genuine feeling. I find it telling, too, that the opening sequence—which rehashes the infamous vault heist from Fast Five (2011)—was probably the most thrilling part of the film. Fast X wants to run its victory lap, acknowledging what has made it great, but it fails to create something worthwhile of its own. Early on in Fast X, Cypher (Charlize Theron) finally gets a fight sequence of her own, and I uttered “thank god” out loud in the theater. Previous outings for the villainous hacker have consisted of her stalking around a glass cage with flawless eyeliner or simpering her lines. It’s such a relief to see her actually doing something. Unfortunately, I can’t say much for the rest of the women in Fast X.  First, we have Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was previously Dom’s equal, whether in driving or in leading the others. Yet we barely see her in the movie. Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) fare even worse: Mia graces the screen for a few minutes and Ramsey is relegated to her F8 role of sharing the hacking spotlight with Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges). Even worse is Fast X’s insistence on making Dom the savior, as mentioned before. This leads to a dramatic moment of him carrying Tess (Brie Larson) who’s been shot in the shoulder. She tearfully looks up at him and thanks him. She’s not the only damsel in distress saved by Dom: There’s also Isabel (Daniela Melchior), who needs his help to survive a bomb planted underneath her car. On the one hand, Dom appears to magnanimously save everyone, man or woman. On the other hand, the shot of Dom raising Tess into his arms—complete with the upwards hero camera angle and the sun shining behind him—is so overdone, it made my theater audience erupt in laughter.  Fast X tries to showcase their tough women by allowing them to throw a fist here and there, but it never allows them to save themselves. Even when Letty teams up with Cypher to leave their prison, Dom has to send Tess in there first to instigate the escape. And while Mia picking up the frying pan during her fight scene is a nice callback to her F9 duel, she’s quickly rescued by Jakob (John Cena). Finally, it’s worth saying that F9 made a baby step as the first in the series to refrain from the demeaning butts and boobs montages that characterize the series’ street races. Well, the boobs and butts are back—a small indication of how Fast X views its inclusion of women as boxes to check rather than people with meaningful things to contribute.  Mediaversity’s previous review of F8 gives a breakdown of the main cast, which mostly holds. Fast X also has Korean American Sung Kang and Jason Momoa, who is of mixed Pacific Islander descent. It also brings in Puerto Rican icon Rita Moreno for what amounts to a cameo as Dom’s abuela. The Fast series remains one of the most racially diverse franchises in Hollywood, but that diversity parades itself more in numbers than in action in Fast X. Part of this is, again, due to the vast amount of screentime that Dom is given compared to the others. But not only do the other characters appear much less, they’re also pale caricatures of their former selves, given shallow development if any. In particular, my burning question going into this movie was “Would there be #JusticeForHan (as outlined in my F9 review)?” And the answer is sadly, no. The stinger at the end of F9 hinted there’d be restitution for Deckard Shaw’s (Jason Statham) attempted murder of Han. Instead, Fast X decides that the best way to make amends is to have Shaw save Han’s life. Shaw then retorts that they’re even now, while Han looks at him with surprise and gratitude. Other than that, Han’s criminally underused. He flips his glorious hair once again in Fast X, but like everyone else who isn’t Dom, he’s not given much to do. Momoa plays the newest villain, Dante, retconned as the son of Fast Five’s drug lord, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). He’s at first a lively and welcome departure from the series’ previous forgettable villains, until he slips into offensive stereotypes that align his villainous tendencies with mental illness. In one scene, he appears to be making a refreshing statement about toxic masculinity while painting the toenails of other men, until the camera pulls back and we see that the men are dead and he’s taped their eyelids open to appear alive. The gruesomeness is played for laughs, obliquely making a joke of Dante’s mental instability. It also goes far beyond the usual, fairly sanitized violence we’ve seen in the series. Fast X leans into the harmful trope of blaming Dante’s mental health problems for his erratic and dangerous behavior, using it as a lazy catch-all to explain any behavioral inconsistencies. I’ve fallen in love with the Fast family over the past years, but Fast X seems more concerned with padding its cash cow than taking care of its crew. The film’s tagline claims “The End of the Road Begins,” but Universal Pictures might extend the finale into an excessive three movies. After such a joyless venture, you can count me out of the final ride.",NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2023"," A typically underwhelming entry within an underwhelming series, Fast X follows Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto as he and his crew are attacked by a larger-than-life villain (Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes) bent on revenge and vengeance. Filmmaker Louis Leterrier, working from Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin’s screenplay, admittedly does an effective job of initially luring the viewer into the progressively uninvolving proceedings, as Fast X kicks off with a promising opening stretch that does, in addition to effectively establishing Momoa’s character, boast an incongruously low-key feel that proves fairly difficult to resist – although, perhaps predictably, it’s not long before the picture segues into the first of many bland, gravity-defying action sequences. (There is, ultimately, not a single set-piece that manages to elicit the thrills or excitement one might’ve anticipated, as Leterrier overuses computer-generated special effects to such a degree that the movie often resembles a video-game cut-scene more than anything else.) And while there’s some novelty in the cavalcade of familiar faces within the expansive cast, which includes, among others, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Helen Mirren, and Rita Moreno, Fast X progresses into a sluggishly-paced midsection that is, as a result of its plethora of plot threads, entirely unable to make the propulsive impact Leterrier is surely going for. (And it doesn’t help that Momoa’s wildly over-the-top and flamboyant performance eventually becomes rather grating.) By the time the expectedly excessive climax rolls around, Fast X has confirmed its place as yet another disappointing misfire within a perpetually lackluster franchise that could (and should) have been seriously streamlined.

"May 27, 2023"," We’re back with 10 movie movies that you can watch right now, whether it’s a trip to the theaters or a nice night in at home. This week, we’ll take a look at the latest installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise and The Little Mermaid (well, the original one, anyway). We’ll also look at some classic films that come from Italy and a couple of 2023 films that came out in the spring that you might’ve missed. It’s fair to wonder how much tread is left on this franchise’s tires, but Fast X is just relentlessly entertaining enough to keep things afloat before the grand finale. If anything, Jason Momoa’s surprisingly unhinged villain keeps everything on its toes and keeps the film from veering too far into its longstanding franchise vices. It’s a tremendous performance for a series that’s not always known for its villainy. While you technically could go see the 2023 Little Mermaid remake in theaters right now, you could also just fire up Disney+ and watch the original. It’s hard to imagine the new film capturing this momentum, as it would be for any live-action remake trying to recreate what the Disney renaissance did so well. This is far, far less explosive than it is studious. It more seeks to build empathy for the young women who seek community in college than it does unearth something freshly scandalous about the University of Alabama’s much-discussed Machine. The documentary falters when it tries too hard to discuss its production within the personal studies of the young women who are either planning to rush or have already gone through the process. It’s not worth any sort of controversy since any discussion of the Machine is just sharing much of what is already out there. If anything, this documentary walks a fine line between trying to critique the social club system and justify its existence in the grander scheme of college socialization. It does both just well enough to work, but it’s much more effective as the latter than the former. This is one of the best studies of post-World War II Italy that you will find, as it’s just a sweeping portrait of unrelenting humanity on the brink of ruin. Masterful filmmaker Vittorio De Sica is one of Italian neorealism’s pioneers, and this is as close to a masterpiece as any film on this week’s list. It’ll break your heart into a million pieces all while lifting your spirit into the heavens.  Your favorite surrealistic movie owes much to 8 1/2, a formally daring study into the creation of art and how our worlds shape what we create. If we want to fix Hollywood, make 100 more movies like The Talented Mr. Ripley and just make that the extent of what people can choose from. It’s maybe too slim and uninspired for its own good, but it’s quick enough to where you aren’t all that bothered by the time spent with it. Adam Driver fighting with a T-Rex is a fun optic. Every year, there are one or two movies that I just do not get the adoration for, and I’m sorry to say this is one of ‘em. I like everything they’re trying to do, but I don’t think it really hits any of the beats it wants to master with the self-aware fantasy comedy Princess Bride stuff. It’s not very funny and the whole meandering plot just felt kind of boring. I’m all for devious charms from Hugh Grant and Chris Pine doing his shtick; don’t mistake me. The cameo in this is fun. It’s just such a niche exercise in inside jokes and corny humor. Some of the action sequences have a bit of zest to the way they’re staged, but without much of a story or cast of characters to rest on, what do you do with them? The opening scene is the funniest part. That’s not good for momentum’s sake! It’s the kind of no frills bio-doc that refuses to tell you anything but the truth, and it does so in such an organic way that doesn’t try to veer too far away stylistically from the subject’s body of work.",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2023"," Needless to say, over many missions and against near impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe put in their path. Now, Toretto and friends must confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced. Fueled by revenge, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom’s world and destroy everything and everyone  he loves. One thing I can say is this franchise never disappoints on the heart stopping stunts, fight sequences and star power.  This time the new faces, in addition to the core four, are Rita Moreno as Abuelita and Jason Momoa as Dante.  Trust me when I tell you that these two are hands down the only reason you will want to check out this new chapter. Momoa, as a conductor wielding villain dressed like The Joker, is mesmerizing with every scene he inhabits. He was a much welcomed shot in the arm for the franchise.  Rita Moreno bring heart and soul, as only she can, with a warm. loving scene alongside Diesel.  Although the franchise has been highly praised for its diverse cast, it has become more than annoying to see that after ten films Ludcaris and Tyrese have provided nothing more than a buddy comedy punchline to each film and the women characters have mostly been reduced to babysitters for their male counterparts.  It would be nice to see the women get their own chapters and the Black men be treated with more substance and less comic relief just once before the upcoming final two films. After the last chapter left us with Black men in space, I figured there was no where to go but up. Having said all of that, most of this film was absolutely ridiculous. However,  as a colleague pointed out  on a social media platform, it is this quality fans know and love.  And, while that may very well be true, can we trim it down a bit and not have a film full of cameos and short on substance moving forward?  Not hating…just saying.",POSITIVE
"May 25, 2023"," Vivimos en una época donde todas las experiencias narrativas que consumimos (cine, series, novelas, videojuegos, etc) deben ser potenciales franquicias y exprimirse hasta más no poder—en forma de secuelas, precuelas o spin off. Los estudios apuestan por la cantidad menospreciando la calidad. La taquilla, que no para de facturar, pone en marcha un mecanismo perverso que nos hace creer que tendremos episodios ilimitados de lo que sea y que cada entrega será mejor que la anterior. Una consigna que ha traído como consecuencia la degeneración de buenas historias en fabricas de churros que, al alejarse de su fuente original, se desdibujan por completo (como el penoso caso de Saw). Contrario a lo que podría pensarse, son pocas las sagas que han sobrevivido al fenómeno de la elefantiasis narrativa… Para ser precisos, solo dos: Mission Impossible y  Fast & Furious. El triunfo de la primera salta a la vista: está basada en una serie icónica, tiene como protagonista a Tom Cruise y sus diferentes episodios han sido dirigidos por cineastas laureados como Brian de Palma, Brad Bird, J.J. Abrams, entre otros. La segunda, por otro lado, es una rara avis que, como sus autos, desafía todo tipo de leyes de causa-efecto. La primera entrega The Fast and the Furious apareció en 2001 de la mano del director Rob Cohen (DragonHeart, Daylight). Su guion, inspirado en un artículo de carreras ilegales, tomaba ideas de otras películas de acción como Point Break y Gone in 60 Seconds. Sus protagonistas era unos jóvenes —y casi desconocidos— Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodríguez y Jordana Brewster. Su presupuesto era módico (38 millones de dólares) y nada apuntaba a que pudiese ser algo más que una simple película dominguera que, en el mejor de los casos, recuperaría la inversión y listo. Nadie pudo imaginarse que esta sería la semilla para un fenómeno que se transformaría en una de las franquicias más rentables y famosas de la historia del cine contemporáneo (amasando más de 7 billones de dólares… y contando). ¿Cuál es el secreto de su éxito? Mucho podríamos especular, pero viéndola en retrospectiva, la respuesta emerge sin mucho esfuerzo: ser consecuente con su línea narrativa y de producción. Desde sus comienzos Fast & Furious ha apostado por rostros “nuevos” que, después de pasar por ella, se cotizan mucho mejor (como el caso de Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodríguez o Gal Gadot). En casi dos décadas al volante, jamás ha caído en la trampa de ceder ante la corrección política o montarse en los trends de Hollywood. Antes de que la inclusión fuese tendencia, cada entrega ha tenido un cast donde existe todo tipo de representación de géneros, raza y nacionalidades —y de forma orgánica. Mientras que las mujeres luchaban contra la cosificación que sufrían en muchos papeles que les ofrecían en el cine, la saga tenía años con personajes femeninos empoderados y protagonizando las mejores peleas de la franquicia (como la épica entre Ronda Rousey y Michelle Rodríguez). Cuando los efectos especiales por ordenador (CGI) comenzaron a proliferar en cada producción hasta transformarse en una suerte de muleta, Fast & Furious siguió haciendo la mayoría de sus secuencias de acción in situ, apostando por trabajar con  stunts y artesanos del oficio que, en la modernidad, parecen estar en vías de extinción. A pesar de contar con famosos entre sus filas (desde ganadoras del Oscar como Rita Moreno, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson; pasando por leyendas como Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, John Cena, Dwayne Johnson y Jason Statham; hasta cantantes como Tego Calderon, Don Omar y Ludacris), la inserción de sus personajes en la historia —y la redención de sus antagonistas— siempre ha sido ingeniosa y divertida. En 2006, al asumir la dirección de The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Justin Lin llevó la saga a otro nivel, sin traicionar su esencia, apretando el nitro en todas las secuencias de acción y construyendo una línea dramática sumamente ascendente en las siguientes entregas (creando una bisagra que le permitió a Toretto y su equipo expandirse para pasar de “carreras ilegales” a “espionaje internacional”). Una labor auto-contenida gracias al ensamblaje de vasos comunicantes entre diferentes capítulos (como Deckard Shaw “matando” a Han en la escena post-créditos de  Fast & Furious 6 para así conectarla con The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift), para robustecer el lore de la saga y crear un suelo fértil que permite hacer ciertas piruetas narrativas (como“revivir” personajes entrañables y reincorporarlos de forma épica, complaciendo a los fans que han inundado las redes sociales con memes pidiéndolos de vuelta). Todo esto ha permitido que la franquicia explore un humor bastante particular y auto-consciente que le da una libertad casi absoluta de hacer lo que desee teniendo el permiso del público para generar situaciones que, en otro contexto, serían inverosímiles. El resultado ha sido la creación de una suerte de “universo cinematográfico” de Fast & Furious que, contra todo pronóstico, se ha mantenido en el tiempo con mayor consistencia que el de DC Comics (dueños de personajes icónicos como Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, entre otros). A pesar de la muerte de Paul Walker —un golpe durísimo que fácilmente hubiese podido torpedear toda la saga— y sus detractores en las filas de la crítica, Fast & Furious ha superado los vaivenes de 9 películas y un spin-off manteniéndose a flote. Es así como, finalmente, llega a nuestras salas de cine el último arco dramático de la franquicia con Fast X (Rápido y furioso X). Ambientada unos cuantos años después de F9: The Fast Saga, este nuevo capítulo nos presenta a Dante (Jason Momoa), un antagonista que tiene una vendetta contra Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) y toda su “familia”. Un argumento que ya fue explorado en Furious 7 (donde Deckard Shaw quería vengar a su hermano que quedó en coma al final de Fast & Furious 6), pero que acá es llevado a niveles mucho más complejos. A diferencia de sus posibles homólogos, Dante no es corredor clandestino ni agente especial ni narco super poderoso: es un psicópata brillante que se aprovecha de los vínculos emocionales de la gente para dominarlos y hacerles daño. Su maravilloso plan de ataque comienza desarticulando a todo el grupo de Toretto, desperdigándolos en diferentes partes del mundo y transformándolos en fugitivos de la justicia. Una excusa perfecta para crear una trilogía que ponga punto y final a las aventuras de nuestros héroes (aunque se anuncien posibles spin-off, claro está). Para despedirse por todo lo alto, el guion de Fast X (a cargo de Justin Lin y Dan Mazeau) se ancla en Fast Five (la mejor película de toda la saga por unanimidad) para construir la historia de background del más temido antagonista que ha tenido Toretto y su equipo. Gracias al plan malévolo de Dante, la estructura de esta entrega se aleja por completo del guion coral que suele caracterizar a Fast & Furious para mutar a un multiplot. Un artificio narrativo idóneo para que los personajes puedan ser desarrollados por separado, en diferentes locaciones, y tener un registro variopinto en las secuencias de acción (que van desde las peleas a puño limpio con Letty y Cipher, carreras clandestinas entre Toretto y Dante, hasta momentos en clave comedia con Han, Tej, Roman y Ramsey). En otro nivel, tener a tantos personajes desperdigados sirve de excusa idónea para explorar algunos easter egg de la franquicia y traer a otros “miembros” de la familia de regreso (y, por supuesto, incluir a nuevos). Al mejor estilo Avengers, el resultado es un spotlight que se posa sobre cada integrante de la familia, resaltando su importancia dentro del equipo y ayudándonos a entender por qué es vital que todos estén unidos y lo vulnerables que son al estar distanciados. Al igual que los capítulos anteriores, el guion de Fast X está lleno de chistes internos, diálogos auto-conscientes, escenas que rozan el melodrama y secuencias de acción que suben la barra de lo inverosímil (algo que todos esperamos luego de pasar por aviones, tanques, submarinos y carros que llegan al espacio). Sin lugar a dudas, lo mejor de Fast X es Jason Momoa. Más allá de la construcción de personaje (que deja en pañales a otros antagonistas como Charlize Theron, Jason Statham y Dwayne Johnson) su caracterización es maravillosa y se aleja por completo de su zona de confort de macho vernáculo (como solemos reconocerlo en Aquaman o Game of Thrones). Momoa encarna un villano excéntrico que por momentos recuerda a la locura del Joker de The Dark Knight y el histrionismo de Ruby Rhod en The Fifth Element. Esta mezcla lo aleja por completo de todos los antagonistas muscle man que ha tenido Fast & Furious, funcionando como una suerte de comic relief en cada una de sus apariciones y, al mismo tiempo, manteniéndonos en vilo por no saber cuál será su próxima jugada. Su estrategia se apoya en explotar, en clave de comedia y tragedia, el uso y abuso que ha tenido la saga con el running gag de la “familia”, resignificándolo y utilizándolo como motor de conflicto (obligando constantemente a Toretto a elegir a cuál de sus seres queridos está dispuesto a sacrificar, demostrándole las consecuencias de querer tener una “familia” obviando los peligros de la vida que ha llevado y los pecados que ha cometido).  La dirección de Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Now You See Me, Wrath of the Titans) está llena de referencias a toda la saga (como el setting de las carreras en Río de Janeiro y la animación del nitro), pero igual logra estamparle a cada secuencia de acción su sello único. Apoyado en la cinematografía de Stephen F. Windon (The Gray Man, Star Trek Beyond y las últimas 5 entregas de Fast & Furious), Leterrier logra proezas que fácilmente podrían ser aplaudidas por el mismísimo George Miller y que parecen imposibles de rodar por su complejidad en desarrollo y puesta en escena (como la bola incandescente en Roma). Gracias al impecable montaje de Kelly Matsumoto y Dylan Highsmith, editores de otros episodios de la saga, el largometraje logra mantener por más de 2 horas un ritmo trepidante articulando una secuencia de acción tras otra in crescendo (y, en algunas ocasiones, saltando entre tramas y conflictos que ocurren en paralelo). Independientemente de las críticas que pueda tener la verosimilitud de su universo narrativo, lo único que es incontestable de Fast X (y sus predecesoras) es su alto nivel de producción (con un presupuesto de casi 360 millones de dólares, es la película más cara de la franquicia). Por supuesto, esto se traduce en ver en pantalla cada dólar invertido en choques, explosiones, acrobacias increíbles, locaciones exóticas y efectos en el set: solo hace falta pasearse por los making of que se consiguen en internet para quedar con la quijada en el suelo y acercarse a Fast & Furious con otros ojos.  Lo que comenzó hace 22 años como una película de acción genérica se transformó en un fenómeno cinematográfico que, a pesar de sus detractores, ha dejado su huella en la historia del cine moderno como la saga de acción más longeva que se ha creado. En una época donde la industria del entretenimiento se da golpes de pecho e intenta darnos falsas lecciones morales, Fast & Furious se rehusa a seguir las tendencias del mainstream y sigue de forma consecuente haciendo largometrajes que responden a los códigos de la acción del siglo pasado: héroes invencibles, antagonistas caricaturescos, vueltas de tuerca impredecibles, amenazas mundiales, one-liners, secuencias de acción absurdas y finales felices. Básicamente, todo lo que necesitábamos en una película para entretenernos y desconectarnos del mundo un domingo por la tarde. Es por eso que le perdonamos —y aplaudimos— tener el valor de superar las leyes de la física, la vida y la muerte, utilizando la fe como recurso narrativo para justificar cualquier locura, apoyándose en la familia como leitmotiv para arcos de redención imposibles y haciéndonos reír con hombres fornidos recitando diálogos naive. En un mundo donde las opiniones cambian con el posicionamiento de cada hashtag, la persistencia y sinceridad de Fast & Furious es algo digno de celebrar. Lo mejor: Jason Momoa, de lejos, uno de los mejores papeles de toda su carrera. Las secuencias de acción alucinantes (e inverosímiles). Las referencias a otras entregas de la saga. Su humor auto-consciente. El regreso de personajes muy queridos (y de forma sorpresiva). Lo malo: por terminar en un cliffhanger, tener que esperar 2 años para la secuela de este cierre. La ausencia de algunos personajes entrañables. Por hacer la gran mayoría de los efectos especiales en set, las pocas veces que usan CGI se nota demasiado la diferencia.",POSITIVE

"May 25, 2023"," It’s been six years since the galaxy was last guarded, aside from an infinity war and an endgame, but the Guardians of the Galaxy, the MCU’s finest fiends and vagabonds, are back for one last hurrah. Whilst the Guardians franchise (within a franchise) is generally lauded, Volume 2 didn’t quite hit for me, and, with Bautista and Saldana both admitting they were pursuing new opportunities going forward, I couldn’t help but wonder what direction Volume 3 would take. Well, it’s still classic Guardians, James Gunn wasn’t going to rock the boat too much before exiting for the new DCEU, but this time he raises the pathos and emotion by a few notches - especially for the character of Rocket Raccoon (Cooper) as Volume 3 becomes his story. The rest of the gang aren’t shunned, in fact, Bautista’s Drax and Klementieff’s Mantis are given greater development (or in Mantis’ case, something to do finally) whilst Gillan’s Nebula gleefully continues her assimilation into the dysfunctional family, but it’s everyone’s favourite anthropomorphic raccoon (badge, rabbit, squirrel, hedgehog…) who exists as the heart and soul of the movie. His backstory powers the narrative and provides real emotion and stakes in a way the MCU hasn’t successfully executed in a while. However, there is still a big bad, the High Evolutionary (played with LOUD relish by Iwuji), complete with nefarious ideas to create a counter-Earth filled with 'perfect species' and a sub-villain in Will Poulter’s criminally weird Adam Warlock to contend with alongside some roaring third-act action, so the MCU hasn’t given up on its conventions. Whilst the action is strong, especially a climactic hallway massacre, the villains again left something to be desired and the movie often struggled to balance its tones - at times it was classic Guardians fare, and at others, it would be dark, traumatic, overly-serious, or hammy. Gunn just about manages to contain the tones and make them sing, but the pacing and momentum suffer slightly because of this. The final movie of the trilogy again brings some impressive visuals and a banging soundtrack, though, sometimes the songs don’t quite match the scenes they occupy - nothing stands out in a purely negative sense, but the synergy didn’t always feel natural. Fans of the Guardians will be absolutely delighted with the gang's swansong, and I had a good time revisiting the team and their emotional exits. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 isn’t top-tier Marvel but it’s damn solid with some great gags and action throughout. Compared to recent MCU releases, however, it’s a rousing success. At one point in time, it really did seem as if everyone had a BlackBerry. I know I did, my trusty BlackBerry Bold 9900 getting me through the highs and lows of life (mainly thanks to good old BBM). Now, the story of developers Research in Motion (RIM) and BlackBerry, the smartphone that ushered in the technology and changed the cellular world forever, is the subject of a movie - in a year where Cheetos, Air Jordan, and Tetris have all received movies, I really shouldn't be surprised. But surprised I was at hearing the announcement of this project, I mean, was there really a story here? More fool me for not knowing as the story of the rise and fall of BlackBerry is a true cautionary tale - riveting, exciting, and strangely tragic all at once. Matt Johnson’s BlackBerry charts the story of RIM from its origins with co-founders Mike Lazaridis (Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (Johnson in an affable role) desperately trying to keep their company afloat to them dominating the technology world and beyond. It’s a story of good intentions and ambition bumping up against corporate devilry and greed in the form of Glenn Howerton’s Jim Balsillie - the man who invested heavily in RIM only to destroy them from within with his shady dealings and desire for profit. Following the lead of The Social Network and Steve Jobs, the movie balances its diverting narratives smoothly - we're witness to the technological angle fronted by Baruchel’s Lazaridis (in possibly his best performance to date) as the company struggles to keep up with unprecedented demand from their relatively small HQ in Hamilton, Ontario and also the frenetic business aspect as we follow Balsillie - fantastically portrayed by Howerton - summoning all of his business ingenue, arrogance, and smarm to secure lucrative deals and the worlds top talent. It’s a combination that works excellently, powered by two fine leads, and, satisfyingly, the movie never meanders through a story that could easily have succumbed to mundanity. There’s a chaotic energy that permeates BlackBerry thanks in no small part to the cinéma vérité style of filmmaking employed by Johnson which really puts the audience in the room with the characters and, at times, allows for some decent dramatic tension - alongside the atmosphere created as the characters hold each other at arm's length throughout. It’s also the decision to focus on the men behind the company rather than the product that allows BlackBerry to really succeed. We get to understand their motivations, we see their changes (specifically Lazaridis), and we’re afforded the chance to see how they all deal with major moments individually and uniquely, and Johnson neatly handpicks the moments we as an audience need to see rather involving unnecessary subplots. BlackBerry is a compelling and richly rewarding experience about a company that, for a while, held the world in the palm of its hands - whilst we may know the outcome, waiting for the implosion has rarely felt so gratifying. Paul Schrader has been on a hot streak in recent years with the magnificent First Reformed and The Card Counter, movies that dealt with conflicted men and their pasts and fears, as well as capitalism, environmentalism, and existentialism in the worlds of religion and gambling. His latest effort, Master Gardener, follows a similar path, narratively and thematically, and plays like the third part of a loosely connected (yet still unconnected) trilogy. As the title suggests, the movie is set against the background of horticulture and gardening and centres on Joel Edgerton's Narvel. Narvel is a man who KNOWS horticulture, an unforthcoming man but one that harbors a mysterious past - a past that, in true Schrader style, we are left waiting to uncover whilst the movie plays out meticulously. Also, in true Schrader style, he is a man who pours his soul into the pages of a diary in a darkened room like Ernst Toller and William Tell before him. Master Gardener is not as sharp or incisive as Schrader's previous two efforts, though there is more of an uplifting tone here, but this is still a Schrader film first and foremost and what he does well, he does very well. The layered messages throughout are clear despite not being as cutting as before, but instead Schrader asks you to buy into Narvel's attempt at atonement as he attempts to guide troubled Maya (Swindell) toward a better life, and, whilst doing so, running full-speed into his dark past. It's an interesting direction for the story to take, but not one that is entirely successful especially in the bond between Narvel and Maya, a bond that was ripe for further review but one that lacked the deft touch of the directors previous works. Both actors, Edgerton and Swindell, provide strong performances alongside Sigourney Weaver's domineering matriarch, Norma, instead the writing fails them at certain moments. The screenplay throughout does not call for concern, however, as there is plenty of profundity on display, and a near-literal nature and nurture argument looming over the entirety of the story, Master Gardener is a movie brimming with intrigue. As the movie goes on, Schrader asks us as the viewer to grapple once again with uncomfortable themes, and, potentially will alienate many with the depiction and arc of Narvel, but Schrader has never been one to take the easy route. Whilst Master Gardener falls short of the levels of quality set in Schrader's previous two offerings in terms of incisiveness, there's still plenty here to continue his winning streak. His next project, though, promises to be a breath of fresh air from this unofficial trilogy - instead becoming an unofficial tetralogy... The family is back for another fast, furious, unfathomable, and unrestricted romp. I won’t rattle on about how this franchise used to be about racing because it’s been done to death and the Fast series is now universally accepted as a crazy, OTT, action-fest. Me? I tolerate the series more than anything, I can’t call myself a fan as…well, the movies aren't great across the board but the series has been going for twenty-two years now so can Fast X prove otherwise? To be honest, no, not really, however…however, for the first half of Fast X, I was having a good time. Sure, it was just as incomprehensible as ever but it hadn’t gone stratospherically stupid at that point - OK, except for the impenetrable bouncing bomb hurtling through the streets of Rome… - though it flowed nicely, and the set up was executed well enough. From the midway point, it all goes crazy and seems dead set on outdoing everything that has come before with the franchise. Helicopters, dams, rivers, rockets, planes, gravity, the Pope - none of it can stand up to the might of a car, or a kayak…or Dom Toretto (Diesel). Superman returns again to uncharismatically lead the family across another global adventure that sees them all become the world’s most wanted terrorists, and it's all part of bad guy Dante Reyes’ (Momoa) plan to DESTROY Toretto once and for all. Though, whilst Vin Diesel lumbers through his performance, desperately trying to add weight to his dialogue whilst sounding like he has a mouthful of toffee, Jason Momoa is full of life and magnetism as the beefy yet effeminate Dante, his character adding some much needed colour and levity to the now-telenovela. If you can breeze past the awful dialogue (“Without honour, you got no family!”...what?) and some wonky CGI, then you’ll enjoy the stunt work and some of the huge setpieces employed throughout - no one can say these movies don’t put in a shift when it comes to spectacle and it's fairly easy to see why these movies are so popular. Fans will be pleased as well with the connectivity with the rest of the franchise, the story picks up, expands or culminates threads from many of the previous Fast movies, and it also clearly sets up the big finale to come - the Endgame for Fast fans is fast approaching. Fast X manages to be bigger and more bonkers than any of the previous entries in the franchise, but it's still a bit rubbish. After the sheer temerity of casting someone who isn’t white, The Little Mermaid felt like it had an uphill battle to overcome even before its release, such was the uproar from the internet bedwetters. As the next in line from Disney to receive the live action adaptation, what the movie really had to contend with was a fantastic ‘original’ animated movie, a movie that has been beloved since its 1989 release for its songs, visuals, and affable characters. This 2023 version, directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha), clocks in at over an hour longer than its predecessor with additional songs, scenes and focus on specific characters - but, honestly, these additions really equate to the weaker aspects of the movie. When The Little Mermaid adapts directly from the 1989 feature, the movie is at its strongest - even if it isn’t as dazzling or beguiling - but as we drift from the familiar, Marshall and co. struggle to fill the runtime with anything of any real substance, instead offering narrative strands that do not amount to anything when all is said and done. Where the movie shines is in its lead performance, Halle Bailey wonderfully taking on the role of Ariel, and, whilst her acting is fine, her vocals particularly soar. Classic cuts such as Part of Your World are belted out with genuine spirit and her earnest, innocent performance fits the role like legs on a human. The cast across the board are solid, McCarthy is deliciously hammy in the perfectly cast role of Ursula and Daveed Diggs shines as Sebastian - as Prince Eric, Hauer-King had great chemistry with Bailey, but he is generally so-so otherwise. Whilst the voices of the anthropomorphic sea life are generally strong, the visual aspect is really anything but - Sebastian is caught between reality and fantasy, whereas Flounder looks on the cusp of death. Throughout the movie, the visuals fluctuate from bright and vivid to murky or downright appalling (some of the underwater CG is painful) and it's genuinely frustrating to see such inconsistencies in a big-budget offering from the major studio. Avatar, this ain’t. The reimagining of the songs, also, fall into this category, the reworking of the classics are enjoyable, but the new additions, particularly Prince Eric’s Wild Uncharted Waters is wetter than the sea itself, and far less interesting. It’s these issues that really sum up The Little Mermaid (a strange title, really…one the movie poorly tries to interpret), it’s all just…fine. It never really excels or allows itself to take risks, every feels a bit safe (including the new additions). When it works, The Little Mermaid is enjoyable and entertaining…because those parts are adapting the wonderful animated movie. When the movie doesn’t work, it can be a slog - one that does not justify its overly long runtime. Halle Bailey is a star in the lead role, but the rest of the movie does not live up to her promise.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2023"," The Fast & Furious movies have now entered their third decade as a franchise, and we still have one or two of these monsters left (depending on who you listen to). They revisit the past and bring back supposedly dead characters more often than Marvel movies do, and they bend and break the laws of physics with so much wild abandon, it’s hard not to give yourself over to it and just let it happen. As jokey as things can get with some of the characters, there’s also a self-seriousness to these films that is almost difficult to watch because these characters are clearly the only ones treating these stories as anything other than live-action cartoons. As with any franchise that is 10 chapters in, some movies are better than others (although no one seems to agree about which are the best). I can say without reservation that Fast X is the most of everything I’ve just said and then some, and that’s not necessarily a good thing. In order to come up with a new villain that still somehow fits into the F&F universe, we jump back in time to Fast Five (2011), when Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian (the late Paul Walker, who I’m uncomfortable still seeing in the movies, pretending he’s still alive) stole a massive vault from drug kingpin Hernan Reyes in Rio De Janeiro. Although we didn’t see it in that film, it turns out Reyes was running his empire along with his son Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), who saw his father die in front of him and has been plotting full-throated revenge for the last 12 years by targeting everyone in Dom’s real and extended family of criminals-turned-government contractors.  Since we’re allegedly winding things down with these movies, the filmmakers have seen the need to bring just about everyone back—living and dead—who has ever been in these movies. I won’t ruin any of the surprises that come in the last minutes of Fast X, but among the new characters introduced in this installment we have Brie Larson as Tess, the daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody (who is Mr. Not In the Movie this time around); Rita Moreno as Dom and sister Mia’s (Jordana Brewster) grandmother; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad), playing a Brazilian street racer with close ties to Dom’s past; and just for good measure Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the agency who doesn't really give a crap about Dom’s rich tradition of racing and thieving, and even more shocking, isn’t related to anyone from a previous film. Directed by new-to-the-franchise Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me) and written by Dan Mazeau and the best director the series has ever had, Justin Lin, Fast X is a ridiculous cat-and-mouse game with Dom and his team—Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Sung Kang—chasing after Dante or him chasing after them. They're trying to stop him from killing other members of the team or people close to them, most especially Dom’s 8-year-old son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), because Dante doesn’t want to kill Dom right away; he wants him to suffer first. For those keeping score, this film also sees the return of Jason Statham as Shaw, Helen Mirren as Shaw’s scheming mother, John Cena as Dom’s brother, and Charlize Theron as Cypher, who, like most F&F villains, is now working with Dom & Co. against the much tougher bad guy. Again, like the Marvel movies, the F&F entries are only as good as their villains. Theron was a great nemesis in previous movies, but all she did was sit in a room and react to things going on in other places. How you cast the star of Mad Max: Fury Road and not put her in a car is beyond me. In Fast X, she at least gets to interact more with other characters, mostly Rodriguez’s Letty, including engaging in a fantastic one-on-one, hand-to-hand combat sequence that is beyond brutal.  But let's talk about Dante. If you’re looking for a drinking game to play while watching this film, try taking a shot every time Momoa stretches his arms out in a Jesus Christ-like pose like he’s celebrating a victory he hasn’t actually won yet. Take another shot every time he puts on feminine airs, thinking he’s making everyone uncomfortable. I’ve been genuinely shocked to see the positive reaction to Momoa’s Dante performance. He’s in no way threatening or smart or witty; he’s just annoying, and maybe that’s this goal. I guess it’s interesting that he’s at least trying for a different tone than the F&F villains of the past, but what he’s doing is so obvious and dull, I couldn’t wait for him to leave the screen. He’s acting sociopathic without being sociopathic, and there are few things worse than seeing someone try so hard and achieve nothing. I didn’t put a stopwatch to it, but Fast X also seems to have fewer car chases than any of the other films (if you don’t count the car chases that are replayed from previous films), which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since the face-to-face fight scenes and foot chases are actually pretty spectacular. And the movie does its fair share of globe trotting, from Los Angeles and London to the streets and catacombs of Rome and back to Rio, with brief stops in Portugal and even the Antarctic. And all along the way, Dante just threatens to kill a new vital member of Dom’s “family,” and Dom races to save them knowing full well he’s walking into a trap. And perhaps even bolder than some of the surprises at the end of the film, Fast X actually does something I don’t think has been done before in a F&F movie: it ends on a cliffhanger, one where it appears many of our favorite characters are either dead or about to be. Fast X is a retread in many ways, not just because it rewinds the story to five movies earlier. I miss the days when the team had an actual mission that didn’t involve some personal vendetta against them. As much as they try, these movies have never done well conveying emotions (except when Walker died, which they didn’t actually acknowledge with his Brian character). Constantly threatening Dom’s people has gotten old and only really results in Diesel scowling his familiar scowl every time. There are a handful of Oscar winners in this franchise’s regular rotation, so let them act, for Christ’s sake.  All that being said, I’m genuinely curious to see how they wrap this series up in two years (or whenever), because I suspect they’re going to go for broke as far as the insane stunts. A guy can dream. As long as you keep your expectations low with Fast X, you won’t come out as disappointed as I was with this fairly crowded and standard-issue entry. Did you enjoy this post?

"May 24, 2023"," PUT the pedal to the metal – it’s the 10th instalment from the Fast & Furious crew – a high-speed and hilarious two-and-a-half hours of motoring madness. We’re taken back ten years, where F&F veteran Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O’Conner (the late Paul Walker) are doing the “vault theft” in Fast Five.  Having hooked a steel bank-safe to their cars, they drive it frantically through buildings — killing the gangland boss that owned it in the process. And so starts Dante’s assault on the team, including Dom’s wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brother Jakob (John Cena), sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) — and double act Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson). The relentless attacks include chasing a giant ball- bomb through the streets of Rome, racing through the busy streets of Rio and being attached to helicopters while on a sunny version of Spaghetti Junction. Nothing is sacred in this first bit of the two-part finale, so you have to make a choice — slip your brain into cruise control and allow the insanity to wash over you, or take it seriously. When en route around the world you’ll see Brie Larson’s 2016 Oscar win flash before her eyes in her scenes with muscleman boss Alan Ritchson. But mostly you’ll enjoy the surprisingly superb turn by Momoa, who plays the flamboyant criminal mastermind with such dark humour, he becomes a buff version of Joaquin Phoenix’s The Joker.  And while Diesel still has the acting range of a flat battery — and no one ever wears a seatbelt yet they come out of collisions unscathed — it’s still one hell of a ride on the big screen. There is a lot of humour to be found in contrasting the conflict-averse Beau with a violent world, containing a naked knifeman, a killer spider and a creepy family. It is the story of 11-year-old Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) who has to move from her home in New York to New Jersey with her scatty artist mum (Rachel McAdams) and soulful dad (Benny Safdie). Being taken away from her beloved gran (Kathy Bates), Margaret falls in with the local girls but this soon inflicts concerns about her lack of curves, lack of bra, lack of periods and lack of experience with the opposite sex. So Margaret – who has no religion after her Christian mum caused a family row when she married her Jewish dad – starts praying to her own version of God for these things to come immediately. All the performances are charming, without being sickly sweet – and with a soundtrack so good it matches Forrest Gump, this film is perfect for all the family. The 80-minute, 15-certificate documentary is full of quirky characters, from 007 obsessive Gunnar James Bond Schafer in Sweden who drinks exclusively Bollinger champagne, to a computer programmer who says having the moniker is an ""outstanding"" chat-up line and even helps him blag-free cinema tickets. Fans will be left shaken and stirred by the dark twists in this documentary, so shocking that not even Bond baddie Ernst Stavro Blofeld could have come up with them. There's also a surprising story behind how Ian Fleming ""stole"" the name for his legendary womaniser from a ""very quiet"" birdwatcher. The matter nearly ended up in court after the ornithologist's wife threatened to sue Fleming for defamation, before they struck an agreement.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2023"," “I don’t know what I just saw. But I liked it!” That’s what movie fans will say collectively when they stagger out of the theater after being assaulted with adrenalin-pumping action scenes for 2h 21m. It’s a formula that’s worked for 22 years, ever since The Fast and Furious premiered in 2001. Team up a crew of multicultural drivers and motorcyclists—aka street racers. Give em’ fast cars and bikes and an enemy to fight, then sit back and watch. This new edition follows that successful blueprint, reassembles the base cast and adds a few new characters.  Sitting in the director’s chair and manipulating all the incredible stunts, explosions, chases and elaborate fights takes guts, creatively and ambition. In that way, Louis Leterrier, who cut his teeth on Jason Statham films (The Transporter), is all business. Measure out mindboggling, over-the-top attacks, rescues and escapes throughout. Squeeze in a plot (co-writers Dan Mazeau, Justin Lin) about the leader Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his extended family being stalked and menaced by Dante (Jason Momoa), the son of a crimelord they once killed. Then let the bodies fall where they may. And they do. Ready, set, rob, smuggle and kill. The gang is back together again. They look older. Muscles aren’t as defined as they used to be. Wrinkles are creeping in. But true fans won’t care. As the group sits at a picnic table in Los Angeles, eating, drinking and socializing, audiences know that these scenes of bliss will be few: Dom, his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The always squabbling Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris). Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) the tech wizard and Han (Sung Kang) the fierce driver. The new edition is Dom’s young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) and Queenie (Rita Moreno) is the matriarch. Dante draws the group into traps, ambushes, shootouts and combat. You’d think he was trying to murder them all because they killed his dad: “My father was a horrible man. A bad daddy. You took him from me!” But he’s more intent on terrorizing his adversaries and making ‘em suffer, especially Dom: “You’re going to die knowing you couldn’t save your son!” Momoa is fun to watch and gets all the best lines. His interpretation of the villain is an over-affected combinations of Liberace and Prince. Campy flamboyant. Bright-colored nail polish, lavender shirts and purple trousers. He acts silly and effete but kills like a demonic sociopath.  Too much of Dom and the main characters’ dialogue is filled with action-film clichés and over-used metaphors. Sometimes it’s laughable. And Dom’s overuse of his “it’s all about family” mantra is turning him into a mockable caricature. The generic talk makes the characters seem cartoonish. That’s a pity because back in the day, these guys were laconic and real badasses.  The cast is wonderful to watch. Piling into the players box are Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Jason Statham, Helen Mirren and John Cena. The ensemble is bigger than a football team, but it’s easy to track who’s who and what they do. So much of their wow factor comes from elaborate stunts in elaborately choreographed fight scenes. A high point is when Michele Rodriguez does a pinpoint, one-wheel 360 on a motorbike when an obstacle is thrown in her path. Acrobatic feats like that make the actors and their stunt doubles magicians. And though they are as fine as they can be, the tech team should be crowned MVPs.  Fast X’s break-neck energy is at a level that exceeds other Fast and Furious episodes. Maybe because this time out, realty is just an inconvenience that the director Leterrier, cast and tech crew chose to ignore. ",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2023"," Vin Diesel gets back behind the wheel in his Fast and Furious franchise of ever-diminishing returns, enlisting familiar fast faces and fan favourites to drive this flimsy story forward the one breath of fresh air in the form of a new bad guy - Jason Momoa's Dante. Look my relationship with the Fast and Furious franchise feels like an all-or-nothing affair. Fast Five blew my freaking socks off, I was all in. Now as we get to Fast X there's nothing much left in the tank. Cars and humans are entirely indestructible, our heroes time and time again emerge from certain incineration without a scratch or blister - the sheer ridiculousness matched only by my sheer boredom. Diehard Fast and Furious fans you'll see your ticket as money well spent and you'll get no judgement here but for me two-and-a-half stars is the most I can muster.",NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2023"," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  School is out (college anyhow) and the alums are back on campus, so for its “Reunion Week” program The Brattle Theatre queues up an olio of 25th-, 50th- and 75th-year anniversary cinematic staples, beginning with Bogie and Bacall in the John Huston-directed noir “Key Largo” (1948) on Wednesday and Harvard grad Darren Aronofsky’s debut sci-fi pontification “Pi” (1998) on Wednesday and Thursday. Then it’s Hitchcock’s “one shot” take on the Leopold and Loeb thrill-kill murder, “Rope” (1948) on Thursday; on Friday, the Dude abides in the Coen brothers’ instant classic “The Big Lebowski” (1998), playing with the Robert Altman neo-noir, “The Long Goodbye” (1973). Saturday, it’s a fierce and furious triple with Steven Spielberg’s World War II classic “Saving Private Ryan” (1998), Bruce Lee’s indelible martial arts espionage thriller “Enter the Dragon” (1973) and Pam Grier (“Jackie Brown”) taking it to the man in “Coffy” (1973). Rounding out the week, on May 28 it’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” (1973) and Vittorio De Sica’s neorealist defining tale of heartbreak and humanity, “Bicycle Thieves” (1948). The Tuesday “May’d Men: Scorsese & De Niro” Retro Replay at the Landmark Kendall Square Theatre this week is Scorsese’s hardboiled 1991 remake of J. Lee Thompson’s 1962 crime-noir, “Cape Fear.” De Niro does the impossible, equalling Robert Mitchum’s virulent menace while adding his own spin to the relentless, lurking psycho terrorizing a lawyer, who he felt did him wrong (Nick Nolte), and his family (Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis). Noting the prior film’s place in the cinematic pantheon, Scorsese casts 1962 stars, Mitchum and Gregory Peck, who played the Nolte part, in supporting roles and the haunting score by Elmer Bernstein is a homage infused reworking of Bernard Herrmann’s brilliant 1962 crafting that deepened the darkness and tensions on screen. Interestingly one of the last films the masterful and eccentric Herrmann scored (he did many a Hitchcock film, including “Psycho” and both “Fears” were made with intentional Hitchcockian flourishes) was Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” (1976). This week at the Somerville Theatre there’s a trove of repertory treasures beginning with the revolving “Fuck the Nazis” program on Wednesday with a double down of “Casablanca” (1942), featuring Bogie and Bergman as one of the most iconic cinematic pairings on the historical screen, and Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn in “The Guns of Navarone,” directed by Lee J. Thompson (the original “Cape Fear,” and “Conquest of the Planet of the Apes”). On Thursday it’s another double shot, this time from director William Wyler with the Academy Award-sweeping “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946) about World War II vets with PTSD trying to readjust back into society and the rom-com that launched Audrey Hepburn as a major Hollywood force, “Roman Holiday” (1953). Then it’s all things David Lynch with “The Elephant Man” (1980), my fave, “Blue Velvet” (1986), the defining work “Eraserhead” (1977) and the “what really happened to Laura Palmer” big-screen score “Twin Peaks Walk With Me” (1992), Friday though Sunday. Not sure that a remake of the 1992 Ron Shelton sports curio starring Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes was necessary, but this updating is passable enough to make the bench. As the Black and white oddballers who bond for street hustle ball in L.A. and later team up for a two-on-two tourney, Sinqua Walls (“Friday Night Lights”) and Jack Harlow (“Scoob!”) have pretty good chemistry as the brooding never-was Kamal and shaggy-dog-goofball-with-mad-skillz Jeremy. Updates include smart devices, barcode scans and viral phenoms, but the rest is pretty much cut-and-paste. As with the original, deep matters concerning race are largely left off court, even though it’s comically front and center and, given the climate today, a tad more tugging than ha-ha. If you’ve seen the original, despite it being released 30 years ago, it’ll all come back to you like muscle memory at the foul line and likely won’t show you any new crossovers; for those curious and hungry for more b-ball entertainment as the Celtics look to go deeper in the playoffs, here’s a little bounce pass to send you to the rim during warmups. (Tom Meek) On Hulu. Diana (Annie Parisse) asks Marlene (Gus Birney), her adult son’s pregnant (not with his child) girlfriend, for a favor: She fell for an Internet scam, lost the family’s savings and needs a ride to the culprit’s address. The goal is to recover the money without her family finding out. Eager to win over Diana, Marlene agrees and keeps it all secret. The quest becomes something of a bonding session as they confide in each other about their unsatisfying family lives, but takes on a more surreal and oneiric texture before they arrive. This directorial debut by Theodore Schaefer works best when depicting quotidian interactions in which families under the same roof are isolated from each other because each exists in their own delusion. Diana’s domineering husband Daryl (Paul Sparks, Parisse’s husband) dreams of opening his own restaurant. Marlene’s mom (Constance Shulman, Birney’s mom) is a harmless Norma Desmond type who does not notice that she is about to be a grandma. Schaefer’s exploration of the two-sided theme of the banal, meager wage-earning life and perpetuation of traditional Greek culture is evocative, but never conveys a cohesive vision to unite the butterfly, deer, feline and twin imagery and literary allusions that get bantered about. A dream is more interesting to the dreamer than those hearing about it. (Sarah Vincent) On Fandor. In this hard-boiled thriller, Jennifer Lopez stars as assassin simply known as “The Mother” who does one last, dirty job for a network of intelligence agencies and comes in for a debriefing that turns out to be a bloodbath – literally. And what’s that, our agent is expecting? Because of the perils of her line of biz, the baby girl is given up for adoption and mom goes underground in Alaska as a sharpshooter keeping wolves away from livestock. Twelve years later, other wolves – operatives from back in the day (Gael Garcia Bernal and Joseph Fiennes) show up and want the girl (Lucy Paez) to ferret mom out. Turns out either one of these cardboard nasties could be the dad, too. The action bounces from Tlingit Bay to the bustling streets of Havana – nothing like a good car chase that ends with a wedding bouquet toss – and most excitingly in the world-hopping action, Cincinnati. The no-nonsense Lopez (“Hustlers”) holds the standard issue together and the action, as directed by Niki Caro (“Whale Rider,” “Mulan”), clicks by with the rapid-fire confidence of Lopez’s mom on the trigger. (Tom Meek) On Netflix. Director and co-writer Pallaoro introduces the titular character (Trace Lysette) in a close-up of her bare face and blue tattooed shoulders as she lies in a tanning bed listening to loud music. She gets a call from someone whose voice and identity are not revealed to us; all we know is that it sends Monica, a transgender woman living an isolated existence, on a road trip to her childhood home (Cincinnati, in the lens again). Upon arrival, Monica learns that her mother (Patricia Clarkson) is dying and does not recognize her, but the reason would be a spoiler for viewers unfamiliar with Lysette’s work in the streaming series “Transparent.” The gorgeously constructed first half feels like a labor of love for Lysette, Pallaoro and crew, who chose a lush, counterintuitive color palette for Monica, namely a teal and orange motif that reflects her appearance, apartment decor, a hotel room along the way and the conflict of emotions within. The acting and aesthetics compel, but the second half turns into an unrealistic fantasy as the family reconciles easily. It feels like there are still messier parts in the past to work through. (Sarah Vincent) At Landmark Kendall Square Cinema, 355 Binney St., Kendall Square and Somerville Theatre, 55 Davis Square. It’s not hard to tell “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is James Gunn’s endgame for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He’s been with the Guardians since 2014; this threequel brings the mishmash crew of subscript heroes together after an especially long break – “Vol. 2” was in 2017 – caused in part by Gunn’s firing after a right-wing panic over long disavowed tweets. Cast members demanded his return, and Disney smartly relented, but DC in the meantime snatched Gunn up to lead its own entire superhero universe. Knowing this is the end, Gunn goes back to the beginning: the origins of Rocket (the voice of Bradley Cooper), as a scarred, genius gun nut raccoon who has no idea what a raccoon is. This means Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and the gang going to messy, loud war with the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji, sufficiently maniacal) and an army of mutated and mutilated animals – PETA members may take exception. It’s an intensely emotional ride that feels as unmistakably, satisfyingly final as anything in the MCU short of Tony Stark’s death. There’s goodbyes, callbacks and dancing, and an estranged version of original team member Gamora (Zoe Saldana) returns long enough to relearn that the Guardians are a family, but no longer hers, and the message is unmistakable: Gunn – er, Gamora – has found a home elsewhere. The Guardians as we knew ’em are over. (Marc Levy) At Landmark Kendall Square Cinema, 355 Binney St.; Apple Cinemas Cambridge, 168 Alewife Brook Parkway, Cambridge Highlands near Alewife and Fresh Pond; and AMC Assembly Row 12, 395 Artisan Way, Assembly Square, Somerville. Ria (Priya Kansara), a Pakistani British teen and aspiring martial artist stuntwoman, is alarmed when her supportive older sister, Lena (Ritu Arya), a depressed art school dropout, seems to abandon her dreams after getting engaged to Salim (Akshay Khanna), a posh geneticist and très eligible bachelor whom they met at his family’s lavish Eid festival. Ria and her school friends try to sabotage the relationship with awkward sitcom-esque schemes – i.e., cheesy fake mustache undercover operations – but Ria’s mission becomes more urgent when she discovers that Lena’s life is in danger. Writer and director Nida Manzoor makes a feature film debut reminiscent of Edgar Wright’s early work (“Shaun of the Dead,” “Hot Fuzz”). Instead of relying on the affable cast’s chemistry and credible crafting of their characters, Manzoor ruptures every solid relationship to increase the tension and concern that Ria will not succeed alone. Rescue, not reunion, is the driving force as the film steers into the denouement. The betrayal within Ria’s family and among her friends may be too bombastic for some to remain invested. The fight choreography and costume design are stunning and help disguise the film’s flaws. The South Asian diaspora elements and feminist themes help ground the film’s minor excursions into sci-fi. If Manzoor stuck to the mature drama without cheap jokes and narrative tropes, the action comedy could have notched another star. (Sarah Vincent) On Amazon Prime Video. The series that keeps on grinding away even though the creativity tank hit E a few chapters back. The additions of John Cena (“Peacemaker”), Helen Mirren (“The Long Good Friday”) and Charlize Theron (“Atomic Blonde”) intrigue, but by “X” we’re overloaded with the regular crew that’s been around Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto for so long – Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), girlfriend/mother to his kid (Leo Abelo Perry); the head-butting duo of Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris); ace wheelman Han (Sung Kang); Mia (Jordana Brewster), the posse’s voice of reason from the start; and the amicably brutish Shaw (Jason Statham). The film unfolds in disjointed, globe-spanning chapters: Letty and and Theron’s Cipher in a prison in Antartica, Dom and the core lads in Rome trying to stop a box-truck-sized bowling ball of a bomb from taking out the Vatican, and uncle Jakob trying to get Dom’s son to a safe place. The fly in the ointment is some fancy fanatic named Dante (Jason Momoa, “Aquaman” himself) who rigs that bomb in Rome and seems to be everywhere all the time at once, pissed that Dom took down his dad and his nefarious network in a previous film. As Dante, Momoa is intermittently the most garish and freshest thing on the screen as he channels the likes of the late Ray Liotta in nearly any role he’s played and an early Brad Pitt in “Kalifornia” (1993). Brie Larson of “Captain Marvel” is also added to mix as an agency operative who just further roils the water. It’s a crowded, revved-up affair that hangs on Dom’s bristling machismo. That worked when the series was muscular and lean, but – and many will walk in not knowing – “Fast X” is just the first of two parts (see “Dune”).

"May 24, 2023"," This is happening, again. If you are a fan of the Fast franchise, fast-ten your seatbelts! See what I did there? They had a perfectly good, built-in tagline and didn’t even capitalize on it. Listen y’all, Fast X is back like it never left, because it never left. Hasn’t left for twenty-two years. Honestly? It’s been as good as it’ll ever be. As the spectacle gets larger and more spectacular, it begs the question: will it ever be ‘too much’? The answer is no. There is no ‘too much’. Dom Toretto and the family are back again like the Hess truck at Christmas. Come to think of it, that would be a hell of a cross-promotion! As per usual, the stakes are higher than ever. Well, the stakes are where they always are, but they feel more stake-y. There’s no real way to critique a Fast movie, it exists in a pocket dimension outside of the rules of cinema. This franchise literally breaks all of the parameters of “good” filmmaking and is a leap of predictable cash grabs. Despite all of that, this is the most entertaining movie on Bast’s green Earth, and we have to live with that fact. I laughed every single time the camera slowly crawled toward Dom’s tortured, angry face. Let’s get into it. If you can name a plot mechanism that semi-threw you for a loop in the first nine movies, they all happen here in the span of just one flick. The Family trots the globe and engages in heists, answering to everyone and no one at the same time. Slick visuals, gratuitous shots of women dancing in exotic locales, dozens of modified cars, and product placement on par with the first Sonic movie, all of the pieces that make it visually scintillating remain. Cinematography and stuntwork are of the highest caliber since John Wick 4 (not that long ago). The fight choreo was very uninspired, but it’s filmed well – although it hasn’t really gotten better in a few movies. Cameos were top-notch. The franchise must really be in its final phase, because they are calling in every favor they ever had in Hollywood. Folks came out of the woodwork to get this check. Two things do stand out in this movie. First, Fast has always held diversity in high regard. Not the vague, please the PoCs while not making the white folk uncomfortable type diversity, nah. I’m talking about the ‘put Tego Calderon, Don Omar, and Black Latinx folks up front in the Puerto Rico scenes’ diversity. Women in strong roles, men engaging in vulnerability with one another, and folks from all walks of pop culture adding their flavor to the Fast cameos. Fast X continues in that tradition of unwavering representation. Internationally known on the microphone with a cast hailing from every damn where. Secondly, what catches you by surprise is Jason Momoa’s heel turn as the bold antagonist Dante Reyes. The word that best describes Momoa’s performance is ‘unhinged:’ Flamboyantly dressed, methodical yet maniacal, and delivering the best lines in the entire film. This man is competing with Academy Award winner Charlize Theron (albeit it’s Fast X) and coming out on top. Honestly, his performance is the entire reason to see this movie. To be clear, Jason Momoa channeled the eccentric and creepy charisma of every iteration of The Joker, and it worked. It was different to see Momoa play the villain, especially one bucking gender expression norms when he’s usually cast as the hypermasculine lead. Ever since that fate-ful entry into the franchise (See? Did it again.) Fate of the Furious, when these racers turned robbers turned rogue state vigilantes took down a drug kingpin; the whole series slipped into some alternate universe. A universe where two overclocked Dodge Charger SRT8s can pull a bank vault out of a wall located in a police station, and have it be manipulated as a weapon. In midday, rush hour traffic – which is beside the point. This moment in the fifth movie is a key point in the timeline that shifted things toward unbelievably unbelievable levels of madness. There’s a clear ‘point A’ to ‘point B’ connection from the safe heist in F5 to Dom doing parkour on London rooftops – in Timbs!?! Loosely laced?! Things in Fast X proceed to move into the superhuman. We watched Dom take his muscle car off a gigantic municipal landmark while dodging liquid fire and defying gravity as we know it, only to emerge unscathed. Like, fam, not a glass scratch? Not a bruise from bouncing around inside a steel frame? No rug burn from the leather upholstery on them bucket seats? If that’s the case, this ain’t even a live-action movie. This is now a cartoon. Fast X has so much CGI stuntwork that it’s damn near a cartoon. If this came on FOX Kids when I was a teen, would’ve been neck and neck with X-Men ‘92. What’s wild is that they brought attention to this fact in Fast 9 introducing the most important moment in Roman’s (played by Tyrese Gibson) two-decade existence. But, I digress. So much of the fight choreography, chase scenes, and even the dialogue is so totally unmoored from reality that this could easily be a B-grade MCU entry. That said, it’s amazing. It does everything it says it will do and there are no upper (or lower) limits to what this franchise will do to center family over everything. To be honest, they’re really losing out. At the present rate of spectacle, the last movie in this ending trilogy (yes, Fast X will arrive in three parts) should basically be a crossover with the Transformers and Jurassic franchises. Hell, throw the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in there for giggles. It would still be believable. In typical Fast fashion (see, another one) this is the first of an ending trilogy and Fast X sends us off on two separate cliffhangers, because why not? Fast X goes for broke, swings for the fences, puts the pedal to the metal, and never stops never stopping. If you’re looking for non-stop action, badly placed humor, wacky pacing, and a relentless narrative, look no further. The Fast franchise has captured the minds and hearts of the world and has no limit in sight. The only thing they haven’t done is time travel. Although, Cipher did roll up in a DeLorean…Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. ",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2023",Of course you know it&apos;s going to be fantastical&#44; a little silly&#44; and completely unrealistic&#44; but this is the kind of big screen popcorn flick we like to go to the movies and see&#46;,POSITIVE
"May 24, 2023"," Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun. The plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past. The story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy. The stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific. The film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son don’t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron). Although I’m a fan of all things “Fast and Furious,” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. “Fast X” feels like it’s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you’re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it’s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2023"," Fast X opens up with footage from Fast Five. You may find this hard to believe, but Fast X retcons some things we thought we knew about this series to insert Jason Momoa’s new villain, Dante Reyes, into the events of Fast Five, as the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes. (The “hard to believe” line is sarcasm.) But watching scenes from Fast Five again, it’s a stark reminder of the epitome of the Fast series. As we watch Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) steal Hernan Reyes’s safe again, there was a day and age where dragging a giant safe with two cars through the streets of Rio de Janeiro was, once upon a time, the height of wackiness for this series. In the ninth movie of this franchise, a car is driven to space. Rewatching Fast Five makes it seem like a grounded drama. Compared to the latest installments, Fast Five might as well be the Ordinary People of this film series. Also, seeing Paul Walker back as Brian, even in old footage, really drives home the point how much this series misses him. I’m not going to pretend I have the right answer on how Walker’s death should have been handled when he was tragically killed before filming of Fast & Furious 7 was complete. James Wan, who directed that installment, was dealt a near-impossible task. But as an audience we still mourn his loss, yet the characters do not because Brian is still around in the Fast universe, he just doesn’t show up anymore. By now, I wish this had been addressed. Maybe something like the way Wakanda Forever handled the loss of Chadwick Boseman. So that the characters can feel the loss of their friend the same way we feel the loss of an actor we admired. Even in Fast X, with a plot based on the fact that anyone who was involved in the Fast Five heist is now in big trouble at the hands of Dante Reyes. This leads to Dom having to deliver a clunky line saying that he called Brian and “he’s safe.” Oh, okay? Well, if it’s that easy, why not just do what Brian is doing to stay safe? So, yes, in Louis Letterrier’s Fast X (replacing Justin Lin who came back for Fast 9, then abruptly left Fast X a week into filming) Dante Reyes is seeking revenge. (Also, Jason Momoa is really going for something here. And I’m not totally convinced it always works? There’s one scene in particular … yeah, I just don’t know. But I do appreciate he’s trying stuff out.) Dante has set a trap in Rome for Dom and his family. What seems like a routine mission turns out to be a setup in which Dom and his crew are going to take the fall for blowing up the Vatican. Dom prevents the bomb from hitting its target, but it still explodes in Rome and Dom and his crew are now international fugitives. Making matters more complicated, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is captured and taken to a black site in Antarctica. Making matters more complicated than that, the new head of the agency Mr. Nobody runs, Aimes (Alan Ritchson), has severed all ties with Dom and instructs his agency to find them and bring them to justice. Dom’s only friend left in the agency is Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of Mr. Nobody, who finds Dom and agrees to help him free Letty and clear everyone’s name. (Good gravy there are so many characters in this movie. I have seen every single one of the Fast movies and I had trouble remembering who was related to whom. We get some deep-cut characters returning so, yes, be ready.) One of the biggest problems with Fast X is it feels like Fast 9 just came out. If you recall, it was finished before the pandemic, but delayed until theaters were consistently open again. (I remember being at the 2020 Super Bowl in Miami and Fast 9 had a big presence there promoting the movie. It wouldn’t actually come out until June of 2021.) But the thing about Fast 9, it did kind of feel like the first big movie to be released after the pandemic started. I couldn’t help but enjoy myself. Now it’s less than two years later and here we are again. These movies are like eating a very rich dessert. They kind of need to be properly spaced out or you start not feeling too great.  We were once promised this would be the last movie of the franchise. then it got split in two and we were then promised the next one will be last. Now Vin Diesel seems to be trying to will this into a three-part ending. And he’ll probably succeed. Honestly, I’d be surprised if it even ends there. We will probably get five more last Fast movies. Why even keep up the charade that these are ending? Let’s just all admit these will never end. ",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023"," You have to admire Fast Ten‘s stubbornness to entertain. However, the Fast franchise has turned into daytime soap operas for millennial and Gen-Z males because simply nothing is off-limits regarding the pure lunacy of its storytelling. The Fast & Furious franchise returns with Fast Ten and has evolved into a soap opera catering to millennials and Gen-Z males. The enduring saga of Dominic Toretto and his friends has spanned over twenty years, and some of the twists and turns resemble those found in classic daytime soap operas like The Young and the Restless. Regarding the plot of these films, virtually nothing is off-limits. At the very least, you can be assured that you’ll get your money’s worth, even if the story is pure lunacy. Vin Diesel picks up his wrench one more time as Dominic Toretto, and his gang of “family is what you make it” return for Fast Ten, a film that ignores the conventional rules of cinematic storytelling and does whatever the hell it wants because it can. After barely escaping certain death from Dante Reyes (a hyperbolic turn by Jason Momoa), the vengeful son of the former Portuguese kingpin killed years ago during Fast Five, Cipher warns Dom that he is coming for him and his family. The entire gang heads to Rome, where Dante sets them up as terrorists who try and blow up the Vatican. This puts the entire team, again, on the run. I’m pretty sure there’s no need for us to delve into many more details about the plot of Fast Ten because it hardly matters. The filmmakers tailored the film to satisfy the masses’ craving for bombastic cinema. A lot has been said about the newest additions to the Fast & Furious franchise. However, while Momoa’s portrayal of Dante can be entertaining, his performance comes across as comical. I would compare it to an even more cartoonish version of the Joker without makeup. Momoa’s character exaggerations occur at every turn, and it can be just as distracting as the action in the film. Brie Larson enters the scene as Mr. Nobody’s daughter, but her portrayal feels lackluster. She appears to sleepwalk through the role, presenting her character as a carefree valley girl who seems out of place in the franchise. However, Alan Ritchson is a perfect fit for the Fast Saga. He brings a brooding presence, and his punch is something that even Luke Hobbs would be envious of. The Fast franchise has turned into sci-fi film lunacy and is practically superhero fare. The constant faceless enemies resemble tricked-out camouflage super troopers. There’s an unmistakable sound during a car chase that sounds just like a TIE fighter. Even then, what I will say is what works is you care about these characters. That’s the difference here between this franchise and, say, Michael Bay’s latest Transformers films, which is no small feat in Hollywood over a twenty-year run. Fast Ten is bad, but it never fails to try and at least entertain its audience. The action sequences, fight scenes, and redundant head-scratching returns of characters are overdone to the point of exhaustion. That includes Momoa’s much-heralded villainous turn. Fast Ten is worth watching if you’re a fan of the franchise. Let me remind newcomers, these movies began with some knuckleheads trying to steal now obsolete electronic appliances to being well-trained assassins who are experts in martial arts, computer science, and space travel, proving you can do anything you put your mind to.

"May 23, 2023"," Con “Rápidos y Furiosos X”, la franquicia ya ha abandonado cualquier parecido a la realidad. Sí, sí, sé que en la anterior entrega fueron al espacio en un carro (¡!), y que personajes como el Dominic Toretto de Vin Diesel han estado realizando actos de proeza sobrehumana desde, aproximadamente, la sexta película. Pero no me equivoco al decir que “Rápidos y Furiosos X” es la primera de estas cintas en sentirse, al 100% y sin lugar a dudas, como un episodio de los “Looney Tunes”. Estos personajes no tienen ningún interés en seguir las leyes de la física o la gravedad; no creen en la muerte, y ciertamente no le tienen miedo al ridículo. Los actors lo saben, los guionistas ciertamente lo saben, y el director Louis Leterrier (“El increíble Hulk”) parece saberlo hasta cierto punto. Lo cual está muy bien, porque es imposible tomarse a una película como “Rápidos y Furiosos X” en serio. Ni siquiera los momentos de supuesta emotividad franca funcionan —generalmente porque le siguen a algunas de las escenas más ridículas que se hayan proyectado en un ecran de cine, pero más que nada porque se sienten vacías. Después de todo, ¿por qué habríamos de preocuparnos por Toretto y su Familia (™), si es que muchos de estos personajes mueren y reviven con el relajo de un Saiyajín de “Dragon Ball Z”? ¿Y por qué debería importarnos que alguno de estos protagonistas esté en peligro, si sabemos que la saga recién concluirá dentro de una (o quizás dos) películas? ¿Y encima, por qué habríamos de ponernos tensos, si los hemos visto sobrevivir situaciones cada vez más absurdas y exageradas e imposibles? No hace falta decir, entonces, que “Rápidos y Furiosos X” es una película de acción carente de tensión. Mucho pasa en el filme —muchísimo—, pero muy poco de lo que se ve en pantalla será capaz de emocionar al espectador. Lo que sí hará, en todo caso —y pasó conmigo— es hacerlos morir de risa por los actos de inmensa ridiculez que Toretto y los demás realizan. Consideren, si no, que esta gente es capaz de jugar al “fulbito” con una bomba gigante, utilizando únicamente sus carros; que pueden empujar grúas con dichos vehículos para lanzar dicha bomba; que pueden manejar por una represa mientras huyen de una explosión, o que pueden ser lanzados en un vehículo desde un avión, para caer encima de OTROS vehículos, saliendo sin un solo rasguño. Toretto es más fuerte y valiente que Superman (resulta alucinante verlo levantar un carro con UNA SOLA MANO). El Tej de Ludacris ahora sabe pelear. El hijo de Toretto mata gente con un cañón y se muere de la risa. Scott Eastwood sale durante cinco minutos, se cae de una camioneta, y nunca más vuelve a aparecer. Y la película cuenta con CUATRO ganadoras del Óscar, cada una con menos qué hacer que la otra. ¿De qué va esta nueva entrega, entonces? Como buena telenovela (porque no se equivoquen; la saga de “Rápidos y Furiosos” es en realidad una telenovela con carros, explosiones y bíceps), comienza con un “retcon” de eventos pasados, con “flashback” y todo. En este caso, se trata del clímax de la quinta película, en donde se nos revela que el hijo de Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida; un actor portugués haciendo de brasileño), Dante (Jason Momoa; un hawaiano haciendo del hijo de un brasileño interpretado por un portugués) estuvo presente cuando Toretto (Diesel) y Hobbs (La Roca) acabaron con su padre. Empeñado en vengarse, el psicopático terrorista se pasó los últimos diez años estudiando a nuestro protagonista, seguro de que eventualmente podría hacerlo sufrir. Y como se deben imaginar, el momento de hacerlo sufrir ha llegado. Es así que Toretto se termina separando de su Familia (™), obsesionado con encontrar a Dante, luego de que engaña a sus amigos, causando toda suerte de destrucción durante una persecución en las calles de Roma (la cual involucra a la bomba mencionada líneas arriba). Por su parte, Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) y Han (Sung Kang) escapan de las autoridades, acusados de haber destruido buena parte de la capital italiana. Jakob (John Cena), hermano de Dom, se lleva a su hijo pequeño a un lugar seguro, y Letty (Michelle Rodríguez) se ve obligada a formar una pseudo-alianza con Cipher (Charlize Theron) para escapar de las garras de la Agencia, ahora liderada por Aimes (Alan Ritchson), quien no parece estar del lado de Dominic. ¿Saben qué? Hay demasiada gente en “Rápidos y Furiosos X”. Se trata de un reparto innegablemente impresionante, el cual lamentablemente convierte a la película en un producto entretenido, alocado pero ciertamente inflado. Porque tampoco he mencionado los cameos (y no se preocupen, tampoco lo haré), ni los giros narrativos telenovelezcos, ni las diez mil locaciones (Roma, Londres, Rio de Janeiro, la Antártida… ¡uf!), ni las veinte mil explosiones. En pocas palabras: “Rápidos y Furiosos X” es MUCHA película, tanto así que se puede argumentar que favorece la cantidad sobre la calidad. Más personajes, más estrellas de Hollywood, más peleas, más explosiones, más efectos digitales, más “flashbacks”, más acciones que desafían las leyes de la física… ¡más todo! Pero como seguramente ya saben, a veces, más es menos, y en este caso, dicho refrán se cumple hasta cierto punto. Lo cual, por supuesto, no quiere decir que la película carezca de valor. No, no es emocionante en lo más mínimo, pero debo admitir que la vi sonriendo prácticamente de inicio a fin. Sonriendo porque Leterrier y compañía parecen haberse dado cuenta (¡por fin!) de lo ridícula que es esta saga, y sonriendo gracias a ciertas escenas increíblemente absurdas y exageradas. Lo que antes era parodiado en otras producciones, ahora es mencionado en el texto (no el subtexto) en “Rápidos y Furiosos X”: el concepto de Familia (™) —deben decir la palabra unas cuatrocientas veces—, las parrilladas, las cervezas Corona, la destrucción, el hecho de que comenzaron robando camiones y ahora son superespías secretos… o les vacila esto, o les molesta. No hay intermedio. No hay marcha atrás. Nuevamente: es “Looney Tunes”, y lo saben. Hasta logran incluir una carrera callejera, por más forzado que se sienta (con planos gratuitos de traseros y todo). Porque esto es “Rápidos y Furiosos X”. ¡TIENEN que haber carreras y traseros! Lamentablemente, nada de eso puede compensar el hecho de que “Rápidos y Furiosos X” se siente tremendamente inflada. El presupuesto de más de trescientos millones de dólares (¡!) se nota a leguas, tanto por los efectos visuales constantes (pero irregulares), como por la presencia permanente de actores que no deben ser nada baratos de contratar. Súmenle a eso los dramas de producción (te extrañaremos, Justin Lin), y no hay forma de percibir a “Rápidos y Furiosos X” como algo menos que un “blockbuster” enorme, excesivo, que lo deja absolutamente TODO en la cancha (¿o en la pista?), y hasta un poco más. El problema es que queda una película más (o quizás dos), y que esta no termina. Simplemente… se detiene. No llega a la meta; se le acaba la gasolina (y el N.O.S.) en medio camino, y habrá que esperar dos años más para ver si es que logra seguir avanzando. Gracias a dios, entonces, por Jason Momoa. Mientras que Vin Diesel parece haber dejado sus energías en otra parte, y los demás actores intentar mantenerse relevantes en una película con más gente que muchos países pequeños, Momoa la pasa de lo lindo. Su Dante Reyes es una suerte de Guasón de Heath Ledger mezclado con el Acertijo de Jim Carrey: puro carisma y energía maníaca y uñas pintadas y frases en otros idiomas y mucha pero mucha locura. Funciona, y se nota a leguas que el popular actor la pasó muy bien rodando la película. Sí, es absurdo que sus planes sean tan perfectos y que siempre esté como veinte pasos adelante de Toretto, pero nada de eso importa cuando Momoa se convierte en el villano más memorable de la saga. ¿Se convertirá eventualmente en parte de la Familia (™)? Lo dudo mucho, pero cosas más raras han pasado en la Saga “Rápida” (si no pregúntenle al Shaw de Statham, al Jakob de Cena, o hasta al Hobbs de La Roca). El resto de los actores, como se dio a entender antes, hacen lo que pueden con el material. Hasta ahora no entiendo qué hace Charlize Theron acá, por ejemplo, pero al menos logra involucrarse en una intensa pelea con Michelle Rodríguez. El Roman de Tyrese sigue siendo la fuente principal de comedia; Tej y Ramsey están acá para “hackear” computadoras y tipear como si no hubiese un mañana; el Jakob de John Cena ha sufrido un cambio de personalidad inexplicable; Sung Kang reacciona mucho pero hace poco; y los personajes nuevos interpretados por Brie Larson y Daniela Melchior (esta última, dicho sea de paso, TAMBIÉN está relacionada a un personaje de las películas anteriores; ¡porque no podía ser de otra manera!) están increíblemente desperdiciados. Asumo que tendrán más que hacer en la onceava (dios mío…) cinta. “Rápidos y Furiosos X” es lo que es. Si han estado siguiendo la franquicia, sabrán exactamente qué esperar del filme (especialmente considerando todo lo que pasó en la entrega anterior). A Vin Diesel no se le entiende nada; Michelle Rodríguez sigue viéndose igual de enfadada que siempre; los carros son rápidos (sí, sí, y furiosos también) y capaces de realizar toda suerte de actos incomprensibles, y hay más explosiones por minuto que en una fiesta promedio de Michael Bay. Nada de esto estaría mal si la película tuviese una duración lógica, pero al durar casi dos horas y media, francamente es… cansador. Pero hey, al menos tenemos a Jason Momoa como un villano extravagante y memorable, quien logra mejorar la experiencia gracias a su carisma y la pura locura de su interpretación. En pocas palabras: “Rápidos y Furiosos X” hace MUCHÍSIMO, tanto así que no tengo idea de qué podrían hacer en la siguiente entrega. Pero me imagino que ese es, al final del día, el punto, ¿no?

"May 23, 2023"," Hollywood does not know when — or even how — to pump the brakes when audiences ask for more. The people demand bigger, faster, stronger sequels (which doesn’t always mean “better”), and a studio’s job is to make money, not to protect the integrity of a franchise. However, few franchises exemplify the grotesque extremes of a studio’s obsession with its bottom line than the Fast and the Furious films, which started from humble beginnings and have since transformed into CG-driven monstrosities. Fast X marks the tenth installment of this franchise — because an “X” is way cooler and more mysterious than a “10” — and the Vin Diesel vehicle spins so wildly out of control that it comes close to doing a full U-turn from preposterously bad to preposterously entertaining. But this star-studded sequel doesn’t quite get there, as its bloated story and outlandish effects overheat the engine well before the finish line. Diesel reprises his role as Dominic Toretto, an ex-con turned government helper turned family man. Michelle Rodriguez returns as his badass wife, Letty, while Rita Moreno makes a brief appearance as Abuela Toretto, continuing her late-career renaissance. Dom’s all-important family includes his loyal crewmembers, including Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), as well as begrudging collaborators such as his own brother, Jakob (John Cena) and former villain Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Oscar winner Charlize Theron also returns as Cipher, one of Dom’s principal antagonists, though she waves a white flag here, as the two of them share an enemy — Dante Reyes, the son of the drug lord Dom & Co. ousted back in Fast Five. Jason Momoa plays Dante, and he represents an exciting, high-octane addition to the cast. Though the ensemble is certainly impressive, its sheer size is one of many “over the top” problems that plague Fast X, which simply runs out of enough road to service all these characters. The script by longtime franchise director Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau is purportedly focused on Dom’s attempts to stop Dante’s quest for revenge and Cipher’s bid for world domination, but the story quickly devolves into a series of vignettes showcasing the star power of these various A-listers at the expense of any real cohesion, or even continuity. Together with director Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me), the writers also include a series of throwback references to prior Fast films, curiously believing that the franchise’s fans come for the story rather than the eye-popping VFX. Of course, Fast X delivers in droves in the action department, with an extended car racing sequence in the streets and hills of Rio de Janeiro a bright spot amidst the chaos of the film’s many excesses. There is, in fact, something cool and slick about Bryan Tyler‘s latest score for the franchise, offering a combination of electric sounds and heavy bass that blend perfectly with revving engines and squealing tires. Stephen Windon‘s cinematography is also in fine form here, as he takes advantage of the film setting by showcasing the appealing panoramas of the Brazilian coastline. On the other hand, Fast X‘s 140-minute runtime is completely excessive, though excess is all but the hallmark of this franchise. Remember when the previous film, F9, decided to abandon all pretense of restraint — even for an action movie — by sending its characters into space in a car? Yeah, after that, all bets were off. Fast X and its eye-rolling exaggerations demonstrate why self-control is important, even in a franchise known for its over-the-top indulgence. Much like a superhero movie in which perpetual invincibility lowers the stakes, the Fast and the Furious filmmakers — after the horrific death of series star Paul Walker — became beholden to fan demands that characters stay well past their welcome. The resulting need for each of them to one-up the other — both the characters and the movies themselves — has made these films too much to bear. Pushing the envelope is one thing, but pushing it off a cliff — and still surviving, naturally — is another entirely. And when it becomes clear that Fast X is but the opening chapter of a planned trilogy — the supposed conclusion to these stories — then the wheels really do come off. Finally, it does not help that some of Fast X’s stars seem to be phoning it in, and have been doing so for at least a few sequels. Moreno shines, of course, lending her characteristic enthusiasm and lovable wit to the sequel, while Momoa’s performance is a breath of fresh air, as he’s relishing the chance to play ever so slightly against type. But the others — particularly Diesel, Rodriguez, and Theron — are clearly over it, as all three play their characters in a morose, forlorn fashion that begs the question of why audiences should care when the stars themselves do not. Of course, this franchise has become review-proof, so its devoted fanbase will prevent Fast X from crashing and burning at the box office, and Universal will take an inevitable victory lap as it dreams up ways for the Fast X sequel to top its bonkers predecessor. But the studio would benefit from making a pit stop to give this badly-damaged vehicle a tune-up, one that hopefully injects some small degree of sanity into the franchise, which might give it a slightly broader appeal while preserving the original core idea behind these increasingly silly movies.",NEUTRAL
"May 23, 2023"," ★★★☆☆Are you afraid of the new Ari Aster film? You should be, because the American director is the sick genius behind Hereditary and Midsommar, two of the most genuinely disturbing horror movies of recent years. Watching both of those films, I felt gripped by an overwhelming desire to unwatch them before they could do any real psychological damage. The new film is called Beau Is Afraid, which sounds like a children’s colouring book — somewhat appropriate, because the film resembles a prolonged therapy session for Aster. It’s also three hours long. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",NEUTRAL
"May 22, 2023"," If there’s one thing that the Fast and Furious movies have sorely missed in nearly all nine films, it’s a good heel. Now, they’ve always had villains, and the names have gotten bigger and bigger — once The Rock, Luke Evans, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and John Cena come into the picture, you’re gonna have some memorable conflicts — but most of them either wind up becoming a part of the extended Toretto family (one can imagine Statham showing up with a large can of Heinz beans at one of the Sunday barbecues) or are cut from the same kind of serious cloth. You know, they’re badasses with a single-minded focus on avenging whatever slight that the Family has done to them, with the occasional additional plot to get rich or take over the world tossed in there for good measure. There’s something quite appealing about the redemptive qualities of the Fast franchise — one is, after all, a Vin Diesel ass-kicking away from enlightenment — but it can get a little predictable (shocking, I know, for one of these movies) in their wrestling-style face turns. Much like in WWE or AEW, the thrills lie in the construction of the action, the personas involved in the stable (is it any wonder that some of its most memorable stars have emerged from that world with its muscled charisma and wit?) and the perpetual escalation of the stakes, with title shots and challengers and grander stages for the heroes to take. But they’ve sorely missed a true-blue honest-to-Christ charismatic asshole, styling and profiling all over a motherfucker, ranting about how they’ve spent more on spilt liquor in bars around the world than our heroes have made in a year or approaching the outer limits of madness in a kilt trying to beat Hulk Hogan. Louis Leterrier’s Fast X finally brings to this to the table in the form of Dante Cortes (Jason Momoa), the son of the corrupt crime lord the Family took down in Fast Five, who’s got a bone to pick with Dom (Diesel) and everyone else who ruined his chances at taking over his papa’s Rio operation. This, on paper, sounds pretty annoying — it’s a significant retcon (who knew Hernan Cortes had a crazy kid in one of those chaingun-mounted SUVs), and, in practice, Dante’s gifts for planning and brand of knife-licking madness are reminiscent of one of the worst trends in blockbuster filmmaking over the last decade: Making every baddie into Chris Nolan’s Joker, whether it’s deserved or not. But here’s the rub: Momoa is one of the few of these antagonists who actually understands what he’s doing. The unpredictable-yet-omniscient psychopath is inherently a campy figure, which is what made Heath Ledger so memorable in that role, given how heavily he contrasted with Nolan’s serious tone — his flippant theatrics, given the self-righteous nature of the hero’s dedication to preserving order, act as a perfect antithesis to his values even as he reflects them. Dante acts similarly for the Fast franchise: A small-time crook who suddenly has global-level connections and the means to realize his goals while also being a goofy parody of Dom himself. Visually, they’re a set of perfect contrasts: Momoa exaggerates his toned belly into a gut, his style is gaudy and outrageous with his flowing colorful clothes, and, of course, he’s hairy as fuck. He’s defined by “family” even as he works to undermine Dom’s. Most importantly, however, he’s a giant bird-flip to the undeniably masculine sensibilities of the series, even if he embodies them in form, being the towering, ripped dude that he is: He paints his victims’ toenails as he rants on about how pastels are in season, hair done up into twin buns, clad in a pink bathrobe. It’s a tonal contrast that no other Fast and Furious film has even approached — an antagonist who outright refuses to participate in the earnest faux-seriousness that is directly aimed at the frontal cortex of every eleven-year-old and eleven-year-old-at-heart that makes up the audiences of these movies. If campy escalation is the name of the game in Fast X, he raises the stakes in ways that are difficult to quantify. His presence has an even greater ripple effect on the film, adding to its pleasures. This takes on a number of forms, some tonal, some practical. The former is best demonstrated by the film’s action sequences, which, in recent years, have always tended towards sating the desires for the Twitter crowd — if you want to see the Family go to space, all you have to do is tweet about it loudly for long enough and Luda and Tyrese will soon be linking up with the ISS thanks to SpaceX — but they’re also left with fewer places to go. In keeping with the ethos here beyond Momoa’s presence — the film is a tribute to Fast Five, one of the GOATed modern blockbusters — a lot of the key setpieces are variations on Justin Lin’s action sequences but with an additional goofy twist. If you don’t remember the bank heist from that film, where Dom and the gang turned an uncrackable vault into a rolling flail-on-wheels, you’ll be reminded of it here before you see Leterrier’s twist on it. This one involves a giant metal sphere containing a nuclear bomb rolling through the streets of Rome, with Dom in a Dodge Charger going out of his way to save pedestrians, diners at outdoor cafes, nuns, and dog walkers from the ball’s path. The small details of the heroism and Dom’s frustration recall one of the most infamously funny moments in campy action — some days you really can’t just get rid of a bomb, as Adam West figured out in Batman ‘66 — albeit with a Rocket League twist (to the point that I almost imagined spamming the “Nice Shot” react when the sequence reached its climax). That sensibility is preserved all the way until the film’s ending, the subject of which we’ll return to in a minute. That latter attribute — the goofy sentimentality — is probably best represented by Cena’s storyline. Taking a cue from the best parts of Fate (where the Shaw brothers are forced to become child-minders in the middle of a high-stakes mission), when the crew is split up across the world, and all of those that they care about are placed in danger, someone, inevitably, must act as a babysitter for Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), Dom’s kid, and who better than his own half-brother, Jacob? The pair go on a roadtrip in the uncle’s 5-0 ‘Stang, blasting “Good Vibrations” out of the tape deck, and singing along in a way that would make Don Jon proud, before doing some James Bond shit out of the back of a commercial airline in a vodka-powered glider. This sort of contrivance would sink a large number of similar storylines in films more committed to their own seriousness.  Still, Cena’s goofy earnestness and his character’s lack of adult pretension make it sing. What’s more is that it’s wish fulfillment for both sides of the aisle in the average multiplex audience — the kids get to imagine having an uncle as cool as Cena, and the adults get to imagine having a relationship with a kid — a son, a daughter, a nephew or niece — as idyllic as the one glimpsed here, all while getting them to unconsciously reflect on those relationships that do exist and matter in their lives outside of that chilled recliner chair. The Fast movies, once their transition to the heights of ridiculousness began back in 2009, have always had that accidental profundity but have accumulated it (for a good reason) in abundance since Furious 7. It’s important to remember that Fast X is part one of a two-part finale for the series, with the requisite cliffhanger included — it’s amusing that, in the aftermath of ongoing Hollywood serialization (at this point, I will remind you to stay for the mid-credits sequence, which got a Royal Rumble-like pop from the audience at the screening I went to) some members of the press and audience are just discovering how necessary that numerical subtitle is. As much as I make fun of unpronounceable multi-hyphenate monikers like Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, it seems it really is necessary to avoid disappointment. Yet even this is in the service of maintaining that Batman-like tone, where one almost expects a series of freeze-frames and gaudy narration to inform us of all the unanswered questions left hanging in the balance.  I will admit to not having much hope for Leterrier’s involvement in the wake of Lin’s mid-filming departure (another victim of Diesel’s attempts to assert creative control over his baby, it seems), but he does enough of a solid job maintaining continuity of Lin’s original vision. It’s still a bloated mess, of course, but that’s the name of the game with this series, and to expect them to suddenly stop being overly complex and absurdly long at this late in the game is like expecting Diesel and company to give up the Hemis and barbecues in favor of fixed-gear bicycles and tofu stir-fries. What Fast X embodies is the often-goofy amiability of the American blockbuster, and the innate charm that still gives it global appeal without the requisite amount of compromises that may assume it may need in our world-spanning modern cinema. And all it took to remind us of all that was a Ric Flair type. Woo, indeed.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2023"," At the end of F9, 2021’s entry in the Fast and Furious, the most common question — after watching two street racers from the hood fly a car into space — was, “where do we go from here?” It’s something of a recurring question with the franchise — each entry works to up the already ridiculous ante set by the previous one. Surely at some point, they either need to fight robot dinosaur-riding zombie Taylor Swift clones in the Phantom Zone or something, right? We can’t possibly get more preposterous than that, right? … right? The answer, according to the Louis Leterrier-directed Fast X, is to continue to ramp things up in terms of speed, explosions, and gravelly proclamations about family, but to also be something of a return to the series’ roots. Fast X brings (almost) everyone back home, to that L.A. good life of Coronas and barbeques, although now with the strangely brief addition of Rita Moreno as the matriarch of the Toretto siblings. Things quickly go haywire as they learn that they’ve been drawn into a wildly overly complicated plot put into motion by Dante Reyes (an absolutely and gloriously unhinged Jason Momoa), the psychopathic son of Herman Reyes — yep, the one who died in 2011’s Fast Five.  Reyes wants to torture Dom by taking his friends and family from him via a series of increasingly insane scenarios, from bombs rolling toward the Vatican to kidnapping to framing the team for terrorism to good old fashion street racing (with a touch of murder thrown in). Somehow, through all that lunacy, we’re also visited by old friends and enemies, including Cypher (Charlize Theron), Queenie (Helen Mirren) and her son Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), and of course newfound brother Jakob Toretto (John Cena). It’s predictably insane, if such a thing is possible, while also working hard to remind us of all the things that brought us to this point, almost like a pastiche of homages to the prior films. We revisit the bridge in Rio, cars driving out of planes, through explosions, and jumping across bridges. The line between homage and simply reusing assets and ideas gets very blurry, very quickly, but it all happens so fast that it’s hard to even realize it in the moment. Yet despite those reminders of feats of past derring-do, there’s still a good bit of fresh content here, enough to keep things from getting too repetitive. Director Leterrier and writers Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin (who has directed five of the previous entries) know their audience well enough to know that if the cars are quips are coming at an equal pace, they can continue to wallpaper their houses with money. There are some fresh faces too, and they serve the franchise well. Momoa is absolutely wild, a garishly dressed lunatic who is surprisingly funny in addition to being completely deranged. Yes, the character suffers from that irritating trend where he is seemingly omniscient, but it’s done with such goofy panache that all is ultimately forgiven. Throw in a quirky-yet-deadly Brie Larson as Tess, a government agent who wants to help the team and Alan Ritchson as Almes, the brutish new head of The Agency who wants to hunt them, and you’ve got quite a crowd. Unfortunately, it’s almost too crowded, since we still must make room for series regulars Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Mia (Jordana Brewster), and of course the resurrected Han (Sung Kang). Even with the film’s 141-minute runtime, it’s hard to give everyone a fair shake (which is probably why for much of the film the team is splintered and spread out across the globe).  Yet as always, everyone seems fully committed to the madness, and that’s half the fun. Fast X is unquestionably fun, even when it’s at its most unbelievable. With each passing sequence, you find yourself somewhere between rolling your eyes and grinning, knowing how preposterous it is and yet forgiving it anyway, like a dog who pees on the floor but is just so damn cute. How can we get mad at Vin Diesel’s increasingly exhausting and — frankly, increasingly stupid — rumblings about family when there are so many shiny things exploding and pretty people making us laugh? You can’t. You just clean up the mess and keep playing. That’s all the Fast and Furious franchise wants, anyway - to make a mess and keep you happy. Fast X is no exception.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2023"," F9: The Fast Saga went soo over-the-top with its bizarre action sequences and the “family” that it became overwhelming. Taking a car to outer space is lousy writing despite an interesting redemption story for the antagonist. Everything was made stupider by how it was choreographed and put together with VFX. So, I went in with a similar notion for Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier. But I admit, I really liked what writers Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau offered, and I was glad to be proven wrong. The Fast & Furious franchise does NOT suddenly shift gears in its tenth main installment. In fact, there is more over-cranked action and illogically advanced technological jargon. Jumping a car off an airplane? Check. Coming out of a seemingly deadly collision alive? Present. Non-sensical mechanical upgrades to vehicles and the non-evolving self-referential drama? Everything that has made this franchise stagnant is here. Amusingly, there’s a self-referential dig at the franchise, “God and gravity-defying” action and stunts when Aimes (Alan Ricthson) irritably declares his unpleasantness towards the “family.” “…a highway chase and car stunt Dom and company pulled ten years ago had unintended consequences. Now, Dante tracks, tricks, frames, and captures all involved.” Fast X also tries to let viewers into an interlinked storyline that intends to conclude the mega-hit franchise with a bang. And that effort makes the tenth film an upgrade compared to its last two installments. There are callbacks to the past, appearances from old faces, and a new attempt to spread out the cast and their respective place. This contrasts with other films, which deliberately congest everybody in one frame. These additional elements in the otherwise familiar theme allow one to sit through the goofiness and enjoy the adrenaline-pumped action beats. We begin with a decade-old flashback from Fast Five. A new character, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), is featured, and we are taken through a crash course of the film’s setup. Paul Walker’s archival footage sends one back in time. It turns out that a highway chase and car stunt Dom and company pulled ten years ago had unintended consequences. Now, Dante tracks, tricks, frames, and captures all involved. Are Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Han (Sung Kang), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and the other family members finally in over their heads? Or can they band together and save the day once again? The film juggles its colossal familial motifs and preachings for quite a while. But then, in an unusual twist, the narrative invites Dante into Dom’s world. Though appearing in the opening prologue, it’s not until this moment he shows off his sociopathically cunning and maddening nature on-screen. He shows up wearing unusual yet attractive colors, acting hysterically manic, and being right-out destructive. This amplifies the ever-enlarging scale of damage, explosions, and collisions. It's finally here. The last good Marvel movie that we're gonna get for a very long time. James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is almost the... If you want a perfect example of a franchise that continues to live past its prime, look no further than the latest Fast & the Furious movie, Fast 9:...

"May 22, 2023"," Where else can this franchise possibly go? After two decades of endless freeways, detours, crashes, and the most ridiculous character evolutions ever put on screen, the “Fast and Furious” franchise is now just going in circles. To be sure, “Fast X,” reportedly the third to last in the series, still blows up plenty of vehicles and has a lot of fun inventing the kind of stunts no one could possibly pull off in the real world. Fans might just be delighted once more. But this one truly has the feel of if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. At this point, the casual viewer could be intrigued by watching top dollar stars consciously being ridiculous, as if letting loose after being in heavier projects. Jason Momoa certainly looks like he’s having a good time as the latest villain targeting our fast-driving “family.” Momoa is Dante (of course he is), the son of underworld figure, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who was killed a decade ago, way back in “Fast Five.” If you didn’t have time to catch up on that entry, the movie opens with a recap of the famous heist scene set in Brazil, where a safe is stolen and dragged across a freeway. Dante nearly dying when splashing into the ocean is an added detail. Fast forward to today and crew leader Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is back to living in Los Angeles with his young son and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The rest of the crew including Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) are off to Rome to snatch some valuable computer chips. But when old enemy Cipher (Charlize Theron) appears bloodied on Dominic’s doorstep, he learns the latest heist is a trap set by the vengeful Dante, who wants to burn down everything dear to the man he blames for his father’s demise.  If the plotting sounds familiar that’s because director Louis Leterrier and writers Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin are now borrowing from countless sources while concocting what is supposedly the final, big adventure of Dominic and crew. While the last entry, “F9: The Fast Saga” was silly popcorn fun that managed to finally get the characters into space, this one more openly takes from plotlines familiar in comic book movies. Momoa’s flamboyant Dante is a cackling, nearly childish douchebag that feels like a cross between Jared Leto’s Joker from “Suicide Squad” and Javier Bardem’s vengeful terrorist in “Skyfall.” He nearly skips around with glee at the carnage he unleashes, makes inappropriate jokes and sticks his tongue out during chases. At the same time, his mission is all about avenging dad, who by now we almost forgot after all the subsequent movies.  While Dante’s drive makes sense in terms of some basic logic, the rest of the movie is pure celebration of how absurd you can get when the sole purpose of your franchise is to make fast objects explode. The dialogue isn’t even trying this time with lines like, “I saw the devil tonight.” Absolutely nothing about this movie can be believed, which is the usual case with a “Fast and Furious” movie, except the big stunts are barely trying. The gang chases a big bomb bouncing towards the Vatican. Dominic can outdrive a shockwave. Charlize Theron beats up a whole room of backstabbing henchmen and Jason Momoa always has a helicopter on standby. Everyone is a tech wizard who can figure out that Dante has hacked the crew’s accounts, thus channeling the money into his gadgets to create chaos. Somehow the military, FBI or any actual governments never get involved because the only agency referenced is the “Agency” Dominic and team work for since “Fast Five.” To be sure there are a few guilty pleasures. Dominic and Dante stare each other down in Brazil amid a crowd of racers before reggaeton music kicks in and they get in their big, shiny sports cars to burn rubber. Why this happens amid such high stakes and destruction is up to us to ponder. Everyone in the family become wanted terrorists after the villain frames them for the Rome bomb, so someone like Letty finds herself imprisoned in one of those mythical, ultra-secret black sites where prisoners receive futuristic healthcare after a stabbing. Pete Davidson makes a hilarious cameo as a vintage internet café worker in Italy and fans will surely cheer two surprise returns right before the end credits. John Cena also returns as Dominic’s long lost brother from the last movie, Jakob, no longer an adversary but a ripped uncle who vows to keep his brother’s family safe until needed to crash a few more big cars. To its credit, the movie does have some funny self-awareness in scenes where Agency operative Aimes (Alan Ritchson) declares with a straight face how our heroes are all about barbecues and get-togethers, when not saving the world. “Fast X” isn’t a “good” movie, but how much one gets into it will probably depend on devotion to the franchise and tolerance of disbelief. We know that it’s impossible for Dante to choreograph an airplane being shot down by a surprise villain, helicopter strikes and two trucks appearing at the exact right moment to cage in Dominic as he drives over a dam. Because of the high budget and skilled filmmakers involved, it all looks well-made. As hard as good taste sensors resist, it’s always absurdly exciting when Vin Diesel digitally speeds down some impossibly high structure as flames and debris follow behind. Yet everyone senses there are few turns left, so “Fast X” goes for the series’ own version of “Avengers: Infinity War,” setting up a ludicrously big villain to threaten everything and ending with a scene that just needed “To Be Continued” announced after a big line.  The great flaw overall is that we’ve seen this franchise’s tricks so often now since the series really went big in the mid-2000s. The original 2001 movie by Rob Cohen still has charm because of its gritty, drive-in feel. “Fast X” announces a crossroads that is hard to move past. Reportedly there are still two movies left to go, which should finally end a saga that began when many audience members were in high school, and is acknowledging its peak when quite a few of them have kids who are at least freshmen by now. Like its predecessors, this entry has great talents, notable faces, top tier special effects and Vin Diesel’s growling stare. But the end of the line is becoming much more glaring as the tank truly starts running out of gas.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023"," The Fast and Furious franchise has expanded intensely over the course of its 11 films (and counting). Humble street racers who hijack DVD players have evolved into godlike superheroes who can leap vehicles from skyscrapers, cliffs, and planes without flinching. They walk away from car crashes and explosions without injury or even smudging their furrowed brows. With each adventure, more crooks and cops are welcomed into their ""family."" Many of these are played by stars so big — or prestigious — that it's laughably astounding yet expected when Fast X has EGOT winner Rita Moreno swinging by to swig Corona and talk about — what else? — family.  Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his Fast and Furious crew have faced off against crime bosses, submarines, and astrophysics. In Fast 9, they launched a car into space. But the nature of these movies is to eternally top themselves. So how can you beat Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as DIY astronauts? You cast Jason Momoa as the latest Fast foe and let him go absolutely wild with the flamboyant charisma we've seen more on red carpets than in his most popular roles.  Fast and Furious villains are often cut from a similar cloth of stoic and intimidating, like Charlize Theron's whispering cyber-terrorist Cipher (who returns in Fast X for fresh fights and biting barbs). But for every Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham), this franchise has a glowering antagonist or three lost in the haze of snarling threats. Clearly, Jason Momoa refuses to be forgotten. Where they zig, he zags, creating a foe that is fearsome, but more classic Disney villain than dastardly Dom doppelganger.  Dante doesn't play by Dom's rules. While the bald and bold hero will repeatedly risk his own life to save others, Dante will risk his life to wreak havoc and cause slaughter. Dante's differences extend past his principles (or lack thereof) into his sense of style. In one gloriously gonzo sequence of street racing and trash-talking, he meets the tank-topped Dom while wearing a lovely ensemble of a lavender silk shirt, bright purple palazzo pants, a kicky scarf tied around his wrist, and not only a matching manicure but also a matching muscle car in a shimmery lavender.  The appreciation for pastels and painted nails are references to Momoa's personal style, playing with the gender norms of how muscle-bound men — particularly in this film series — tend to present themselves. Within this, Momoa taps into a freedom of expression that sets him apart from Dom's circle of friends and foes.  Where they stride, he skips into action. They scowl or smirk. He beams with a cartoonishly broad grin, whether he's threatening the lives of children or the whole of the Vatican. Dom's crew favors a lot of bald heads, glistening in the sun and streetlights. Momoa not only brings his signature long locks to the role but also dons them in scunchied space-buns, while delivering a villain monologue and doing a deadly pedicure.  Fast and Furious films are adored not only for their eye-popping action sequences, but also for the mind-snapping plot twists that repeatedly involve unearthed secret family members, scorching grievances, and resurrections from the dead, no matter how conclusive one's demise. Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) may be new to this franchise, but F9 screenwriters Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, who has been a writer/director on the series since Tokyo Drift, and — along with newcomer Zach Dean — set him up with a story that is ripe with exactly the kind of revelations, retcons, and unhinged opportunities for stunts that have driven audiences mad for these movies for two decades and counting.  The action ranges from jarringly hard-hitting hand-to-hand combat to high-octane car chases to the kinds of vehicular derring-do and devastation that only the Fast movies can dream up. Sure, you've seen Dom drag a vault around like a giant's punishing fist. But what might he do with a pair of helicopters hooked to his ride?  These action sequences are so good that they put Marvel and its recent misfires to absolute shame. Who needs mutant baddies and space battles when you've got masterfully composed highway brawls, where every enemy or explosion is an opportunity for awesomeness?  It's not just Leterrier's skills at keeping action geography clean through precise coverage and editing. Fast X excels because the director understands the dizzying humor of these films, which treats its heroes as everymen and invincible demigods. There's blue-collar gruffness to their close-ups and one-liners. But a gleeful humor allows for space so the audience might cheer or guffaw at how the franchise mocks the very concept of physics, biology, or mortality. The Fast movies laugh in the face of death, and so too do we!  Sometimes, however, those laughs might not be what the filmmaker intends. Because as fans of this franchise know, no matter how dead a character might seem, there's always a chance for a return. (WE LOVE YOU, HAN!) So, certain scenes that should be harrowing land with a soft thud instead of a boom because we may well assume our sacrificing angel won't be gone for long. While the lows may not be all that low because of all this assumed invincibility, the highs are still exhilaratingly dizzying. Be prepared to laugh, scream, and cheer, because Fast X is absolutely stuffed with the plot twists, big stars, and bonkers action fans expect. Plus, thanks to Jason Momoa, the franchise has a new villain who is not only absolutely extra but also relishes in being deliciously evil.  There's an enchanting excitement in watching Momoa declare himself the devil, giggling over a wicked plan coming together, using ""you butthole!"" as an insult, or blowing raspberries at his flustered foes. This script sizzles with the kind of over-the-top action dialogue that made '80s movies so stupendously quotable and outlandish. Much of the cast — including newcomers Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson — make the most of them with steely confidence and snarling sharpness. (""Everyone becomes family. It's like a cult with cars!"") Yet Momoa takes his lines to the next level.  With his irreverence colliding with whimsy, Dante is a unique vision of nihilism, facing off against Dom's quest to build a family and a legacy that can withstand the evils of the world. He's so unlike those who've come before that he's refreshingly unpredictable. And freed from the stodgy machismo of Aquaman or Game of Thrones, Momoa's verve for this villainy taps into an exaltation of vengeance, primal and petty.  In short, this is what summer movies should be! It's spectacular! It's thrilling! And it's the kind of movie you can't wait to yammer about to your friends. Truly, I walked out of Fast X with a big Momoa smile on my face, so wide it hurt. I may go again this weekend.  Fast X opens in theaters May 19 and is available to rent and buy from June 9 in the U.S. on. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and other platforms.

"May 22, 2023"," In a plot development that has become increasingly commonplace within this juggernaut action series, Fast X revises the events of 2011’s Fast Five to reveal a formidable new villain in the shape of an aggressively flamboyant Jason Momoa. Justin Lin, the franchise’s de facto godfather, was originally slated to direct what would have been his sixth instalment, but retreats into a producer/screenwriter role, allowing seasoned action director Louis Leterrier to take the wheel for what is being touted as the first half of the franchise’s grand finale. Beyond that it is business as usual, as this unwieldy beast of a movie jet-sets around the world, destroying everything in its path, while ensuring sufficient screen time for each member of its bloated, star-studded cast. Momoa plays Dante “Enchanté” Reyes, vengeful son of Joaquim de Almeida’s Brazilian mobster, whom the gang robbed and killed way back in the seemingly more plausible and pedestrian days of the franchise. Introduced as the devil himself by previous victims, Dante secretly sends Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris) and various other members of Dom’s “cult of cars” on a bogus mission, only to frame them as terrorists for firing a giant bowling ball of a bomb careering towards The Vatican. Peacocking through the film in a resplendent plumage of billowing silk shirts, dazzling jewellery and ostentatious hair extensions, Dante marks a bold but most welcome gear change in a franchise that has been choking on its own stale stench of man sweat and motor oil for years. The only caveat is that he also insists on groping and leering at any female character within reach as though to reinforce his heterosexuality – at the insistence of timid studio execs, one suspects – in this fiercely masculine arena. Elsewhere, every new character, from Brie Larson’s “Little Miss Nobody”, to Daniela Melchior’s Brazilian street racer, is related to a previous or existing teammate. Even Don and Letty’s pint-sized son “Little B” (Leo Abelo Perry) is now a fully fledged member of the crew. True to form, more past adversaries, in the form of Charlize Theron’s Cypher and John Cena’s Jacob, have now allied themselves with the fast family. Seasoned viewers will take all of this unresolved suspense with a boulder-sized grain of salt, however, having witnessed so many characters outlive the impossible or inexplicably return from the grave to take any outcome even remotely seriously. But those same viewers, still in the front seat after 11 laps of high-octane hokum, will almost certainly be on board for one last ride.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2023"," Sustaining an idea for ten movies is quite a feat, even if the idea has been stretched, abandoned, and smooshed back together. Fast X bears little resemblance to 2001’s The Fast and the Furious, which followed LA street racers/DVD player thieves and the police officer tracking them down. The subsequent 9 movies have enmeshed the crew in the highest levels of international espionage and given them innumerable enemies to hunt them down. But, as every Fast & Furious movie has emphasized, it’s also given them an endless web of family. This time, the son of the drug kingpin they killed in Fast Five has gotten off his butt to exact brutal revenge, his ethos coming from the one lesson his father passed down: don’t settle for death when suffering is owed. So he separates the Fast Family from their government connections and goes after everyone they love, blah blah blah. Plot doesn’t matter. That’s about the only thing that’s held true from The Fast and the Furious to Fast X. This is plug and play stuff, an excuse for obscene car chases, friendly banter, and a lot of Vin Diesel furrowing his brow. So Fast X is a Mission: Impossible movie with less brains and more cars. Why not? What the legions of people showing up to these movies care about is what seems to sell all blockbusters nowadays: familiarity. Fast & Furious’ longevity may seem like an accident, but there’s a nimble and unique backbone to the franchise. Family was there from the beginning, as was honor, responsibility, religion, and yes, cars, all brought to you by its casually diverse cast and crew. Elements ebb and flow, but you can count on a loving family that probably has someone who looks like you settling in for some Coronas and a laugh when the madness dies down, a bit of comfort in an otherwise uncomfortable world. In the past I’ve labeled these movies as masculine camp. I think this holds true for Fast X, but it’s also become a reductive lens. Lovingly overblown masculinity is still there, but as the characters have aged their sense of self has stabilized and their need for peacocking waned. No one is jockeying for superiority anymore. They’re all just trying to protect what they’ve built, a shockingly mature understanding of human nature overall and the shifting pressure of masculinity specifically.  Like pretty much all camp, it’s easy for critics to miss what’s happening. The point never was and never will be smooth plotting, cohesion, or god forbid good taste. Such a rigid definition of a good film limits the art form, yet it’s a trap most of us (i.e. critics) fall into. Fast X has none of the markers of a traditionally good or meaningful film, but it’s still a good and meaningful film. Just look what they’ve done with their idea of masculinity. They’ve been expanding it for a while, introducing variants on the alpha male (or Hawksian woman-esque characters who function as men), but Jason Momoa’s Dante keeps them with the times and the themes. As Dom and crew have grown into security, Dante represents a villain equally as secure in who he is. If you’ve never grasped the distinction between gender and gender expression, you’ll feel it in Momoa’s jaunty ability to stand toe-to-toe with Diesel, but with more color on his nails. This is no mere rehashing of the queer-coded villain; this is what people are trying to get the masses to understand is masculinity. If this seems strange or even worse too thoughtful for Fast & Furious, remember that this is a film franchise about men and their emotional lives. We’re ten films into Dominic Toretto cobbling together a found family, a journey that’s allowed the series to show the kind of meaningful, platonic friendships, particularly between men, which get ignored by nearly all other film franchises. And now that Dom’s kid is growing up, the series is rife with earnest scenes of passing down what’s important. For Fast & Furious that’s religion, family, and cars, and you’ll rarely see such unabashed joy in this duty of fatherhood. ",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023"," Despite boasting a healthy 141-minute running time, Fast
X is not a complete movie. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Assured
that audiences will return like lemmings for future installments of the Fast/Furious
series, the filmmakers seemingly felt no compunction about concluding Fast X
with a series of cliffhangers, keeping the fates of most of the characters in
doubt. Although this probably won’t bother die-hard fans of the franchise, it’s
a gamble where more casual viewers are concerned.  Fast X brings little that’s new to a series that has
been repeating itself since it went hyperkinetic with installment #4. It’s all
action all the time. Yet, for an action sequence to work, something has to be
at stake, otherwise it's just sound and fury signifying nothing. In Fast X,
there's plenty of noise and CGI (some of it on the dodgy, cheap-looking side)
and things crashing and blowing up, but there's never a sense that it means
anything. No danger. No peril. It's all loud, visually expressive, and BORING.
And that's the core problem. It claims to have characters but that's a lie. It
claims to have a storyline but that's a fallacy. There's nothing here. The Emperor
has new clothes. It's a big, hollow vat of steaming excess. Fast X is like a flashy party guest who's initially a
lot of fun but stays too long. By the end, they have become tiresome. At this
point, there's not much difference between a Fast/Furious movie and a Transformers
movie. Both are soulless entities that exist solely to milk the box office. It
astounds me that audiences haven't yet tired of this shtick. It has been
evident since Paul Walker's untimely death that whatever human element the
series had has evaporated, leaving behind...nothing. Still, viewers know all
this and, although the box office takings for these films are down more than 50%
from the heights reached by the best of the franchise (Furious Seven),
this movie is still expected to claim in the $60-70M range (domestic) during
its debut weekend.  Fast X opens with a retcon of the climax of Fast Five, inserting a few new characters into repurposed footage from the
original film. (This also allows for a Paul Walker cameo without having to
resort to any sort of cinematic chicanery.) Turns out that Fast Five’s
bad guy, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), had a devoted son named Dante
(Jason Momoa) who is injured in the car chase that results in his father’s
death. His time for revenge has now come and, in keeping with his clearly
impaired mental state, he is determined to inflict maximum pain on Dominic Toretto
(Vin Diesel) before killing him. This involves framing Dom and his cohorts for
a terrorist attack in Rome, then setting them up one-by-one for slaughter. Dom’s
wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is captured and sent to a Black Ops center
for interrogation/torture. His son, left in the care of his sister, Mia
(Jordana Brewster), and brother, Jakob (John Cena), barely escapes a home raid.
A quartet of his friends – Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ‘Ludcaris’ Bridges),
Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) – find themselves set adrift in
London with their bank accounts drained. Like a flamboyant maestro, Dante keeps
pushing buttons, leading to a very typical Fast/Furious climax that
comes without any kind of resolution. Along the way, new and familiar faces
make appearances, including (but not limited to) Helen Mirren, Jason Statham,
Charlize Theron, Rita Moreno, and Brie Larson. None have screen time to match
the credibility they bring to the proceedings.  Although a majority of Fast X creates an aura of
sensory overstimulation that quickly loses its impact and turns sleep-inducing,
there are a few bright points. Depending on your point-of-view, it’s either
amusing or embarrassing to watch four Oscar winners skate through paper-thin
roles with minimal screen time. Jason Statham proves that he has more charisma
than the entire Fast/Furious gang combined. And Jason Momoa’s explosion
of excess proves that he gets how utterly, stupefyingly ridiculous the
proceedings are. Instead of frothing at the mouth, he preens and struts and has
a great time doing it. That might not be worth a recommendation but it’s at
least worth an extra half-star, pushing Fast X out of the garbage end of
2023 feature roster and into the range of bland mediocrity.  This is one of those reviews where I feel like throwing up my
hands and saying “Why bother?” With these movies, people no longer expect a
good film; they just want to see over-the-top action scenes and catch up with
familiar characters, even if those characters are just going through the
motions. Rumor has it that Fast X is intended to be the first volume of
a three-part story designed to bring the franchise to an end. That’s plenty of
time for these old dogs (star Vin Diesel, director Louis Leterrier,
co-screenwriter Justin Lin) to learn new tricks but, judging by how close the
movies are coming to self-parody, I’m not holding my breath. ",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023"," There are loyal Fast & Furious fans who will never care one bit how bad these movies are, how nonsensical they have become, or how much of a vanity project this is for Vin Diesel. Sir. Madam. The line starts just over there. Feels like it was created by a child who likes to blow stuff up, break things, and has no idea of the consequence or ramifications of those actions.  The next #1 movie in the world is Fast X, landing in theaters as the tenth entry in the Fast & Furious franchise, and the 11th film overall attributed to the series. 22 years after the first film was released in 2001, these Fast & Furious films continue to draw audiences and inexplicably become worldwide sensations. But let’s get real. For every dismissive wave of a hand or begrudging “Yeah, but…” I have offered, or you have perhaps offered to friends in defense of these things, Fast X is maybe the worst of the bunch. We all have limits. I know I’ve reached mine (and yes, I have watched the first four films in this series).Written, it seems, from the mind of an 8-year-old who likes to build LEGO cars and smash them together at high rates of speed, Fast X is mind-numbing in its absurdity - which says a lot because we flew a Pontiac Fiero up to the International Space Station in 2021’s F9. This film, at times, is every bit as painful to a viewer as stepping on those LEGOs, which end up scattered all over the floor and become embedded deep into your feet.We will talk about Jason Momoa shortly - the one saving grace in this whole debacle. With a price tag of $340 million (and yes, you read that number correctly), much of which is spent to satiate Vin Diesel’s colossal ego, Fast X is aggravating in how much this thing seems to exist to serve an audience of one. The audience who actually paid to watch the film? Afterthoughts. We don’t matter. Not really.Diesel is unwatchable throughout Fast X. And if the constant references to “family” amid melodramatic musical interludes set to claptrap dramatic dialogue are now supposed to be a “nod and wink” to the criticisms of previous films - the joke isn’t funny. Except maybe to Vin Diesel.How else do you explain a scene where Diesel’s Dom Toretto is literally turned halfway toward a picture hanging on a living room wall, his muscled-up arm fully aglow in “natural” lighting, while he mumbles about the importance of “family” and all it means to him. Half his lines are delivered with his eyes barely open or closed. Sleeves are apparently Diesel’s kryptonite, his arms flexed and chiseled and positioned perfectly in front of the camera for every scene. Did I mention that Diesel reportedly came in out of shape for the shoot, could not remember his lines, and was often late to the set? This is apparently what led to long-time Fast & Furious director Justin Lin departing the project one week after shooting started. And so: Lin leaves early on. Diesel’s guns are on display for 140-plus minutes (no sleeves!). He says no more than 4-5 words at a time and almost all of his action sequences involve him sitting in a car. Well, he showed them! Literally.

There are so many people in Fast X, and so many meandering subplots, the film feels incomprehensible. Director Louis Leterrier, presumably brought in because he has managed ensembles in films like Now You See Me and Clash of the Titans, feels like little more than a “yes man” for whatever Diesel wants to see on screen. He loses command of his film very quickly and the screenplay by Dan Mazeau (with Lin getting essentially a posthumous credit for all the work done prior to his departure) goes absolutely nowhere. Is there where I mention Mazeau is rewriting the script for Diesel’s next film? Surely a coincidence.We flashback to scenes from Fast Five in 2011, which admittedly reinvigorated this franchise for a few years. When the faction successfully took down drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), we were all apparently unaware that his son Dante (Momoa) was right in the thick of it all and has grown increasingly despondent over the death of his father and end of the family business. Now, more than a decade later, Dante has amassed enough wealth, guns, ammo, and all-terrain vehicles to come running and gunning for Dom and his crew. Momoa is off the rails in the film and makes this thing watchable, if only for how bizarre and unpredictable he is. He is a fan of ballet, paints his nails, and launches terrorist attacks on Rome in broad daylight. Dubbed as “flamboyant” and “androgynous” in press notes and interviews, Momoa is truly unlike any villain you have seen in quite some time. Unless you’ve seen The Joker. In all fairness, Momoa is hilarious, crazy, and entertaining as hell in this, so let’s just forget that some iterations of The Joker have done similar schtick in other films. To everyone’s credit, they let Momoa cook here and thankfully, for all of us, Diesel apparently finds that just as entertaining as audiences will.Without Momoa in Fast X, we have a loud, senseless movie that labors on screen. Charlize Theron as the dastardly Cipher and Michelle Rodriguez as Dom’s wife, Letty, beat each other up, going through glass tables and glass walls with nary a rip or tear of skin. Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and Tyrese Gibson bag on each other nearly the entire film with contrived, anodyne putdowns. Helen Mirren shows up to talk about (you guessed it…) family. Brie Larson (yay!) shows up for a couple wasted scenes (boo!). Jason Statham’s badass fighting machine, Deckard Shaw, is here for a minute. Rita Moreno shows up as Dom’s grandmother, praising Dom for his commitment to (checks notes…) his family. Alan Ritchson (“Reacher”) plays Aimes, the new leader of “The Agency” who has taken over for Dom’s former colleague, Mr. Nobody. John Cena is back as Dom’s brother Jakob, crashing cars and letting his nephew, and Dom and Letty’s young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), literally murder people by shooting cars into smithereens with Jakob’s “cannon car.”And wait. Is that Pete Davidson?Fast X is exhausting. This globe-trotting endeavor feels like it exists to simply keep Diesel relevant (and honestly maybe that’s true for some other cast members as well). From a technical standpoint, the action sequences are shot impressively, but the novelty has long since run its course. Where we used to laugh at the audacity of the action stunts these films attempted, we now laugh at the idiocy of it all. With a bunch of new cast members added and reports that this could be the first part of a three-part finale, Fast X indicates there are no signs of slowing to a stop anytime soon. Even as the film ends seemingly in mid-thought, dangling a cliffhanger, with a mid-credits scene that feels desperate by design, there is next to nothing here to entice someone to come back for a “Fast Eleven,” or “Fast XI,” or Fast X - Part 2,” or whatever we are calling the sequel.

"May 20, 2023"," Somehow a film that began as Point Break with cars – The Fast and the Furious – has gone on to become one of the highest-grossing franchises in cinematic history. The seventh instalment amassed an impressive $1.5 billion, the eight $1.25 billion; the double whammy ensuring that the franchise was bankable enough to keep churning them out. The ninth film didn’t break the billion mark, but had a global pandemic working against it, and now comes the tenth film (Hobbs and Shaw is a spin-off unconnected to the main series outside of characters), Fast X.  This heist plays a key role in Fast X, the film opening by rewinding ten years to show a new vantage point of Dom and Brian’s vault snatch. In these scenes the villain of Fast Five , Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), is revealed to have had a son, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). During the course of the sequence, Dante is shown to have been the driver in the car that got knocked off of the Rio bridge. He didn’t die though and is about to cause Dom a whole lot of suffering. This opening rewrite is nothing new to the Fast franchise. Since the fifth film it seems that almost every entry has gone back to undo something from the past, prime examples being the deaths of both Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang). Given that the audience never saw who was inside the second car in Fast Five, the previously unmentioned son angle in Fast X is tangible. Just like many of the other retcons, there is just enough viability that the audience is prepared to go along with it. Plot holes tend to be viewed as a bad thing, but the Fast franchise constantly proves that you can always fill them in later.  In addition to forever rewriting its own lore and history, the family expands with each Fast film. In Fast X their are multiple expansions; Dante is one new face, but there are several new cast members who are inevitably shoe-horned in. The manoeuvre is a cheap attempt at getting the audience to invest in the new characters quicker. However, as the family expands, screen time is constricted. This time around the group are fragmented across the globe with Dom isolated from those he loves. The geographical distance makes for lots of jumping around the planet to check in with the different factions meaning everyone’s screen time is diminished. Mia (Jordana Brewster) is sidelined once more, Letty is barely there, and the quartet of Han, Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese,) and Ramsey (Nathlie Emmanuel) get little in the way of development.  One of the more infuriating aspects of the story is that once more the group fail to address the elephant in the room: Brian’s absence. In reality Paul Walker tragically passed away during the filming of the seventh film. Rather than kill Brian off, it was decided to keep the character alive. Whilst it was a touching move initially, as the films move on it makes less and less sense why Brian wouldn’t be there to help his family. For the last two outings it has been Mia who has waded in to help, which goes against everything we’ve seen from her character previously. Brian’s absence is most glaring during an early BBQ scene during which there is an empty chair and plate next to Mia. It’s clearly meant to be Brian’s, but nobody mentions it, and don’t get me started on the fact that we haven’t seen either of Mia’s children since Furious 7.  Though his cousins are missing, Dom’s son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) takes a more central role. A number of years have seemingly passed since the events of Fast Nine with the youngest now aged somewhere between 8 and 10. He becomes a coveted prize for Dante to capture and so the youngster gets a substantial amount of screen time. His inclusion serves to open the doors of the franchise to a more kid friendly arena. Youngsters who catch the film will love seeing themselves represented via their peer and will have the whole playground playing Fast and the Furious.  It wouldn’t be a Fast movie without some action and Fast X does not disappoint on that front. There are plenty of missions and battles to sustain fans, however the sequences themselves appear to have fully embraced the Marvel mantra. As such, the level of carnage and disregard for civilian life is at a series high. An early mission in Rome causes more devastation that all previous outings combined. In casting itself in the Marvel mould, so too come the pitfalls. The set-pieces are all excessively long, eventually petering out to white noise. There isn’t the same level of investment as in earlier films and signs point to a franchise desperately in need of ending. That doesn’t seem likely anytime soon however, with Diesel having heavily alluded that the once two-film ending will actually be a trilogy. Fast X being the first part of this final story means that, inevitably, the film just ends. It isn’t quite as abrupt as The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 in terms of a cliffhanger, but it is frustrating nonetheless.  Fast Five combined all the fan favourite characters into one film, Fast X follows suit by revisiting the most prominent locations from the last few entries. London, Rio, and even Antarctica all play pivotal roles. There is a nostalgia to returning to these places, but there is also a distinct lack of the electricity that the original uber team up generated. The task of injecting Fast X  with new excitement falls to Jason Momoa and fortunately he doesn’t disappoint. Dante is a great villain; he is uncomfortably unhinged, driven, and fully in touch with his femininity. Momoa’s performance is high camp eccentricity, which works perfectly with the now heightened OTT arena of the Fast franchise. Momoa is gleefully wicked and gives John Wick 4‘s Marquis a run for the title of best dressed villain of the year, but for very, very different reasons. What’s more, you can feel Momoa’s excitement and delight at not only being in a Fast film, but also playing a baddie again after all his heroic aquatic adventures.  One of the many new additions, Ames (Alan Ritchson – who was Smallville’s Aquaman) remarks that Dom isn’t running a family, but rather “a cult with cars.” The statement rings true for the audience as, over the course of the ten films, they themselves have become part of the world, progressively accepting even more outlandish stunts and resurrections. In a way, loyal viewers are all suffering from a touch of Stockholm Syndrome, and it is exactly this frame of mind that enables the series to sustain its longevity. How good the movie is doesn’t really matter so long as its audience is fed their new fix of Dom and co. Fast X hits all the expected (and now familiar) tropes and beats, but this being the first in a multi-movie story, it is ultimately a little underwhelming… but regardless, we will all return for the next chapter like the dutiful cult members we are.

"May 20, 2023"," If there exists a bulky, ultra-masculine, could-be-ex-wrestler actor out there, preferably with luscious locks, steel eyes and a beguiling smile, the ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise will envelop him at some point in his career, folding him into its soap opera saga of souped-up cars and complicated relationship drama like a mother kangaroo stows away its young. He will have a life outside of the films, but he'll always be drawn back to the pouch that touts family values while they race, steal and shoot 'em up. Once you join the ""Fast"" family, they don't let you go, and it was only a matter of time until Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa, with his dazzling pecks and even more vivacious personality joined this hyper-elite group of men and women. His turn as the film's capricious villain Dante in the tenth installment ""Fast X"" is a wonderfully unexpected use of the burly Hawaiian thespian, and his appearance is joined by so many other star-studded, award-winning actors, it may seem like ""Fast"" creators are gunning for an Oscar next. That was hyperbole; there is no Oscar in the franchise's future... yet, at least. But the films have certainly elevated their talent and special effects over the 22 years since the first one was released. Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron - both of whom have won the golden statuette - joined the family several films ago, and another Oscar-winning actress has signed on for ""Fast X"" and its sequels. Brie Larson stars as Tess, the best chance Toretto and crew have for getting out of the sticky business that always seems to find them. It would be helpful to know before watching that ""Fast X"" is part of a scheduled 3-film journey. There should be no expectation that the bad guys are downed and the family vindicated this round. The other films in the series were very much stand-alone action flicks, hilariously and infamously known for resuscitating characters that had been killed in previous entries or fumbling with timelines for the sake of blockbuster chase sequences and outrageous stunts. As the years have progressed and the ""Fast"" fandom has evolved, so has its taste. Famed French action director Louis Leterrier has taken the steering wheel this time, and as the cast has grown exponentially both in size and talent, so has the awe-inducing sequences that quite literally blow up the screen. ""Fast X"" opens where ""Fast Five"" ended a decade prior. What is often considered the best of all the ""Fast"" films in the series, ""Fast Five"" tops most lists thanks in part to its breathtaking technical chase sequences. It reinvigorated the series and grossed more than $625 million worldwide. At the end of the film, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and ex-cop Brian O'Conner (the late Paul Walker) steal a vault cemented into the concrete walls of a Rio de Janeiro police station to undermine the vicious drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). What wasn't shown in that film - and brilliantly edited into the footage to open ""Fast X"" - is that Reyes had a son, Dante. With Reyes' death at Toretto's hand, Dante is driven even further into madness, sent into a spiral of spite and revenge aimed directly at Toretto and his familia. The film traverses the globe, sending the team to Rome, where Dante concocts a vicious plan that involves a large bomb (the most cartoonish round explosive ball you would more likely expect to see in an episode of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"") terrorizing its way to the Vatican. Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) are left holding the bag, running from authorities who think they are responsible for the destruction of Rome. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has been captured and thrown into an impenetrable prison in Antarctica alongside former foe Cipher (Charlize Theron), and Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) has lost leadership of The Agency, an off-the-books, covert organization running outside government lines, to skeptical, anti-Toretto Aimes (Alan Ritchson). The crew is rounded out by Mirren's Queenie and Jason Statham's Shaw, both of whom are welcome returns. But Toretto is on the hunt to clear their name and undermine Dante, who seems to be two steps ahead at all times. Dom's formerly estranged brother Jakob (John Cena) takes his son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) into stealth mode, but even a remote cavern hideaway in Portugal is not far enough flung to evade the scary, oppressive power and resources at Dante's disposal.  Theron was, and is, a terrifying ""Fast"" villain, but Momoa adds a flare of insanity that is utterly thrilling. He's both the macho character similar to the franchise's many other mainstays, but he paints his nails, wears his hair in pigtail buns and prances around in bonafide deranged, unapologetic jubilation. Like a beautifully physiqued Joker, a villain notorious of his irreverence and unpredictability, Dante is the glorious future of the ""Fast"" franchise, and we are furious it took this long for his debut.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023"," It’s never easy breaking bad news to family, especially after all that we’ve been through together. Since your humble origins in 2001’s The Fast and the Furious—a movie meant to do for gearheads what Point Break did for surfers—the Fast franchise has morphed into a multibillion-dollar colossus, and a ragtag group of street racers has become synonymous with actual superheroes. That time your crew stole a bunch of DVD players from a truck is but a distant memory—now, all I can think about is how dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro would be a city planner’s worst nightmare, and that more covert special ops missions should require parachuting cars out of a plane.  Before you permanently revoke my Corona privileges, please allow me to explain. I’m telling you this because I want to help you and the rest of the Fast family avoid a fate worse than death: irrelevancy.  There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. Unfortunately, Dom, a more clear-eyed rewatch of F9 does not do the film any favors. Even for a franchise that retcons prior events and brings back characters from beyond the grave like it’s a daytime soap, the manner in which F9 resurrected fan favorite Han Lue was as ham-fisted as the much-memed Palpatine debacle in The Rise of Skywalker. (“Mr. Nobody had a way of making things look real” is all that Han offers as an explanation for Prestige-ing what was believed to be a fatal, and quite real, explosion on the streets of Tokyo.) Another soap opera cliché deployed by F9 was integral to you, Dom: the reveal that you had a long-lost brother who was conveniently never mentioned across two decades of moviemaking. (It’s OK: You’re a man of few words and many unintelligible mumble growls; nobody expected you to bare your soul.) But setting aside the fact that you and Jakob Toretto look nothing alike, the twists and turns throughout F9 didn’t feel knowingly campy as much as downright lazy. Turns out, jumping the shark is a lot easier to accomplish when there’s a V12 engine roaring under the hood.  Which brings us to Fast X. I was cautiously optimistic that you could right the ship, Dom, especially when the power of family is so intense that it defies the laws of physics. But what happens when a mighty family begins to fracture? It was not a great look when Justin Lin, the filmmaker who has left the biggest imprint on the Fast franchise behind the camera, exited Fast X over creative differences. (Lin was replaced by French director Louis Leterrier; not renaming the movie The French and the Furious was another missed opportunity.) No shade to Leterrier, but hiring the dude responsible for the Clash of the Titans remake and Grimsby didn’t exactly inspire confidence—nor did Michelle Rodriguez’s admission that she and Charlize Theron filmed their fight scene without the director present.  Dom, while it’s commendable that the Fast franchise has made the familial bonds you cherish so integral to its DNA, it forces these movies to keep folding in on themselves. That process would be a lot more bearable if the franchise had a deeper mythology to lean on, but that’s never been a selling point. As a result, the increasingly predictable, self-referential nature of the storytelling makes every subsequent film feel like a parody of itself—the cinematic equivalent of drifting around in circles.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023"," Fast X doesn’t have an ending. Did you know that? I guess I missed the memo. It was apparently meant to be part one of a two-part finale for the series, or possibly a three-part finale, if Vin Diesel’s red carpet interview at the international premiere is to be believed.  After seeing the film, that feels more like a threat than a tease. Not a lot of film franchises make it to ten films, and Fast X seems like a good example of why. Just as in the Marvel universe, no character who dies in the Fast franchise is ever really dead (except for the former star of it, who died horrifically in real life doing the thing the movies glorify). From Letty to Han to Cypher to Gisele, everyone returns for their fan service cameo in Fast X (Gisele, played by Gal Gadot, doing it as the pilot of a submarine emerging from the ice off Antarctica — these characters are basically LEGO people now, you just screw different hats on them depending on the situation). Only unlike Marvel, the Fast franchise hasn’t quite figured out how to organize their IP into subdomains. At best it’s the lesser of two algorithms. Aside from the resurrected, there are also some new characters (both brand and relatively), from Brie Larson to Jason Momoa to Alan Ritchson from the Jack Reacher series, plus regulars Diesel and Statham and Brewster and Mirren, and cinema’s worst comedy duo, Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson (who have unlocked the secret of doing “banter” without changing facial expressios). Basically if you can think of a Hollywood buff guy, he’s probably in Fast X. Suffice it say, that’s too many people to try to squeeze into one movie. And so we get two hours and 20 minutes with no ending; a film that asks, “isn’t applauding your faves story enough?” Jason Momoa plays the Big Bad, and Fast X spends its first five minutes retconning his character into Fast Five (which, along with Furious 7, is one of about 2.5 movies in this franchise that are objectively above average). That was the one where the gang stole some giant safes from a drug lord and dragged them around Rio from ropes attached to their NOS machines (we did this once in high school using a stolen chair from Taco Bell). Well, what if we told you Dante, played by Momoa, was that drug lord’s son! How about that!  Does this knowledge add anything to the rest of the movie? Not really! It’s purely continuity for continuity’s sake. The scene, surely setting a record for the most re-used footage from a film that came out 11 years ago, is a microcosm of the whole, in which any potential fun buckles under the weight of the backstory required to get there. Fast has always been an Idiocracy-ready amalgam of Pimp My Ride, pro wrestling, and vague Christianity (now with more shiney Crucifixes!) but now it’s become the cinematic equivalent of a TLC reality show: so many recaps of previous action and teases of future plotlines that there’s barely any time left for the thing you thought you were watching. At least Jason Momoa seems to be having fun. He plays a character who has sworn not to kill the Toretto gang, but to make them suffer. Which in practice seems involve kidnapping everyone’s wives about 27 times over. That’s how he recruited his gang, in fact. He just showed up at Cypher’s house (who I think used to be dead? I’m not looking this up) and showed all of her henchmen that he had kidnapped their wives. With what henchmen he accomplished this, we’re left to guess. It seems like some kind of wife kidnapping pyramid scheme to me, the SEC should get involved. Momoa, playing a Brazilian, flirts with a Brazilian accent for about three words in his first scene, then settles into something like the muscle-bound Hawaiian equivalent of a flamboyant, gay-coded eighties villain (you could make a drinking game out of how often he sing songs “Oh, Dommy!”). I like Momoa better when he’s playing Jason Momoa instead of this Gary Oldman tribute act, but at least it’s a choice. Dante’s first big act is to trick the gang into chasing a giant, round “underwater neutron mine” around Rome, framing them for the entire fiasco and putting them on the outs with the CIA. No part of this plan makes any sense (to say nothing of the logistics of how Dante is supposedly orchestrating it at all like an all-seeing God) but it does result in one of the film’s two inspired moments: a stunt that involves a muscle car playing deadly pinball with crane and a big round bomb. (There’s a later one involving helicopters that invokes two bees tied together with string that’s also quite nice).  That’s about the best you can hope for in the Fast franchise these days (or ever, really), a setpiece so inspired in its utter ridiculousness that you can’t help but giggle. Fast 7 is basically a compilation of these kinds of moments (sadly the only installment directed by James Wan, who understands the appeal better than anyone) and the muscle car crane-bomb pinball moment briefly gave me that same giddy head rush. When The Rock shattered his arm cast by flexing and then choke-slammed Jason Statham through a table in Furious 7, it was inspired. All of Fast X’s fight scenes are interchangable combinations of blurry close-ups set to screeching sound effects, as implausible as the cast break but without any of the fun. Almost every American action movie these days makes me pine for RRR, the last big silly action film where it felt like the filmmakers were there to amuse themselves and not just check an action item off a list. It’s inconceivable that a filmmaker could be in this much of a rush to get to the next scene, especially when… there’s nothing to rush to! This movie doesn’t even have an ending!  Fast X feels like the logical end point of franchise filmmaking, which turns characters into IP and the movies in which they appear into pump-and-dump schemes. And so it isn’t a movie so much as a lengthy collection of character entrances and cliffhangers. Look who’s here! Look who else will be here soon!  Just like the characters in the Fast franchise eventually realize that there isn’t anywhere else to drive (hard to believe the “endless runway” sequence was a full decade ago now), these self-referential ourobori, dedicated to bilking a locked in fandom, are going to realize that they spent so much time serving fans that they forgot to make any new ones. I saw 6 and 9 (I think?). The one with the magnet. The magnet was cool in concept, but they just kept using it to do the same shot of cars smashing for like 15 minutes. It's almost impressive to be able to take something so ridiculous and make it boring.  Side point: At one moment Momoa sings “O Solo Mio” on a motorcycle. Is it possible for people entering their 40s like me to not envision Jim Carrey singing it out of his butt?",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023"," Nothing in the trailer, the title or the poster art suggest that Fast X is part one of a film; another summer blockbuster Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning-Part One has no such problem. Going into the cinema unaware you’re about to see the first section of a two or possibly three part film creates precisely the opposite effect that the measured ending of John Wick 4 had; instead of introducing plot elements and characters that come together in an unexpectedly satisfying way, the various components of Fast X end up lying about like Hot Wheels toys discarded on a child’s bedside rug. And I thought we were done with the whole ‘splitting films in several bits’ lark anyway, after the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises stumbled at the last hurdle by separating their dramatic endgame into segments that took so too long to come around that half their audience had moved on. So while the insatiable public appetite for such high-octane Tex Avery-physics carmageddon destructathon rampages will likely propel Fast X to the usual series box-office heights, it’s not one of the better entries in a Fast & Furious franchise. That series of films scored a notable comeback from the law of diminishing returns when the seminal Tokyo Drift discovered a driving mojo that rebirthed the franchise and sustained it through a strong second trilogy that included the real breakout, franchise darling Rio Heist. Louis (The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans, Grimsby) Leterrier’s film for Universal starts by retconning Rio Heist’s concrete-splintering safe-on-a-chain climax, now remodelled to introduce Jason Momoa as big bad Dante Reyes with a mission to take down Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Reyes plans to get Toretto through his weak spot, his love for his family, and franchise fans will recognise that Toretto has been established as a family man. Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) does what he can to protect Toretto’s son, but Lettie (Michelle Rodriguez) falls into the hands of Dante, a flamboyantly camp villain who looks and acts like a 60’s Batman villain. All of this is framed with a wider story in which Toretto is wrongly accused of a bombing attempt at the Vatican; in proper Fast and Furious style this incendiary device takes the form of a giant ball that looks like it should say ACME on the side. Toretto and his team (Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Natalie Emmanuel) somehow ending up chasing this giant sphere in their cars down the Spanish Steps in Rome, bopping the ball around in the traffic. Such childish sequences are where the franchise excels with goofy OTT visuals, and for fans, this should be enough to earn the film pass marks. There’s also increasingly fakey explosions and stunt-work, a very firm no swearing, no sex, minimal violence, and general vanilla flavouring that reflects the MOR attitude the series increasingly reflects. Additional returnees include Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, Sung Kang and Scott Eastwood; newbies dragged into the fray include Pete Davidson, Rita Moreno and Brie Larson taking over from MIA Kurt Russell as Mr Nobody. The cheerful gang show mentality still invests the Fast and Furious franchise entries with an easy-going, undemanding guilty-pleasure charm, but it’s wearing a little thin by movie ten. Other than the big basilica bagatelle set piece, there’s not much more than a motorway showdown with a cannon car that really drops the hammer action-wise. Otherwise, it makes sense that the bad guys would cop onto the ‘cult with cars’ that Toretto’s extended family offer. It’s the right motive for a final act struggle, but that struggle doesn’t materialise, we just see Dom fall into a trap and that’s it, and 2025 feels a long way away to find out what happened to characters we’re not that heavily invested in from film to film. Maybe, like Letty’s convenient amnesia, we’ll eventually forget about the bad times, but fans may well feel a little short-changed by this surprise cliff-hanger; there’s something to be said for the art of satisfying blockbusters, and Fast X doesn’t even try to play that game. The MCU and Star Wars franchise basically re-introduced the old idea of serial filmmaking as mainstream. These are just the tricked out versions of the Lone Ranger or Flash Gordon or Dick Tracy now. I don’t know if it makes much difference if the movie doesn’t end properly, since everyone knows the franchise is just going to keep going. I can tell you it made a big difference to me sitting in the pictures yesterday. I like a satisfying story, rather than a binge-able series that tv or streaming do better. Every Fast film has been a one off until now; they’re off in the wrong direction. Looks ridiculous but I like the mad stunts. Think I’d watch it once all 3 have been released so I could do them 1 weekend after the other. So, Statham is a goodie in this? I thought he was a baddie in the earlier ones so I didn’t watch those. The Mother is like a documentary compared to Diesel reversing his car out of a plane, dropping hundred of feet into a motorway, and driving away as if he’s clipped a kerb. Just not a film. The mix isn’t right when even they don’t know what pace to tell the story at, wanting to keep their options open for one or two more. So you’re just left looking at green screen cameos and action that tends towards the ridiculous. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"May 20, 2023"," Fast X continues the story of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his ragtag group of thieves spies loved ones he considers family. At a time of peace, he teaches his son, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), how to drift in his muscle cars while the group have social gatherings in barbecues whilst chugging down Coronas and discussing side missions they plan to undertake. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes it upon himself to lead his own mission while Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) reluctantly tag along under his supposed leadership. However, their time of peace ends abruptly when Cypher (Charlize Theron) falls injured on the front door of the Toretto home, warning Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) of what is coming – Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). Dante is the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who was killed in the events of Fast Five (2011). Dante’s psychopathic tendencies, unpredictable attitude, and rampant sadism to those with family ties makes him a killing machine intent on taking Dom and his family down. With numerous allies (including John Cena as Dom’s brother Jakob) and wildcards (including Alan Ritchson as Aimes, a player in the Agency tasked to take Dom down) stepping up to the plate, this looks like it is going to be the most dangerous Fast and Furious chapter yet. Fast X is the latest entry in the long-running action franchise. However, it is also the one that is plagued with numerous behind-the-scenes stories that have impacted production. The major story is Justin Lin’s departure from the director’s chair, with allegations claiming that his absence was due to clashes with Diesel, numerous rewrites, and abrupt changes to shooting locations. Enter franchise newcomer Louis Leterrier – a veteran in action films who has worked on popular studio films, including the first two Transporter films, The Incredible Hulk (2008), and Now You See Me (2013), as well as the Netflix fantasy series The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (2019). Will his directorial expertise set Fast X straight? The pieces in all the prior films are still here – the fast cars, the Coronas, the family barbecues, the hit-and-miss comic relief from Tyrese and crew, laughably meat-headed pathos that is meant to be emotionally stirring, illogical stunts that would make Isaac Newton spin in his grave, characters returning that would make Annie Wilkes shout at the screen and so on. Yet Fast 9 (2021) skidded into some predicaments that involved a self-aware tone, droning melodrama, and jumping the NOS so far that the story literally ended up in outer space, which attracted major criticism. Thankfully, Leterrier takes the proceedings back down to Earth (in setting, not gravity) and dispenses with those things and relies on an anarchic tone, swift pacing, and escalating momentum to bring the action goods. The set piece in Rome involving a flaming boulder of a bomb crashing through the city is the film’s peak while the climax involving helicopters and rocket vehicles are fun in their ridiculousness. Unfortunately, other set pieces involving a fight between Letty and Cypher feel perfunctory as it neither feels consequential or revelatory. The storytelling moments of breathing room, exposition, and dramatic pathos are kept to a concise minimum and Leterrier paces the film like a jet turbine that it provides the requisite thrills with exhilarating effect. In fact, the pacing is so fast that it is meant to distract you from the film’s messy and slapdash execution. The consequences of the behind-the-scenes hullaballoo really show on screen when you notice the blatantly obvious green-screen in scenes where the actors are supposedly interacting with each other. The film’s concept of family becomes quite muted when you realise the group are all quite separated from each other and are rarely all on-screen together. And with news reports and media outlets saying the film is part of a trilogy, numerous plot points and characters are left unresolved. While that is an obvious consequence due to the nature of cliff-hangers, most of the roles (particularly the new ones) are given the short shrift and become more like guest stars of actor recognition rather than full-bodied characters with any discernible personality. Speaking of franchise newcomers, Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, and Daniela Melchior make very little impression as they are only given archetypes, or worse, are relegated to plot devices. Melchior ends up with the worst role as she is nothing but a plot device for Dom to save and to add tension with which our antagonists can play. What is worse is that the characters are so ineffective in their roles that when story twists occur late in the narrative, they all land with a thud. However, there is a saviour in the film that introduces a sense of anarchy to the equation. The true standout is Jason Momoa as antagonist Dante Reyes. Given free rein to overact as much as he pleases, which is reminiscent of villainous roles played by Alan Rickman and Nicolas Cage, Momoa lends the film a sense of danger and gallows humour that is refreshing and entertaining. His performance even makes Diesel’s stoic work better as it gives him much-needed weight in terms of stakes and gives him an antithesis to play with as hero vs. foe. Overall, Fast X delivers exactly what fans would expect in terms of action and absurdity while surprising us with an entertainingly over-the-top Jason Momoa performance. However, with the dearth of family togetherness, the numerous behind-the-scenes faults, and the lack of resolve, the film is underwhelming after reminiscing over it with the slightest bit of scrutiny.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023"," The last three entries in this series have felt like the franchise running on fumes. Increasingly convoluted plots, a bigger reliance on CGI, off-screen ego clashes. These have detracted from an otherwise fun time at the movies. So when star Vin Diesel promised Fast X will be the first of three more movies, I let out a sigh. But if they're anything like this one, I'm excited for the ride. The film's prologue basically replays the climactic heist from Fast Five - arguably the series' best entry - in which Dom and Brian literally ripped off a bank vault and drove it through the streets of Rio. The money they stole belonged to a drug kingpin (Joaquim de Almeida). His heretofore unknown son Dante (Jason Momoa) had to sit back and watch his father die and his fortune vanish. Now, a decade later, he's out for revenge, promising suffering for every member of Dom's crew. And boy does he dish it out! With a seemingly vast fortune and tech pilfered from Cipher (Charlize Theron), he frames them for a terrorist attack, obliterates their bank accounts and tries to kidnap Dom's son. Momoa's character is ruthless but gleeful in his destruction. His wild fashion sense and over-the-top persona works for the movie: believable enough to try to kill everyone who gets in his way and ridiculous enough to provide comic relief. He also serves as a nice counterweight to Diesel, who's the film's weak link. This should be Dom's most emotional mission yet, but Diesel sleepwalks even more than usual. But the new cast additions mostly work. Brie Larson is her usual spunky self as a rogue CIA agent, though her part is underwritten. Alan Ritchson (Prime Video's Reacher) fares better as the latest beefcake to join the franchise. As the new agency head, he wants to rein these outlaw street racers in. His charm shines through, and he'll be a definite asset in future films. The only downside is he does not have a big hand-to-hand combat showdown with anyone. While the film does have some of the bad marks of the later entries in the saga - too many characters, pointless cameos, car wrecks that don't result in even a scratch on the driver - it makes up for it with a chaotic energy that recalls the sixth film in the franchise. This also marks the first time one has ended on a true cliffhanger. It raises the stakes for this series, even if it brings back dead characters more than any soap opera.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023"," The Fast and Furious movies have long been Diesel’s baby, ever since he jumped on as a producer for the fourth entry, 2009’s Fast & Furious. The story behind his creative control of the series is a convoluted one. The crux, however, is that as he’s taken more ownership, the movies have increasingly catered to the star’s superhero complex.  How have they catered, exactly? For starters, there’s the oft-repeated fact that Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham have in their contracts that they can’t lose a fight onscreen. Then there’s the years of offscreen animosity between Diesel and Johnson (presumably related to their competing egos) that caused Johnson to minimize his future involvement with the franchise. Most damningly, early on in the Fast X production process, long-time director and producer Justin Lin departed after “creative differences” with Diesel on the movie’s direction (Lin remained as a producer). The point is this: Diesel shows all the signs of being a star who believes he knows best what works for these movies, and what works best for these movies is Vin Diesel. Ironically, that understanding could not be further from the truth, as Fast X, an otherwise typically daffy and fun entry in an always daffy and fun series, repeatedly demonstrates. Everyone else is having a great time. Diesel’s Dominic Toretto, however, is a dour anchor dragging it all down. Fast X, the first entry in the series’ three-part (reported) finale has Dom and his beloved family facing down yet another enemy to end all enemies, this time in the form of Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of the Brazilian drug lord our heroes took down in Fast Five. After Dante frames the group for a bombing in Rome, Dom and his crew have to work to rebuild their relationship with The Agency, and destroy Dante before he destroys them.  Helping Dom pull this off is new addition Tess (Brie Larson) the daughter of Dom’s Agency ally Mr. Nobody. Dom’s now-reformed brother Jacob (John Cena) is tasked with safely transporting Dom’s son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) to a safehouse. The franchise’s previous entry, F9: The Fast Saga, felt like a series high, with beloved characters rejoining the fold and long-time fan theories (i.e. “they’re going to space”) finally coming true. Fast X is a step back from the meta delights of that experience. The threats here are still totally silly; a giant spherical bomb rolling through the streets of Rome, some mumbo jumbo about a computer chip.  That’s not to say what’s here is without enjoyment; much of Fast X is lots of fun, and the dynamics between the characters are as satisfying as ever. Our side characters—namely Han (Sun Kang), Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)—are still having a hijinks-filled good time. Cena’s interactions with little Brian are endearing. Momoa’s Dante is cartoonish fun, though a little over the top and problematically coded. He’s clearly patterned after The Joker, but leans more toward Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Dom has always been a tough, stoic dude who loves talking about how much he loves his family. In this finale run, however, it really seems like Diesel wants to drive home Dom’s heroic qualities above all else. He uses a car door like Captain America’s shield. When his son is in danger, the film slows down to ensure you see Dom selflessly shielding him as dramatic music plays. Dante presents him with moral conflicts like Dom’s Batman in The Dark Knight. Even by previous entries’ standards, Diesel’s performance lacks anything resembling a sense of humor, increasingly at odds with the movie he’s actually in. There are a few reveals in this one that suggest the subsequent parts of the three-part finale have some extra fun up their motorcycle jacket sleeves, but all that will be for naught if Diesel doesn’t learn to take at least a half-step back and take some constructive criticism. It’d be a shame for these movies to end on diminishing returns just because one guy couldn’t get over himself.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023"," Anchored by several so-silly-they-are-good action sequences, plus the addition of an outlandish new villain played by Jason Momoa, this is the best the franchise has been in at least the last two or three movies. It's a high octane thrill ride that never allows the audience to process just how crazy this film really is. ""Fast X"" begins with everything seemingly great for Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his makeshift family (that one character later refers to in the film as a ""cult with cars""). But the good times don't last long, as Dominic's concerns that his past will come for him become reality in the form of Dante (Momoa). He's the son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), the Brazilian drug lord from ""Fast X"" who met his demise at the hands of Dominic and his crew. Nearly everyone returns from the original films, with a cast that is just overflowing with talent. Back for more includes Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges, John Cena and Jason Statham. There are also three former Oscar winners returning — Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno and Charlize Theron — making you wonder just what the pitch was to get that trio involved not just once, but multiple times. ""Fast X"" adds another former Oscar winner with Brie Larson joining the cast as an FBI agent trying to help Dominic and his crew. In any other film, the way she blends right into the cast would be the headline — the kind of performance that really injects life into a long running franchise. But Larson is upstaged by Momoa, who goes full Joker-mode as the film's main heavy. Momoa is a total blast in ""Fast X,"" so over-the-top he basically destroys the scenery. It's the kind of performance that walks a fine line between fun camp and eye-rolling overacting, but Momoa manages to walk that line quite effectively. Fans of the franchise may care about the characters, but the real draw is the action sequences — which director Louis Leterrier presents in fabulous fashion. The set pieces are beyond logic, with everything from the gang chasing down a nuclear device through the streets of Rome to a chase on a highway that basically ignores the laws of physics.  At this point, the franchise is nothing more than a Marvel movie with cars with action sequences playing out like a video game. It shouldn't work, but in ""Fast X"" it all manages to come together quite nicely — with the film never taking itself too seriously (even if it includes numerous amounts of dialogue about family that sounds like it came from a fortune cookie).",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Fast X continues to deliver big&#44; loud &amp; dumb entertainment but it&apos;s diminishing returns with a forced and frustrating cliffhanger&#46; Momoa&apos;s villain is a blast while the script&#44; dialogue&#44; and soap opera drama is among the weakest of the franchise&#46; ,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023"," Consistently for the franchise, the theme here is ""family"" -- although now the main goal is to protect your family from constant threats, rather than loving, enjoying, or appreciating them. And while there's definitely teamwork in play, much of it involves excessive violence without many consequences. It's hard to consider the main characters role models, given the sheer, consequence-free destruction they cause, but they do risk their lives to save the world and protect their loved ones and stand up against impossible odds. And there's a lot of teamwork. Dom (Vin Diesel, who describes himself as ""of ambiguous ethnicity"") is the clear leader. Other key cast members include Jason Momoa, who's Native Hawaiian, Native American, and Irish; Michelle Rodriguez, who's Dominican and Puerto Rican; Nathalie Emmanuel, who's of Dominican and Saint Lucian descent; Sung Kang, who's Korean; Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson, who are both Black; Daniela Melchior, who's Portuguese; and Rita Moreno, who's Puerto Rican. Women are smart and self-sufficient, but at least some of them are also objectified. Tons of over-the-top action violence, destruction. Guns and shooting. Car crashes. Huge runaway bomb (on fire for a while). Missiles. Explosions. Characters die (off-screen). Fighting, martial arts. Characters slammed against hard surfaces. Stabbing. Some blood shown: scratches, bullet wounds, etc. Villain stabs a man, licks the blood from the blade. Eye-gouging. Villain ""hangs out"" with and talks to two corpses, dead bodies whose eyes and mouths have been propped open with tape. Characters crash through glass windows; character throws a handful of glass into another's face. Two characters kiss and caress each other. Women objectified: The camera leers at women's bottoms and legs as they dance. Villain paws at a young woman and licks her face. Sex-related dialogue (""the carpet matches the drapes""). Sporadic uses of ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""goddamn,"" ""bastard,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""butthole,"" ""oh my God,"" ""damn."" A young boy starts to say ""shi-"" twice but stops or is stopped. Social drinking: beers in a bar and at a barbecue. A character eats a ""fun muffin"" and experiences brief LSD-like effects, which quickly go away. Parents need to know that Fast X is the 10th official entry in the Fast and Furious franchise (not counting Hobbs & Shaw), as well as the first half of a two-parter (it ends on a cliffhanger). It doesn't fully satisfy, but there are still enough wild stunts to keep fans eager to spend time with Dom (Vin Diesel) and his found family. Violence is typical for the series, with nonstop over-the-top, cartoonish action mayhem. Expect guns and shooting, fighting, kicking, slamming, stabbing, car crashes, explosions, a runaway bomb, and more. Characters seemingly die (off-screen). The villain (Jason Momoa) stabs someone and licks the blood from his blade and also talks to two corpses he has propped up in chairs, with their mouths and eyes taped open. Sporadic strong language includes ""s--t,"" ""goddamn,"" ""bastard,"" ""bitch,"" etc. Two characters kiss and caress each other, and -- even though some of the movie's female characters are self-sufficient and smart -- there's objectification of women's bottoms and legs during a race. Adults drink beer socially, and a character eats a muffin that causes a brief LSD-like effect. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In FAST X, a new villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), emerges. He's seeking revenge on Dom (Vin Diesel) and everyone Dom loves because Dante blames Dom for the death of his father, Reyes, in Fast Five. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) are called to go to Rome to steal a powerful computer chip, but the job is actually a trap set up by Dante. After a huge bomb is detonated, the team is made to look like terrorists, with Dom as their leader. They lose their protection from The Agency, and their bank account, too. Meanwhile, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is arrested and winds up in a secret prison, while Dom's brother, Jakob (John Cena), rushes Dom and Letty's son (Leo Abelo Perry) to a safe place. Now off the grid, the team must try to reunite, even as the sociopathic Dante seems to anticipate their every step. The 10th official movie in this wildly popular franchise -- the first of a two-parter -- has the same, now somewhat tired formula: travel, stunts, fights, explosions, crashes, ""family"" talk, repeat. In Fast X (the marketing team missed a chance to play with the phrase ""Fast-Ten your seatbelt!""), the oft-repeated ""family is everything"" theme is now mostly about protecting your family and how much it hurts to lose loved ones (even though most of the characters who were once thought dead are actually alive). The stunts are bigger, of course, but they still seem derivative of past set pieces. And Momoa's Dante acts almost exactly like Batman's foe the Joker, dancing, giggling, wearing flouncy, clownish outfits, spouting endless one-liners, and behaving ghoulishly; it's all pretty shopworn. (Cena, on the other hand, offers some of the movie's warmest, funniest moments, playing the ""cool uncle"" in charge of protecting his nephew.) While the movie occasionally, slyly makes fun of itself, that's not enough to break it free from its slavish devotion to the franchise's hit recipe. And after more than two hours, Fast X ends on a cliffhanger! Still, it's all so exhausting that even that may make you yearn not for more, but rather for a true and proper ending to this decades-long story. Families can talk about Fast X's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it thrilling or shocking? Are there any consequences? Why does that matter? How does this movie continue with the series' theme of family? How is this one similar to those that have come before it? How is it different? How are women portrayed in the film? Did you notice any objectification? Agency?

"May 19, 2023"," The tenth installment of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise is more of the same gravity-defying stunts and laughable dialogue but Jason Momoa fuels the action with humor. The script is also filled with fun moments that poke fun at the ""familia"" and the ridiculous car stunts. Once again, revenge drives the plot with Jason Momoa playing a past foe's son, Dante who witnessed his father’s demise at the hands of the crew. His target is Dom’s (Vin Diesel) 8-year-old son. From the start line, the movie kicks off with a Charger drifting around the Dodger Stadium parking lot, looking over Los Angeles. When we finally see who is behind the wheel, it’s both laughable and irresponsible. Sure it’s just a movie, but this franchise has heavily influenced street car racing. Going into this franchise, you have to put away logic. In addition to over-the-top action, every installment introduces new Toretto family members. The last movie introduced a brother, and this time we have a grandmother played by Rita Moreno. You have to overlook the fact that in the original movie, Dom and Mia were set up as orphans who turned to crime to survive. Why harp on the impossibilities of the franchise like characters returning from the dead, a souped-up Chargers at Dom’s beck and call like a Batmobile, or introducing characters (Brie Larson, Helen Mirren) with no real purpose, other than to bring star power. The FAST & FURIOUS franchise tapped into a multicultural phenomenon never seen on screen. Others have tried imitating it and failed. The billion-dollar saga just keeps going and going like the Energizer Bunny. Obviously, fans enjoy the over-the-top shenanigans and will keep returning to the big screen for it. So let’s talk about the highlights in this film. Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson are great additions to FAST X. Both bring comedy and muscles to their new characters. Aquaman brings a different sort of vibe to this tough guy. Dante is a bit flamboyant and a psychopath with funny lines. Momoa livens up the formulaic movie. Alan Ritchson, the former Titans star is finding success playing tough characters with his star-turning performance as Jack Reacher. The actor brings that charisma and humor as Aimes, the head of the Agency formerly run by Mr. Nobody played by Kurt Russell. Ritchson is given some of the best lines when we meet him. Aimes sums up the ridiculousness of the franchise with a self-awareness that lightens up the moments. Acknowledging those laughable elements works serves in a way to allow yourself to enjoy the illogical storyline. As weird as that may sound. Directed by Louis Leterrier (CLASH OF THE TITANS, THE INCREDIBLE HULK), the director brings nothing new to the franchise unless he can take credit for the self-aware moments which is the only new thing in this tired installment. From start to finish, FAST X is cookie-cutter.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023"," The Fast and the Furious franchise earned its place as the blockbuster franchise to beat in the early 2010s. While the series struggled after its initial release, fans eventually grew to hold the series in high esteem. Fast Five became the victory lap that proved it was capable of holding the belt as the heavy-weight champion of the action world. Yet ever since the tragic passing of Paul Walker, the series has struggled to celebrate the tone. Fast X hopes to change that, introducing the most exciting villain to the series in years. However, Vin Diesel‘s insistence that Dominic Toretto drive every piece of the story upends the team dynamics once again.  While his team completes a mission in Rome, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) care for their son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). However, their peace is disrupted when Cipher (Charlize Theron) arrives injured. She’s come to warn them of an emerging threat from their past. The son of Hernan Reyes, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), plans to kill the Toretto family as payback for his father’s death.  From there, Fast X hits the booster and builds out a half dozen action setpieces. Some of these are incredible, including a warehouse battle where Jason Statham and Sung Kang work out their beef. John Cena emerges from the last film with more of his bubbly personality intact. He’s here to help his brother and steals the show with Perry by his side.  However, new director Louis Leterrier quickly showcases his flaws as an action director. A chase sequence through Rome features dozens of edits and cutaways in minutes. The goal is to raise the anxiety and “pace” of the scene, ” but often, these feel unnecessary. Leterrier also fumbles the chronological storytelling, abandoning storylines at the drop of a hat and then returning to them like nothing happened in the time gap.  Leterrier cannot handle the tonal shifts required to make a Fast film work either. It’s clear that the giant ensemble on display could rarely interact much because of scheduling. Whatever the future plans are for the franchise, there’s little time spent with the core “family” Toretto has cultivated. Instead, we are treated to extensive sequences with new characters that do not pop.  Brie Larson does her best, but her role is comically underwritten. Literally everything moment positive moment for her character is non-verbal or non-existent on the page. Meanwhile, Aimes (Alan Ritchson) and Isabel (Daniela Melchior) instantaneously read as misses. They do not have any characterization without applying their screen time through the lens of a character out of the franchise.  The real shock comes from Momoa. The actor has never had a difficult time breaking through, but this performance is far more intricate and energetic than anything we’ve ever seen from him. Momoa gets to be funny and violent. His ideology becomes clear early on, and it makes his omniscient powers somewhat earned. Momoa dances through every scene, having a blast at every opportunity. While coding a villain as queer carries its own implications, Momoa easily becomes one of the top two villains in franchise history. Diesel once again fumbles the bag as a star and performer. His sequences throughout the film are messy in the best of circumstances. Yet he brings so much self-seriousness into the film it throws off the rest of the gang’s moments. Why Diesel sees Dominic Toretto as a gladiator is beyond us all. The once charismatic and funny character now gruffs his way through scenes and angrily screams at anyone who crosses him. Diesel used to have fun in these films, but it’s clear that is no longer the case. Instead, we’re left with a shell of the character we used to love.  Unfortunately, Fast X forces us to spend large swaths of the film with Diesel solo. The gang quickly splits up. Almost all of the comedy comes from two storylines. In one, Tyrese, Kang, Ludacris, and Nathalie Emmanuel desperately search for supplies to fight back. In the other, Cena and Perry get to buddy-cop their way off the grid. Rodriguez becomes paired off with an unexpected character, and Diesel tries a tete-a-tete with Momoa. The newcomer charms Diesel off the screen, and it calls Diesel’s future as the heart of the franchise into question.  Another real shock seems to be the reversion to CG effects. Time and time again throughout the film, the images look blurry and sludgy. From Tokyo Drift to Fast & Furious 6, the legends of how they used practical effects were incredible. CG obviously played into those films, but not at the level we see in Fast X. Leterrier has not historically been great at framing shots to allow the CG to disappear, and once again, this proves correct. No matter how cool the stunts are, the vast majority look like waxy CG bodies. ",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023"," The Fast & Furious series has been massively popular with audiences, leaving outliers like me to wonder what we’ve been missing. I liked the 2001 original, which was about street racing, and disliked the eight subsequent sequels, especially as the series evolved into a ridiculous car-driving spy adventure. Now we’re at the tenth installment, Fast X. Well, pigs are flying, hell has frozen over, and monkeys are flying out of Wayne Campbell’s butt, because they finally made one of these that I enjoyed. Of course, that might mean hardcore fans won’t like it as much. Hard to say. The success of Fast X is due in large part to Jason Momoa. He plays Dante Reyes, the son of a drug kinpin Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and crew robbed back in Fast Five. Now he wants revenge. Killing Dom isn’t enough, however. Dante wants to make him suffer by taking away the most important thing in his life – his family, especially son “Little B” (Leo Abelo Perry). Momoa gives a big, over-the-top, Nicolas Cage-esque performance in the movie. He’s hilarious, yet also a very intimidating villain. Dante’s desire to get revenge by causing Dom endless misery infuses the story with a type of suspense that wasn’t always there in previous sequels. Diesel gets to go beyond his tough-guy posturing too, showing fear, an emotion we really haven’t seen from the character. Brie Larson is another new addition to the cast. She’s Tess, the daughter of the now missing covert ops leader Mr. Nobody. The actress gets to provide a little comic relief, while also taking part in a couple action sequences. Here is more proof of my theory that any movie is automatically improved by the presence of Brie Larson. Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, John Cena, and Helen Mirren all reprise their roles from prior entries. Seeing how and when their characters factor into the plot is fun, especially Theron, whose Cipher was once an enemy to Dom, but now has an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” relationship with him. The all-star cast is certainly a treat to watch. Insane action is the true draw, though. Fast X is every bit as preposterous in that department as its predecessors. Nevertheless, the Dante revenge angle makes those outlandish scenes feel like they have actual stakes. The best of them finds Dom and crew racing around Rome, trying to halt a massive round bomb that careens through the streets like a pinball, headed right toward the Vatican. Statham gets to take part in a nifty fight, as do Theron and long-time star Michelle Rodriguez. Craziest of all is the grand finale, a chase that cheerfully ignores rules of physics and gravity even more than the franchise has before. Thankfully, there’s nothing as stupid as the “going into space” bit from F9.  Fast X drags a bit in the middle, and having to give each of its many, many characters their own big moment causes it to feel overstuffed. Fans already know that a second part is on tap for next year, meaning the movie ends with a cliffhanger. Such gimmicks make sense for a studio looking to extend a franchise; for fans who want a conclusive ending, it’s sort of disappointing. A mid-credits scene designed to be a crowd-pleaser will placate those fans somewhat. Back in 2001, nobody expected ten of these movies would come into existence. That F&F has managed to hold audiences’ interest for over 20 years is a cinematic miracle. I thought it ran out of gas a long time ago. Thanks primarily to the awesome turn from Jason Momoa that gives us a reason to care about the vehicular mayhem, Fast X has unexpectedly found a way to refill the tank. Being entertained by this sequel was a pleasant surprise. This Is Family - This 35-minute behind-the-scenes documentary covers everything from the addition of new cast members, to how the “bomb in Rome” scene was accomplished, to the camaraderie on set. Director Louis Letterier is here, along with all the cast members. Watching the actors dote over Rita Moreno is especially nice, and you can see the idea of the “Fast family” isn’t just talk. Fast Breaks - Letterier breaks down several of the action scenes, letting us know how they were shot and why certain choices were made. You get a better understanding of how the Fast saga’s complicated sequences of vehicular mayhem were achieved. To my surprise, CGI is used sparingly. Even when Dom’s car lands on two other cars after dropping out of an airplane, the team did it for real. Xtreme Rides of Fast X - This is an enjoyable look at the vehicles used in the movie, as well as how some of them were modified. The motorcycle Jason Momoa rides, for example, was stripped down to its basics to make it look leaner and more badass. Belles of the Brawl - A fun look at actresses Michelle Rodriguez, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Jordana Brewster as they rehearse and shoot the movie’s fight scenes. Tuned Into Rio - This segment focuses on taking the story back to Rio, how it ties into earlier films, and the racing scene set there. Jason Momoa: Conquering Rome - A section focusing on Momoa, who’s present to discuss his approach to playing his villainous character. Footage of him performing some of his own stunts is included, too. As he’s the highlight of Fast X, this is a particularly pleasing look at his work in the movie. Little B Takes the Wheel - This part focuses on Leo Abelo Perry, who plays Little B in the film. He’s the youngest member of the Fast family so far. Additional features are an amusing gag reel and two music videos related to the movie. It’s a first-rate package of supplementary material. A DVD and digital copy are also inside the box. Fast X is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, language, and some suggestive material. The running time is 2 hours and 21 minutes.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," Family, corona beers and the self-aware ridiculousness are part of the charm of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise, and its latest film, “Fast X”, is another enthralling entry into its legacy. There is no illusion in anyone’s mind that the films in the “Fast and the Furious” saga aren’t just blockbuster soap operas. They hook you the same way, and part of what makes soap operas so enjoyable is the awareness of its campiness, while still retaining immense heart. One of the reasons why this saga has managed to reinvent itself, and why people enjoy coming back are its intense action, epic fights but also the soap opera clichés where villains become family, villains become allies, storyline history is retconned to help give new introductions more substance, with life and death stakes always at play. If you have seen any of the “Fast and the Furious” movies after “Fast Five” (considered by many to be a soft reboot) and you enjoyed it, then you will love “Fast X”. If you didn’t then this film won’t be worth your time. “Fast X” delivers on upping the ante with the explosions and intricate fight choreography that will leave you pumped up. Charmingly, though, where the film hooks you most is the heart and love of family. This is in large part thanks to performances by Daniela Melchior who plays as a Brazilian street racer with ties to Dom’s (Vin Diesel) past, Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s 8-year-old son, and also Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. However, I didn’t fully enjoy Jason Momoa’s performance as Dante, the son of Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. My perspective on Momoa’s performance may be a minority view, as there are many who already love it, but the umbrage is a rather layered one. Momoa’s character is one who has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. On paper that makes for a great villain but Momoa’s performance lacks nuance. His character is an eccentric sociopath, who we’re told experienced numerous trips to a psychiatric hospital. Added to that is a layer of effeminacy to the character who paints his nails, who wears double/pigtail buns, displays a penchant for theatricality, and who also gets flirty with Dom. It’s obvious that he is attempting to deliver a camp performance but the reason why this doesn’t work fully in my view is because he is relying on too many caricatures of eccentricity.  Queer coding is the imbuing of characters with queer traits and stereotypes recognisable to the audience. Such traits are greatly varied, but traits of exaggerated masculinity and femininity, vanity and hypersexuality are frequent tropes. Though such a character's sexual identity may not be explicitly confirmed within their respective work, or they may in fact be straight despite their queer mannerisms, a character is usually coded as such to allow filmmakers leeway.  They can have a character for queer audiences to identify with, but can get away without having to wade into the growling contentious debate around identity politics, which is exactly what “Fast X” does. The film is treading that similar line to the recent “John Wick: Chapter 4” film, and Javier Bardem in “Skyfall” with its depiction of eccentric and arguably feminine men as weak/evil. Worth reiterating here, action movies are usually never the type of films that one can view through any queer lens or come away with queer interpretations as they are too steeped in the glorification of hyper-masculinity and violence (of which queerness is seen in opposition too), but if there are examples of films that get it right, such as  Netflix’s “The Old Guard”, one has to wonder why are so many others being lazy. It needs to be stressed that there isn’t anything wrong with campy or theatrical performances as they can be a standout, but Momoa’s campiness reads as something to laugh at, not delight in. While it may be worth considering that none of the above criticism actually matters, because it’s just a popcorn action flick, it it worth noting that these films make hundreds of millions and sometimes a billion dollars.  Many people put great weight in them, and conscious or subconsciously, they do leave an impact. Maybe that impact should sometimes be used for good and not ambivalence. Director Louis Leterrier deserves an honourable mention for how he skillfully maintains the story’s scope, especially given how he stepped in after Justin Lin departed the film due to his reported frustration at on-set dramatics.  The film spans so many locations and is truly a globe-trotting film, but it all works well, and the action scenes are truly a visual buffet. The film also includes some fun and cool cameos with Paul Walker’s daughter, Meadow, and Twenty One Pilots’ drummer Josh Dun and former Disney star Debbie Ryan, who happens to be his wife. There are more cameos that won’t be spoiled here, but really add to the film’s enjoyment and also shows just how many Hollywood stars love the cheesiness and campiness of these films. The somewhat vexing portrayal of Momoa’s character aside, the film is great, and worth watching. There are possibly two more films to be expected as producers begin the journey to wrap up this money making franchise, but it will clearly not be going out without a bang.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023"," Con el estreno de Fast X, la “saga de Fast and Furious”, se reafirma estruendosamente como la telenovela más grande, cara y ridícula de la pantalla grande. Esto no es solo por su naturaleza episódica de la narrativa y porque después de casi dos horas y media de película, la producción de Universal Pictures deja correr los créditos finales en lo que se supone que sea un momento de intriga y suspenso y sin concluir el conflicto principal.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023"," The Pitch: When last we left la familia, the sprawling multiracial ensemble that bops in and out of the Fast and the Furious franchise, things were relatively calm, with most of them on good terms with the law (despite their occasional extra-legal operations) and wealthy (thanks to said extra-legal operations). Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are even talking about the possibility of a potential younger sibling for their son Little B (Leo Abelo Perry). Then, of course, a bloody Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up on their doorstep with a warning: Someone arguably even more evil than her is coming for them. Take Your Fast Car and Keep on Driving: At this point, every new installment of the Fast saga feels less like an actual film and more like an episode of a TV show — a TV show with at least eight series regulars, and countless recurring stars as well. And as sprawling as that cast already is, the film adds even more newcomers to the mix, like Daniela Melchior as a young street racer from Brazil and Brie Larson as the daughter of the long-missing Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell). While Dante’s revenge quest at least keeps everyone on the same page narratively, the team is split up across multiple storylines, with Dom largely on his own as he jets around the world trying to stop Dante, and the film’s focus taking a slapdash approach to checking in on him as well as other big and small players from the franchise’s history. This devotion to franchise continuity might be fan-pleasing, but it also means that Fast X never really coalesces as a stand-alone film, even before ending on an epic cliffhanger. Director Louis Leterrier steps in here for Justin Lin, who abruptly left the production last year after two weeks of filming, and does a commendable job of mimicking what’s come before. He does such a good job, in fact, that it ends up feeling like just more of the same, even while trying to top the spectacle of the previous films. It’s all competently done, but fails to feel fresh. The Gang’s All Here: So Jason Momoa has never been accused of giving a subtle performance, but he’s perhaps his most unhinged yet here, literally twirling and jetee-ing through the carnage he causes around the world. Some might argue that “genderqueer Bugs Bunny” is redundant, but it’s a combination of words that got stuck in my head during his time on screen, aided and abetted by his gleeful sartorial choices and delicious scene-chewing. It’s honestly just nice to see someone having fun in these movies, which are otherwise a masterclass in deadpan asides and grumbling monologues.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," We’ve reached the point in the “Fast and Furious” bell curve where the series has flatlined. In Diesel-flavored irony, the only gravity the series has finally acknowledged is the franchise’s freefall back to earth. After a brief nitrous oxide boost of “stupid fun” in the middle movies, they’ve jettisoned the “fun” but kept pretending that Paul Walker is still alive… It’s gotten weird, right? We can admit that now? There’s a point at which this isn’t “preserving his legacy” and some kind of narrative “Weekend at Bernie’s” schtick that feels grody. The long-threatened end to the “saga,” in the loosest sense of all four of those letters, has finally arrived. Allegedly, this is the first of a three-part finale. Three. Parts. For all the globe-trotting across the 11 movies, none have really featured the Midwest, which adds to the aforementioned irony, given that this “final act trilogy” is the easiest way to describe what a “Midwestern goodbye” feels like on the inside. Anyway, “Fast X” is dumb, ugly, and awkward. It is goofy in the bad way, not goofy in the awesome way or goofy in the “Gawrsh!” way, either of which would have been better. It is uninspired, awkward, and the opposite of escapism. Few things can make you feel as trapped as looking at the time and realizing you still have hours ahead of watching folks who have no interest in acting make obligatory noises with their faces. Except for you, Charlize. You are doing what you can, and we love you. As the series simply cannot stop itself from doing, the bad guy is yet again a relative of someone from a previous film. It’s Dante, a bad Nicolas Cage impression worn by Jason Momoa. He seems like the only one having fun, but maybe that’s because he did a “Face/Off” riff for months and nobody on set called him on it. He’s not intimidating so much as a silly, silly Billy. He shows up, not to kill Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his grand-theft-auto Scooby gang, but to make them “suffer” for murdering his pops in that one “Fast and Furious” movie where they dragged a vault around like a wrecking ball. You don’t have to. The first half hour is just them literally replaying the best part of it with Momoa digitally inserted in the background looking pissy. In present day, Dante tries to blow up the Vatican and pin it on the Toretto family. He then takes all their money and gets Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) locked up in super-secret prison. John Cena goes on a plane ride with Dom’s kid while Tyrese and Ludacris incessantly bicker in London. Those actors may all have character names, but if they aren’t going to give them actual storylines after a jillion movies, nobody should have to remember them. Nobody is trying. Nobody. Not even kinda. The script is a Frankenstein’s monster of flashbacks and repetitive action beats that feel so un-furious as to beg ennui. Even the most die-hard of “Fast” fans will root for the villain, and not because he’s “cool” so much as he’s at least doing something. For a while, the series was something special, a diverse and liberated spectacle of oddly compassionate bravado and bombast. Now, it must simply die and die faster. The ferocity of the death is up them. “Fast X” has broken me upon its wheel, split me upon its axel. I’ll give you whatever you want, just make Diesel stop flexing, Cena stop mugging, and the word “family” stop losing all meaning. Between this and Elon Musk, if we have to get rid of all cars, I will proudly climb aboard a Segway or horse or just rollerblade everywhere. Nothing is worth this noisy, vapid futility. I will walk, dammit. I will walk. Maybe only when we are all just pedestrians, this can finally end. Wesley Morris at The New York Times says “The series doesn’t need Momoa’s vamping. The camp was always coming from inside the garage, the way these movies operated in defiance of physics, chronology, narrative logic and DNA. Their subject was criminals conflicted about going legit. Now they’re practically a government agency, out protecting the planet — and they’re so far through the moral looking glass that everybody looks too comfortable.” Rosa Parra at In Their Own League says “Be warned that you’re walking into a poorly written film whose sole saving grace is Momoa’s performance.” Sarah Gopaul at Digital Journal says “the film’s biggest downfall is perhaps the thing that’s tied all the movies together: its emphasis on ‘family.’ It’s a concept that was made top priority day one and has continued to be the glue for more than two decades. But it’s so heavily underscored in this movie, it becomes a punchline.”",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023"," You’ve got to hand it to the Fast and Furious franchise, it’s now lasted 10 installments and it never fails to give the fans exactly what they want: fast cars in impossible situations, tough guys, tough girls and major star power. Fast X does all the above with gusto, but its major flaw exists in the fact that it’s so full of stunt driving and stunt casting that filmmakers forgot to tell a cohesive or engaging story that makes much sense. In essence, the whole fast crew and their families are facing threats from dual sources, one of them the best villain yet, Jason Momoa as Dante, the crazy son of a Brazilian drug lord who Dom (Vin Diesel) killed years ago. Make no mistake about it, it’s worth the price of admission just to see Momoa’s over the top killer character alone. I love what he’s done with the place. And his hair? Sublime! Also sublime is the fact that Fast X features four, count ’em,  four Academy Award winning actresses, including Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Helen Mirren and Rita Moreno. These women hardly need to make appearances for the paycheck—they seem to be doing it for the fun of it all, as do so many others; Michelle Rodriguez, Scott Eastwood, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, John Cena and Jason Statham, to name a few. You’ll even see Paul Walker in a flashback scene, and The Rock, whom you thought would never grace the screen of a Vin Diesel movie again. They’re all as sharp as ever. Interestingly enough though, it’s Diesel, or his character Dom, who seems to be slipping a bit. What used to be a glowering gaze of barely controlled fury has turned into a pursed lip pout of…indecision? Confusion? Constipation? Whatever the case, there are far too many of these impossibly contrived, face to face confrontations with those who wish him dead. How many games of cat and mouse can one movie withstand? Not as many as we find in Fast X. It’s a punishing two hours and 21 minutes long. When you stage a car chase scene that involves a giant bowling ball bomb in flames smashing through Rome at the very beginning, it’s just plain exhausting trying to sustain that type of velocity through the entire film. And it’s not over yet! I’m sure you’ve heard by now that Part 2 of Fast X is still to come. At least we can look forward to more Jason Momoa and the Oscar quartet. Perhaps director Louis Leterrier is saving the best for last. Products recommended by At Home In Hollywood are selected by our editorial team. We often receive free samples of these products.

"May 19, 2023"," Back sometime in the early '90s, I had occasion to go with a buddy of mine to Vegas. He was there for a lawyer conference, I was there, ostensibly, to do some book research for a novel I was working on. Neither one of us had been before, so it was kind of a lark -- at least at first. I'm not a gambler, by nature or practice, so the casinos, with their visual overload, and constant money jangling, didn't do much for me. But I appreciated the weird neo-reality vibe of the place, the way in which time seemed unbound by our petty societal mores. It was always casino-o-clock there, and night had been permanently banished from the Strip -- along with taste, it must be said -- in favor of endless day, where you could spend every waking second losing more money to the greed-soaked corporations who were busy exploiting your human frailties for massive profit. It was an interesting sociological experiment for about 24 hours. After that, even while drinking copiously, it became a grinding slog, as if spending days and nights locked inside a Fuddruckers. After a time, it came to me that Vegas was what happened when you removed the soul from a place entirely, and, to make up for it, spent enormous gobs of money to replace it. Everything felt flimsy and weightless, like the veritable front-facade buildings in old-timey Western pictures, only with a lot more neon attached to them. Which brings us to the latest installment of the now 22-year-old ""Fast"" franchise specializing in macho bohunky posturing, ""wild"" CGI ""stunts"" that are so ridiculous Wile E. Coyote would roll his eyes, and the total destruction of a plethora of shiny supercars in the process. The series, which started out as a basic cop-and-villain action thriller, has come to the point where no one buys a ticket because they actually care about the characters (has there ever been an extended franchise run with the same actors in which so little character work has been accomplished? We're 10 films in now, and the camaraderie is about at the level of a standard episode of ""Super Friends""), or even the plots themselves (there are always villains -- big, angry, rich -- who have a bone to pick with Dominic Torreta, and his crew, and send giant mechanical octopus cars, and motorcycles with teeth, after them). No, they come, like the denizens of Vegas, for the thrill of rule breaking -- be those rules societal, with everyone breaking laws without regard for anything else; or physical, in which cars can go careening down the walls of a Hoover dam-like structure and emerge more or less intact -- and the creativity of said destruction. With that in mind, this latest film, helmed by veteran French action director Louis Leterrier, mostly knows what the ""Fast"" audience is expecting: a minimum amount of complexity, and a maximum amount of boom boom, set at a teeth rattling pace, jacked by a thousand hot music cuts, and filled with broad-shouldered dudes with massive biceps, and tough-as-nails women who can take a punch as well as any heavyweight. The first of a reported closing trilogy of films designed to give Dom (Vin Diesel), and his endless ""famiglia"" the longest goodbye imaginable, this installment opens with everyone at the L.A. compound in more or less in happy repose. Dom is giving his young son, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) ""driving"" lessons (involving looping, squealing-tire doughnuts around a deserted parking lot); his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is home with Dom's Ma (Rita Moreno), and the rest of the crew, Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson), along with various other family members. The series has long been besotted with the idea of family, to the point where it becomes a kind of one-note rubric for Dom, who goes on and on about the importance of family and how much you have to sacrifice in order to protect those whom you love (that is, when he's not spouting mumbling, dunderheaded junk poetry like ""She loved with her eyes, and bled from her heart""). As the closest thing the series offers in the way of thematics, I guess it might as well figure prominently enough, but Dom -- and the film -- are so relentless with the notion of whatever family means, it all begins to feel like so much sentimentalist drivel, a colorfully patterned carpet designed to distract you from all the people losing money at the slot machines. Besides, I'm not aware of any family that seems as blandly positive and lovingly reciprocal as Dom and his extended crew, including his younger sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and kick-butt bro, Jakob (John Cena). Everyone is so interconnected in these movies -- along with the idea that people in families win, while individuals always lose (they must not be watching the same mob movies as I) -- it begins to feel as if you can't possibly stand on your own and expect to survive. Family, of course, becomes more difficult to maintain if, say, your father happens to be a corrupt drug-running mastermind named Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who gets killed by Dom and his crew (way back in ""Fast Five"") after they steal a vault of his precious money. As told in ret-con flashback, this killing leaves his wild-eyed son, Dante (Jason Momoa), to plan his ultimate revenge on Dom: Not just killing him, but making him suffer greatly along the way. And we're off! This entails many plot-dense bits, with Dante tricking a squad of Dom's people to embark on a mission in Rome, that goes wildly off the rails, with a giant, metal, zorb-like bomb hurtling down the streets of the city, bringing chaos and destruction in its wake, and in the aftermath, getting pinned on Dom and his team. This, in turn, causes immediate disassociation from the Agency, the ultra-secret government organization that is definitely not the CIA, now led by yet another bruising hotshot, this one named Aimes (Alan Ritchson), who wants to finally bring Dom in and make him pay for his crimes. This comes against the wishes of another high-ranking Agency operative, Tess (Brie Larson), whose father, Mr. Nobody, used to be their main person of color before disappearing. Given Dante's need for revenge, his limitless wealth, and his unhinged personality -- Momoa plays him like a muscled-up Joker-esque agent of chaos, with a macabre sense of humor (painting the toenails of henchmen he has murdered), an affinity for loose, pastel silk pants, and a love for standing high up above his adversaries and raining mayhem down upon them while pirouetting -- we have another worthy adversary for Mr. Torreta, even as previous series villains, such as Shaw (Jason Statham), and Cipher (Charlize Theron), pop in here and there to help Dom's crew (as is often the case in this franchise, one film's big bad becomes the next film's unexpected benefactor) when needed. To the film's wobbly credit, it does at least include a scene where Aimes calls out some of the franchise's more ludicrous conceits (Everyone is in the family! All the supercars have to be demolished!), to at least tacitly acknowledge we aren't actually emulating reality in these affairs, but then the film just as gleefully sets up a dramatic scene near the end where a father's actual plan to rescue his son involves, shall we say, a tremendous, er, leap of logic that goes beyond ""unlikely"" and fully into ""recklessly negligent."" We end with a cliffhanger, of course, although it's anyone's guess as to how the filmmakers are going to string together enough story to cobble two more such installments. To be sure, however, as with giant new casinos, and multi-billion-dollar summer franchise blockbusters, where there is copious amounts of cash involved, there is always a way.

"May 19, 2023"," The American writer-director Ari Aster has made just three feature films, but already his name could be turned into a cinematic adjective: Aster-oid, perhaps, or Aster-isque. Then came his folk-horror triumph Midsommar (2019), in which Florence Pugh's character is left traumatised by the murder of her parents by her sister, who then killed herself. And now we have Beau Is Afraid, in which Joaquin Phoenix plays a mentally ill man in thrall to his distant mother (that's distant both geographically and emotionally). What all this dysfunction tells us about Aster's own background, I wouldn't like to say. Maybe nothing. But he certainly seems to view families as the root of all internal misery. He seems almost sane by comparison. But his paranoia mounts, to the point where it is hard to know whether his terrible misadventures are actual, or merely inside his own head. In a way Aster mines the same seam as Florian Zeller in his acclaimed 2020 film The Father, for which Anthony Hopkins won a Best Actor Academy Award. He gives us a portrait of mental instability from within, and I expect Phoenix, too, will be hyped as an awards contender. It is a bravura performance, sure enough, but also somehow showy: so extravagantly committed that you can practically see him grasping for another Oscar, having bagged one the last time he played a troubled man trapped in an urban nightmare, in the superior Joker (2019). Erase the taste of the BBC's controversial new adaptation of Dickens's classic with David Lean's 1946 Oscar-winning version, starring John Mills as Pip, and Alec Guinness. Beau's day really starts to go downhill when his keys and luggage are stolen from outside his sleazy apartment, which means he can't get to the airport for a flight to visit his mother (Patti LuPone). That kicks off a distressing chain of events, ending with him being stabbed by a lunatic and, as if that weren't enough, run over by a truck.  Act two begins with Beau waking up in the care of a kindly couple, Grace (Amy Ryan) and Roger (Nathan Lane). They have taken him into their home where she in particular makes him a surrogate for her own son, a soldier killed in combat.  But he is treated with hostility both by their daughter Toni (Kylie Rogers) and another house guest, Jeeves (Denis Menochet), a PTSD- ravaged army veteran. Whether this fellow is called Jeeves as an ironic reference to the PG Wodehouse character isn't clear. If he is, then it's a joke that doesn't work, very much like the film's third and strangest act, when Beau, after things go dreadfully wrong and Grace turns on him, legs it into a nearby forest with Jeeves in murderous pursuit. This time he finds sanctuary with a troupe of travelling actors, but before long we have been pitched into a parallel, partly-animated narrative, in which Beau is an ageing family man long separated from his wife and two sons. Again, this is evidently a manifestation of his own mind playing tricks. But really the trick is on us, forced to endure Aster's self-indulgence in a film so long and loopy that the final act, in which Beau has sex with a childhood friend, is reunited with his cruel, controlling mother even though — spoiler alert! — she has been decapitated by a falling chandelier, and encounters monsters in the attic, comes as a welcome relief from the proper weirdness. He plucked it from his own bookshelf. The original James Bond was the author of Birds Of The West Indies, Fleming's 'bible' at his Goldeneye residence in Jamaica, who was none too thrilled to discover his name had been stolen. Most of the JBs agree on two things: it's a blessing and a curse. A gift for chatting up girls; not so great when the police pull you over and assume you're taking the mickey. At a mere hour and 20 minutes long, The Other Fellow never outstays its welcome and ultimately proves more memorable (and certainly more original) than many big screen 007 outings. If you've caught any of the previous nine instalments, you’ll know what to expect from Fast X (12, 131 mins, ★★): cars, explosions, more cars, zero grasp on reality and far too much blithering on about ‘family’. There’s no point in attempting to tell you the plot, since this franchise lost it the moment they opted to send a car into space in Fast & Furious 9. Suspense or emotional investment, however, are feeling the pinch. The main aim seems to be to crowbar in as many A-list stars as possible: Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson — it’s more like a Vanity Fair party than a movie — yet only a splendid new villain (Jason Momoa) seems to be having any real fun. Luckily, he’s fabulous. For more than 50 years, Judy Blume’s coming-of-age books about the intimate tribulations of puberty have provided bosom buddies for girls fretting about first kisses, first periods and first bras (and when they’ll finally grow something to fill them). So it was a wise idea to re-angle this long-awaited movie version of Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret (PG, 106 mins, ★★★★), her 1970 bestseller, in a nostalgic manner that triggers cross-generational appeal. This means while our heroine may still be 11-year-old Margaret (an adorably sincere Abby Ryder Fortson), it’s veteran actress Kathy Bates who all but steals the show as her brash, relatably ‘difficult’ Jewish granny. Where once Blume’s books drew censorship in religiously conservative America, they now seem blissfully tame, even innocent, compared to the scary new terrain today’s TikTok tweens are facing.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," Fast X is an incredibly dumb time at the movies. Not just in an F9 “they took a car to space” kind of dumb (there’s also plenty of that, which is fine), but in a more fundamental Fate of the Furious “why did they name the baby Brian like he’s not still alive?” kind of way. There’s always room for big, dumb entertainment at the multiplex, especially the kind of pure, mind-numbing escapism at which this improbable billion-dollar franchise has excelled. Since the franchise apex of Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 it’s hard not feeling the constant drag of diminishing returns. An ever-evolving cast of regulars starts to feel like too much baggage even for this family––especially when they don’t even stay dead or are treated as goners even though they’ve just “retired.” A great summer actioner can be big and dumb, but it can’t also be clunky. Thankfully, Fast newcomer Louis Letterier, ever a big-dumb-movie workman, siphons enough goofy energy from some of his previous blockbusters to inject some verve back into this lumbering series. As perhaps the first in the Fast Saga to go harder on camp than any previous entry, Fast X finds its groove most when fully surrendering to it––whether you’re laughing with or at it, it’s certainly never boring. Much of that is thanks to Jason Momoa shaking things up as Dante, the big bad who’s been retconned in, with exquisite scrunchies and nail polish, as the son of Fast Five’s Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). He’s on a warpath of revenge for the death of his father. In truly remarkable fashion (literally), Momoa barrels through Dom’s machismo and muscle-bound platitudes on faith and family with a garish chaos both on and off the page. Every line is a big swing, and with all the bluster of a WWE villain is Momoa clearly enjoying himself so much that it can’t help but rub off. Diesel continues feeling more like a heavy center of gravity than an actual leading man. He’s been smart enough to know these films have only been as good as their brolic antagonists as of late, which explains his laborious turn as villain in Fate, or John Cena’s wholly unconvincing menace in F9. It’s worth noting that X’s reliance on Cena for his more cuddly demeanor is a canny choice. A course-correct from Momoa’s Indochino psychopath is certainly refreshing, especially when the only character beats Diesel could convincingly muster are about his (very much alive) friend Brian, who Dom eulogizes like he’s been dead since, say, 2015. The maximum effect of Momoa’s potency amidst this is both a bit much and not nearly enough. It’s hard not sensing every other member of this storied ensemble is extremely tired by comparison, held in a state of arrested development by their overlord Vin Diesel. The man has kept them paid for well over a decade, to be sure, but when they get brief moments to shine there’s a tinge of lamentation with the exhilaration. Some of the best action beats serve more as a reminder of all the great solo work they (i.e. Rodriguez, Theron, Statham) could have been doing the last ten years outside the realm of NOS and Coronas. It doesn’t entirely help matters that certain setpieces play perfunctory rather than motivated. Rodriguez and Theron resort to fisticuffs not because the story demands it, but because the fans do. Although it is a finely crafted brawl, and one of Fast X‘s better moments, it’s a literal distraction prompted by one of them amidst much more pressing matters, hindering character rather than servicing it. Leterrier does have a command for the bigger splashes, though, and the marquee centerpiece––featuring Dom playing some real-life Rocket League across Rome with a neutron bomb––is certainly more playful than anything in the previous two outings. These films have relied on video game logic for so many years that it’s shocking it took them this long to directly rip one off. Unfortunately, some of the most impressive bombast consists of moments already heavily featured throughout its promotion; Letty doing a bit of hopscotch on a motorcycle or Dom hauling two helicopters to the pavement loses a bit of its unabashed popcorn oomph. Despite it all, there are actual jokes that land (aside from the usual Tyrese clownery) and an uptick in gonzo energy the Fast films have been thirsting for. All told, Fast X is an improvement on its recent predecessors and perfectly welcome as distracting summer fare, but whether or not it will stall before the end of the road remains to be seen.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," Our story begins ten years ago in Rio, when Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team stole an entire vault from Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Reyes’ son Dante (Jason Momoa) was in one of the SUVs that gave chase and it got knocked off the bridge during the standoff. With his father’s words about how suffering is a worse payback than death ringing in his ears, Dante has spent the past decade plotting his revenge. His first step is to get Dom’s entire team framed as terrorists responsible for an attack on Rome. The Agency formerly run by Mr. Nobody is now under the command of an agent named Aimes (Alan Ritchson), much to the irritation of Mr. Nobody’s daughter, Tess (Brie Larson). When Aimes decides to go after Dom’s team, Tess goes rogue and tries to assist them whenever she can. Fast X feels exactly like what it is: A bridge movie, designed to get us from F9 to the Grand Finale (that is if the recent rumors of this being expanded into a trilogy don’t pan out). It’s still a lot of fun, while simultaneously being not so much. Just like each subsequent entry in the franchise, the physics-defying stunts are gloriously insane, which is what has kept us fans coming back time after time, right? I mean, you don’t go to a Godzilla movie because you want a plot that’s something akin to Dickens? You go for the monster mayhem, and if you get a good story to boot, then it’s a really nice surprise. Granted, the story accompanying the stunts in Fast X isn’t some deep deconstruction of our current societal ills or anything. It’s an average revenge tale that doesn’t bring much in the way of new ideas to the table. When not concentrated on car sequences or fight scenes, the script falters in comparison to the previous entries. We could always be assured of some entertaining subplots and interactions among the characters. Yet, with the exceptions of letting the good-natured ribbing between Tej and Roman (Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson) finally come to a head and the scenes with Jakob and Little Brian (John Cena, Leo Abelo Perry), it’s almost as if the script was struggling to find the words for any of the supporting players. One thing Fast X gets right is its villain. Momoa turns in a performance as Dante that’s quite entertaining. This is a Momoa we haven’t seen much of, completely stripped of his typical glower. He injects Dante with a massive amount of gleeful flamboyance, giving off strong Joker vibes to what could be viewed as Dom’s “Batman.” Despite its flaws, though, I—as a big fan of the entire Fast Saga—still had a lot of fun. At the end of the day, it’s a Fast film and I got my “monster mayhem,” so I’m happy.

"May 19, 2023"," 'Fast & Furious X' convierte las salas de cine en una fiesta en la que los motores rugen al cielo y en el que no falta gasolina, sangre y fuego. 'Fast & Furious X' llega a las salas como el principio del fin de una franquicia que, además de llevar dos décadas sorteando cualquier atisbo de verosimilitud dentro de su propio universo, ha sabido ignorar tendencias de la industria mientras se reinventaba una y otra vez para buscar su camino. Lejos queda ya aquel título sobre delincuentes de buen corazón con gasolina en las venas que lo comenzó todo y, de algún modo, si uno revisa ahora 'A todo gas' (Rob Cohen, 2001) descubrirá que ya contenía las tres ideas sobre las que Vin Diesel ha decidido que todo pivote: coches rápidos, conductores furiosos y barbacoas familiares. Louis Leterrier llegó como un parche casi improvisado a la dirección de esta décima entrega tras ""diferencias creativas irreconciliables"" entre Diesel y Justin Lin, arquitectos fundamentales de esta hiperbólica feria ambulante, pero el director ha sabido controlar el volante del pesado vehículo del que se ha visto sorpresivamente al mando y, por el camino, ha dado algo de sentido al viaje que llevaba dos capítulos aprovechando su propia inercia. No, Leterrier no ha esquivado la condición de épico sinsentido del ampuloso guion de Justin Lin y Dan Mazeau, esto sigue siendo una orgía de imposibles en la que todas tus fantasías están invitadas, pero sí hay más de cohesión entre actos que, con coches voladores, venganzas comiqueras y resurrecciones telenovelescas incluidas, nos hace atisbar algo similar a una trama, acercando el rimbombante despiporre que se nos ofrece en pantalla a la trilogía más certera dentro de esta colección, aquella que formaron 'Fast & Furious 5' (Justin Lin, 2011), 'Fast & Furious 6' (Justin Lin, 2013) y 'Fast & Furious 7' (James Wan, 2015). La historia remite directamente a acontecimientos ocurridos en el episodio estrenado en 2011, el que nos demostró que todos ganábamos si las leyes de la física que rigen nuestro universo abandonaban a los ladrones tuneros. Gracias este travieso vistazo al retrovisor aumenta su condición de culebrón interminable y, además de volver a ver a Paul Walker en pantalla, el nitroso universo encuentra a su propio Joker, un villano encarnado por un Jason Momoa que ha sido incapaz de esconder lo bien que se lo estaba pasando durante el rodaje, haciendo partícipe al público de su gozo con un histrionismo que, de no ser porque sale de él y pertenece al mundo de Diesel, estaríamos criticando. Pero recordemos que 'Fast & Furious X' no es solo una película, es el sueño de un loco, una celebración del blockbuster autoconsciente y que, pese a todo, se toma ridículamente en serio mientras se permite todas las licencias que serían censuradas en una reunión de directivos con algo de vergüenza. Quizá sí sea el momento para unir esto con el universo de 'Jurassic World'. Todos ganaríamos.

"May 19, 2023"," 
	If ChatGPT were to write a feature screenplay it could scarcely be more robotic or soulless than Fast X, the latest exercise from the action franchise that won’t die. This is less a movie than a series of, well, car crashes, many of them spectacular in a rote way but, like the rest of the pileup, completely removed from any emotional or logical context. It’s a numbing collage of fiery, stitched-together spectacles. You can feel your IQ draining with each passing minute. 
	Once upon a time there was an action movie about a group of street racers. It was ridiculous, but also good, silly fun, fairly modest in scale and pleasantly forgettable. That was, believe it or not, 22 years ago. Yes, The Fast and the Furious belongs to a pre-9/11 world, and its architects surely never foresaw that there would be ten of these things (and counting). But that’s what happens when people keep buying widgets. The industry continues to make them. 
	By now this franchise should have the car part down pretty well; it certainly maintains a “Can you top this?” flair on a movie-to-movie basis. In Fast X cars are catapulted and dropped from helicopters, blown up (more times than you can count), and flipped end over end over end. They are used as weapons as much as vehicles. But the movie’s most impressive feat is making all of this feel deadly dull. When all you eat is ice cream, you get sick of ice cream pretty fast. When all you get is automotive mayhem, you start hungering for something radical, like character development. Whatever recognizable humanity this series ever had has long since skidded off the road. With its listless callbacks to old characters and storylines, and a narrative that doesn’t even seem to care about making sense, Fast X really does feel like it was written by a software program.

"May 19, 2023"," In this, the tenth(ish) feature entry in the seemingly endless Fast and the Furious series about L.A. street racers turned freelance government agents, Vin Diesel and his pals are hassled through the streets of Rome, Rio, London, L.A., Portugal, etc. by a cheerful sociopath (Jason Momoa) with a vengeful grudge. It's lavishly and extravagantly produced, with a high-ticket cast, mostly playing characters from the earlier films. The beauty and glamour and diversity of these people, including but not limited to Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson and Jason Statham and Nathalie Emmanuel and Daniela Melchior and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Jon Cena and Brie Larson and Sung Kang and Charlize Theron and, no kidding, Helen Mirren and Rita Moreno, if you please, is undeniable. Momoa is droll as the chatty villain. And even though the movie is overlong, the settings are sun-drenched and sumptuous, and I found it surprisingly less tedious than I expected to sit through. But it's not cool. The many extended set-piece action sequences here are so preposterous that they make the James Bond flicks look like kitchen-sink realism. This silliness is not, in itself, what's pernicious about it, however. Even by action movie standards, Fast X is simply cavalier toward human life. As with the earlier films, the message of this movie seems to be that it's nearly impossible to be seriously injured, or to injure a pedestrian, in a high-speed car chase through a densely-populated urban area. It suggests that cars can almost fly, and that people can almost fly between cars in midair, with surgical accuracy. It suggests that you have leisurely amounts of time to plan your maneuvers in a hurtling vehicle. It suggests that if you're thrown from a hurtling vehicle and land on pavement, you can get up and shake it off as if you'd tripped on a porch step. What this movie suggests that cars, and human bodies, can do and withstand is recklessly delusional, and to assume that it has no effect on the behavior of real-life drivers raised on movies like this seems naïve. I don't want to be a killjoy. I've enjoyed many movie car chases over the years, and I enjoyed, albeit with a little guilt, some of this movie. But the Fast & Furious flicks take the seductive fantasy of invincible car action to a level that seems irresponsible to me. We hear a lot of complaints, from all quarters, about the negative influence of movies on, say, sexual morality, or racial perceptions, or the objectification of women, or toxic masculinity. Why can't the impact of movies on basic public safety be considered a moral issue?",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023"," ‘Fast X’ takes the team on a world tour as they try to avoid the wrath of a crazy villain bent on revenge by erasing them from the planet. It’s been more than 20 years since Dominic Toretto welcomed Brian O’Connor into his den of rubber-burning, car-loving thieves. Since then, the pack has gained and lost many of its members… some more permanently than others. They’ve made allies the world over, creating a reliable network of people they can call on in moments of distress. The team’s international escapades turned them into classified government assets and high-value targets. But time has reweighted the scales, putting greater value on the comforts of home than risky adventures. However, in Fast X, to retain the former they will need to engage in the latter one more time. Dom (Vin Diesel) has settled into fatherhood, building a home with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his son, “Little B” (Leo Abelo Perry) The team is less active but tighter than ever, still doing the occasional covert job for the government. Unfortunately, their peace and quiet is blasted into oblivion by a former foe seeking revenge. Dante (Jason Momoa) is an evil mastermind, always staying several steps ahead of the team, using Dom’s love for his family as a weapon against him and a means to make him suffer. But how does one stop a destructive force with a sadistic streak, endless resources and nothing to lose? This movie takes audiences around the world from the U.S.A to Europe to South America to mystery Black Ops sites. Each country brings new and familiar faces, and mass destruction. There are, of course, impressive wheels, ranging from a gold-plated Lamborghini to a McLaren Senna to American muscle like the Dodge Charger. However, there isn’t as much car play as is typically expected from the franchise. The major stunts bookend the movie, while there’s only one high stakes race. Instead, much of the street action is replaced by an unprecedented amount of hand-to-hand combat, which is unfortunately full of quick cuts and disorienting editing that diminishes the actors’ physical abilities (because who hasn’t been waiting for Letty v. Cipher (Charlize Theron) or Shaw (Jason Statham) v. Han (Sung Kang)). This poor decision-making is only surpassed by a sudden cut to black in the last act that would normally denote a commercial break. However, the film’s biggest downfall is perhaps the thing that’s tied all the movies together: its emphasis on “family.” It’s a concept that was made top priority day one and has continued to be the glue for more than two decades. But it’s so heavily underscored in this movie, it becomes a punchline as Dom’s relentless commitment to protecting his family is repeatedly tested. Moreover, Alan Ritchson is completely miscast as Aimes, seeming to have been selected for his physique rather than his suitability for the role. On the other hand, Momoa’s villain is deliciously over-the-top as he relishes playing the insane psychopath and delivers the picture’s best moments, singlehandedly raising the movie’s watchability rating. In addition, a lot of unexpected but familiar faces pop up over the course of the film to delight fans and maybe drop their jaws in at least one instance. COPYRIGHT © 1998 - 2023 DIGITAL JOURNAL INC.

"May 19, 2023",I think we all expect the movies to be silly and they have always been self-aware of how ridiculous they can be with their impossible stunts&#46; But sadly&#44; &quot;Fast X&quot; just proves that the franchise is running out of gas&#46;,NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," While none of us can make sense of their hilariously arbitrary titles (“Fast Five”, “Fast & Furious 6”, “Furious 7”, “The Fate of the Furious”, “F9”, etc.), one thing is for sure – the Fast and Furious movies have fully embraced what has made the franchise such a hit. Since taking a dramatic turn in 2011 with its fifth installment, the series has grown into one of the most expense and most profitable popcorn franchises in big screen history. The latest chapter is “Fast X” and it’s being advertised as the first film in a possible trilogy that will bring the adrenaline-fueled saga to an end (it even sports the tagline “the end of the road begins“). Vin Diesel returns as the series centerpiece Dominic Toretto. Pretty much everyone else is back as well for this $340 million last ride. “Fast X” doesn’t do anything to break the mold. So if you like the previous movies this one will deliver the same over-the-top, fuel-injected action spectacle you’ll be looking for. The reverse is also true. If you didn’t care for the other films in the franchise there’s nothing new in “Fast X” that will suddenly win you over. Well maybe Jason Momoa who plays the story’s giddily diabolical antagonist. He’s a blast and goes for broke in delivering a villain like none other we’ve seen in the franchise.  “F9” was a little wobbly with several nagging issues keeping it from living up to expectations. Still it had the crazy set pieces and most (not all) of the characters we have grown to love. As you might guess, “Fast X” amps up nearly everything. It’s not as distractingly absurd as “F9”, but it still features the franchise’s signature reality-defying action and it miraculously finds time to give everyone some meaningful moments.  It’s pure fan food, made from start to finish with fans in mind.  One thing is for sure, “Fast X” is far from a standalone movie. In fact you’re guaranteed to have more questions after the movie than you did at the start of it. Director Louis Leterrier, working from a screenplay by Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, puts a lot of things in motion and their cliffhanger ending leaves several loose story threads dangling. But that’s okay for a tale of the size and scope. Diesel gives one of his better performances of the series, portraying Dom as both tough-as-nails yet vulnerable. He loves his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) more than anything else and he has worked so hard to keep them and his extended family safe. But the constant worry is clearly taking an emotional toll on him. But once again the past comes back to haunt Dom. This time its in the form of the flamboyant and maniacal Dante Reyes (a hysterical and unnerving Momoa). He’s the son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a violent drug kingpin who was killed during 2011’s “Fast Five”. Dante is intent on paying back the man he holds responsible for killing his father and stealing their family fortune – Dominic Toretto. And what better way than by taking away what’s dearest to Dom – his family. Of course in the Fast & Furious movies family isn’t just blood kin. It also includes loyal friends like Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). Dom’s sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) and his little brother, Jakob (John Cena) also find themselves in the mix. That’s a lot of people to protect and the sadistic Dante knows it. So he hatches a meticulously crafted plan aimed at separating Dom’s loved ones and luring them all across the globe. Not even Dom can be five places at once. So the danger ratchets up and the personal stakes get higher and higher.  As the story takes shape Leterrier ushers us around the globe, making stops in London, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Portugal, and Antarctica among others. At each stop we meet old friends like Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) and some old enemies like Cipher (Charlize Theron). And there are plenty of new faces as well played by the likes of Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, and Alan Ritchson. Yes, it’s a massive cast. By the end it feels like this final story is only getting started. We’re left shocked by certain outcomes, wondering about certain fates, and curious for what lies ahead. And what can I say – I enjoyed the ride. Even more, Diesel and company did their job of leaving me genuinely looking forward to the next film. As with all the FF movies you have to endure a rather large amount of silliness, and buying into some of the plot machinations can be a challenge. Those are baked-in issues that have been around for years. But the franchise freed itself from the restraints of reality a long time ago. “Fast X” is openly self-aware yet it has an undeniably big heart. And Momoa brings a blithely psychotic energy that you can’t turn away from. It’s hard to get a good read on the film since so much is left for later. But the movie sets the table well, all while delivering just the kind of big budget popcorn entertainment it advertises. In the end, it’s hard to knock it too much for being exactly what its fans want it to be. “Fast X” is now showing exclusively in theaters. Sounds like a good plot for this franchise.  Dom’s got his work cut out for him.  Glad Cena is back as Jakob.  I wondered if he would be in the next one. Pretty much the whole gang is back (kinda) with a few new people added. I enjoyed it. But it is truly made for the fans. I watched, or tried to watch, F9 a couple of weeks.  I never got engaged with it – noisy, phony, whatever the plot was I just wasn’t interested in.  The phrase about “jumping the shark” came to mind, although I think it was more like jumping a whale. lol what are they going to do with the middle section there — like how is that differentiated from just another Chapter in the whole saga. This is absolute nonsense. I do believe there might be a gameplan with this one. Where each of the other films have had pretty tidy endings, this one clearly has a bigger story in mind. And I think I see how the three films might be segmented. I’m guessing this will slide right into that same lane for you. My daughter went with me to see it and we had a blast.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," “You know what gets harder? The work off-screen,” he growled (probably), to industry weekly Variety. “The thinking, the expanding. There’s a reason why Tolkien stopped writing after a while.” Now, a full 10 years after his dad was killed by Diesel’s Dom Toretto, it’s just occurred to him that he should be out for revenge. So the next two-and-a-half hours of CGI-heavy car chases and choppily edited fight scenes mostly involve Dante chasing Dom and his “family” of off-the-books spies around the globe. Occasionally, he’ll catch Dom, flounce about a bit then let him go. At one point he puts his mission on hold to challenge him to a muscle car race. Tej (Ludacris) describes Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as “the black Bezos”, referring to the sequence in the last film where he drove a car into space.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," It’s fitting that the first two sequences in Fast X are an elaborate car chase followed by an intimate family barbecue, because that pretty much defines the Fast & Furious franchise at this point. Ten films and 22 years into the series — which isn’t slowing down anytime soon — it’s all about fan service for the legions of devotees who treat each installment like a reunion among friends who share an affinity for machines that are fast and loud. They probably won’t care that the basic concept lost its freshness long ago or that emotional depth and narrative logic still take a backseat to over-the-top mayhem punctuated by a barrage of screeching tires and pyrotechnics. Every sequel, it seems, revolves around raising the bar in terms of visual spectacle, exotic locales, visual effects, stunt work, car chases, clever titles, and cameos. This latest film follows the same frenetic template. Yet even by series standards, the globetrotting plot bridging the set pieces feels uninspired and rudimentary as it funnels toward an obligatory high-stakes final showdown. As always, the storyline is driven by shifting loyalties and cloudy motives surrounding covert government agent Dominic (Vin Diesel), who’s targeted by a vendetta from a sadistic adversary, Dante (Jason Momoa). That sends Dominic back into action along with his regular crew — Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang). Meanwhile, as Dominic’s family is threatened, his young son (Leo Abelo Perry) flees with Dominic’s brother (John Cena) for protection. With considerably more brawn than brains, the follow-up from French director Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me) features a handful of amusing quips and a menacing villain in the flamboyant Dante. Some of the action scenes are genuinely thrilling, of course, such as an armored truck chase through the streets of Rome, an intense street race in Rio, and a perilous mid-flight plane escape. There’s a mix of new and familiar faces, with appearances this go-around including Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Scott Eastwood, Pete Davidson, a deepfake of the late Paul Walker, and more. As a series motivated more by financial than creative ambitions, there’s not much incentive to change the formula. Perhaps it deserves credit for longevity, but with Fast X, it feels like the franchise is running out of gas.",NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023"," Before walking into Fast X, this formally two-part chapter (this film was announced as 2 movies to conclude the series) was formally touted as a possible trilogy by Vin Diesel and director Louis Leterrier. Ergo, an epic conclusion akin to The Lord of the Rings, obviously. But instead of walking to Mordor, we’re driving. It feels important to note that, unlike all previous Fast and Furious films, there is no real conclusion here. In fact, it does seem as though this is all set up for two MORE films in this series that has bucked every trend and statistic Hollywood has for a franchise, as we end on a cliffhanger and Vin’s comments are now in the ether. So, is Fast X basically The Empire Strikes Back with cars, bridging the upcoming films together with real stakes and emotional complexities? Have you ever seen one of these movies?! If the answer is no, then don’t start here. There are literally 463 characters in Fast X, and half of them carry baggage from previous films. This is a series built for the long haul, not a quick trip, and despite the previous films all having a beginning and definitive conclusion of sorts, this adventure is all about the family you already know. There’s that word: Family. It deserves to be capitalized as it’s basically a name as synonymous with the Fast and Furious films as Dom Toretto and oversized cross necklaces. For this entry, the entire Fast Family is back – Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris, who has a hilarious bobblehead gag), Han (Sung Kang), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Queenie (Helen Mirren), Shaw (Jason Statham), Cipher (Charlize Theron), Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) and Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). The cast budget alone for these films is easily approaching ONE BILLION a movie as we also get treated to new Family members Abuelita (Rita Moreno, here solely because it’s freaking Rita Moreno), Tess (Brie Larson, as Nobody’s daughter, also in the Agency), and Isabel (Daniela Melchior, you’ll see how). Not to mention, Aimes (Reacher’s Alan Ritchson, glistening with a fresh tan and Cheshire Cat smirk), a new Agency lead who is brought in to hunt down the Family for reasons that will become obvious as you watch the film. Aimes also delivers a witty breakdown of the series thus far, a sounding board for all the Twitter haters out there who insist on reminding anyone who will listen that they don’t like these movies (FYI – we don’t care). I am being careful not to spoil Fast X because, believe it or not, there are a few genuine surprises this time. Suffice it to say, the Family is under siege by the son of Fast Five’s Hernan Reyes, Dante (Jason Momoa). His father was killed in the safe siege of that earlier film, and Dante has had a decade to prepare for his wrath. His plan is as elaborate as any Bond villain, and as ridiculous as any Marvel entity. But let’s just agree that if you’re hanging with this series 10 movies in, you stopped caring about plotting a LONNNNG time ago. So, what do you care about? Action? Stunts? Shunning gravity and physics alike? FasTen your seatbelts and strap in, because the set-pieces are insanely bombastic and maniacally joyful to behold. Thankfully we stayed away from space this time, but that doesn’t make this film any more grounded than the last. Taking over for Justin Lin (who left due to exhaustion), director Louis Leterrier is a solid fit for the Fast franchise, as he knows how to keep the pace and characters constantly moving. Our Family gets separated numerous times, leading to various fight scenes, car chases, bonkers stunts (the Rome scene as our heroes attempt to thwart an attack on the Vatican is phenomenal), and even a few quiet moments of touching reflection. After a rather mundane and dreary entry with F9 (which established that this series is completely OK retconning massive story elements like Han dying in an exploding car or Dom and Mia having a previously never mentioned brother), Fast X gets back on track. It’s still mindlessly absurd and utterly ridiculous, of course, but the FUN is back. The entire cast delivers as they all have in previous films, they ARE these characters by now, and somehow each cast member gets their own sliver of screen time to shine. That said, the standout is easily Jason Momoa. Despite essentially borrowing the same plot as Furious 7, this is a perfect mesh of character and actor which simply works. Dante is Jack Sparrow if Joker was his father and vengeance was his motivator: a whirlwind of chaos, destruction, and sexual nuance. Clearly relishing his chance to bounce off the deep end, Momoa single-handedly saves this series from imploding on itself with self-seriousness, rejuvenating it in the process. Madness, glee, and a complete lack of empathy make for the best villain in the franchise thus far, and finally one that has no place for redemption in our established Family. He’s THAT good. Fast X returns the endless franchise to its rightful place near the top of ridiculous action films, and much of that is thanks to the gleefully mad performance from Jason Momoa as the series' new big bad. ",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," The Fast & Furious franchise has been about many things since it started as a comparatively modest street-racing thriller back in 2001. It’s been about cars, obviously: cars that go fast and drift around corners and, in later movies, prove themselves capable of launching into orbit and tenderly catching people on their hoods as though cradling them in cushioned catcher’s mitts. It’s about family, in both the biological and the found sense, with the latter slowly sucking in so many past antagonists that the movies occasionally take a beat to acknowledge who has previously tried to kill whom. It’s about the lingering allure of Hollywood bombast, and about the successful exporting of the kind multiethnic ensemble that same Hollywood used to insist the rest of the world didn’t want, and about gyrating butts in close-up. But now that the Fast & Furiouses are firmly in their dotage — Fast X is more self-referential remix project than film, an idiot 2046 for a series out of new roads to zoom down — what they’re especially about is the state of stardom. No actor seems able to escape the gravitational pull of these movies, and it doesn’t feel like a spoiler to note that some well-known ones make unannounced appearances in this latest installment. Between all the returning cast members and the new ones, Fast X is deliriously unwieldy. It’s barely able to attend to all the big names involved — like, who needed Brie Larson to be in this and why? — and the way it hoards them turns the movie into an unintended treatise on how much power has tipped from stars to brands. The celebrities need this aging blockbuster saga more than it needs them, and the ones who try to leave come crawling back eventually, with their characters’ deaths or departures retroactively explained away. Vin Diesel himself took off after The Fast and the Furious, which alongside Pitch Black helped vault him into prominence. But by 2009, after The Chronicles of Riddick flopped and he’d starred in a fish-out-of-water babysitting comedy, he wasn’t just back in the role of Dominic Toretto, he’d been promoted to producer as well. If you can’t leave the series, you may as well become it, and Diesel’s fused himself to this IP so thoroughly that, mid-production on Fast X, he managed to chase away director Justin Lin, who alongside writer Chris Morgan was one of the franchise’s main architects (Lin retains a screenplay credit). The Transporter’s Louis Leterrier took over, though the film plays more like it was made by an AI versed in the existing movies but not quite up to spitting out something coherent itself. It is, despite all this, a decent diversion, though watching it feels like sustaining a head injury. Not far into the run time, a bloody Charlize Theron shows up at the Toretto house (remember how Charlize Theron is in these now?) as yet another villain looking to turn ally. “There’s a war coming. Sides will be chosen and everyone you love will be destroyed,” she gasps out; these are basically evergreen words for this franchise that would have fit into at least four past films. Theron’s cyberterrorist Cipher has had a run-in with ascendant baddie Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), who in classic fashion has been retconned into the series as the son of Hernan Reyes, the Rio de Janeiro drug lord played by Joaquim de Almeida in Fast Five. Momoa does not attempt a Brazilian accent, but he is — how to put this — doing something like a femme affectation? Dante wears flamboyant outfits, paints his dead victims’ toenails, and trills “Buongiorno!” while tumbling a neutron bomb through the streets of Rome like a giant pinball. He jokes about looking to tone down the masculinity and is vaguely reminiscent of the gender-dissident revolutionary played by Silvero Pereira in Bacurau, though that’s surely overthinking things. Mostly, Momoa is going big, though given how outsize Fast X is, it just ends up registering on the same scale as everything else. I didn’t hate it! Fast X finds the family getting framed by Dante and trying to find him while being pursued by the Agency (formerly headed by Kurt Russell, the only actor in the world not in this movie), the secret organization Dom & Co. have done jobs for in the past. The characters get split up and clumped into their own subgenres — Nathalie Emmanuel, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, and Ludacris are doing light comedy, while Michelle Rodriguez and Theron are in a gritty escape flick, John Cena and Leo Abelo Perry (playing Dom’s son) embark on a buddy road-trip movie, and Larson is in a girlboss spy drama alongside Reacher’s Alan Ritchson as new Agency boss Aimes. Flipping between all these tones is disorienting, but the movie settles down whenever Diesel is onscreen, mostly because Diesel is acting harder than anyone has ever acted in their life, and also because the movie is for him. Every line he delivers feels engineered to be clipped and used without context for promotional purposes. Shots linger for a beat too long on his face, which has begun accruing the vague unreality of a CGI creation. When he, say, jerks his head around at an unexpected sound, it’s so dramatic it can startle a laugh out of you. Fast X may treat movie stars like they’re a dime a dozen, but it’s an altar for its lead, lifting him up like a minor deity fallen to earth. The series may be running on fumes, but as it coasts toward what’s promised to be its final episode, you can at least count on it doing everything it can to make Diesel look larger than life and sound twice as gravelly.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," In many ways, Fast Five was the turning point of the Fast and Furious franchise. It iterated upon the previous films in the franchise, but it ended with what might be the series’ best set piece: a vault dragged through the streets of Rio de Janeiro by two cars, defying physics and reality, and what could have been the series’ moment of jumping the shark. However, one spin-off and five movies later, even thinking about the notion of this franchise “jumping the shark” seems so blasé. Fast Five’s final set piece was a warning shot, but the franchise took itself to new heights (quite literally), and Fast X feels like the franchise finally accepting that it has taken things far enough. Scribbled in the margins of every screenplay in the series so far, already littered with the word “family” or “faith,” are more instances of the word “family.” Could this person have a sibling? Just because this person killed this person, can they still be family? Is blood all that matters to call someone family? Director Louis Leterrier’s foray into the franchise with Fast X represents the choking point of that, as new characters are introduced, and Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) family might be too big to save everyone.  At least, that’s what Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is counting on. Fast Five isn’t just the turning point of the franchise; it’s now become the origin of its greatest villain yet. After his father, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), is killed and his money burned by Dominic Toretto and his crew after the vault heist in Brazil, Dante spends a decade planning the ultimate act of vengeance against a man who values family over himself. It’s a decently handled enough retcon, though pales compared to the multi-movie retcon of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.  Luring part of Dom’s crew to Rome, Fast X finally shifts into gear when Dante begins playing with Dom and his crew – pretty much all of which return here – and starts targeting the family one by one. The Rome sequence is the highlight of the film for multiple reasons. First, it’s got a lot of the improvised action that the crew has always utilized effectively. Every plan that falls apart, whether by dumb luck or by design, is replaced by a plan B. It’s the Fast and Furious way, and it’s one of the few times it feels understood in Fast X. The second, and perhaps the most vital reason that the Rome sequence works as well as it does, is Jason Momoa. Embodying a character who has nothing left to live for and loves that about himself, Momoa is the most charismatic performance in the film. Dancing his way through scenes, providing comedy through anarchy, Momoa wears the spoiled-son-turned-vengeful character with more panache than any villain in the past. It’s the jolt the franchise needed as it continues to drone on and on about how much family and faith matter. It was understood many movies ago, and Dante is the necessary shock to the system that characters like Brixton from Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw or Cipher (Charlize Theron, who again returns) were supposed to represent. His singular purpose is to burn Dom’s world down. As more characters get added to the roster, like Mr. Nobody’s daughter, Tess (Brie Larson), or new government hotshot, Aimes (Alan Ritchson), so too does the number of targets for Dante. It also means too many characters to keep track of, especially when they keep getting separated from each other. This leads to one of the most glaring problems in Fast X and something that many franchises winding down have struggled with: balancing pacing with clarity. The final seasons of Game of Thrones started speeding their way from destination to destination, removing the breathability and character work in exchange for the meat and potatoes of the plot. Fast X is no different, as it can’t sit still long enough to make new characters matter or forge relationships that require time before they can truly manifest. It also literally can’t sit still as location names are plastered on the screen before the point of the scene is even digested. This, unfortunately, mires the action sequences as well. The most notable sequences are Rome and the final setpiece (though even the latter is sprinkled with familiar beats from previous films in the series) because they are given time to breathe. There are so many moving parts in a good Fast and Furious setpiece, so it’s unfortunate that Fast X goes for quantity over quality for its action scenes. There is more action in this film, and even though it seems slightly settled down in Brazil at a certain point, it also has so many characters all over the world that it can’t stay centered on one character for too long. The actual action itself is solid, but without the team dynamics, or the chaotic energy of Momoa’s performance, it is often well-executed but without any excitement. That being said, it’s important to stress how much better a scene with Dante is compared to the rest of the action. A loose cannon, his motives force Dom to not just make split-second decisions to save the day but also to save his family. A street race gone awry emphasizes Dante’s intent of creating controlled chaos: where even the right decision still has a consequence. He highlights the stakes in his every action, capitalizing on Dom’s selfless nature to push him out of safety. His prevalence throughout the film keeps it entertaining even when the scene itself may not matter. What will undoubtedly annoy most is that Fast X doesn’t have an ending. It barely has a plot for most of the time. Dante’s plan is so singular and simple – inflict the maximum amount of suffering upon Dominic Toretto – that the film doesn’t have anything to add at a certain point. It has introduced characters that it can’t quite make matter; when it does try, it’s haphazardly. It separates characters for no point other than to separate them, ultimately leaving the potentially fun dynamic of Dante versus Dom’s crew as a hope for the sequel.  The problem is that Fast X doesn’t feel like it’s setting up anything substantial. Its threads barely matter, with the only throughline being that the only way to hurt Dom is through his family. He only cares about making sure his family is okay, no matter how extended that family may become. That Fast X pokes at that throughout makes it entertaining, even when spinning its tires. One of the only compelling elements of the screenplay (written by Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin) is a fumbled attempt to tackle sainthood and selflessness through a musclebound softie who puts his life in danger at every turn – just to keep the ones he loves safe. Arguably, Fast X suffers most from trying to be everything at once without any weight to it all. Things have happened by the time the credits roll, but it’s multiple vignettes all essentially cutting to black before the third act can begin. Outside of Dominic, it does not ever feel like anyone else matters. Even Dominic has acknowledged that the one person who he couldn’t live without is his son. Every other character is sent off in the background, with acknowledgment from the audience only once the credits roll that we will see them again in the next film.  A few reveals at the end (including a post-credits scene that is less awesome than it thinks it is), and eventually, it becomes clear that Fast X was never a whole movie. Omitting an ending to lure audiences into theaters for the sequel is one thing, but what always worked about the Fast and Furious movies is that they could complete a narrative and then later pick it back up. Fast X picks up the Fast Five thread but decides to forgo closure, instead focusing on a character parading through the streets causing mayhem and destruction.  Fast X is an idea without direction: fun in the moment, but the lack of closure on any arc and the mishandling of other arcs serve as a reminder that the franchise was always held together by duct tape. Unfortunately, as it approaches the finish line, it finally feels like it’s falling apart.

"May 19, 2023"," After skipping installments 2-5 in the improbably resilient series following an allergic reaction to The Fast and The Furious, I caught up with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew of reformed criminals in the abysmal Fast & Furious 6 out of professional obligation and have reviewed each subsequent adventure. Three films later, I had my first tolerable experience of the saga with F9 — my fifth overall watch, bringing me in line with the numbskulls who kept pace with the franchise and crowned Fast Five as its first consensus “actually good” entry in 2011. That must be what it takes for the series of cinematic concussions known as The Fast Saga to wear down viewers to the point that they start accepting them as legit entertainment. Because after my “I don’t hate this” experience with the 2021 installment, Fast X is the first to enter borderline recommended territory. And no, it’s not thanks to the writing or any of the performances from the series regulars. Following an extended opening that revisits Fast Five’s Rio De Janeiro heist from the perspective of Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, Desperado) and his hot-tempered son Dante (Jason Momoa), Fast X gets back to Dom, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and their son B (Leo Abelo Perry) in Los Angeles where scattered mentions of “family” always seem to be accompanied by the corniest musical cue possible. Once again, Diesel puts minimal effort into his performance, and the painfully unfunny “comedic rapport” of dull side players Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) is naturally also back, along with plenty of other ho-hum additions over the years who pop up throughout the film. (If you think someone appears, they probably do, especially if they’ve become famous in the interim.) But despite the factors that ideally would have made this series a one-and-done back in 2001, Fast X damn near succeeds thanks to its new blood. Overcoming some ridiculously schlocky CGI, Louis Leterrier (The Transporter; The Brothers Grimsby) pulls off multiple memorable set pieces, beginning with an elaborate chase through Rome with a giant round bomb resembling the more nefarious cousin of the boulder from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Orchestrating the chaos, Momoa is clearly having a blast leaning into Dante’s unhinged, flamboyant ways and earns plenty of laughs with his combination of one-liners and physical comedy. Nearly matching him is the return of John Cena as Dom’s little brother Jakob, essentially playing a new character in line with a PG-13 version of the actor’s Peacemaker, cracking wise with B while shepherding his nephew to safety in entertaining super spy fashion. Earning a few laughs of her own, Brie Larson classes up the joint as Tess, the daughter of the currently missing spy ally Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and our heroes’ lone friend in The Agency, whose muscular new head honcho Aimes (Alan Ritchson, Reacher) plays into Dante’s master plan by labeling them the world’s most wanted criminals. All of these factors and more converge in physics-defying, laugh-in-disbelief ways as the team remains at least one step behind Dante, whose commitment to making Dom suffer pulls career-best work from Momoa and leaves the series with its most effective cliffhanger yet.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023"," THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise started modestly in 2001 as a tale of street racing and car theft. The second and third entries were only lightly related to the first, but with 2009’s fourth installment, FAST & FURIOUS, continuity became a factor. Then the budgets got larger, the stakes got higher, and the casts got ever larger as former antagonists became allies. As for continuity, it is now so much a part of the FAST films that it might help (assuming one doesn’t regularly rewatch them) to read a few synopses before jumping into FAST X, which is the tenth feature in the now twenty-two-year-old feature series. For those who need a refresher, FAST X begins with flashbacks, using clips from 2011’s FAST FIVE, where Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O’Conner (the late Paul Walker) and their crew took down Rio de Janeiro-based drug lord Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). It turns out that Reyes’s psychopathic son Dante (Jason Momoa) doesn’t so much hold a grudge as just want an excuse to torment a worthy opponent. Sure, there’s an element of, “You killed my father, prepare to die,” but Dante really likes his games. Besides, one of his dad’s primary lessons was that, instead of killing an enemy outright, it’s better to make foes suffer by targeting their loved ones. It’s hard to know what to make of Dante’s flamboyance in terms of whether it’s intended as homophobic (the “Look, this character is so evil that he’s even gay!” trope) or just Momoa trying something new that shows his enthusiasm. Dante enjoys mayhem more than most people enjoy anything, and Momoa plays him with the delight of the proverbial kid in a candy store. Returning actors all do what they do well, with Michelle Rodriguez as Dom’s wife Letty continuing to come off as effortlessly badass, and Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren both seeming particularly happy to be back. John Cena as Dom’s brother Jakob gets to lighten up and be humorous this time around. Leo Abelo Perry is appropriately wide-eyed and energetic as Dom and Letty’s little boy. Rita Moreno is on hand as Dom, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and Jakob’s grandmother, which somehow feels right. Franchise newcomers Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson, as government agents at odds with each other, both fit into the tone with ease. Speaking of tone, while “restraint” would be vastly overstating the case, the screenplay by Dan Mazeau & Justin Lin, from a story by Dan Mazeau & Justin Lin and Zach Dean, based on characters created by Gary Scott Thompson, takes things down a hair from the previous outing, 2021’s F9: THE FAST SAGA. Yes, everything is still outlandish and overly earnest and enormous, but at least we’re not launching into space with duct tape (there’s a brief reference made to this sequence, but it doesn’t get explored at length). The vehicular action and explosions, as directed by Louis Leterrier (of the first two TRANSPORTER films), are properly kinetic. While the story does have an episodic feel – at one point, we’re following five separate characters/character groups – it’s fairly coherent, and even manages to pack a few surprises. The biggest of these comes mid-end credits. FAST X ends on a big cliffhanger. It didn’t strictly have to, since FAST & FURIOUS fans have long since demonstrated they’ll show up for the ride whether they’re in suspense or not. FAST X delivers on what it promises with proficiency. It doesn’t transcend its essential nature, but there’s no reason that it should.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," Fast X is the most absurd entry yet in the long-running franchise, and that’s saying something, considering the crew journeyed into outer space in the previous installment, F9: The Fast Saga. But this is 140 or so minutes of pure obnoxiousness. Writers Dan Mazeau (Wrath of the Titans) and series regular Justin Lin (who directed four others) embrace the comic book, anything-goes, Looney Tunes aesthetic established around the time of Fast & Furious 6 and run wild with it. Nothing makes sense. Granted, I’m not sure it is supposed to. The time, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are forced to face off against Dante Reyes (Jason Mamoa), the larger-than-life, flamboyantly homicidal son of deceased Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), the charismatic heavy from Fast Five. Dante’s out for revenge. But he doesn’t just want to kill Dominic and his clan; he wants to make the fast-driving thief turned government superhero suffer. Most notably, he’s after “Little” Brian Toretto (Leo Abelo Perry), and he’s willing to slit every throat standing in his way to get his hands on the child. I’m not going to try and make sense out of any of this. I mean, if the movie doesn’t care to try and do it, why should I? Just know that Dante’s plan sends Dominic’s clan sprinting across the globe from Brazil to England, from Portugal to even Antarctica. But the dastardly baddie is roughly four steps ahead of every move they make as he tirelessly endeavors to achieve his vengeance against those responsible for his father’s death a decade prior. Pretty much everyone is back, including Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, Nathalie Emmanuel, Scott Eastwood, John Cena, and Helen Mirren. As for the newcomers, after Momoa, there’s also Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, and even Rita Moreno. There are massive stunts (mostly involving cars), cartoonish special effects (mostly involving cars smashing things like helicopters and the law of physics), and feats of derring-do (also — you guessed it — mostly involving cars). Things explode. There are a few narrow escapes. The human body gets thrown around like a pinball and barely gets a scratch. There are gunfights and fistfights galore (not to mention fistfights that turn into gunfights — and vice versa — at the drop of a hat). In short, it’s everything and more that audiences have come to expect from these films, and the more insane they get, the bigger the take at the box office seems to be. But when is enough enough? At what point do audiences start to tune out? While Fast X is reported to be the last turn around the track for Dominic Toretto and company, that it has been split into three chapters strikes me as a level of overkill even this goofy series should have steered away from. While I’m sure the story will get more convoluted as things near their conclusion, the simple truth is that there isn’t a lot of meat on this bony carcass. Going the Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame route with all this madness feels to me like a step too far, and the comical cliffhanger ending makes things even worse. Lin’s decision to step away as director (during the early days of filming, no less) over “creative differences” is noticeable. It’s not that journeyman Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) isn’t up to the challenge so much as that his focus is more on the visual carnage than the human element. As blatantly melodramatic as the character interactions may be, as inanely convoluted as the mythology has gotten with each new chapter, Lin still maintained an emotional authenticity that was admittedly endearing. That’s not the case here. Not that Leterrier doesn’t try. There is a focus on Dominic’s relationship with his son Brian, and that’s to be expected. But anything else involving these characters — both old and new — feels pulled from a how-to workbook that could easily have been subtitled “Soap Opera Emotional Theatrics for Beginners.” The director becomes so consumed by the razzle and the dazzle that he appears to forget to give the audience worthwhile reasons to care, and that’s one gigantic chasm no supply of nitrous oxide could help this beaten-up wreck of high-octane lunacy jump across. What Fast X does have is Momoa, and he’s extraordinary. The actor knows exactly what kind of movie he is in and precisely what is needed from him. His performance isn’t over the top — it’s ten or eleven steps beyond that. Momoa gobbles up every stitch of scenery. Dante goes from silly to cutthroat to playful to deathly serious at the drop of a hat. The villain oozes psychotic menace out of every pore of his monstrous frame, and I admit I’m curious to see if Momoa can maintain this freakishly high level of titanic villainy for the entirety of this climactic trilogy. But only slightly. As impressive as the Fast saga’s evolution has been since its inauspicious, small-scale beginnings back in 2001, the unrepentantly mind-numbing stupidity is wearing thin. Old-school Saturday matinee serial cliffhanger be damned, I honestly don’t know if I care to find out how Dominic and company continue their fight against Dante. And considering how meaningless death has become to this franchise, it’s hardly surprising this tank is running perilously close to empty, and I don’t foresee a refill happening anytime soon.

"May 19, 2023",Is it good&#63; Does it matter&#63;,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," If you’re familiar with this franchise, then there’s no secret of what to expect: a whole lot of ridiculous and entertaining action sequences that defy any laws of physics, along with modest acting. Diesel delivers some of the most hilarious lines (in an attempt to be serious though). In fact, the script is a weak element of this entry.  The Fast family gets larger and larger by the minute, such that it feels overstuffed and not giving enough time to spend with some of the members. What’s a little disappointing is the lack of seriousness given to death. This is the new MCU where any death in the series doesn’t have any impact because the dead pop up a few films later. There were many cameos (stay for the mid-credit scene) with one surprise cameo in the third act that genuinely delighted me.  Momoa is a scene stealer. His malicious villainous character is refreshing, and it intrigues me to see what he does in the rest of the installments. He brought to this franchise a never-before-seen villain that gave it a breath of fresh air. His character does have a level of menace and a threatening presence that would probably bring something these films haven’t had in a while – high stakes.  This film is one where you must absolutely turn off your brain though, particularly the area used for logic. Be warned that you’re walking into a poorly written film whose sole saving grace is Momoa’s performance. There are cars racing and cars exploding, and now the addition of helicopters utilized in all the commotion.  Overall, “Fast X” minimally improves from its last two films, the majority of it being the addition of Momoa. His performance alone is worth the ticket entrance. He doesn’t fail to deliver nonsensical action with atrocious dialogue but is an enticing villain that did enough to spark my curiosity for the upcoming entries. This film is nothing groundbreaking that does what any blockbuster movie sets to do though – entertain. ",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," At this stage, you know exactly what to expect from a Fast & Furious movie, and Fast X doesn’t even try to reinvent the many wheels that burn rubber from beginning to end. That’s either a positive or a negative depending entirely on how you feel about the franchise, because the suitably ludicrous 10th chapter in the long-running series isn’t interest in winning over the newcomers. If there’s a checklist these things need to tick in order to succeed, then replacement director Louis Leterrier seems to have read it diligently before ticking every single one of them. It’s definitely fast and most certainly furious – which are obviously the two most basic requirements – but it also plays as something of a Greatest Hits package for better or worse. Is there the obligatory street race scene to remind you of The Fast and the Furious‘ lowly origins as a B-tier thriller, replete with many gratuitous butt-shots? You bet. Does Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto continue his rampaging vendetta against any item of clothing that boasts sleeves? Of course. Does he come out with inane lines of dialogue that repeatedly indicate how important family is to him? Based on such gems as “No-one starts at the finish line” and “Nothing’s impossible, you just have to have faith,” that’s a positive. Most importantly of all, though, are there a string of action sequences that defy the laws of physics, gravity, and logic to continue The Fast Saga‘s evolution into full-blown superhero territory? Naturally. For a property that saw Dwayne Johnson divert a torpedo with his bare hands, Ludacris and Tyrese jet off into space, and Diesel single-handedly destroy a parking garage to name but three, it truly boggles the mind how the design team manages to not just keep coming up with such deranged set pieces, but have them make complete sense within the context of the world. Another hallmark that Fast X makes sure to incorporate is retcons aplenty, with Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes introduced as the son of Fast Five‘s nefarious drug lord Hernan, while Oscar-winning legend Rita Moreno debuts as the ultimate matriarch of the Toretto clan, along with Brie Larson’s Tess being established as the daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody, because everything needs to be connected somehow. Despite its status as one of the biggest brands in the history of the box office, Fast & Furious has always been lacking when it comes to villainy, at least until Momoa came along. The actor completely understands the assignment, and decides that the only way he can overshadow the explosions is by attempting to devour as much scenery as humanly possible, a task he pulls off with aplomb thanks to a turn that’s both deliberately over-the-top and eccentrically idiosyncratic at the same time, making him the most memorable big bad the family has faced by far. Unfortunately, the narrative and the ensemble cast continue the overstuffing that’s been dogging F&F for a while now, with callbacks referencing over 20 years of misadventures battling for screentime with multiple new additions that also includes Daniela Melchior (who also has a connection to a legacy character, because of course she does), Alan Ritchson as government agent Aimes, and a smattering of “surprise” cameos that are either wholly shocking or entirely predictable. That’s without even mentioning Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordanna Brewster, Ludacris, Tyrese, Sung Kang, Nathalie Emmanuel, Scott Eastwood, Helen Mirren, John Cena, Jason Statham, and Charlize Theron, all of whom find themselves struggling to make an impact individually when Fast X decrees that the best way to make the best use of its disparate parts is to split them up and have them battle over scraps in terms of making an impression. Fast X is basically split into a string of mini-movies that possess a different cast, tone, and goal, with some faring much better than others. Dom naturally takes the lead in tracking down Dante, but series regulars Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey have their own exposition and banter-heavy mission to complete, Letty has her own things to deal with, the federal newcomers attempt to wrangle in the crew, while Cena heads off on an odd couple buddy road trip with a child. It’s weird, sometimes wonderful, but doesn’t always work. One of the main selling points and most popular elements has always been the dynamic between the core group, and fracturing them across the globe doesn’t do anyone any favors. Of course, the movie has already been confirmed as at least a two-part story, perhaps even three, so there’s no surprises when it ends on a cliffhanger. That being said, deliberately withholding resolutions to the many plot threads does a disservice to not just the audience but Fast X as a whole, because there’s barely a single strand tied off in a satisfying fashion. It’s basically a 141-minute trailer for the next one, and as entertaining as it can be, that’s never the right way to design and execute a $200 million blockbuster. Leterrier has been heavily touting his credentials as a longtime fan of the franchise, though, and thankfully it shows. He nails the tone by treating the serious moments with a completely straight face before immediately launching into a jaw-dropping chase, pile-up, or riotous slab of vehicular carnage, without it ever feeling jarring. That sounds as though it should be a bare minimum, but it can’t be overstated how hard that is to pull off when you’ve got Dom fighting helicopters and running away from an avalanche of literal fire, without mentioning heavy-duty weaponry rolling around a heavily-populated civilian area like a live-action Looney Tunes. As oxymoronic as it sounds given the franchise’s entire MO, Fast X is solid, but nowhere near spectacular. It’s not the worst one to emerge from the factory, but it’s a long way away from dwelling among the top tier. There’s plenty of sizzle on display, but by the time the credits roll, it’s evident that Part 2 is when everyone gets to feast on the steak.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," In defiance of gravity, logic and critical bashing, ""Fast X"" hits theaters dumber and more delicious than ever. But the thrill dissolves fast in the face of supercharged stupidity, paycheck acting and preposterous stunts. After 10 films in 22 years and a $6 billion box-office jackpot, ""Fast X"" slows down to a crawl as the runt of the ""The Fast and the Furious"" litter. It had to happen, excitement giving way to age-related desperation. ""Fast Five,"" still the bracing best of the bunch, put a tiger in the series tank by switching gears from illegal street racing in Los Angeles to a ""Mission Impossible"" ripoff where cars became peripheral to the global action. In ""Fast X,"" the drain of redundancy kicks in as king of the road Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) again takes the wheel. His extended family and crew is headed by Dom's wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and their son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) named after Brian O'Connor, the undercover cop and Dom bestie played by Paul Walker, who died in a car crash in 2013. The plot? I couldn't find any, except it has something to do with an incident in ""Fast Five,"" when Dom and Brian killed drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) in Rio de Janeiro, leaving his son Dante vowing to break Dom's family piece by piece. Ouch! Since we never head of Dante in the previous films, it's a welcome if wacky surprise to see him turn up in the screen-filling, scene-stealing presence of Jason Momoa (""Aquaman"") who turns his desire to see Dom suffer into a life-of-the-party tour de force. Yeah, it makes no sense but Momoa revs up the movie with a full tank of deranged comic energy. He will also catch hell for indulging in flamboyant queer stereotypes. ""I'm Dante, enchanté,"" he announces, claiming to ""adore"" surprises and dressed to wow in glitter shirts with rings and painted nails. Offensive or intentional sendup? You be the judge. Diesel can't hold his own against the mountain of Momoa so he compensates by taking his stunts to a surreal limit whether he's using his wheels to drive down the wall of a dam or knock a bomb off course. That's way better than hearing him make speeches: ""Without honor, you got no family. Without family, you got nothing!"" Shut up, already. Director Louis Leterrier, of two ""Transporter"" films, is new to the series, but can't seem to come up with anything new to shoot. That's why ""Fast X"" comes off like a greatest hits package so abbreviated that nothing resonates. The A-list cast, notably Oscar winners Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson and Rita Moreno, are in and out, though Theron and Rodriguez do have one kickass fight scene. Otherwise, nearly everyone who has ever appeared in a ""Fast"" film makes a quickie cameo. Look, there's Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) as pawns in Dante's plot to set up Dom and his crew as terrorists. Others like Jason Statham, John Cena, Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster come and go so fast that they should be furious. Pete Davidson is also in there somewhere for whatever reason. Jamming in everything would be more forgivable if the 10th time around was meant to be a fond farewell. Hell, no. Studios don't willingly kill a golden goose. Intended as the first half of a two-part franchise finale, plans now are to stretch it into a trilogy, and ""Fast X"" ends with a cliffhanger instead of a victory lap -- proving that you really can have too much of a good thing.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023"," Fast X has two sequences explaining the motivations of Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the franchise’s new uber-villain. The first is an extended flashback inserting him into the events of Fast Five, when Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his partner, Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker), drove a vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro like a wrecking ball — a setpiece so awesome it wrote a check its sequels continue to cash 10 years later. During the flashback, we learn Dante is a psychopathic monster and that his father, Hernan (Joaquim de Almeida), has shuffled him in and out of different institutions in the face of his wanton bloodlust. Later, after Dante has started ripping Dom’s family apart, Dom heads to Rio to investigate this new foe — and ultimately finds a satchel of files that helpfully explain Dante is a psychopathic monster, whose father, Hernan, shuffled him in and out of different institutions in the face of his wanton bloodlust. It’s this kind of saggy writing that really defines Fast X, a film with no story of which to speak. Even The Fate of the Furious and F9: The Fast Saga had some sense of what they were about besides ridiculous car-based action sequences and likable characters being funny together. Gone is any semblance of deep continuity, stakes or tactile physical reality. Everything about Fast X is shallow, ceaseless and clearly written on the fly for a schedule that had already been established before director Louis Leterrier was brought on board. I guess, in the parlance of the youths, Fast X is just vibes. I’m admittedly a fan of the entire Fast saga, even the entries made after Walker died back in 2013. It’s notable how Diesel stopped giving a shit about interacting with his co-stars after that; this is the third adventure in a row where Dom runs off on his own story while everyone else deals with side quests or supporting action. For a second there, it seemed Dwayne Johnson was going to usurp him as the face of the franchise, but somehow Diesel has nipped that in the bud through sheer force of ego (helped by the fact that Johnson’s spinoff, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, while fun, didn’t hold a candle to the other Fast films). Even as the ideas get more outlandish and the characters become pastiches of their earlier selves, I can’t help but love the escalating ridiculousness of each successive entry. So I loved Fast X, too, and in some ways, the slapdash nature of its execution only makes it more endearing. Franchise favorites like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Ludacris), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) all get moments to shine, both comedically and violently. Newcomers like Tess (Brie Larson) and Aimes (Alan Ritchson, of Reacher fame) establish their bona-fides by beating up random goobers. I liked Aimes a lot, both because I enjoy Ritchson’s other work and because he describes himself as a man who could make a “freight train take a dirt road,” which is just about the only dialogue flourish in the entire film. The whole cast is thrown around the world on an incoherent adventure without a clear objective, but their time together is fun. It’s like a hangout film with characters who stopped evolving three movies ago, but you enjoy seeing them every few years all the same. Of course, there’s the Dom of it all. Diesel gets to spent more time with Tess and Aimes than he does his old friends, as he goes on a solo hunt for Dante. It doesn’t really make much sense that he’d put himself in the line of fire, but whatever. Diesel is a man who believes himself to be a movie star and, by sheer force of will and bizarre charisma, has managed to make himself one. I’ll never get tired of the way he yearns for these films to be about more than just loud engines and gun smoke, how every film seems to have a lesson. Last time, it was about listening to your heart and learning to forgive. This one is about fear of loss. It’s wholesome, in a dumb way. It’s all dumb, and nothing more exemplifies the total ridiculousness of Fast X than Dante, the Joker to Dom’s dork knight. Every time the film starts to suffer from the weight of being written on the fly, here comes Momoa to liven things up. He has all the hallmarks of a classic Bond villain — oddly effeminate, grandiose in his mannerisms and capable of great acts of planning that defy any shred of logic. Momoa carries the film. He may well be the best foe in the entire franchise. Just a joy to watch. Another standout is John Cena as Jakob Toretto, seemingly no relation to the Jakob we saw in F9. Oh, well. This one is an upgrade and a role that plays into Cena’s comedic talents. He’s a very welcome addition to the overall ensemble, and I hope we see more of him in the next few films. At this stage in the game, it’s pretty clear whether you’re in the tank for these Fast movies or not. Although Fast X sets a new low bar for writing, it still delivers some great action moments, some enjoyable characters and an energy that feels comforting and familiar. If you like the Fast movies, you’ll find much to enjoy here; if not, why are you seeing the 10th movie in a series that has been waning for over a decade? That’s not a question I can answer, I guess, but rest assured fans will be happy with this one, and everyone else can take a hike.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," For over two decades the Fast & Furious franchise has continued to defy the odds. Similar to an aging popstar constantly reinventing themself, the ability of the series to continuously remake itself on the fly has been the map to its fountain of youth. While studios have been desperately trying to recreate the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula for a successful franchise it can be argued that Fast & Furious is the template that they should be taking notes from. After years of rewriting its own saga, the franchise is finally ready to pen the final chapter of the book with the spectacle that is Fast X. The first of a two-part finale, or trilogy if recent rumours are to be believed, Fast X aims to reward loyal fans who have stuck with the franchise through its gleeful highs and tragic lows. The film is full of outlandish stunts that go against the law of physics, ruminations on the power that comes from having a loyal support network, plenty of talk about the importance of having faith, and a slew of inside jokes and references that only those with an encyclopedic knowledge of the series will truly appreciate. Considering the amount of pandering to hardcore fans that occurs in the film, it is fitting that the story commences by taking audiences back to the events of Fast Five. The consensus pick for best film in the franchise, Fast Five was the catapult that launched the series into the stratosphere and picked up millions of new fans along the way. Remolding its evolving lore once again, Fast X takes us back to the day of the infamous safe heist in Brazil to introduce viewers to a new foe who had been waiting in the wings for a decade. After being involved in the epic chase to reclaim his father’s, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), stolen safe, Dante (Jason Momoa) makes it his mission to get revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his chosen family. Believing that one should “never accept death when suffering is owed,” Dante sets in motion an elaborate plan that not only physically separates Toretto from his team, but also puts the life of his son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) in danger. Setting the stage for another globe-trotting adventure, one where Toretto’s crew are once again top of the international most wanted list, Fast X hits many of the familiar beats that fans expect. The team must improvise their way many challenges while leaving massive destruction and battered bodies in their wake. Although never short on action sequences, as every character, including new additions Tess (Brie Larson), Ames (Reacher’s Alan Ritchson), and Isabel (Daniela Melchior), get their moment to shine, the sheer number of fight scenes does hinder the film from a story standpoint. The overabundance of unnecessary fight sequences is especially noticeable when characters opt to settle old scores, or perceived wrongs, when time constraints dictate they should actually be fleeing. Trying to escape an agency black op prison in four minutes? Lets have a female fight scene with lasers. Need to get gear to sneak out of Europe? Lets have two friends come to blows at the shop where they are ordering supplies. By frequently pausing the sense of urgency for fisticuffs the film inadvertently exposes some of the plot holes in the story. In taking The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers approach to its unfolding narrative, where characters find themselves on separate journeys, Fast X struggles to juggle all of the balls it throws in the air. One cannot help but question how Dante is magically able to predict every single action he set up multiple traps for. At times the film seems more interested in basking in its cartoonish elements than telling a cohesive story. Director Louis Leterrier clearly has fun playing up the self-referential moments in the film that essentially call out how absurd the franchise has become. In one amusing moment, Ames complains “it is like a cult with cars” when commenting on Toretto’s ability to lure people into his “family.” He even notes distain for beer and BBQ, which is a dig at both the former criminal’s choice of beverage and the family dinners featured in each film. In openly acknowledging the silly way the Fast & Furious films have turned the notion of family and faith into catchphrases, Fast X finds an unlikely saving grace in the character of Dante. Playing the role as if he was an understudy for Heath Ledger’s The Joker in The Dark Knight, there are several parallels to Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster throughout, Jason Momoa perfectly captures the tone of the film. While Diesel’s Toretto is overly serious and sentimental, Dante reminds viewers of just how colourful and fun this franchise can be. Edging ahead of Charlize Theron’s Cipher for best villain of the franchise, Dante runs around like deranged jester eager to see the world burn. Consistently lighting up the screen at every turn, Momoa’s performance allows the film to rise above its narrative shortcomings. Clearly stretching its goodbye speech to ensure every memorable character past and present gets their moment of applause, the film is unabashedly for the hardcore fans. While Fast X offers a fun start to its final road trip, only time will tell if the franchise can steer towards a satisfying end.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," I’ve seen all of the “Fast and Furious” movies. As a reward, Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto should adopt me into that “fammm’ly” he’s always talking about between car chases. Not only would I get a souped-up, quality automobile that can survive an explosion, multiple rollovers, a trip into outer space, and a drive down the wall of a dam, I’d get to change my name to Vin Odiesel. It’s a win-win proposition, if you ask me. All of the aforementioned fates have befallen vehicles in this series. Some of these movies have been faster than others, and some of them have left me feeling furious. But even at their worst, there’s something I find compelling about them. It’s not the promise of preternaturally exciting car porn, though that’s the hook that keeps audiences driving themselves to theaters to experience the exploits of the Toretto clan. What keeps me watching is the incontrovertible fact that these movies are pure soap opera. “Fast X,” like its predecessors, plays like an episode of what your grandma used to call “her stories.” Like a soap, the dialogue is intentionally melodramatic and purple. Nothing is more important than family, and the characters speak about it with such emotional reverence that we can’t help but take it seriously. Diesel usually gets these monologues, but “Fast X” ups the ante by giving the requisite speech to EGOT legend Rita Moreno. Moreno, who is 91, plays the 55-year old Diesel’s grandmother. She should have been lecturing screenwriters Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin about math. The plots are not only preposterous, they’re also mutable — another soap opera feature. “Fast X” uses scenes from the fifth installment, 2011′s “Fast Five,” and inserts a heretofore unknown character into the lore. The new character is Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of the drug lord Hernan Reyes. Director Louis Leterrier adds a de-aged Momoa into those “Fast Five” scenes, making him a witness to his father’s demise. Dante wants Dom to suffer before killing him. He concocts a plan that entails killing off his “family” while he watches. Leterrier enjoys toying with the audience’s expectations for who might not make it to the end. Suffice it to say, things do not go as planned on any of the continents where the story takes place. As with any soap, the rivalries among a large group of characters are not only over-the-top — the dynamics can suddenly change from antagonistic to collaborative. It’s how characters played by The Rock and Jason Statham have evolved over the course of the series. They even got their own spin-off, 2019′s “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw,” which actually makes the Roman numeral X in “Fast X” a miscount. “Fast X” even ends with a nighttime soap-style season-ending cliffhanger, as it’s the first film in this current trilogy that will close out the series. Apparently, I was the only person in the theater who didn’t know that beforehand. Imagine my surprise when the damn movie didn’t have a conclusion! The characteristic that most makes these films feel like “All My Car Drifts” is their insistence that we, the viewers, must be intimately familiar with events that may have happened decades before the current story line. The allusions in these movies lock out new viewers. If “Fast X” is your first movie, don’t bother. For the full effect, you need to have not only seen all the movies, but have taken copious notes to figure out simple questions like “who the hell is that?” and “what on Earth are they doing?” In addition to Dom, the characters fans know and love are all present here. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges) are still the comic-relief bickering duo on Team Toretto. Their banter is starting to wear thin. Dom’s wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and kid, Little B (Leo Abelo Perry), are around to (as usual) be put in danger. Toretto’s younger sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), is also there to offer support. Charlize Theron is back as the villainous Cipher, whose name should clue you in on what her specialty is. Cipher and Letty get one of the best fights in series history, one that occurs during a jailbreak culminating with an appearance by an actor I had forgotten was in a F&F movie. “Fast X” is watchable, and its car chases are often exciting, but it’s not as satisfying as the best F&F movies (“Fast and Furious 6,” “Furious 7,″ and the extremely ridiculous “F9″). Part of the problem is Dante. Clearly, he’s psychotic, but Momoa plays him like a supervillain in a lesser James Bond movie. He seems unstoppable, which limits any form of suspense, and his flamboyant nature skews uncomfortably close to gay stereotype. This installment boils down to several battles between Dom and Dante. The acting styles of Momoa and Diesel are an unintentionally hilarious study in contrasts; imagine the Iron Giant being pursued by Divine’s Dawn Davenport from John Waters’s “Female Trouble.” If only it were as fun as it sounds. Still, as someone who watched his “stories” on TV for decades, I will be back for parts 11 and 12. I always come back, no matter how bad the plotlines. The desire to see how it all ends overrules common sense. It’s what hooks you in the first place.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","[Momoa] seems to have modeled his bright, sing-songy delivery on Bill Murray's brilliant work in ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" and darned if he isn't almost as funny.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023"," There was a point in time where I unabashedly loved the Fast and Furious movies, but with each new installment, my affection for this franchise diminishes further. The high-octane action that gleefully thumbs its nose at the laws of physics has been steadily losing its appeal thanks to the eighth and ninth installments, the latter of which turned a long-running online joke about Dom Toretto’s crew going to space into an eye-rolling reality. That Fast X could somehow be even worse is nigh unthinkable, and yet here we are.  Weirdly enough, this latest entry opens by reminding us just how great these films used to be, flashing back to the bank vault heist from Fast Five, which remains the series high point. But this time, the moments we remember are intercut with new scenes that reveal drug lord Hernan Reyes had an adult son named Dante (Jason Momoa), who witnessed the vault theft and the subsequent death of his father at the hands of Dom (Vin Diesel) and company. It seems Dante has been carefully plotting his revenge for the last decade, and now he’s resurfacing (literally, as the intro shows his being blown off a bridge and nearly drowning) to set his grand plan into motion, which begins by sending a massive bomb careening through the streets of Rome while the crew desperately tries to keep it from wiping out half the city — a sequence that feels like a retread of the aforementioned vault heist, although with significantly more slow-motion shots of Diesel trying to look heroic.  Naturally, the Toretto crew are blamed for the chaos and are forced to go on the run, splintering the narrative into various subplots that play fast and loose with character motivations and the series’ own history. Remember how Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) was a stone-faced badass who spent the last movie trying to murder everyone? Apparently the filmmakers don’t, as Jakob is now a dorky goofball high-fiving his nephew while admonishing him not to swear — there’s absolutely zero trace of the character’s personality as depicted in F9. Ruthless cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron) is also back, following in the footsteps of Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw (also returning) by joining forces with the Toretto crew after expending considerable resources trying to wipe them off the map in previous films; after spending the last two films monologuing and staring at monitors, at least we get to see Theron get physical this time around, and Cipher’s prison cell brawl with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) will be catnip for longtime fans.  With returning characters that also include Roman (Tyrse Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Immanuel), Han (Sung Kang), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Queenie (Helen Mirren), Fast X struggles to find enough for its massive ensemble cast to do. That’s before introducing new characters like Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of (a conspicuously absent) Kurt Russell’s shadowy government agent Mr. Nobody, or Isabel (Daniela Melchior), whose sister played a pivotal role in the events of Fast Five. There’s also a new agency contact in the form of Aimes (Alan Ritchson of Jack Reacher fame), whose presence is actually somewhat pivotal to the narrative, something which can’t be said of most of the names on this list. And as if the roster weren’t already overstuffed, the final moments tease the return of at least two more former cast members for the eleventh (!!) film, which was originally envisioned as a finale but may turn out to be the middle installment in a trilogy.  Thankfully, there’s Jason Momoa as the revenge-driven Dante, a cackling and charismatic sociopath who exists somewhere at the intersection of Cesar Romero’s Joker and a classic Bond villain. Momoa is electrifying here, gleefully chatting up the decomposing bodies of minions he’s just dispatched while clad in a bathrobe and detonating remote bombs with the exuberance of a ten-year-old kid playing a video game; it’s the best work of his career, and almost makes the unwieldy tedium of Fast X worth the cost of admission. If virtually anything onscreen was half as entertaining as Momoa’s performance, I could offer a begrudging recommendation, but the rest simply pales in comparison: an unwieldy jumble of disparate action sequences, puzzling departures from logic (even for this series) and a self-serious Diesel grimacing through the entire 141 minutes.

"May 19, 2023"," Invite yourself to consider, is there a more improbably successful, or indeed, simply improbable franchise in the entirety of cinematic history than The Fast and the Furious? What began in 2001 as a mildly diverting and hacky Point Break rip-off, trading surfboards for street racing, has now fully metamorphosed into a globe-trotting action saga that has, amongst many absurd escalations, sent two of its supporting characters into actual outer space—in a car. Deniers will pinpoint this watershed moment in 2021’s F9 as the moment the series “jumped the shark,” but franchise devotees will know that Vin Diesel and crew had already leapt across a megalodon to get to this point. With Fast X, the first installment in a two, maybe three, part finale, it’s difficult to tell where parody ends and the movie begins. Diesel clearly still takes his most successful franchise seriously, but does anyone else? Post-Fast Five, the long-running but not exactly “acclaimed” franchise experienced a sizeable mainstream and critical reevaluation. With a dose of self-awareness and a knack for one-upping themselves in creative, sometimes practical ways, the films were stupid, but in a charming, almost critic-proof fashion. Yet somewhere along the line, Diesel seemed to lose the plot. He declared in 2015 that Furious 7 would win Best Picture at the Oscars—it did not—only to make similar claims before the release of the eighth installment, The Fate of the Furious. Diesel’s misguided but genuine earnestness helped to sell the Fast movies as an ironic guilty pleasure, where the emotional portent combined with ever-increasing silliness gave the sense of being in on a multi-million-dollar joke that its star was appealingly oblivious to. In Fast X, the joke eclipses everything. The first act is its most riotously entertaining, but it plays like an intentional parody of every single meme anyone has ever made about the series. Midway through the film, at the vaguely titled “Agency Headquarters,” Tess (Brie Larson) is briefed by new agency lead Aimes (Alan Ritchson) on the team’s previous exploits. Surrounded by holographic screens playing clips from the previous movies, Aimes dives into a meta summation of the entire Fast Saga: “if it could be done by a car, they did it. If it violates the laws of God and gravity, they did it twice.” Aimes later states “everyone they meet becomes a part of their family… like a cult.” Laughing at this series has always been part of the appeal, but it’s never felt more like the creators were desperate to be in on the joke. Fast X utilizes cheap self-awareness at the expense of making an actual movie, as if the entire script was generated though an algorithm. Excessive audience-winking is far from the script’s only fault though; some lines of dialogue are just plainly incoherent. “Roman,” Ludacris’s Tej chides early on to Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the franchise’s dubious source of comedic relief, “the only thing you know is Rome-man noodles.” I’m sorry, but what?  The storyline, which quickly dispenses our central team onto separate, somewhat unsatisfying side quests, concerns a convoluted revenge plot concocted by Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the psychopathic son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes from Fast Five. The first 20 minutes of Fast X clumsily insert Dante into pre-existing footage from that aforementioned film, establishing his desire to get back at Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and “tear his family apart… piece by piece” for killing his father. Momoa’s performance is intentionally absurd and will likely be a highlight for many. However, the character is a bizarre concoction. Apart from simply looking out of place, Momoa portrays Dante with a dubious mix of flamboyant peacocking and what could only be described as a Looney Tunes version of Heath Ledger’s Joker from The Dark Knight. One particularly off-putting scene features Dante having a “girly” chat and painting the nails of two mutilated corpses he’s recently killed and stitched back together. The character is questionable, but that aside, he’s having a blast. Otherwise, the most energetic presences are series newcomer Larson and the returning Charlize Theron. It’s the gifted actors in Fast X that seem to be most aware of the movie they’re in, relishing every minute of screentime to be as goofy as possible.  It’s difficult to parse what makes a “good” installment in this series, but it most likely comes down to the directorial work of Justin Lin. Even F9, which took its characters completely into the realm of fantasy, was captured through Lin’s lens in articulate, energetic frames. Sure, Fast Five’s practicality was gone, but the set pieces still felt playful. Having left Fast X over “creative differences” with Diesel only 10 days into production, Lin has been replaced with Louis Leterrier, primarily known for his work on Now You See Me and 2010’s Clash of the Titans remake. There’s no nice way to say it—Leterrier is a hack. It’s Diesel behind the wheel, steering Fast X further into vanity project territory than ever before. There’s not a single emotional beat, especially from Dom, that doesn’t inspire incredulous laughter. While that’s certainly entertaining, it becomes exhausting when you consider that there’s possibly two more of these things. Fast X ends on a cliffhanger, and the series has never felt more like it was running out of road. It’s a movie that cares too much and not enough. Everything you want to see is here, from drag racing in the streets of Rio to Corona-fueled barbecues. But it’s in the wrong order, cheaply constructed with half a heart.

"May 19, 2023"," If you’re a fan of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise, you already know that you need to check your brain at the theater door. So, let’s just say that “Fast X” is yet another James Bond wannabe that is predictably silly with an over-the-top performance by Jason Momoa as the new bad guy. It’s mildly entertaining, but after 2-hours and 21-minutes of CGI-generated wheel spinning, “Fast X” leaves the audience with a ridiculous cliffhanger. That might make even die-hard “Fast and the Furious” fans furious. The arthouse musical drama “Carmen” was written and directed by famed dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, loosely inspired by Bizet’s classic opera. Melissa Barrera portrays a Mexican immigrant aided by American Paul Mescal who kills to protect her. They sing and dance their way to LA as they evade the law. The original musical numbers are engaging, but “Carmen” is an opaque cinematic experiment that never hits a dramatic stride. The low-key drama “Rare Objects” was written and directed by Katie Holmes, adapted from the novel by Kathleen Tessaro. In this revised version, a young woman, struggling with tragedy and fresh out of rehab, tries to rebuild her life by taking a job at an antiques gallery. It’s well-meaning and warmly embraces its flawed characters, but the rambling structure of “Rare Objects” prevents it from achieving much of an emotional impact. Sinqua Walls and rapper Jack Harlow star in the Hulu update of the classic basketball movie, “White Men Can’t Jump.” This substantially revised reboot is irreverent and good-humored, benefitting from some clever dialogue and the charisma of its stars. It won’t make you forget the original, but the new version of “White Men Can’t Jump” is a cheerfully cheeky sports comedy.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023"," “Oh, and look! There’s big, tough, Harley-Davidson-riding, funny Jason Momoa doing a villain role dressed all in billowy purple satin, driving a matching custom paint-job lavender Chevy Impala with Cragar mags, that matches his purple, lavender, and fuchsia fingernail polish, and doing a kind of campy, gay interpretation. Which is a hilarious choice for him to make and he steals the entire movie with it. I like macho Jason Momoa stealing the whole stupid car and thong bikini movie with hysterical feigned swishy-ness—I guess I’m having fun now!” Now, the deal with Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes: It’s revealed that his father (Joaquim de Almeida) was killed by the Fast and Furious boys 12 years ago. We also come to find out Dante’s a psycho, having been in juvie, psych wards, and prisons. And as mentioned, he’s a rather flamboyant fellow. Dante wants to destroy everything Dominic loves. The path to this destruction involves lots of fast and furious car chases through São Paulo, Rome, and a small Portuguese village. There’s plenty of kicking, punching, and submission grappling moves, involving, most notably, Cipher (Charlize Theron) versus Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The whole gang is here: Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, Brie Larson, and so on. Rito Moreno makes an appearance as Dom’s grandma. Bringing up the rear is the eternally young Dame Helen Mirren. The Rock may or may not show up, and, in the same way there was once a link-up between the “Fast and Furious” muscle-car franchise, with Jason Statham’s “Tranpsorter” super-car franchise, if you stay for the post-credit-roll scene, you may find there’s a hook-up with yet another, giant franchise. (Hint: Which franchise started the whole post-credit-roll scene thing in the first place?) If you follow Momoa on Instagram, which I do, because he likes all the stuff I like, i.e., Harley-Davidsons, rock climbing, weight-lifting, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, bass guitar a lá rock band Primus’s Les Claypool, metal band Metallica, acting, filmmaking, and until recently, ex-wife Lisa Bonet—you discover he’s a giant goofball. Dangerous, to be sure, but like a big kid who can’t believe he actually succeeded in becoming a famous actor. He’s hilarious. So the revelation that his big bruiser self is primarily good at comedy, and watching him having a gleeful blast playing an effeminate baddie—is rather fun, actually. I’m giving it 3 stars for how it bludgeoned me into submission with the delights of the bro and the dude … but mostly I still hate it.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2023"," Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) loves street racing, he loves a good barbecue – but, as the Fast and Furious series never tires of reminding us, what he really cares about is family. Not just his biological family, although that’s where it all starts, but the chosen family that’s stuck by him as he’s evolved from a humble Los Angeles criminal to a clean-living American answer to James Bond. Family is everything to Dom in Fast X: (clockwise from left) Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Han (Sung Kang), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Dom (Vin Diesel), Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), Abuelita (Rita Moreno), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Tej (Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson).  In the long run, even the bad guys in the Fast and Furious universe tend to be brought into the fold. In Fast and Furious 9, Dom’s black sheep brother Jakob (John Cena) was seeking world domination, but in Fast X he’s the ultimate goofy uncle; and while the amoral hacker Cypher (Charlize Theron) takes longer to come around, she, too, winds up showing signs of redemption. Family, for Dom, is strength and weakness: it means he never has to fight his battles alone, but also multiplies the ways he can be hurt. This supplies the core tension of the saga, especially as the finale approaches (it was said years back that the 11th film would be the last, though there have been rumours of a part 12). On the face of it, the world of Dom and his team is one where danger is constant yet never truly real. All the same, losses have occurred, sometimes unavoidably: the series is still steering around the absence of Diesel’s original co-star Paul Walker, killed in an actual high-speed car crash in 2013. Fans will also be aware of recurring reports of disputes within the off-screen Fast family, where Diesel serves as producer and star. Justin Lin, the most frequent series director, walked off the set of Fast X a few days into production, and has been replaced by French action specialist Louis Leterrier (The Transporter). Back in the realm of fiction, there may be genuine reason to fear for Dom’s cherished family members, including his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). As the endgame approaches, will the writers seize their opportunity to take a few pieces off the board? Diesel no longer seems quite human enough to be vulnerable, with his bald dome polished to an ageless sheen and his life-coach mottos delivered in a gruff near-whisper. Still, there are moments that show that despite everything he remains an actor – especially when Dom is thrown off-balance by his latest antagonist, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), a burly psychopath who flounces about like a Vegas magician. This is not, frankly, a performance I expected Momoa to give – and its fey perversity may shed some light on what Dom’s broad notion of “family” finally excludes, in the context of a story otherwise peopled largely by exaggerated macho types, the women still more than the men. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Sure, the epic may be one big compensatory fantasy, built around the absence of Dom’s mother (yet to be addressed explicitly, though his world teems with mother substitutes, including Rita Moreno as his paternal grandmother and Helen Mirren as a Cockney crime matriarch who calls him “duckie”). Unlike its predecessors, Fast X ends on a cliffhanger rather than purporting to be a complete, satisfying story – so, at this point, statements about what it all adds up to can only be speculative. From another angle, all this psychodrama is little more than a pretext for the over-the-top action set-pieces, which are fantasy in a still more blatant sense. While the stunt team is undoubtedly first rate, there’s little effort to convince us what we see happened in anything like the way it’s shown. These sequences are more like dreams or hallucinations, especially the early set-piece involving a huge spherical bomb rolling downhill towards the Vatican as if the Eternal City were one big bowling alley. How much thought has been put into the symbolism is hard to say. But Dom, we know, is a man of faith – and if he were dreaming the whole thing, we might wonder if he felt some buried guilt for his undoubted yen for mayhem and destruction, even while telling himself it’s all in a good cause.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023"," The a-lister cast list is a laundry list, including returning stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson and Charlize Theron along with the addition of Marvel superheroes Jason Momoa and Brie Larson. The villain is faster and more furious than ever before and the action can only be described as bigly. There’s even a surprise cameo from one of the world’s biggest movie stars. A jumble of the usual mix of family, friends, fast cars and flashbacks, “Fast X” begins with relative calm in the world of former criminal and professional street racer Dominic Toretto (Diesel). The patriarch of the “F&F” gang, he has left the fast life behind, and retired with wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and his son Brian. “We used to live our lives a quarter mile at a time,” he says. “But things change.” Dom’s past comes back to haunt him in the form of flamboyant villain Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the sadistic, revenge fueled son of drug lord Hernan Reyes. “I’m Dante,” he says by way of introduction. “Enchanté.” Way back in “Fast Five” Dom and Co. were responsible for the loss of the Reyes family fortune. “The great Dominic Toretto,” Dante snarls. “If you never would’ve gotten behind that wheel, I’d never be the man I am today. And now, I’m the man who’s going to break your family, piece by piece.” Cue the set-up to the second part of the franchise’s three-part finale. It is, as they say on the movie poster, just the beginning of the end. In the “Fast & Furious” world the word “ludicrous” is not just the name of prominent cast member Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges, it’s also the name of the game. Since the franchise’s humble 2001 debut, the movies have grown bigger and sillier with each entry. “If it can violate the laws of God and gravity,” says Agent Aimes (Alan Ritchson) in “FX,” “they do it twice.” The out-of-control car stunts that crowd the screen have no touchstone in reality, other than the cars have four wheels and drive along streets when they aren’t bursting into flames or flying through the air. It’s as if the wild car chases were dreamed up by fourteen-year-olds playing with their Hot Wheels sets as images of canon cars danced in their heads. Anything goes, and no idea is too big or too ludicrous. When the tires aren’t squealing, Dom is whinging on about the importance of family with a straight face and a serious tone that makes Leslie Nielsen’s “Naked Gun” deadpan look positively flamboyant. Only Momoa seems to understand how colossally silly the whole thing is, and has fun pulling faces, doing a Grand Jeté or two and peacocking around as he rolls a neutron bomb through the streets of Rome. It’s a ludicrous performance in a completely ludicrous movie and it fits. The bombastic “Fast X” is overstuffed with characters—it seems like every actor in Hollywood has a cameo—plot and, if this is possible, it is overstuffed with excess. The very definition of “go big or go home,” it is for “F&F” fans who have been along for the ride for more than two decades everyone else may want to take a detour.

"May 18, 2023"," We are ten films into the Fast and Furious franchise. So let’s just start with some obvious points. #1, Vin Diesel is easily the most uninteresting thing about 9 of the 10 films (he’s not in #3). The most interesting thing continues to be the set pieces – the fisticuffs, city explosions, flying car shenanigans. Director Louis Leterrier had some big tires to fill stepping into the tenth episode, and those two Transporter films are not pedigree enough. But he more than holds his own, even if the ridiculous nature of most of these will have you laughing out loud. And then the other reason to like this franchise: the villains. Most of them wind up falling to Dom’s charms and joining his cult, but still! And a ton of them are back for this one: Statham, Mirren, Cena, Theron, and now, Momoa. Jason Momoa has a ball, all swagger and silliness as the devil – a foe so evil that all previous villains (even those who sought to end the world; even those who actually killed members of Dom’s beloved family) quake in his presence. His every moment onscreen is a joy, but I honestly think one particular scene with toenail polish might have been added late just to show us how amazing he can be. The core group – the family – of course returns, although the adventure splits them up to allow opportunities to bloat the run time. I mean, to give each of them arcs and storylines. Tyrese Gibson and Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges lead the comic relief squad. They head one way while Uncle Jakob (John Cena) takes Dom’s precious son a different direction. Most interesting, per usual, is whatever Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) does. It mainly involves Oscar winner Brie Larson (making her F&F debut as Mr. Nobody’s daughter) and Oscar winner Charlize Theron (who, once again, delivers a performance far better than the material deserves). Cameos galore, plus a stinger you’ve heard about but probably still want to stick around to see, add to both the run time and the fun. Somewhere around Justin Lin’s Fast 5 (ironic, given the Fast X storyline), Dom and his family just became superheroes, flying, impenetrable, imperturbable superheroes. Yes, you will hear the word family more often than every other word in the script combined. No, Diesel never acts. I mean, he can. We all saw Saving Private Ryan once up on a time. He just doesn’t do it here. He’s a gravelly voiced Buddha, as he always has been. And he’s the least compelling element in the film or the series, as he always has been. It takes nothing way from the film. It never has.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2023"," If Fast X can accomplish the simple task of being a better product than the last film in the franchise, F9: The Fast Saga, then the studio has a winner on their hands. To say that title was an awful catastrophe is an understatement. By now audiences around the world know what they’re getting into with this slate of films. They’re nothing but a ridiculous mess of fun and chaos. However, that is no excuse to just pump out garbage quality productions either. With these films being so successful at the box office, it would be hard for the studios to turn away from more sequels, and at least half of their releases are actually quality films. With that being said, it’s still such a toss-up on what the end result will be trying to create the next big stunt. Regardless, most people will still run up to the theater no matter what to see it all unfold, and to be honest it’s hard to blame them. Surprisingly, one of the best aspects of this part 10 sequel are the relationships between the characters. There’s actual substance there on full throttle. Dom (Vin Diesel) is a father now, and he seems like a pretty good one too. Seeing how this franchise started out during his younger years with not a care in the world, to now seeing him as a grown adult responsible for another human was refreshing. It appears that his priorities are straight with the relationship with his son, which makes the audience care about him even more than they already did. Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) is shockingly great as well. His character didn’t have the best arc last time around, but this time he’s a dedicated uncle and can still kick ass. Mixing comedy in the middle of action can be hard to execute properly. You’d want to sell the intensity of the scene while still creating laughs, which is not easy to do. However, John Cena was born for this stuff. Seeing these two alone and how much they’ve matured is enough for most to root for them in addition to the rest of the team. Their involvement is not the best section of the film though in the slightest. That recognition goes to the character Dante (Jason Momoa). He may be one of the best antagonists that this franchise has created. Not only was he a noble threat with an endless amount of resources, the man was freaking hilarious. Again, it’s difficult to come across as menacing and dangerous while you’re cracking jokes, but for some reason, the Fast franchise has now figured out that formula. Praise to them for their creativity. Dante was super charismatic, charming, and flamboyant. There are not too many people out there that laugh hysterically while they’re getting punched in the face, which is scary. The rest of the team did their jobs decent enough. They didn’t have much screen time though which is missed to a small degree. The team (family) is so large now that it’s hard to give everyone the attention they may deserve. It was as if their personalities were missing and only their bodies were present. When the film did show us their tropes from the past it wasn’t funny. Now like all comedy, it’s subjective, but these scenes specifically weren’t necessary at all. Just forced for some reason leaving you to take deep sighs in your seat waiting for the next scene to populate. In particular, there was a squabble between Roman (Tyrese) and Tej (Ludacris) who were bickering for no reason. It was childish, dull, and cringe-worthy. More on the positive side the stunts are beyond ridiculous but still exciting. These men and women continue to defy the laws of God, gravity, physics, and everything else. The film is so self-aware of this, that it dedicated nearly an entire scene just to make fun of itself, which was possibly one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie as a whole. This film does need to be tighter due to it being all over the place and not focused. It was nice to see them going back to the basics by actually having car racing between characters, an aspect that has been absent lately. However, there’s so much going on in other portions of the film that just run on nonstop which seemed scattered. It’s to the point that there may not be a point. Just characters running around the world with fancy equipment. A few times I had to question whether there was an overall plot or end goal, which isn’t a good feeling. While the stunts and action were fun, there were both pros and cons. Seeing car flips and explosions on a big screen can be entertaining most of the time, but it still has to be grounded in some reality. The car that Dom Teretto was driving was not. It would not be a surprise if in Fast 10 part two it was revealed that the vehicle that he drove in this film was an actual Transformer. I mean it has to be with the amount of damage it took on and is still able to operate. The metal has to be from some other planet because it can’t be from Earth. It’s incredibly shallow and silly, but if your expectations are low it’s easy to please. While the movie is a fun blast there’s still so much that can’t be forgiven which will leave you shaking your head, but when the credits hit, I was still smiling.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," After Fast & Furious 9 blasted Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris into space (in a car) it was hard to see what route this multi-billion-dollar franchise could possibly take next.  Even the screenwriters have clearly lost the plot on the tangled web of interconnected histories that now bind street-racer turned heist operative turned international government agent Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) to his ever-expanding ‘family’. The emotional thrust is that Dom is being hunted down by an androgynous super-villain called Dante ‘it rhymes with ‘enchanté’ Reyes (Jason Momoa), the vengeance-seeking son of a dead drug lord on a sadistic mission to make our bald, gruff-but-loveable patriarch ‘suffer’ by targeting those he loves.  Given Dom’s loved ones now encompass a Marvel-Universe-sized ensemble cast (currently including Charlize Theron, John Cena, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Jason Statham – and that’s just the A-list), Dante has his work cut out – hence Fast X is actually a part 1 of a 2-part franchise farewell. It’s not that Fast X is bad, it’s just long and incoherent. The outrageous amount of set pieces are untethered to any shred of reality.  E.g. a flaming bomb the size of Indiana Jones’s boulder barreling through Rome or Diesel landing a car out of a speeding jet and sustaining the kind of impact I’d get from a speedbump in Sainsbury’s carpark.  What’s missing here is that magic ‘Yippee-ki-yay!’ factor. The saving exception being Jason Momoa, the franchise’s best baddie yet, who is having an absolute ball.  ‘I don’t care about anybody’s heart of gold! And I hate barbecues!’ he huffs, as he bounds between hyper-macho antics and painting his nails lilac.

"May 18, 2023"," Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast and Furious series proper, has got to be the dumbest fucking movie I’ve ever seen in my whole godforsaken life. Just powerfully dumb. Big, brash, loud, and so mired in retcons and on-set controversy that it’s no wonder the resulting product is absolute nonsense. I’ve often joked that I’d love to find a Fast noob and show them just the first and most recent entries to see if they can even begin to fill in the blanks between the two, but I’ve never followed through for fear of someone’s head exploding right in front of me. Be it the impossible physics, the aggressive messaging about family (despite the ever rotating members of said family), or the weird Christianity-based moral code of a man who has violently killed no fewer than a thousand people, it’s a wonder that we moviegoers keep putting up with this series that absolutely refuses to die (much like the multiple characters within who have died explicitly, only to be returned to our mortal coil with the swift stroke of an intrepid writer’s pen). Yet we do. Why? Because despite being, again, the dumbest fucking movie I have ever seen in my entire godforsaken life, Fast X, the first part of the gigantic franchise’s closing trilogy, is the most fun I’ve had at the movies in quite some time. Yes, it’s powerfully dumb. Like, “needs to be reminded to chew its food” dumb, but it ain’t stupid. And better yet, it’s earnest about its dumbness, and it’s happy to revel in delivering exactly what we expect from Vin Diesel’s magnum opus that took a bunch of street racing DVD-player thieves and morphed them into a diverse squad of international super agents with an inclination to accomplish 100% of the tasks assigned to them through the usage of cars. Are there easier ways to defuse a gigantic, rolling bomb before it blows up the Vatican? Sure, but none are as fun as treating the entire city of Rome as a Rocket League arena. Our tale begins with a retcon. Remember back in Fast Five when Dom and The Fambly (complete with a handful of members who are no longer part of The Fambly for a variety of reasons) dragged a gigantic safe all around the streets of Rio de Janeiro, killing hundreds of innocent people that we prefer not to think about in the process? Well apparently, the guy who owned the safe has a son, and now the son (Jason Momoa) is pissed. He has made it his mission, like so many bad guys before him (literally all of whom have become good guys), to dismantle The Fambly once and for all. Luckily for The Fambly, they now have the full support of The Agency, an agency that gets them whatever gadgets and cars they need, while also providing international travel and a magical way of never having to deal with jet lag or the passage of time. But just as this new villain, Dante, makes his mission clear, The Agency finally decides that The Fambly have killed way too many people, and need to be stopped from killing any more. This leaves us in a place we’ve been many times before: the good guys and the bad guys are after The Fambly, and now they have to split up and do action things until either the bad guy becomes good or the good guy says “you’ve earned yourself 24 hours to run, Toretto, but after that, I’m comin’ for ya.” As this franchise races forward, a splitting up of The Fambly has become all too common, partially because there are so many characters to serve, and partially because Vin Diesel is reportedly not a lot of fun to work with on set. But since these movies have gotten so insanely grand in scope, it’s barely noticeable that The Fambly doesn’t really even seem to hang out anymore. More noticeable is the fact that Brian O’Conner, played by the late Paul Walker, is still very much alive in the film’s canon, but doesn’t seem to ever want to hang out, or even be present in his own home. This is made doubly clear by the inclusion of Dom’s son, Baby Brian, who by the end of Fast X racks up a pretty impressive kill-count of his own (for Fambly and Jesus). Here in the back half of the franchise, these films live and die by their directors. The original director of Fast X, Justin Lin, quit after just a few days on set (it is largely assumed this is because of Vin Diesel acting like a dingus). His replacement, Louis Leterrier, is a good fit for the material, having handled plenty of shiny actioners in the past. After literally going to space in F9: The Fast Saga, this entry brings things back down to Earth (to a degree), and it is evident in the action. The focal point here is, as expected, cars. For the most part what we’re seeing is practical car stunts enhanced by digital effects. The series has typically prided itself in using actual stunt driving wherever possible, although some things are simply impossible (except through faith, as Dom would surely assert). Fast X delivers on the action in a big way. The auto-tomfoolery is crisply shot, cleanly edited, and quite cleverly staged (the hand-to-hand combat, conversely, is a mixed bag of satisfying fisticuffs and nonsensical gobbledygook). We made peace with the extremely loose physics many movies ago, and the film has a lot of fun with such freedom. One agent of The Agency, played here by a game Alan Ritchson, calls out the lack of physical consistency when explaining his distaste for The Fambly to an equally game Brie Larson, who must owe somebody money. In doing so, he highlights one of the Fast Franchise’s battiest strengths: you don’t have to explain it as long as you call attention to it. I’d personally much rather someone marvel “that’s impossible, but he’s doing it” than have someone explain why some batshit piece of action is indeed possible. In the same scene, said agent also points out that every antagonist to The Fambly eventually becomes a part of The Fambly, and that’s really all we need to explain how Jakob (John Cena) is a good guy now, or how Cypher (Charlize Theron) is a good guy now, or how Shaw (Jason Statham) is a good guy now. This is perhaps the most exciting thing about Fast X: Its villain. Jason Momoa is arguably the best baddie in the whole series, and it all comes down to his strange, energetic performance. He has a gleeful, Joker-like energy that defies the notion that he could ever turn into a good guy. He gets off on being evil (no lie, it actually seems to make him horny), and he does so while looking rather fashionable in a variety of outfits from all across the gender spectrum. Momoa’s surfer-bro standard is tweaked into something a bit wilder than we’re used to, and it gives him license to go as big as possible. He is presumably the heavy for the remainder of the series, and there’s no one better for the job. Sure, his Dante has some loose ties to the history of The Fambly, but really, he just wants to fuck shit up, and boy does he. Momoa is having so much fun that it’s hard to think of anyone else as the star of the movie. I’d venture to say it’s his best performance. He’s giving everything that this strange series never gave Charlize Theron a chance to give, and he’s giving it from under layers of purple silk. There’s one beat that I won’t spoil (you’ll know it when you see it) in which Momoa does something so gruesome and dark that it feels lifted from a much ballsier film series. I’m glad it found its way here. To review a Fast movie has become a bit of a fool’s errand since most readers already know whether or not they’re going to see it. So really, all I can offer is a review of where this ranks within the series. After Furious 7, when the death of Paul Walker put a damper on things, the series dipped. Both The Fate of the Furious and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, despite having insane titles, were pretty lackluster movies. F9: The Fast Saga, was a bit of a course correction, capturing some, but not all, of the magic that the series found at its height (namely the unofficial trilogy consisting of parts 5-7). Fast X is most comparable to F9 in both quality and style, but has such a gleeful abandon that it takes a slight edge. It’s the best of the post-Furious 7 bunch, but doesn’t quite have the same charm as the first three films. It’s certainly better than part 4, a “we’re trying to figure out what this series can be” entry if there ever was one.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Bush Jr was in the White House, Tony Blair in Downing Street, Bertie Ahern still easing his way into the role of Taoiseach, the Twin Towers still standing when The Fast And The Furious was released. Its simple formula — of wronged street racers avoiding the law at high speed — may not have evolved all that much in the intervening years, but the plots and auto stunts have become ever more preposterous. This, we are assured, will be the penultimate instalment, with a grand finale in 2025, after which the noise will cease, as various characters putter off into aimless spin-offs. The locus of all this nonsense has always been Dominic ‘Dom’ Toretto, reformed hoodlum and man of few words, played with a pout by Vin Diesel, the catatonic action star who does not so much act, as stand. Around him has grown an extended family — Dom is all about ‘family’, he says the word ‘family’ a lot — including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), harum-scarum road racer and now Mrs Toretto, Dom’s sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), his brother Jakob (John Cena), old buddies Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), and master hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). These days, Dom just wants to settle down, rest his weary limbs, be with his ‘family’ and so forth, but there’s always an aggrieved party, collateral damage from some previous escapade now hellbent on revenge. In this case, that would be Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes, who died horribly during a heist organised by Dom’s gang way back inFast Five(2011). If you can remember anything that happened in that film, you deserve a prize, but I do recall it being easily the best of the Fast & Furious films, and it’s certainly better than this one. Unhinged, badly dressed and carrying on like a Hawaiian frat boy, Dante does not merely want to kill Dom and co, he wants them to suffer. And after a campaign of craziness is unleashed in Rome, Dom must join forces with enemies, including Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) and even the dreaded Cipher (Charlize Theron) to challenge Dante’s might. This thing is loud and toneless, stupid above and beyond franchise requirements, not helped by a dreadful turn from Momoa, who aims for camp comedy and misses by a country mile.",NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Directed by the mediocre French action filmmaker Louis Leterrier (“Transporter 2,” “Clash of the Titans”), after Justin Lin dropped out in that position, “Fast X,” the 11th film in the “Fast & Furious” franchise, featuring Vin Diesel’s famously laconic renegade Dominic Toretto, reunites the remaining members of the “Fast & Furious” team aka Dominic Toretto’s family. As usual, the film, which uses the Roman numeral for 10, instead of the Arabic number, is an often laughable mix of family-movie mawkishness, over-the-top, nitro-boosted action and toxic masculinity. It’s worth noting that even the women in the “Fast & Furious” series are super-masculine when necessary. Rita Moreno of the original “West Side Story” appears in an opening family meal to give this schmaltzy-super-violent, supremely dumb action film a classic film glaze. The film’s nothing-if-not-redundant screenplay is by Dan Mazeau (“Clash of the Titans”) and Justin Lin (“F9:” The Fast Saga”). What are we to make of these “Fast & Furious” films? They are like dim-witted versions of “The Godfather” movies with street racers, who engage in all types of gangster film activities (heists mostly), instead of actual gangsters. The problem is the characters in “Fast & Furious” films only exist in the minds of the film’s makers and fans, and their activities resemble nothing more than wanton boys banging their toy cars and trucks together, setting them on fire, flinging them from rooftops and blowing them up for their frighteningly destructive amusement. This installment begins by recapping scenes set in Rio de Janeiro from Lin’s “Fast Five” (2011) in which a giant vault is dragged through the streets of Rio, resurrecting Paul Walker and wreaking the usual (previously shot) mayhem. All the surviving players are here for X: Dom, his wife and powerful fighter and driver Letty Ortiz (Michele Rodriguez), Don’s hard-fighting sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), former convict Roman Pearce (an occasionally amusing Tyrese Gibson), master mechanic and tech expert Tej Parker (Ludacris), as well as others from the franchise, including Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), his mother Queenie (Helen Mirren), previous villain Cipher (Charlize Theron) and newcomer Tess (a completely supernumerary Brie Larson), the daughter of the absent Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell). Plus, we have surprise cameos that you probably didn’t want. Most noteworthy character outside of Dom himself is Dante (Jason Momoa), the revenge-seeking son of the late Don Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, “Warrior Nun”). Thanks to Momoa’s excessively nutty behavior, outfits and make-up and coiffures, Dante becomes this film’s low-rent Joker. In scenes set in Rome, for example, super-villain Dante threatens the Vatican itself with a giant ball-shaped bomb straight off “Raiders of the Lost Ark” rolling down the streets of the Eternal City. See flaming slo-mo SUVs fly through the air like ballet dancers made out of glass and metal. In Rome, Mirren’s Queenie wryly notes that Diesel’s Dom is “no Gregory Peck” in reference to the William Wyler classic “Roman Holiday.” Well, Queenie’s’s not quite Audrey Hepburn, either. Pete Davidson has a widely reported bit that is so throwaway they should have thrown it away. The agency known as the Agency descends upon Dom’s house in L.A. where Aunt Mia and Uncle Jakob (John Cena, quipping none too brightly again) fight to protect Dom’s son Brian aka B (Leo Abelo Perry). Back in Rio, we get a leering montage of butts and Dante in pigtails and nail polish. Can you drop a car from a low-flying cargo plane and not have it smash to pieces? Can you drop me off, please?",NEGATIVE

"May 18, 2023"," At this point in time, if you’ve made it to “Fast X,” which opens on area screens Friday, you’re either all in or a glutton for punishment. After more than 20 years, having either position isn’t a bad thing. They certainly may be testaments to how much an audience can enjoy or endure. “The Fast Saga,” as it’s come to be known, is review-proof as the cumulative box office total of more than $6.2 billion can attest. Only the sheer absurdity of most of the films can eclipse that fact. Dominic Toretto (forever stoic Vin Diesel) and Brian O’Conner (the late Paul Walker) catapult themselves between two skyscrapers in an uber expensive, high-performance car in a Middle Eastern country. Yup, got that one, too. Somewhere along the way during the course of 10 films, “The Fast Saga” ceased being about guys and ladies and the street racing car culture they inhabited and became secret agents on wheels. That fact in itself represents a significant escalation of the absurdity factor. Dom and his crew ceased being bad guys and turned into superheroes whose respective powers were directly tied to their cars and their ability to manipulate them to do patently ridiculous things. And the audience eagerly went along for the ride as the franchise picked up new passengers, be it Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson, Charlize Theron or Helen Mirren. Those last two are Oscar winners who’ve willingly loaned their gravitas to the franchise and are an absolute indicator that “The Fast Saga” isn’t to be taken seriously. It’s pure unrestrained escapism, films meant to provide refuge from everyday life. And by gosh, actors like to have fun too. No, Dom and his buddies don’t exist nor do they operate in our world in its current state (lucky them), but they do allow us into theirs and, to be honest, it’s a lot more fun than reading headlines about government budget crises and the latest mass shooting. And add to the mix that in the franchise’s evolution, those associated with the franchise have managed to make it about something more than just fast cars and crashes. The message about family may feel a bit contrived, but there’s little doubt the cast has been able to mine it for every bit of emotion. And what about plot in this one? A villain from the past (Jason Momoa, who gets to camp it up, much to the audience’s delight) is out for revenge on Dom, but really, at this point does it matter?",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," The end of the road begins. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began. Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. With the tenth movie in the bag, Fast X knows what people are coming to see, and it delivers in full when it comes to the stunts. There’s no question that many of the chase scenes are exhilarating to watch and the explosive situations are enough to make Michael Bay drool. One of my favorite moments was the chase scene in Rome. What made it work for me was how practical they made the sequence feel. Sure, it was over the top, but in this Fast franchise, it actually had a pragmatic feel to it. (Until the end, but I’ll address that later.) No matter how insane some of the stunts were, you still couldn’t help but watch the madness ensue. Of all the performances, the absolute best highlight was Jason Momoa. He clearly was channeling his inner Joker with his performance. What I loved was how his performance matched up perfectly with his character, Dante. He was an absolute problem for the Fast family and it was refreshing to see a villain be so completely unhinged. The crazy thing is that Momoa’s character manages to accomplish things that the whole franchise wishes but can’t. For example, Dante’s commentary throughout the series is spot-on and hilarious. It was like all the positive energy that would go into making a movie great flowed into him and left everyone else out to dry. While I did enjoy watching most of the stunts in Fast X, they always seemed to find a point of absurdity that made me check out and roll my eyes. The sad thing is that a lot of the stupidity that happens in the stunts are completely unnecessary. Either that, or they’re so unbelievable that whatever sense of urgency you may have felt being built up, immediately goes away because an outlandish moment makes you feel like you accidentally turned on a cartoon. The other thing that made me check out at times was Vin Diesel and his acting. It’s kind of odd to see this character go from the mysteriously cool persona from the first couple of films to now being a super-strength, inspirational-quoting Rocky wannabe. Trust me, I NEVER go into these movies looking for award-level acting, but Diesel’s performance was cheesy and cringy most times he wasn’t driving a car. A lot of the contrived emotional drama felt like a low-budget soap opera. I should also mention, without spoilers, Dom Torretto is a terrible parent. Diesel wasn’t the only culprit either. Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce wasn’t one of my favorites either. I’ll grant that comedy is subjective for sure, but Tyrese’s scenes simply didn’t work for me. Every single one of his scenes felt like a deleted scene that forgot to be deleted. Will you get some cheap laughs? Maybe? For me, I’m just a little exhausted with his character not really adding anything meaningful to the franchise besides corny, poorly-timed, forced jokes. When it comes to the plot of Fast X, the story was doing the absolute most. There were so many subplots and characters to juggle that the almost 2.5-hour run time started to weigh down at times. So much attention is misplaced on Dom that the other characters suffer as a result. Thankfully, a random action sequence was thrown in to help keep your attention. However, even then, I still found myself questioning why Fast X kept forcing situations in an inorganic way. People would be cool one minute, and then out of nowhere, they’d just start fighting. Why? Because fights are cool? Plus, the drama felt so forced. With so much of the story going all over the place, emotional beats fell flat because they had no time to really develop and pay off. Not to mention, given the fact that this franchise doesn’t allow characters to stay dead, the stakes in this film are lessened even more. Fast X is a culmination of all the nonsensical action that the Fast & Furious franchise has devolved into, yet manages to entertain audiences to some degree. It carries the same awe of a fireworks demonstration and the wonderment of witnessing a car crash. With ten movies in, and God knows how many more left to go, I’ve given up expecting this franchise to get any better. At the same time, being a fan of the first 5 movies, and loving the beautiful Paul Walker tribute in Fast 7, I fully admit that I’m not going anywhere. I‘m still going to watch these movies because I’d love to just see them finally cross the finish line.  I’m fully aware Fast X doesn’t take itself seriously. I’m aware that no one is asking for Shakespearean-level acting. I watch action movies all the time and I know the standards. But the Fast and Furious franchise constantly finds a way to reach a new low while still throwing shiny explosions and cars on screen. It’s gotten so low that I think the Fast Franchise can’t even be compared anymore to other action films. In a similar way to how the John Wick franchise has separated itself into a different action category, so has Fast and Furious. It’s because of that I’m really tempted to judge this movie on a curve. It’s like a B-movie with a Hollywood budget and production team. At the same time, I also see how Tom Cruise manages to raise the stakes and stunts in each of his Mission Impossible movies proving that you can have action and logic work simultaneously. If you wanted a sense of what Fast X will give you, I think it’s a combination of the absurdity brought to you in Fast 8 (The Fate of the Furious), but it’s a step above Fast 9. If you’re good with senseless action, corny jokes, and literally unbelievable stunts that abuse helicopters and cars, then Fast X is exactly what you’ll want to see.  Stay tuned for one post-credit scene that hopefully wasn’t spoiled for you. If you need to play catch up, the Fast & Furious collection is available on Blu-Ray and DVD.

"May 18, 2023"," So much has gone over the top in these “Fast and Furious” movies — stunt work and demolition, obviously; but also family trees, racing, race, plots, pates, biceps, upper backs — that it wasn’t until I saw what Jason Momoa was up to in this new installment, “Fast X,” that I realized how much the acting had stayed under the table. He swoops in to play a flamboyant terrorist named Dante Reyes. And it’s pretty clear, from the pitiful quips he’s been given and the light-loafer treatment he’s going for, that the mustache Momoa’s twirling isn’t his. It’s Rip Taylor’s. For half a century, Taylor ran all over American TV in a hail of confetti that he threw for himself. He didn’t act. He made appearances. That’s how Momoa operates here, showing up wherever the movie needs him (on patio furniture, at the top of the Aldeadávila Dam) in lavender and snakeskin and billowing everything, horny to blow something up. These movies have been out of good ideas since “Furious 7” eight years ago, mired in government-flavored tug-of-wars over hacking, surveillance and tech. And Momoa’s here to zhuzh things up. So along with Taylor’s mustache, Momoa twirls himself. It’s like watching an overcup oak go trick-or-treating as a Christmas tree. And yet, even though he destroys the Spanish Steps of Rome with alacrity and purrs lines like, “I know what you’re thinking. And yes: the carpet matches the drapes,” it’s not zhuzh-y enough. Momoa is giving the Joker. But Cesar Romero’s. Of course, he’s the only person here committed to clear and present lunacy, going for post-macho chill, refashioning the quote marks around him into neck pillows. Five movies and a dozen years ago, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the gang trashed favelas in Rio de Janeiro and killed Dante’s drug-lord father (along with scores of innocent Brazilians, but we’re not going there today). Now, with the series at the bottom of its barrel, Dante wants revenge. This means sending a giant bomb barreling toward the Vatican. He doesn’t quite pull that off, but his wish comes true to make wanted terrorists of Dom and the rest of the gang, creating a rift between them and the feds they covertly work for and spoiling the driving lessons Dom had been giving to his 8-year-old son, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). There are about five intersected plot lines, credited to Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau (the director Louis Leterrier replaces Lin as mayhem manager). Dom on the run; Dom’s brother, Jakob (John Cena), babysitting Brian (they’re on the run, too); some of Dom’s crew — Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) — all but backpacking through Europe; Dom’s wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), arrested and locked up alongside the crew’s cyberterrorist nemesis, Cipher (Charlize Theron); and the two feds, Aimes (Alan Ritchson) and Tess (Brie Larson), at odds with each other over whether to aid or apprehend the “F&F” gang. And just about every strand stems from Dante’s pique and gets left as a cliffhanger that won’t be resolved until years from now in, what, “Fast X+1”? The best I can say about all of this is that it didn’t bore me. But this is a series that, by the time its fourth and fifth installments arrived, had merged the original movie’s casually erotic, multiethnic, omni-racial car culture with the “can’t top that” set pieces of Hollywood summer movies. It wasn’t that that fusion was never boring. It had the thrill of newness. How many times have I laughed, in awe, at what this series could do with all kinds of vehicles and the people behind them. It insisted that a universe of nonwhite folks could meet the priorities of blockbuster filmmaking and still rake up money around the globe. And it was exciting to see who they could enfold into that agenda (Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Kurt Russell). Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"May 18, 2023"," It may be hard to believe now, but the “Fast and Furious” franchise, which reaches its tenth installment with this all-too-cutely titled, totally brainless behemoth, began in 2001 with a comparatively cheesy muscle-car movie about an undercover cop who infiltrated a gang of street racers with a sideline in crime.  Over time what started as a slicker version of a Roger Corman potboiler morphed into a “Mission Impossible” wannabe, with Vin Diesel, as “family” head Dom Toretto, putting Tom Cruise to shame only in terms of stern inexpressiveness.  The plots grew ever more ludicrous, the interrelationships among characters ever more convoluted, and the stunts ever more preposterous as the budgets ballooned to astronomical levels.  It’s telling that this tenth movie in the franchise cost nearly ten times as much as the first one did, but provides less entertainment value—a damning statement, since “The Fast and the Furious” was itself no prize. The plot is a simple revenge tale, introduced by a long segment from 2011’s “Fast Five,” a goodly portion of the culminating heist of the vault containing the consolidated cash of Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who dies in pursuit of his treasure.  But the footage is altered to insert the figure of Reyes’ son Dante (Jason Momoa) and one other person who shall remain nameless to avoid spoiling one of the screenplay’s supposed surprises. Ten years later, Dante returns, having mapped out a plan to make Dom suffer by targeting his family—not only his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and their son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), as well as his brother Jake (John Cena) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), though thankfully his tough grandmother (Rita Moreno, introduced in an early cameo) seems to be absent from the list—but his “extended” one, which basically means his entire team and former associates.  These include Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and his partner in bickering Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), computer wiz Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang).  Along the way Shaw (Jason Statham), the absent Mr. Nobody’s lieutenant (Scott Eastwood), mechanic Buddy (Michael Rooker) and even Queenie (Helen Mirren) make reappearances, though in the last three cases very brief ones.  Another returnee shows up in the sequel-promising clip in the closing credits, but who won’t be revealed here. Then there are newcomers: Tess (Brie Larson), Mr. Nobody’s daughter; Aimes (Alan Ritchson), the new head of Mr. Nobody’s agency; and Isabel (Daniela Melchior), a Brazilian street racer who turns out to have a family connection to Dom. That’s a huge ensemble to manage, and the screenplay–credited to Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin (who was originally scheduled to direct but pulled out of the project over the usual “creative differences,” replaced by Louis Leterrier, at best a journeyman action helmer who’s also talked about his rewriting of the script)–has trouble shoehorning them into a single narrative and providing each with something substantial to do.  The solution is to toss in lots of fights, car chases, races and big action set-pieces that all can engage in, in various combinations, even if why some of them happen is a mystery.  Apparently the disparate episodes are all integral parts of Dante’s master plan, which seems to depend on everyone doing precisely what he predicts from moment to moment.  That pits the crew against the authorities, including Aimes and his agency, and leads to face-offs all over the globe, from Portugal to Antarctica.  At one point some of the gang retreat to a place run by a shifty character (Pete Davidson) to secure some needed equipment, which raises the question of who would be stupid enough to trust anybody played by Pete Davidson. Dom stops off in Rio, too, where there’s an impromptu, raucously colorful drag race featuring him, Dante, Isabel and Diogo (Luis Da Silva Jr.), another returnee from “Fast Five.”  Everything culminates in a confrontation involving Dom, Jake, Brian and Dante atop a dam, which ends in what’s probably the series’ most absurd escape-by-car. That finale, and the big action moments elsewhere, are marked by special effects that are, to put it charitably, mediocre.  The explosions and vehicular crashes look fine enough—they’re basically real wastes of autos, after all—but the CGI accompanying them is often second-rate (like the car superimposed over the carnage at the very end), a surprise considering the mega-budget.  Otherwise the technical crew—production designer Jan Roelfs and cinematographer Stephen Windon—do a decent job, though editors Dylan Highsmith, Kelly Matsumoto can’t bring coherence to either the mishmash of plot or the overextended set-pieces.  Brian Tyler’s score is a model of empty bombast, like the movie it serves.  As to the acting, everybody does what’s expected of them, reciting the insipid, frequently laughable (and not in a good way) dialogue as required; Cena at least brings some amiability to Uncle Jake.  Diesel is his customary stiff, brawny self, stone-faced but for the slight smile he occasionally shows to his kid (Perry, much less adorable than intended) and grandmother, and declaiming Dom’s frequent dull encomia to family in stentorian monotone.  Frankly, the series has missed the presence of the likable Walker since his untimely death. In any event, the real star of this installment is the villain, and as Dante, Momoa gives a performance so ostentatiously awful that you’d swear he was actively campaigning for a Razzie.  In a film that’s over-the-top, he might be described as over-over-the-top, fiendishly grinning and flamboyantly swishing his way through every unbelievable plot twist.  It’s a thoroughly corrupt piece of work, offensive in its dependence on hoary old stereotypes rather than funny, and by the end it has become pretty much insufferable. But apparently he’ll be back in the second part of this multi-episode finale, which—if reports are correct—may extend to a third chapter as well.  That’s a cruel threat, given that the “Fast” series is already running on fumes that are fast approaching the point of noxiousness.",NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Momoa plays Dante Reyes, the son of Joaquim de Almeida’s Fast Five big bad. Because if there’s one thing this franchise loves besides the vroom vroom, it’s telling us later that there was a family member lurking just on the periphery who comes back for vengeance in a future installment. This drives the whole plot. Dante wants to not just kill Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his ragtag group of super spies (and that’s what they are now, the saga has fully stopped pretending) but wants to rip their lives apart. And he will do it with the most convoluted, nonsensical plan imaginable.  The plot is a mishmash of elaborate chase scenes tied together by tenuous premises and the sprawling internal, and discombobulated mythology the Fast and Furious movies have cooked up over the last 20-plus years. Which is really what this franchise is all about. Only Fast X lacks any of the emotional resonance, earnest camaraderie, or joy that sold the earlier chapters, especially Five through Seven, as much as the action ever did. The result is a hollow shell of a movie, which is saying something because F8 and F9 are vapid as hell.  Everyone gets their own side quest. We’ve got Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), the most chemistry-free couple in all blockbuster cinema, who love nothing more than abandoning their young child to go adventuring around the globe. Roman (Tyreese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) do their schtick, bantering back and forth in an act so tiresome and threadbare when Ramsey (Natalie Emmanuel) rolls her eyes at them it feels more like the character doing it than the actor. Han (Sung Kang) kicks around sometimes, Jordana Brewster’s Mia pops up occasionally, as does Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and a who’s who grab bag of other familiar players. And we get new players, like Brie Larson’s Tess and Alan Ritchson’s Aimes, Agency spooks who do espionage things.  And even with all of this, it's wildly inconsistent within the framework of the other movies. For example, Jakob (John Cena), Dom’s long-lost brother. He went from being a cold, calculating international terrorist in F9 to being wacky uncle Jakob who dances and makes Vanilla Ice jokes. This turn is actually much more in line with what Cena does well as an actor, but it’s a complete 180 from the last outing. Nothing feels like it has any consequences, to the next scene, the next act, the next movie, and so on. There’s so much going on, and somehow none of it matters. I can already hear people saying things like, “This is just big dumb action,” and that I expect too much. Big dumb action is great, big dumb action is fun. These movies have made billions of dollars on that premise. But Fast X is just dumb and missing the fun component. (Momoa excepted.) Dante plays like an audience surrogate, like a meta commentary looking at these movies from the outside and making fun of the inherent absurdity. It’s starting to seem like a Sharknado kind of situation, like the filmmakers are inviting us to laugh along with them at this stupid movie they made instead of with the movie. It’s not only horribly inauthentic, but it also undercuts the heart and pleasure of earlier movies and feels insulting as an audience member.  Even the action, which has always been the one thing this franchise could always hang its hat on in the bleakest days, leaves you wanting. Again, after going to space, parachuting cars out of planes, and drag racing a nuclear submarine, how can you top that? Fast X tries, but fails, stringing together sequences of subpar action scenes. And we’re not criticizing the physics-defying nature of the action, they left any pretense of reality in the rearview long ago. What we get here is uninspired, thrill-less car chases with zero stakes, physically or emotionally, and shoddy CGI and green screen work. For as much hyperactivity as they put on screen, the result plays painfully dull and devoid of any tension.  And then there’s the end. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil the ending, because there isn’t one. It ends; it just ends. In the middle of a climactic scene, Fast X stops and that’s it. Like so much of the preceding film, it’s an empty, ill-conceived choice that offers no reason to care. The resulting impression walking out of the theater is one of a franchise that’s gradually had everything that once made it special leached out of it and like maybe the filmmakers never understood what made it good in the first place. At this point, the only way to redeem these movies is to bring back Johnny Strong as the main villain. [Grade: D+ and the + is 100% for Jason Momoa and nothing else.]",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2023"," You may recall that the last entry in the Fast and Furious saga, 2021’s F9, featured a sequence in which two of the Avengers our heroes—the comic foils Tyrese Gibson and Chris “Ludacris” Bridges—drove a car into outer space. There is not anything quite as wacky as that in the 10th and latest installment, Fast X, but there are still plenty of reality-defying stunts that keep this franchise from returning to Earth in any fashion that’s recognizably rooted in reality. Still, back in F9, one got the sense that the film was at least leaning into its sheer ridiculousness, which made it more palatable and entertaining. With one notable exception, however, Dominic Toretto’s much-discussed Family is now taking itself far too seriously. As a result, the 141-minute movie is a fairly lumbering and tedious sit. The exception is Jason Momoa as villain Dante Reyes, who in a bit of blatant retconning turns out to be the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), defeated by Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and executed by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in Fast Five. It’s not clear why Dante has waited five movies to exact his revenge on Dom , but it seems likely that he spent at least part of that time watching The Dark Knight over and over and perfecting his Heath Ledger/Joker impersonation. Yes, Momoa borrows heavily from that iconic performance—with a bit more sashaying and prancing – yet despite the derivative nature of his delivery, he’s terrific. It’s obvious that he’s having a blast and, as we often say, acting in his own separate movie. The same can’t be said for the rest of the Fast cast, who know exactly what movie they’re in and are starting to show signs of fatigue. In a bit of a twist, Fast X starts off with the now-standard cookout in Dom’s backyard, instead of ending with it. Abuelita Toretto (Rita Moreno) gives the usual homily about family. The rest of the plot is pretty simple: Momoa’s Dante wants to avenge the death of his father by not just taking out Dom but also making sure that Dom sees the rest of his family—including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Gibson), Tej (Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Mia (Jordana Brewster), and Jakob (John Cena), along with Dom’s son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry)—tormented and killed first. Dante is ready to go to extreme lengths to accomplish his mission too. The film’s first major action sequence features the crew chasing a bouncing neutron bomb through the streets of Rome where Dante’s (again, Joker-like) ability to stay three steps ahead of the crew and have traps laid out for them certainly makes Momoa the franchise’s deadliest foe yet. But there’s just one problem with all this: The beats are so familiar by now that a certain numbness sets in, and it’s also become very evident over the course of the last few movies that the stakes in the Fast franchise are virtually nil. This is an issue when the characters, while graduating over the course of the series from illegal street racers to high-tech intelligence operatives, are still supposed to be human in some way. But no human could withstand or survive the chaotic, pulverizing destruction that is wrought upon their bodies and vehicles, let alone even accomplish it (even if it looks more computer-generated than ever). And as we’ve also seen, thanks to the return of the supposedly deceased Han in F9, even death doesn’t keep these folks down.  Hence how even a new death scene doesn’t even carry any emotional weight because it’s just as likely that the character will be back by Fast XI (supposedly the last one, although Diesel has been grunting something about a trilogy lately). Again, this might all be much more fun if the franchise as a whole embraced its essential, absurd nature. But every time it steps in that direction, the turgid, by-the-numbers script, and especially the performance from Diesel himself, pull it back into the same endless speechifying about the family and faith and loyalty. That’s what makes Momoa’s performance so jarring. It stands apart from the rest of the film, even if Momoa’s doing a variation on the Clown Prince of Crime. Elsewhere, most of the ensemble, aside from Diesel and Rodriguez, get shortchanged in various ways. Gibson and Bridges’ patter is stale by now while there is barely a shot in which Emmanuel isn’t chained to a laptop. Brewster is barely in the thing. As for Cena, his abrupt swerve from master assassin in the previous film to a kind of goofy uncle in this one is indicative of the real lack of attention paid to these characters as the series has gone along, although the actor does play to his comedic strengths and gets by on his sheer charisma. The guest stars are all trotted dutifully out but given little to do. Of all of them, Charlize Theron’s Cipher perhaps fares the best while Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, and Scott Eastwood, along with newbies Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, and Daniela Melchior, are all given a few minutes of screentime then hustled off. As usual, Brian (the late Paul Walker) is said to be around and “safe” somewhere, but the series has really backed itself into a corner by pretending that he won’t come out to play even as his best friend Dom faces his gravest threat yet—a big, glaring elephant in the room that the franchise has utterly failed at handling. Aside from Momoa’s flamboyant display, Fast X borrows other elements liberally from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, from the pursuit of a bomb in a truck through city streets (The Dark Knight Rises) to even lines of dialogue (“Oh, you wouldn’t be interested in that,” lifted right from Morgan Freeman’s mouth in Batman Begins and handed to Cena, also about a new vehicle). It’s kind of surprising that they didn’t go the well-worn “villain allows himself to be caught” route. The aforementioned bomb chase sequence is actually quite exciting to watch for the most part, and a few of the other action sequences—as digitized and wildly impossible as they are—provide more than a few thrills, which is fairly impressive since Fast X is directed by pinch-hitter Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk), who too over from the abruptly departed Justin Lin. Those scenes combined with Momoa’s presence provides at least some spark of life to the movie, which more or less runs out the clock and ends with a cliffhanger. It’s not a spoiler to say that; we all know that Fast XI or Furious One Short of a Dozen, or whatever it’s called, is on the way. There’s also a short tag before the credits roll that exacerbates some of the problems we’ve discussed, as well as a mid-credits scene that many of you have heard about by now. If Vin and company aimed for their Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises here (with a side of Avengers: Infinity War), then surely the Fast version of Avengers: Endgame is next. But Vin, please, let’s end it there.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023"," Twenty-seven times. That’s how often one character or another utters the word “family” in Fast X, latest in the long-running, long-revving Fast & Furious franchise. To put that in perspective, you know what phrase gets used a mere 22 times in the original Star Wars? “The Force.” So there’s our leitmotif. And what is the extended, blended family of Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto up to this time? Well, long gone are the days when they were street racing for pinks, and/or committing multi-million dollar heists for fun and profit. Nowadays they operate on the right side of the law, though still near enough to the edge that it’s easy to to frame them. Such is the vengeance-fuelled desire of Dante Reyes, played by Jason Momoa as though auditioning to be the next Joker. A prologue set 10 years ago reminds us of the time that Dominic and family stole $100-million (and the vault it came in) from Dante’s dad, drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. Momoa (not to mention the late Paul Walker) are CGd into the flashback, with the death of the elder Reyes providing all the motivation Dante needs for his present-day mayhem, which fills up the rest of the film’s 141 minutes. Dante is a formidable opponent, able to get his hands on money, intelligence, personnel, vehicles, weapons – just about anything short of buttons to keep his shirt fronts closed. I mean, look at the sequence in Rome, in which two of Toretto’s guys find themselves locked inside a tractor-trailer hauling a huge incendiary device. When the truck crashes and the spherical bomb gets loose, it spends the next 20 minutes bouncing and pinballing its way through the city, making for the Vatican with the single-minded determination of a tourist with limited time to take in the sights. It’s as if the boulder in Raiders of the Lost Ark had its own personality, and a score to settle. The cast is massive, and introduces some new faces including Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior (also in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) and Alan Ritchson, whose character accuses the Toretto family of stealing “at least one nuclear submarine,” as if he’s not certain if there were others and would like to hedge his bets. There are also a pile of returning characters, chief among them Michelle Rodriguez as Dom’s wife; and trusted lieutenants played by Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang and others. There are cameos by Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno and Gal Gadot (stay through the credits for one more), but the prize for the best entrance goes to Charlize Theron, who rolls up in a DeLorean Alpha5, a prototype for a future electric sports car that will (because I know you’re curious) go from 0 to 88 mph in just 4.35 seconds. And there are stunts galore, which start at the level of the impossible and just get crazier. It’s not just that the actions of the cars – flipping end over end, pulling helicopters of the sky, surviving a bomb’s shock wave through a combination of horsepower and willpower – are bonkers. It’s the image of Dom or one of his crew glancing in the side mirror and concluding: “Yeah, I could crash this car into that one, blowing up a third while stopping a fourth and killing no one,” – all with the casual nonchalance with which we mortals might merely merge into traffic. It’s all shot with breezy elegance by returning cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, who’s been shooting these movies since Fast Five in 2011, plus Tokyo Drift in ’06. New to the director’s chair is Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, Clash of the Titans), who easily manages the transitions from calm, drinking-beer-and-talking-family moments to intense driving-fast-and-talking-family scenes and back again. He’s already in pre-production of Fast X: Part 2, which will either wrap up the franchise or else segue into yet one more instalment. My money’s on the latter – why make 11 movies when you can make 12? But also, Fast X offers such giddy, goofball enjoyment, I’d gladly return for two more if they can keep the energy flowing.

"May 18, 2023"," While delighting in Fast X like a kid with a giant bucket of popcorn and Milk Duds, I remarked to my friend and colleague Jen Chaney that the moment this franchise broke free from the shackles of logic was in Fast Five. You probably know the scene, too, when Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O’Connor (Paul Walker) and the fam raced away with an entire stolen vault of money from Brazilian crime kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Ironic, because that moment was the catalyst for everything that happens in this latest film, the tenth in the epic 22-year race and (for now) the penultimate chapter. From that scene on, these movies have never cared one wit about what makes sense, and it’s to their credit that we as its fans no longer care, either. Cars in outer space? Sure. Former garage mechanics manning nuclear submarines? Okay, whatever. People coming back from the dead? We’re down for any and all of it. Now, imagine that this franchise, with all of the ludicrous shit it’s done over the years, only has two movies to cram as much ludicrosity (That’s not a word but I’m running with it.) as possible. That’s basically what Fast X is, as not a lot makes any kind of sense but you won’t care because it’s all too Goddamned fun and exciting to deny. There’s bombastic and then there’s this, with so many car crashes and explosions per-minute they make Michael Bay feel woefully inadequate. In numerous ways this is to be expected. For the first time in a long time, these movies have a legit action filmmaker in Louis Leterrier. This guy doesn’t do anything else well other than craft ridiculous set pieces (he directed Now You See Me and Incredible Hulk) and make muscular bald-headed dudes look like gods (and also Transporter 2), so he’s right in the proverbial wheelhouse. The story is absurd and demands that you be an expert at the Fast & Furious trivia game to understand what the Hell is going on. Even those of us who have studied these movies ad nauseum can get knocked loopy by some of it, while convenient editing of footage attempts to make it all seamless. Picking up from those events in Fast Five, the death of Reyes leads to the emergence of his vengeful son, Dante, played by Jason Momoa doing what I can only describe as the RuPaul’s Drag Race version of Jared Leto’s Joker. I’m pretty sure they gave Momoa zero notes on this performance. Dante is both menacing and fabulous, the first truly unique character to hit these movies in ages. He makes a statement by putting a hurt on the villainous Cipher (Charlize Theron) so bad that she comes running to archnemesis Dom for help. He’s skeptical, given that she murdered his ex-wife and mother to his son Brian Marcos (Leo Abelo Perry), but soon it becomes clear that Cipher is telling the truth. Dom has a lot more to worry about this time, and you can probably guess what this is in a single word: FAMILY.  Yes, “family”, literally mentioned in various languages no less than 17 times and possibly more since I gave up counting near the end. With Dom’s son growing up, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) by his side, sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) off doing who knows what with her husband Brian O’Connor eternally out getting groceries (They should’ve killed Brian off years ago, sorry to say. His absence is just weird.), newly rehabilitated little bro Jakob (John Cena), and now grandmother Abuelita (Rita Moreno) saying grace over the dinner table, the Toretto clan could now field a baseball team if it wanted to. A lot of narrative cartwheels are done to connect these characters together by blood, and that includes the infamous Shaw family (Jason Statham, Helen Mirren), all of which find themselves at odds with Dante, who seeks revenge for his own family. Having been retroactively added to past footage, Dante now has years of pent-up rage to unleash and a lot of psychopathic urges to indulge. Fast & Furious once had a gritty, street-level nobility that drove (no pun intended) the first few movies to varying degrees of success. That’s long gone, replaced by what is essentially Mission: Impossible on four wheels, with ever-escalating spectacle in the place of storyline cohesion. In this case, one of the huge sequences finds Dom and his team chasing down a flaming bomb as it hurtles towards the Vatican, unleashed by Dante in an effort to wipe out Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson), who has deluded himself into thinking he can lead this mission with any degree of success. After so long, you sorta forget just how many characters are part of this universe, until Fast X slaps you over the head and reminds you of each and every one of them. Even a side character like Kurt Russell’s clandestine Mr. Nobody has spawned a little mini-universe of his own. Brie Larson turns up the star power for a glorified bit role as Tess, Mr. Nobody’s daughter who also works for the mysterious Agency, while Scott Eastwood is “Little Nobody”, a sort of generic functionary only notable because he’s played by Eastwood. There’s also refrigerator-sized Jack Reacher star Alan Ritchson as Aimes, who has taken control over the Agency and turned its considerable resources against Dom, making life even more difficult. It used to be that critics would say “If you like one you’ll like them all’ when it came to these movies, but Fate of the Furious was so terrible it put an end to that lazy analysis that too was guilty of. While F9 reached a farcical apex with a literal trip into outer space, Fast X is comparatively grounded in terms of stakes. This isn’t a case of the entire world being in jeopardy, although the world is nonetheless scarred by billions of dollars in property damage. The story here is a deeply personal one that strikes at the movies’ core theme. Family has its benefits, but also its share of pain. One consistent narrative is that every character that enters Dom’s orbit becomes a part of that family, but there has to be a breaking point. Not everyone can have the family’s best interests at heart, and what happens when that is someone close to Dom’s inner circle? The script, crafted together by Dan Mazeau and previous director Justin Lin, is arguably the worst and most expository yet. But it doesn’t really have much choice in being that way, and at this point lousy writing is part of the charm. You don’t even really notice it until you get legends like Moreno and Mirren spouting nonsense. There are too many guest stars to list, and some shock twists that will have longtime fans literally screaming in their seats. I know, because I did at least twice. Whether Fast X is the start of a two-part finale or the first leg of a new trilogy, we don’t know, but this film is everything you’ve come to love and hate about Fast & Furious all condensed and powered by rocket fuel. My suggestion is that you see it with others who also live their lives a quarter mile at a time, and who pray at the altar of Dom’s indestructible Dodge Charger.  Fast X is overstuffed and over-the-top fan service, and after more than two decades this franchise knows how to keep its fans on the edge of their seats.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Rápidos y furiosos X (Fast X, Estados Unidos/2023). Dirección: Louis Leterrier. Guion: Dan Mazeau y Justin Lin. Fotografía: Stephen F. Windon. Música: Bryan Tyler. Edición: Dylan Highsmith y Kelly Matsumoto. Elenco: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Momoa, Brie Larson, Charlize Theron, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Alan Ritchson, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno. Duración: 141 minutos. Distribuidora: UIP. Calificación: apta para mayores de 16 años. Nuestra opinión: muy buena. Rápidos y furiosos X confirma a pleno lo que Vin Diesel venía adelantando. Estamos frente al primer episodio de una trilogía que pondrá fin a la serie estable de acción y aventuras más grande, más larga y más ambiciosa concebida por un gran estudio de Hollywood para ser vista y disfrutada en el cine, porque hacerlo de otra manera contradice por completo la naturaleza de esta creación. La historia de Rápidos y furiosos creció tanto en cada nuevo capítulo que para cerrarla solo es posible pensar en un relato de dimensiones apoteósicas. El primer acto de este largo adiós lo corrobora, pero no solamente desde el marco de sus espectaculares set-pieces y el descomunal despliegue de una producción que viaja de Los Angeles a Roma y de Londres a Portugal con elementos de ficción suficientes como para provocar la destrucción de ciudades enteras a cada paso. Aquí, además de nervio, músculo y grandes escenas de acción que siempre tienen sentido y se entienden de principio a fin, hay corazón. Rápidos y furiosos quiere despedirse llevando a lo más alto sus banderas y sus mejores virtudes. Todo lo que llevó a transformar a un desprejuiciado grupo de corredores de “picadas” callejeras en un grupo dedicado al espionaje global más sofisticado mientras entre sus miembros se afianza y consolida una idea central: todos se sienten parte de una familia que debe ser preservada frente a cualquier tipo de amenaza. Como hay que honrar ese espíritu fraterno casi sagrado, que se afirma más allá de los lazos de sangre, y asegurar que nadie faltará al próximo encuentro, el comienzo de este largo adiós nos trae de vuelta a la familia ampliada de Rápidos y furiosos casi completa. Hay unos cuantos regresos (algunos anunciados desde el póster oficial de la película y otros completamente inesperados), malos que cambian de bando por razones estratégicas y, sobre todo, una razón para que cada integrante de esta gran confraternidad haga con mucho sentido y convicción su propio aporte al relato. Todos tienen su momento para decir y hacer cosas importantes, aunque dure apenas segundos. Nada parece imposible, ni siquiera este esfuerzo por lograr esta convocatoria plena, para una aventura que alguna vez hasta llegó a desafiar la mismísima ley de gravedad. Lo inverosímil desaparece aquí frente a un objetivo superior: ponerle el broche final a una larga historia recurriendo a la memoria de sus mejores momentos. Por eso no es casual que el décimo episodio se explique a partir del regreso a lo ocurrido en Rápidos y furiosos: 5in control (Fast Five, 2011), exactamente a la mitad del camino recorrido hasta hoy, y de la necesidad de sumar fuerzas para hacerle frente a un villano más poderoso que los anteriores. De las diez películas de Rápidos y furiosos, Fast Five es la mejor. A partir de ella, la saga alcanzó una grandeza narrativa y visual que pocos imaginaban. Desde ese momento, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) y su clan empezaron a crecer como nunca entre los mitos del Hollywood contemporáneo. Este décimo episodio los convierte poco menos que en los herederos de los Avengers. Marvel nunca recuperó esa presencia desde ese momento y DC todavía no cuenta con la brújula adecuada para salir a buscarla. De esos mundos de fantasía también provienen algunos de los nombres que suman su aporte a este nuevo capítulo. Especialmente Jason Momoa, el gran malo de turno, que trae de vuelta a través del espejo deformado de la idea de familia encarnada por Toretto y cía. lo ocurrido en Fast Five. La película nos recuerda, en un largo flashback, la muerte del narco Hernán Reyes (Joaquim De Almeida) después del electrizante robo de una bóveda llena de dinero en Río de Janeiro. Con las uñas pintadas, ropa extravagante, deliberada ampulosidad y un aire operístico en sus gestos, Momoa se divierte a lo grande encarnando a Dante, el hijo de Reyes, mientras planea vengarse de quienes mataron a su padre. Mientras Dante y Toretto están a punto de chocar una y otra vez el resto de la compañía hace lo suyo para mantener bien alto el sentido de la aventura y el entretenimiento con mayúsculas. Las escenas de acción crecen en cantidad y calidad respecto de las dos o tres películas previas, el suspenso es siempre genuino (sobre todo cuando involucra al pequeño hijo de Toretto, siempre bajo amenaza), los golpes duelen y los nuevos como Brie Larson (bellísima y cada vez mejor actriz) se integran y adaptan a la perfección. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"May 18, 2023"," ‘Fast & Furious X’ es la décima entrega de la popular franquicia sobre las aventuras de un grupo de corredores callejeros y ladrones en colaboración con el gobierno. Se estrena el viernes y esta vez ha sido dirigida por Louis Leterrier, veterano del cine de acción con títulos como ‘Transporter’ o ‘El Increíble Hulk’, que llegó para salvar la producción cuando Justin Lin dejó el proyecto en abril pasado, en pleno rodaje, un problema que ha dejado su huella en el resultado. La saga FF se ha ido perfilando en el tiempo como un campo de pruebas para lo que puede dar de sí el cine de acción americano. De un producto coyuntural de la época en la que el tuning se hizo tendencia, ha sabido esquivar con mayor o menor acierto su legado de cine equivalente al regetón en la música para pasar por todo tipo de subgéneros hasta encontrar su voz en un concepto tan sencillo como un gran partido de tenis cuyas pelotas son automóviles a toda velocidad, en el que la trama no es tan importante como las escenas de espectáculo. La saga encontró su mejor punto en la octava entrega, cuando acabó de sacudirse la sombra de tratar de ser “buen cine” de atracos, y abrazó un delirio imposible que acercaba su marca a algo similar a uno de esos espectáculos en directo de piruetas, monster cars y fuego en las ruedas. La novena llevaba ese mismo espíritu al espacio y devolvía autonomía a un Vin Diesel desplazado en la anterior entrega. Ahora el actor parece haber tratado de convertir a su héroe en el centro absoluto y supone un bache para el potencial de su propio universo. La película sigue a Dominic Toretto y su tripulación mientras se enfrentan a un nuevo enemigo: Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), el hijo del capo de la droga que mataron en ‘Fast Five’ (2011), quien busca vengarse del grupo por un rencor derivado de su atraco en Río de Janeiro, para ello ha desplazado a Cipher (Charlize Theron), la ciberterrorista que ha sido la némesis de Dom y su familia en las dos últimas entregas. Esto lleva a un nuevo juego de alianzas que permite que la saga siga siendo un espacio de enemigos que se transforman en socios y viceversa. El enorme elenco de esta ‘Fast X’ incluye a caras familiares de las películas anteriores, como Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Helen Mirren y Rita Moreno, y también presenta nuevos personajes interpretados por Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson y John Cena, esto, unido a sus megalomaníacas escenas de acción, han elevado el presupuesto a 340 millones de dólares, lo que la convierte en una de las películas más caras jamás realizadas, superando otras como ‘Vengadores: Infinity War’. La escala de las acrobacias se han vuelto más descaradamente irreales que nunca, pero quizá esto no justifique su precio. La sensación es que se está preparando el escenario para sus dos capítulos finales y el evento parece un aperitivo comparado con lo que se vio en la anterior entrega. Sí, hay dos secuencias alucinantes, una en Roma, con una bomba rodante que parece un pinball a gran escala y otra hacia el final, con un combo de aviones, helicópteros y coches saltando por los aires que son de ver para creer. Pero la acción parece no serlo todo en esta ocasión y se intuye cierta nostalgia de las primeras entregas, de su lado más hortera en el peor sentido de la palabra. Momoa se lo pasa mejor que el público haciendo de villano y su catálogo de chistes con poca gracia es demasiado constante, su timing no está tan bien lubricado como los motores que destrozan y su exceso de posturas mesiánicas hacen una caricatura de villano que acaba empachando tanto como la solemnidad de un Toretto desesperado por resultar icónico, un baño de grandilocuencia y mala digestión del orgullo barriobajero que acaba saturando por redundante. El personaje de John Cena sufre tal transformación con respecto a la anterior entrega que parece recuperar los mejores momentos de ‘El pacificador’ y su presencia MVP logra borrar los olvidables tentativas —o atentados— de comedia en las escenas con Pete Davidson. La fugaz aparición de Statham es uno de los momentos más memorables y la inesperada buddy movie de Rodríguez y Theron es mucho más digna que algunos momentos de sus protagonistas principales. También es un acierto incorporar a Ritchson a la saga, volviendo a demostrar porque su presencia es capaz de convertir ‘Reacher’ en una de las mejores series de acción recientes. Larson puede funcionar como una aliada interesante en la trilogía planeada, pero sencillamente su papel se reduce a lo anecdótico y ‘FF 10’ acaba resultando un potaje lleno de personajes, tramas, villanos que aparecen a la vez en todas partes y una narración desordenada que entorpece el ritmo y hace echar en falta a Justin Lin en sus momentos de delirio. Leterrier es bueno haciendo un montaje frenético en las escenas más vertiginosas, pero no tiene el mismo ojo panorámico de la anterior. En general, ‘Fast & Furious X’ hace un buen trabajo como primer capítulo de algo más grande, y sigue siendo una oda a la locura que mejora a otras entregas mejor valoradas de la franquicia, que puede ser definida como la propia familia en la película, “una secta de los coches”, y es precisamente ese el gran logro de los últimos tres capítulos, que llevan la cultura del motor a extremos de desvergüenza y ridículo, a la caricatura grotesca puesta en bandeja por la propia primera entrega. Por ello es mucho más gratificante cuando juega a ser un disparatado circo ambulante que cuando se quiere convertir en un duelo de tamaño de pollas en el patio de exhibición de un Diesel borracho de sí mismo.",NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Si por algo han tenido éxito las películas de la franquicia Rápidos y furiosos es porque saben lo que son. Todo se trata –exceptuando la primera entrega– de secuencias inverosímiles en las que un grupo de corredores expertos en autos lideran atracos y atrapan a los criminales más buscados del planeta. La acción grandilocuente es lo que caracteriza a cada capítulo de la saga y, por la forma en la que está coreografiada esa acción, el público se sigue sintiendo atraído a este universo fílmico.  Pero la realidad es que, desde hace muchos años, todo se empezaba a sentir repetitivo. La película Rápidos y furiosos 10 es un intento medianamente funcional para poner todo de regreso en el carril correcto. La mayor parte es un reciclaje descarado. No obstante, hacia la mitad, el proyecto se convierte en entretenimiento veraniego que, ahora sí, le da su lugar a la historia de origen. Y es que los autos ya importaban poco. A partir de su quinta entrega, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) y compañía se convirtieron en agentes gubernamentales prácticamente indestructibles que enfrentaban a la muerte sin preocupación alguna. Esa energía despreocupada se percibía también en los guiones, impregnados con indiferencia hacia lo que se estableció en 2001. Quizá la mayor demostración de esa indiferencia llegó con aquella muy comentada escena presentada en la novena cinta. Ahí, de la nada, Tej (Ludacris) y Roman (Tyrese Gibson) viajaron al espacio sin preparación previa adentro de un vehículo de cuatro ruedas y con nada más que tanques de gas y trajes hechos de aluminio. Sin embargo, aquí todo regresa a la tierra –literal y figurativamente–. Aunque la acción sigue siendo muy poco creíble, el tono de autoparodia ya no está tan presente. Sí, todos los personajes siguen teniendo una fuerza sobrehumana, pero, al menos, ahora sí existe verdadero peligro. Todo el conflicto de la película Rápidos y furiosos 10 inicia porque Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) quiere vengarse de Dom y su equipo, quienes presuntamente terminaron con la vida de su padre, el narcotraficante Hernán Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), en aquella famosa escena de persecución en Río de Janeiro, con una gran caja fuerte de por medio. Eso es todo. Estamos ante una narrativa de venganza muy convencional. De hecho, la mejor escena de la película es su apertura. En esta se conectan, de manera muy fluida y con una edición inspirada, escenas filmadas en 2011 con material nuevo. De manera ágil, se inserta a Momoa y de Almeida en Fast Five, en la que Paul Walker aún vivía. El viaje al pasado es conmovedor y muy estimulante. Pero esa edición que prometía bastante se vuelve monótona y torpe durante el resto del filme, que además tiene una excesiva duración de dos horas y media. Para compensarlo, están las tres armas secretas de la producción. Primero, la actuación de Jason Momoa, quien demuestra un rango insospechado al entregar un antagonista en extremo estrafalario pero muy amenazante. Su Dante es volátil e impredecible, pero muy divertido, y no cabe duda de que él la pasó de maravilla en el set. Es algo así como una mezcla entre Simon Phoenix, de la ya mencionada El demoledor y Ruby Rhod, de El quinto elemento (1997). Un delirio total. A ratos, se convierte en una caricatura. Sin embargo, ahora, por primera vez, un villano de Toretto tiene una personalidad interesante. Después, la actuación de Brie Larson como Tess, quien asumió la dirección de La Agencia tras la desaparición –¿muerte?–  de su padre, Mr. Nobody. Cada escena en la que aparece Larson es refrescante por la cualidad misteriosa y burlona que se hace presente en la forma en la que entrega sus diálogos. Por último, está el estilo del director Louis Leterrier, quien se caracteriza por sus puestas en escena elegantes y vistosas que ponen especial énfasis en la composición de los cuadros. Gracias a este estilo permanecemos enganchados a los momentos que involucran automóviles. Ya sea una magnífica carrera callejera llena de adrenalina, y que recuerda a las viejas glorias de la saga, o una impactante carrera vertical muy bien ejecutada que hay que ver para creer.

"May 18, 2023"," Esta Rápidos y furiosos X tiene todo lo que el fan de la saga ansía ver, después de una espera bastante más prolongada de lo que estaba acostumbrado. Hay acción, acrobacias, muchos regresos -está Paul Walker, y también su hija, en un cameo: búsquenla en un avión-, tiene un villano como Jason Momoa de lo más extravagante, y la familia, de sangre o de lo que sea, por delante de todo. Las acciones se remontan a diez años atrás, en Río de Janeiro, cuando Dominic roba con Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker, luego muerto en un accidente automovilístico) una bóveda con dinero de un narcotraficante brasileño (Joaquin de Almeida). Diez años después, Dom acompaña a su pequeño hijo Brian (llamado así en honor a su amigo muerto) derrapando el auto. Y compartiendo la mesa larga, al aire libre, está la abuela de Dom (Rita Moreno), que es como Mufasa de El Rey León cada vez que abre la boca: tira una enseñanza.  La acción regresa cuando el hijo de reyes, aquel narco que murió persiguiendo a Dom, quiere vengarse. Sí, ese personaje es el de Jason Momoa, al que le dieron todos los chistes posibles y juega aquí más al comediante que al villano de acción. Es malísimo,  sigue el refrán de su padre muerto, que es la antítesis de la abuela/Mufasa (que mejor que matar, primero es hacer sufrir), se limpia la sangre de la navaja con la lengua, extorsiona a todos y tiene entre ceja y ceja -y miren que las tiene tupidas- a Toretto y su familia.  Decíamos que hay varios regresos, y se deben hacer varias alianzas que hasta la película novena eran impensable, e imposibles. Pero ya aprendimos bien que en Rápidos y furiosos nada es imposible, y lo que ayer era una cosa, hoy bien puede ser otra. Y mañana, también.  Así que se desata la guerra, los bandos se arman y los combates, por lo general con los protagonistas furiosos a bordo de autos rápidos, se dan en locaciones como Roma, Los Angeles, Nápoles, Londres y en Portugal.  Hay secuencias increíbles, como la de una bomba subacuática enorme, recorriendo las calles de Roma hasta llegar cerca del Vaticano, que el director Louis Leterrier (El transportador, El increíble Hulk, la de Edward Norton) asegura que era una bola de verdad prendida fuego, o sea que no es por efectos de computadora.

"May 18, 2023"," The tenth instalment in the series is the first film in an upcoming trilogy which will ultimately bring the high-octane film franchise to an end. But the cracks are already beginning to show. Fast X opens with a lengthy recap of the events of Fast Five, the picture in which Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) steal a bank vault and drive it through Rio. In this recap, viewers are introduced to Dante Reyes, the scorned son of an organised criminal who has seemingly endless money and resources and wants nothing but revenge on Toretto and his family for killing his father. That's something no one will ever be able to take away from the Fast and Furious series: they know how to make cars and stunts attractive. From every race, flip, explosion, and flying car, Fast X is a masterclass in entertainment. I would defy anyone to watch these incredible moments and not have a great time with just how bombastic and ridiculous they get. If Toretto knocking two helicopters into one another with a car isn't enough, how is driving off a dam at break-neck speeds while outrunning an explosion with an unlimited supply of NOS (magic fast car juice)? It's completely and utterly thrilling - there's no other way to describe it. It's like a roller coaster ride you're witnessing in real-time. A true triumph! It becomes even more woe-inducing, then, when the stunts are replaced with extremely obvious CGI segments that plainly do not look good. Fans will be able to pick out the computer-generated cars from a quarter-mile away. Diesel growls through his lines and remains insufferably stoic through even the most furious moments. Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) is given perhaps the most groan-worthy moments of the picture, and the incessant tit-for-tat banter between Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) feels completely amateur. Jason Momoa's portrayal of the psychotic and endlessly charming Dante is one for the ages. The Aquaman star blends Dracula with Patrick Bateman to create a laugh-out-loud villain that you might actually be scared of. Likewise, Brie Larson's character, Tess, introduces a much-needed injection of excitement and creativity into the script; similar to how Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) was treated before she became a blank slate like every other character in the series. Unfortunately, Larson is criminally underused throughout the picture. Fast X is the biggest and baddest Fast and Furious movie yet. Its stunts and action moments are industry-leading - exciting, stake-filled, and totally enthralling. But it's brought down by a godawful script and nonsensical plot. Characters come and go without meaning or intention and viewers are simply expected to roll with it until the next car chase begins. It's kind of insulting. With that said, Fast and Furious lovers are going to lap this up if they enjoyed the last couple of entries. After this trilogy comes to a close, I hope the Fast and Furious makes a much-needed pit stop before anything else is attempted.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2023"," The “Fast and Furious” series has always threaded a very fine needle when it comes to the varying degrees of ridiculousness on display. The good is reflected in sending a car to outer space, driving through one building and into another, or catching and redirecting a torpedo barehanded. The bad pops up in the form of self-aware commentary, convoluted plot wrangling and inconsistent characterization. These are not meant to be serious movies, yet they still find ways to undercut the bonkers reality that they establish. “Fast X” is no different, but while there are highlights to be found in this tenth installment, it’s ultimately an exercise in bloated whiplash caused by such inconsistency in quality and tone that it’s hard to approach as one comprehensive movie. The central problem of “Fast X” is consistency, enabled in part by the fact that so much of the film feels episodic in nature. There are essentially four storylines that are cross-cut between each other, following different groups of characters in different locations. This leads to poor pacing between action sequences, vastly different approaches in storytelling, and a lopsided quality where three or four good scenes happen in a row followed by a terrible one. During the events of “Fast Five,” Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) watched as his father was taken down by Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew. Ten years later, Dante has concocted an elaborate revenge scheme that will decimate his adversaries. Through some violent machinations, Dom’s friends (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang) are all placed on the terrorist watchlist and pursued by the Agency, which is under new management (Alan Ritchson). Meanwhile, the Agency captures Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and places her in a black-site prison alongside nemesis Cypher (Charlize Theron), and Jakob (John Cena) must play protector to Dom’s son (Leo Abelo Perry) from the same organization. Through all this, Dom tries to take down Dante, who always seems one step ahead. The disjointed nature of the concurrent storylines leads to scenes that add virtually nothing to the movie. Sure, not every sequence in a film needs to further the plot, but it should serve some purpose, like establishing the world, developing characters and relationships — anything that contributes to the overall experience. “Fast X” has multiple scenes that could easily be cut and not change a thing. Clocking in at 141 minutes and crosscutting between so many stories with so many characters across so many locations, these digressions add to the film’s bloat and weigh down the more excessive sequences. While the choppy approach to “Fast X” is a detriment, it doesn’t totally get in the way of the usual insanity that fans have come to expect (and love) from the series. There is nothing as mind-meltingly audacious as driving a car into space like in “F9,” but there are still some genuinely entertaining set pieces that harken back to the physics-defying elements from past entries. Outrunning fire, saving the Vatican and car-mounted cannons are just some of the highlights, while the terrific dialogue continues in the form of lines that sound epic but are ultimately hollow and plaintively silly. Momoa will either be delightful or insufferable to viewers, as his grandiose villain is tremendously over the top. It worked for me because there are some genuinely funny moments that he delivers, and his character stands in stark contrast to the stoic badasses that fill out the rest of the cast. While Diesel can’t smile without it looking like it’s his first time attempting it, Momoa is a joyful eccentric who is clearly channeling the many iterations of the Joker in his chaotic flamboyance. Having him be a source of entertainment every time he’s on-screen makes his “episodes” among the most fun in “Fast X.” New-to-the-franchise director Louis Leterrier has delivered one of the lesser entries in the series, with one half following the entertaining tradition of the other movies and the other half existing as a bungled, pale imitation of what’s come before. With its dubious physics, over-the-top characters and convoluted logic, “Fast X” finds itself straddling a fine line between the good and bad types of ridiculousness, though the film flops onto the lesser side more often than not. Considering that the movie ends with three different cliffhangers (and there will be at least one more entry in the franchise), that unsatisfying feeling permeates well into the end credits. It feels like Leterrier, Diesel and company wanted to make a muscle car version of “The Lord of the Rings,” but they should have focused on making one united film instead, running on the usual nitrous-fueled audacity rather than this ambitiously awkward hybrid of a movie.

"May 18, 2023"," 
The arrival of a new Fast & Furious movie hardly requires any preamble. After 22 years, nine main installments, one spinoff, and a total metamorphosis of the franchiseâs ethos from an initial film about a tight-knit crew of carjacking street racers stealing DVD players to later entries where international government agencies are recruiting the same characters to pull off high-stakes, world-saving espionage missions, the Fast franchise has become a ubiquitous piece of American pop culture. Itâs easy to write them off as braindead megablockbusters that cost unfathomable amounts of money (this one is one of the most expensive films ever made), but that would be ignoring their authentic sense of gleefully explosive absurdity and high-energy spectacle. Call it Meathead Mission: Impossible, call it whatever you want, but one thing remains more true than ever about these films: You either get it or you donât.
 
That said, Fast X â a great title addition to a series with a comically inconsistent sense of naming conventions â comes with its own contextual obligations. This is part one of two (or three, if a recent statement by Vin Diesel is to be believed) of a series finale, the culmination of all things both fast and also furious. To that end, itâs hard to ignore how much this indeed feels like a âPart One,â in that so much of it seems like setup for a real pedal-to-the-metal final installment. It has an inconclusive ending and feels like itâs holding back on its set-pieces, which, in a franchise thatâs already finding it hard to top itself (they already literally went to space), equates to something a little deflating.
 
However, if youâre anything like me and intrinsically enjoy the brazen spectacle, earnest silliness, and shameless incongruity of such a series, itâs likely youâll walk out of Fast X with the same sense of satisfying fulfillment that I did. No, itâs not Fast Five â itâs not even Fast & Furious 6 or Furious 7 â but taken on its own terms in the post-Paul Walker era of the franchise, itâs a gratifying piece of video game physics and cartoonish melodrama. It puts seemingly invincible superheroes behind the wheels of muscle cars to do things like stopping a giant bomb rolling through the streets of Rome from blowing up the Vatican. That's all in a dayâs work before making it back home for the family barbecue and popping open a Corona. It rocks.
 
Though the magic of the franchise once stemmed from the collaboration between series-regular director Justin Lin and Vin Diesel, after the former stepped away from this project over creative differences, leaving directing duties to Louis Leterrier, it feels like the true mastermind of the franchiseâs direction now is Diesel himself. Lin retains a screenplay credit with Dan Mazeau, but every bit of the ever-expanding roster of the Fast Family lineup and relitigation of previously established events feels like itâs being transmitted directly from Dieselâs fanatically passionate brain, finding new ways to pull from every corner of lore and character work established thus far. Whether thatâs a feature or a bug is up to viewer discretion.
 
The ensemble cast here is too immense to try and list but you can trust that the main players fill in their requisite parts, as do some returning cast members that have sat out an entry or two. The most notable new addition is Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes, son of Hernan Reyes from Fast Five (we actually get to see the big safe set-piece from that film played out again from his perspective, because of course). His flamboyantly masochistic persona, in theory, fits in with the erratic lunacy of these movies but follows a trend that F9: The Fast Saga started of these films finally becoming too self-aware of their own madness. Still, itâs refreshing to see an actor having such fun with a role, and heâs a decent foil for Dieselâs grumbling gravitas.
 
This film leaves you hanging on what the ultimate showdown between the two will look like, and itâs hard to know how a series built on consistently going bigger and bigger will finally close things out. But for the 10th entry in such an unlikely franchise, itâs hard not to get wrapped up in all of the typical mannerisms that grant this series its identity. Even when the Fast films are stuck spinning their wheels, they still have their foot firmly on the gas.

"May 18, 2023"," The patriarchal, ex-con, street-racing mechanic Dom (a star-making turn by Vin Diesel) said this to undercover cop Brian O’Conner (the late Paul Walker). At a raucous party at the Toretto home, he hands a bottle to Brian, who’s become his new best friend; that beer (yep, a Corona) was being consumed by a disagreeable member of Dom’s LA gang of precision drivers. I’ll wager that next to “I am Groot” in all its wonderful permutations, Diesel has never delivered a better line in his career. And the performance has a lived-in authenticity, a quality that has never been repeated in the nine sequels that followed. “The Fast and the Furious” was all of those things. It’s a relic of its time, but the movie remains raw and infinitely watchable. Compared to “Fast X,” “The Fast and the Furious,” with its street racing, youthful macho posturing, and NOS-powered, colorfully painted compact speedsters, exists in a world approximating our own. The razor-voiced Dom is a character ideally suited for Diesel, the magnetic, bald-headed, intimidating, muscle shirt-wearing actor (who got his start as a writer/director). But at some point, Diesel, who initially abandoned the franchise, lost the edge that made Dom a charismatic lead. In “Fast X,” only Dom’s cheesy, insincere smirk remains. It doesn’t matter how much he waxes philosophical about the value of family; the “Fast” series theme is money. The machine that mints bills for everyone involved will keep chugging along with not just one additional concluding chapter but reportedly two more! And if the box office is strong, don’t count out many others. There’s nothing wrong with milking and squeezing every dime out of this property. There’s not a sacred classic in any of the sequels to be tarnished. But armed with almost unlimited resources and a loyal fan base, why not attempt to make a good movie? Instead, we get a contrived combination of inane banter that weakly frames a tired set of weightless computer-generated action sequences. In “Fast X,” I never got the impression that the players drove any of the cars that performed impossible gravity-defying stunts. At no time will viewers suspend their disbelief. Now rolling into its third decade, the progression from B-movie actioner to blockbuster cartoon is tragically complete. Diesel’s Dominic Toretto, once a wily Road Runner, now occupies the stunted role of an aging Elmer Fudd. You can almost hear him politely request quiet because he’s hunting rabbits. But thankfully, that rabbit is played by Jason Momoa. Drawing on the events of 2011’s “Fast Five,” Dom’s extended family faces a new threat: the vengeful Dante (a refreshingly fun Momoa), the lunatic son of the Brazilian drug cartel leader killed by the gang in Rio. Fans will remember that in “Five,” Dom’s crew stages a delirious heist by ripping the cartel’s safe full of cash from a police station and roughly dragging it through the streets. That safe scene, in which two muscle cars pull the safe along the city’s streets, is, admittedly, a highly of the franchise. Going back to the well, however, yields diminishing returns. In a flashback that contains newly shot footage integrated into the original material, we learn that Dante was present during the shootout on the bridge that ended “Five.” And for the 13 years thereafter, the guy’s been hatching his revenge. We pick up with Dom and the fam back in Los Angeles. The home, once blown up by a bomb, has been entirely rebuilt, and the Toretto matriarch Abuela (Oscar winner Rita Moreno) presides over a humble backyard barbecue. Missing from the gathering is Brian. Viewers know that Paul Walker tragically died in 2013 at age 40 in a car accident. Despite using his brothers to double for Walker to complete a previous “Fast” film, this franchise has yet to deal with his recurring absence coherently. It’s a nagging problem that no line of dialogue can effectively address. But fans will appreciate the archive footage of Walker playing Brian as he and Dom pull the enormous safe through Rio. Moving from the backyard to the streets of Rome, the crew, minus Dom, attempts a new goofy heist. The group is led by Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the comic relief of the bunch. His plan is typically foolish, involving flashy cars and techno gizmos controlled by computer experts Tej (Ludacris) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). Of course, Roman’s first outing as the leader doesn’t go well. Dante shows up, and all hell breaks loose. Paying homage to the safe sequence in “Five,” a bomb, the size of a minivan, rolls destructively through the ancient, cobblestone streets toward the Vatican. When it explodes, Dom and his family are blamed, making Dom enemy number one globally. The high-profile man-hunt doesn’t stop Toretto from freely traveling worldwide. We see him drowning his sorrows in a bar somewhere in Italy. Is he drinking a Corona? No matter, a new character named Tess (Marvel’s Brie Larson) finds him and delivers a couple of glasses of Stella Artois (product placement?) to his dimly lit table. I suppose an appropriate Italian brew, like maybe Rome’s own, Peroni, didn’t pay enough to get featured. Tess is the daughter of secret agent commander Mr. Nobody (played in previous installments by Kurt Russell). She’s a tough customer who would instead make an entrance by blowing a home in the establishment’s ceiling with a shotgun than politely ask for information. Dom agrees to work with Tess so long as she can break his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), out of black-site maximum security prison. But standing in Tess’ way is agent Aimes (“Reacher’s” Alan Ritchson), the new leader of the agency that Tess’ father used to run. Unlike the trusting Mr. Nobody, Aimes has no love for Dom and his crew. He is determined to bring them all to justice or put them in the ground trying. As the globe-traveling Dom works with Tess to clear his name and stop Dante, Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) takes custody of Dom’s son Little Brian (“Black-ish” star Leo Abelo Perry). They travel to a safe site to wait out for Dom’s return. Of course, there’s no such thing as a safe house. Fans of this film universe will care less about the silly narrative, the cartoonish characterizations, and the outlandish action sequences that rely on loads of weightless computer-generated effects. They may be content with hanging out in this crazed world for a couple of hours. The cars, the toys, the jokes, and the action is all that matters. But I wonder what would happen if the movie constructed within that place was a good one? The fans who will shell out their hard-earned cash deserve better. Despite a record budget, aspects of this production feel cheap. It’s disappointing that the hand-to-hand combat scenes are poorly shot and executed. The fights (and there are plenty of them) have little credible motivation to begin with. Still, even the balletic Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw doesn’t seem to be hitting anyone as he combats hoards of heavily armored henchmen. “Fast X” suffers from low energy every time someone decides to hit someone. I’d trade the entire rolling bomb sequence for one solid fistfight involving Statham. The camera work is obsolete by 2023 standards with the impossible bar now set by the glorious “John Wick: Chapter 4.” “Fast X” relies on tight framing and handheld jerky shots to mask obvious playful sparring. It’s positively lazy compared to what we saw in “Wick.” But not everything is maddeningly simplistic and forgettable in “Fast X.” Jason Momoa is terrific. Maybe it’s because there’s so much wrong with the film as a whole that Momoa’s work stands out, but he infuses Dante with a sexually fluid vibe that’s infectious. Dante is fearsome with flamboyant costuming, strange exaggerated mannerisms, some sharply written witticisms, and a dark, even nasty bloodlust. Unfortunately, the tone of this wicked performance is at odds with the weak comedy drama pushed out by the one-note Dom and his clueless family. After the city of Rome is nearly blown up with millions of dollars in damage and countless lives harmed or worse, Dom’s gang would rather make jokes and bicker than articulate anything resembling human emotion. If these people on screen aren’t bothered emotionally by all the carnage, why should the audience care? If Dante were allowed to go full-tilt, viewers might ignore the banality that has come to define the last few entries in the franchise. At least, Dante’s reactions to the events are guided by insanity and single-minded ambition. This guy’s sadistic tendencies make a strong case for an “R” rating. Part of this is the dynamic Momoa’s carefree, unhinged performance, and part of the character's success is the clever writing, credited to three writers, that belies everything else in the screenplay. There’s a scene involving a perverse pedicure that is more visceral and impactful than every exploding jet or a duo of helicopters thwarted by a muscle car. This sequence demonstrates the power of human interaction on screen that no amount of computerized trickery can match. If only we had more Dante in this movie. But alas, we get lots of the sullen Dom, the grunting, the off-putting half smiles, and repetitive, innocuous flat line readings. Diesel is capable of more range; here, he seems to be collecting a paycheck. The joyful glee associated with Dante only exposes this flagging franchise's bankrupt nature. A character should be first and action second. There’s a reason why there are four movies with the name John Wick in the title. Those movies collectively form an action masterclass. But we only engage with the frenetic sequences because we have bonded with the hero at the center of the action. When discussing “Fast X” with my fellow critics, I wondered whether criticizing any movie in this franchise was something akin to punching down. That’s a weird expression to levy when referring to one of Hollywood’s biggest cash cows, but since there’s so little effort to make a good movie here, is there any point in exposing its apparent flaws? Let’s hope that the money made by “Fast X” helps to fund better films that feature rich characterizations with relatable goals and are populated by fast cars and even faster people.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023",While some of the story drags when there&#8217;s excess exposition&#44; the magnetism of Jason Momoa takes a familiar story arc and catapults it into a dazzling spectacle of ridiculous excess&#46;,POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," Dismissed — not without reason or justification — at the time as an unofficial remake of Point Break (or a rip-off if we’re in a less charitable mood), a mid-budget actioner pitting part-time electronics thieves and illegal street racers against an undercover FBI sting operation, aka The Fast and the Furious, would go onto to spawn nine sequels (and counting), one big-screen spin-off (and counting), and a combined six billion-dollar (US) gross (with more to come) from all corners of the globe. Collectively, the decades-spanning series would also make franchise stars of Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker, along with turning frequent director Justin Lin (Star Trek Beyond, Better Luck Tomorrow) from a relative unknown into an A-lister and a brand name among franchise devotees.


It hasn’t all been smooth drifting, though. Over the 22 years since the first entry premiered on American multiplexes, the series has seen the untimely death of Paul Walker (partially written out, but never forgotten), occasional director turmoil, ballooning budgets, and a pandemic that slowed or halted production on the most recent entry, F9: The Fast Saga. The series has also seen more character heel-turns, deaths, and resurrections this side of Marvel or DC Comics. And yet despite the in-universe’s comic-book approach to story logic and the usual laws of physics or gravity (suspended as needed), audiences continue to return entry after entry.


The stories themselves — along with Diesel’s furrowed-brow, gravelly voiced mantra (“family”) — matter less than the elaborately choreographed set pieces involving fast cars, indestructible characters (or rather their stunt stand-ins), and NOS-boosted pacing to keep audiences perpetually in stimulation mode right up until an end credits scene that reveals either the return of a beloved character, the back-from-the-dead return of another, or simply both. It’s a formula that’s worked time and time again, though the 10th time around the racing track, Fast X, has started to show more than a few signs of engine and tire wear.


Opening with a nostalgic nod to Fast Five, arguably the high-point of the series and the first entry to leave street racing behind entirely for heist-oriented plotting, Fast X reunites Diesel’s Dominic “Dom” Toretto with Walker’s Brian O’Conner for a Rio de Janeiro robbery involving a mega-sized bank vault, a chaotic, destructive chase in and around the streets of said Brazilian city, and the untimely death of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a vicious gang boss. In another comic-book inspired plot turn, Fast X retcons that heist to include Reyes' heretofore unknown son, Dante (Jason Momoa), both a participant in the bank vault chase and a witness to his father’s demise.


Ten years later and Dante, even more vicious and sociopathic than his psychopathic father, puts an incredibly complex revenge plot into motion. Said revenge plot involves a super-secret mission in Rome supposedly for the “Agency” (the CIA by any other name) to retrieve the latest iteration of the Great Whatsit, four members of Dom’s family-team, the miserly, money-obsessed Roman (Tyrese Gibson), his perpetual foil and straight man, Tej (Ludacris), an uber-hacker with the requisite genius IO, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and the recently resurrected Han (Sung Kang).


When the mission goes predictably sideways, Dom and longtime partner Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) spring into action, Dom in a super-charged muscle car (an extension of his ego), and Letty on a sleek, easily maneuverable motorcycle. Not everyone, of course, gets saved, but the mission and the attempt to save Dom’s team leads directly into the first extended car-related set piece. Mirroring the bank vault of the prologue, the “new” scene swaps out the cube-shaped vault for a mini-Death Star-inspired bomb.


While that scene rides right up to the line between tedium and excitement, the rest of Dom and Letty’s crew stateside, Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom’s sister; Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), Dom’s son by another mother (not Letty); and Jakob (John Cena), Dom’s formerly estranged brother, are forced to fight and flee as the new head of the Agency, Aimes (Alan Ritchson), far less tolerant of Team Family’s penchant for urban destruction, sends dozens, if not hundreds, of interchangeable helmeted goons to take them in.


Yet another semi-exhausting subplot involves returning cyber-villain Cypher (Charlize Theron), betrayed and imprisoned, attempting to convince an unlikely ally to join her on an escape mission while Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of the missing Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), and, like her father, somewhat of a loose cannon, refuses to follow Aimes’ search-and-capture order, a fireable offense in any bureaucracy, government or otherwise, and does her part for Team Family. She makes for a positive addition to the team and the film, though at this point, it feels like the Fast X series needs to dramatically scale back the character count and re-focus on the core group.


Of course, Fast X is just part one of an announced two-part finale to the Fast and the Furious franchise (Diesel recently stated it was the first of a trilogy), so audiences won’t be surprised that it ends on a metaphorical, possibly literal cliffhanger as Dom and his crew find themselves in varying levels of peril and/or danger, several missing or even presumed dead (dead is never dead in the Fast and Furious universe, regardless of whether you've seen a corpse onscreen or not), and Dante enjoying all of the havoc he’s unleashed on Dom's world over the preceding two hours and twenty minutes.


While character surprises or face-heel turns hit rock bottom the 10th time around, the addition of Dante as Team Family’s Blofeld-like antagonist makes up for the over-familiarity (Roman and Tej’s tired shtick, for example, could and should be tabled going forward), his fey, flamboyant mannerisms, constant monologuing, and sheer, chaotic joy at the chaos more than compensate for Fast X’s typically forgettable story, flaccid character interactions, and over-indulgent running time. As usual too, the best-money-can-buy set pieces rarely disappoint and more often have the opposite result, delivering just the right amount of awe, wonder, and humor at the utter and complete absurdity of it all. ",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," The
most successful installments of the Fast
and/or Furious movies are the ones
that acknowledge and play up just how ludicrous this franchise has become.
Somehow andappropriately for a series that so routinely treats the basic laws
of physics as ignorable suggestionsbeyond any sense of logic, we're ten
entries in to these movies (not counting a spin-off), so theoretically, Fast X has a lot of very silly things to reference and attempt to
surpass. Thankfully, this new installment mostly accomplishes those goals in
practice, too. It's
quite a bit of over-the-top fun, but that's as much for the willingness of Dan
Mazeau and Justin Lin's screenplay to wink and nudge at just how ridiculous all
of this has become as it is for the variety of setpieces. Here's a movie in
which the action sequences start with a multi-layered chase through the streets
of Rome, featuring assorted vehiclesincluding a truck with a giant bomb
aboardand plenty of destruction, yet that is somehow not the most elaborate
and absurd thing director Louis Leterrier has in store. The
plot isn't quite a reset, since it features a villain who is re-written into the
events of the fifth movie, necessitates that we have a basic understanding of
these relationships and how the characters have somehow transformed from street
racers to international spies, and hopes that there's at least some investment
in the characters from those previous installments. Then again, though, there's
something almost self-contained about this new film, because the actors have
become so sturdy in these roles and the script is clever in its use of narrative
shorthand to remind us of the many details we might have forgotten. It's enough,
perhaps, to fill in any newcomers on the history of most of the gonzo things
that have happened here. For
everyone else, we're reunited with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), now the father
of a young boy (played by Leo Abelo Perry) and married to long-time love Letty
(Michelle Rodriguez). His friends and fellow super-spies Roman (Tyrese Gibson),
Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Ramsey (Nathalie
Emmanuel) are set for a top-secret mission from the Agency in Rome. That turns
out to be a trap. The
setter is Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the sociopathic, revenge-fueled son of the
villain from the fifth movie who wants Dom to suffer as much loss as possible
before finally killing him. That's it, really, but oh, does that simple setup
blossom into a fairly impressive juggling act of characters old and new
(probably too many to mention here), as well as action that's as straightforward
as a no-holds-barred fistfight in an operating room with a laser-armed robot and
as convoluted as a chase on an elevated highway that incorporates
harpoon-wielding helicopters. In
other words, nothing here is very simple or straightforward. It's obvious that
the filmmakers are continually looking forand usually findingways for each
action sequence to top whatever has come before it. The
film almost seems as if it might peak with its initial setpiece, which has the
quartet in Rome discovering that Dante has planted a bomb on the truck they're
trying to hijack, has Dom and Letty split up to stop the bomb and capture the
villain, and sends the bomb rolling down the hilly roads of Rome. It's not
enough, by the way, that the bomb is heading for the Vatican. At one point, the
giant metal orb catches fire, and if that giddy spectacle isn't enough,
Leterrier also gives us smaller moments of real stunts, such as when someone
does a hopscotch jump on a motorcycle over an obstacle in the way. There
are more action scenes, of course (probably, again, too many to even suggest
here), and they play like the stuff of some kind of live-action cartoon (with a
lot of aid from visual effects, naturally). The filmmakers know it, or else, why
would they introduce new Agency head Aimes (Alan Ritchson) by giving him a
lengthy monologue about how unlikely the team's history is, how ridiculous it is
that the Agency has let them cause this much chaos for this long, and the ease
with which they defy the laws of physics in their shenanigans. Aimes is a solid
addition here, as is Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of former and absent
Agency leader Mr. Nobody, whose entire character can be summarized by the fact
that her shoes always have spikes on them. Our
main team is divided for the rest of the narrative, giving each one or group
something to domainly to get into or find trouble as they evade Dante or
attempt to save each other. Momoa, by the way, is an unhinged hoot as a villain
who actually seems like the exact type who should be in a film as excessive as
this one. Other cast members include Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, Charlize
Theron, and John Cena as Dom's brother, who tries to hide his nephew in plain
sight on a fake canoe trip while lugging around a canoe that turns out to be
anything but. Fast
X gets right to the point of giving us
outlandish action and keeps making that point in equally or increasingly
outrageous ways (The film's multiple cliffhangers even promise future setpieces
to kick off the next installment). It has been too easy to dismiss these movies
as illogical, irrational, and inherently nonsensical, but there's a distinct
feeling that this one takes such criticisms, not only as a challenge, but also a
self-aware joke. It makes all the difference.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023"," It’s about family. And cars. Family and cars. And some miscreants attempting to tear the family apart by beating them at their own game. So, more cars. But mostly family: family, cars, and a bad guy—who loves cars but hates families. But nostalgia is creeping in, threatening to take over where family was once cornerstone. And for a franchise dedicated to speed, Fast X is stuck in the past with a few glimpses down the road ahead. It stalls at a sideroad between then and tomorrow. The present happens, but it comes as an inconvenient interruption of memories. The film’s cold opening is a repeat of a scene from a previous F&F film—don’t know which one (guessing Fast and Furious 7, still the best in the franchise) but it has the late Paul Walker. Despite the cleverness of the scene as a spectacular feat of stunt driving and collision, the repurposed footage has the thrill of a budget cut. Not that Fast X doesn’t gear up to deliver impressive, freshly minted demolition derby bedlam turning neighbourhoods, parked cars, café umbrellas, and much of Rome into collateral damage (not to mention an undetermined body count). But Fast X doesn’t just rob from its own vault. There are scenes that ring familiar with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and even Burt Reynold’s Cannonball Run, if Reynold’s Cannonball Run had an actual cannonball. I’m not quite sure what universe the Fast and Furious characters exist in. I used to know back when the first film gave off the sheen of an 80s cop film. I don’t recognize the world they currently exist in where ultra-secret headquarters house cells with mammoth stoned clawed gates, and multi-armed laser guns, and oversized satellite shaped bombs. But then again, I’m not really a car person. We’ve had time to get use to the characters’ transition from the street-level road warriors of Fast & Furious (2009) to the Marvel-like high-tech superheroes they become in Fast X. But the willingness to suspend disbelief is beginning to reach an apex. The excess is more watchable than inventive, with maneuvers so elaborate that it’s difficult to connect any authentic concern for the safety of the characters—it’s the stunt drivers you’re worried about. Director Louis Leterrier has the credentials to jump in the driver’s seat, but he lacks the smooth hand of a James Wan to turn a cliché into innovation. His Transporter (1 & 2) proved he has an ability to pull off a chase scene, and his Now You See Me (2013) illustrates reasonable skill in maneuvering through the complexities of a heist film.  But Leterrier has a rather stilted sense of humour (The Brothers Grimsby, 2016) and when it comes to moments of tenderness (and there are far too many moments of tenderness), Leterrier has a heavy foot that floods the screen with unnecessary maudlin (and overstated) sentiment—usually about the importance of family. And there is something about Vin Diesel phoning in sincere that can crack an audience up. Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto, the saviour of the backlot drag race community. He has lost enough loved ones in past episodes (their spirits hanging in framed photos) to warrant fear for the safety of his young son (primed to be the next generation of fast and furious drivers).  The villain this time is Dante, played with colourful excess by Jason Momoa. Momoa’s flamboyant, sometimes gender-fluid performance is the best Fast X has to offer. His cutting asides, amusing mannerisms, and incredulous cruelty carry much of the movie, until it wears thin and edges towards camp and mockery.  There are several stories crammed beneath the umbrella of one. There is Tej (Ludacris) playing off Roman (Tyrese Gibson) with comic intentions that never get off the ground. There’s the adventurous road trip taken by Dom’s brother, Jakob (John Cena) and Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) Dom’s son.  There is the conflicted partnership of sworn enemies, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).  These break-off scenarios get lost in a mash-up of tributes and homages, many with an assumed understanding of their backstory. ",NEGATIVE

"May 18, 2023"," As the engine of the Fast & Furious roars once again with Fast X, the question looms larger than ever:  just how many more movies are we in for? The question, of course, is rhetorical. I know there will be least one more movie. The franchise ran out of gas several movies ago and has been running on fumes ever since. I don’t want to sound like a broken record and say that Fast X sucks. Not saying it doesn't (it does). But chances are if you are willingly watching the movie (unlike me, a critic, who has to watch it only to tell you how bad it is) you like the franchise. And since Fast X is much better than the simply unwatchable mess that was F9, It is perhaps a given that you will enjoy this movie.  If that is the case, you might as well stop reading this and rush to your nearest theatre. If you are like me, however, and cannot come to terms with the fact that these movies have millions of fans who love them wholly unironically, well, read on. The series, which began as a humble street racing film back in 2001, has evolved into a global blockbuster phenomenon. Its combination of action, charismatic actors, and over-the-top visuals has clearly struck a chord with many around the world. With each new instalment, F&F has become increasingly divorced from reality, stretching the boundaries of plausibility to the point of absurdity.  It became so ridiculous after a point that those in charge embraced the criticism that these films have no regard for the laws of physics. Now, they just do not care and continue to churn out more and more mind-bogglingly impossible action scenes. And since there is a large audience for those, the dollars keep coming.  Once again, a ghost from the past comes to haunt Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who looked as tired as me). This time it is not an estranged brother, but a man called Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa, perhaps the only good thing about this film) who blames Dom, not without reason, for killing his father. That is the story. That is Fast X. Rest is filler. Oh, and we hear Dom say things about protecting the FAMILY and other members of the said FAMILY also get to do cool stuff, and there are a couple of cameos. But by and large, that is the story. Like every villain standing opposite Dom, Dante is super-strong and super-smart. He soon gets his army of soldiers and tech wizards from Cipher after he threatens to kill the family members of those men. But if he were working alone, who did he get to do those kidnappings? But who am I kidding? This is not that kind of film, where you stop to think about stuff. It will only erode any enjoyment you might have had. Anyway, Dante not only desires Dom's demise but also wishes to subject him and his FAMILY to immense suffering before delivering the fatal blow. This motivation is only there to explain why he does not kill his main foe, the man with whom he has nursed hatred for who knows how many years, when he gets so many chances.  If you are a fan of the series and enjoy the extravagant action, charismatic characters, and disregard for realism that the franchise is known for, then you may find entertainment value in Fast X. Despite its flaws, it offers the same familiar elements that have attracted a dedicated fan base. I don't wish to sound condescending, but I like something more in my cinema. Like: an underlying depth, thought-provoking themes, and nuanced storytelling. Sure, there is space for mindless action and fun in every movie, but that should be a part of the movie —not the movie itself. The movie's story is lacklustre, and at one point it appeared that it was satirising its own genre and engaging in some self-referential humour. But no, it remained unapologetically serious until the very end. The characters stop to punch, shoot and slam only to deliver trite phrases like ""You will never be able to break my family"" and ""Time to end this"" with unwavering sincerity.  The acting is terrible too, though many of these actors, I believe, are capable of better. Except for Diesel, of course. He is just bad. He sticks like a sore thumb compared to better performers that inhabit the cast. ""I’m coming for you, son!"", he tells his boy in the same tone he uses for his enemies when he is coming to get them. For most of the movie, he sports an expression that is somewhere between a full-fledged frown and a stoic indifference (it is hard to tell!) — from which I gathered he was either concerned about his FAMILY or was not bothered that his latest enemy is quite clever.  Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson are fine in their banter and instill a bit of much-needed wit. Momoa, though, is the only one who I loved watching. Playing against the type, he injects the film with a much-needed dose of energy. Charming and charismatic, Dante has hobbies that range from harmless feminine ones like elaborate hairdos and flashy tunics to painting the toenails of his victims (who are posed in deckchairs with mojitos in hand). The only fun I had from Fast X was a perverse kind of fun. I imagined that it looks like the actors and director had to live through gruelling production in multiple countries. It is better than F9, but that is like saying you prefer a stubbed toe to a broken leg. In both cases, you are longing for relief.",NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023"," One of the major contention points of the current writers’ strike is the use of artificial intelligence to write scripts. The writers, rightfully, would rather not see studios use AI to craft films or television shows, and they see it as a threat to their jobs and to the entertainment industry as a whole. AI can’t match human imagination – it can only emulate, or borrow, or outright plagiarize. That said, if AI had actually come up with the script for Fast X, it probably wouldn’t be far off. There are only fleeting moments of what could pass as human interaction or emotion, and every story beat is orchestrated for fan service instead of anything resembling original thought. The apex of this series remains the fifth, sixth, and seventh films, where the spectacle evenly mixed with stupidity and this odd franchise became something more than the sum of its parts, at least for a little while. It’s easy to pinpoint when that equilibrium got out of balance, and it can be explained as simply as this – for a series that often bent over backwards to give audiences what they wanted, it became something of a running joke. At least in Fast Five the series winked and nudged and laughed right along with the audience, but eventually all that winking and nudging becomes facial tics and jamming its elbows into our ribcage to make sure we’re still paying attention. I will say this for Fast X – it does embrace how dumb all of this is again. Fast 9 was strangely dour and almost pessimistic, and it completely wasted John Cena, an actor who has been in some outrageously funny comedies and although he’s built like a Mack truck, can be as graceful and as funny as some of the best comedians. All Cena’s Jacob does in F9 is scowl, and at least he’s given a chance to crack a smile this time around, which is a marked improvement. Fast X lets “The Fast Saga” be silly again, but it does so without moderation. Even when the series was joyously stupid at times, it still tried to stay somewhat grounded. Yes, the stunt work was more mainframe than Michelin, but there was always plausible deniability. Not anymore. Fast X is more video game than movie, where no one ever really dies, characters defy the laws of gravity and physics and brush themselves off afterwards, and the action sequences are pure zeros and ones. Nothing has any real weight to it, and the dialogue only serves to crack wise without any real meaning. Maybe there will be audiences who will enjoy it, much as toddlers are fascinated with your car keys. Speaking for myself, I used to appreciate the earnestness of the series, where it felt strangely ambitious for what was once a street-racing franchise. Now, it’s hard to remember when the series was that charming or genuine. It’s not a complete disaster. I get the feeling that when the producers hired Jason Momoa to be the villain, they wanted to capture the chaos and the threat of, perhaps, the work of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Momoa certainly is riffing on the Joker, but it’s not Ledger’s. If anything, it’s Cesar Romero’s. Momoa’s Dante is outrageous, hilarious, and I’d say he steals the movie except that no one else in the movie even comes close to taking the ball from him. It’s like watching Michael Jordan play basketball with a roomful of cats. They aren’t making any baskets with him around. Dante is the son of Reyes (Joachim de Alameida), who died during the events of Fast Five. He’s not just seeking revenge against Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and the others, he wants to make them suffer. And if Dante can get Dom’s son in the bargain, all the better. There are a few action sequences that remind us of better Fast & Furious movies, especially a bomb rolling loose on the streets of the Vatican, reminiscent of the safe chase in Fast Five (instead of a cube, it’s a ball – how original). Soon everyone is on their own separate tracks – Letty is stuck in a black site prison with Cipher (Charlize Theron), while the bulk of the team tries to get Shaw (Jason Statham) to help, while Jacob and Dom’s son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) make a run for it. Vin Diesel spends so much time away from his “family” and team that you start to wonder if there was something in his contract that specified that he couldn’t share the screen with any of the other cast members for more than five minutes at a time. I understand that Paul Walker’s tragic death makes using or referencing Brian O’Conner, but it’s to the point now that it’s straining credulity (yes, even for this franchise) that O’Conner hasn’t stepped in at some point. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Walker’s work in the franchise, but I realize now what he brought to the table – even as these movies got more ridiculous, Walker brought, dare I say, some credibility to everything. Vin Diesel stopped being a human being in this series quite a few films back, but Brian O’Conner was always relatable. With him gone, this simply becomes a series of fights and battles where nothing gets resolved because no one is allowed to lose, or die, or have any stakes beyond the next five minutes. If you don’t like the way the story is going, just wait a few minutes, because character motivations will change, someone will come back from the dead, or something will blow up good to distract you. Fast X cynically ends with a cliffhanger, almost literally, but it doesn’t matter because nothing does. There are no repercussions, no consequences, in these movies. It’s all empty calories. If you’re a completist, you may want to watch this one if you’ve seen the others. If you quit this series some movies back, this isn’t one that would bring you back into the family. I will say that Jason Momoa’s performance is leaps and bounds the reason to see this movie. I almost want to see it again just to watch him do… whatever it is he’s doing. It’s weird and fun and unexpected, and I say this wholeheartedly – I was rooting for him throughout Fast X‘s running time. That’s not great when your villain has the audience actively rooting against the heroes, but it is what it is. To borrow from a much smarter movie, Fast X is stoopid with two O’s. Universal Pictures will release Fast X in theaters on May 19, 2023. The film is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material. Alan Cerny has been writing about film for more than 20 years for such sites as Ain’t It Cool News, CHUD, Birth Movies Death, and ComingSoon. He has been a member of the Houston Film Critics Society since 2011. STAR WARS biased. Steven Spielberg once called Alan a “very good writer,” and Alan has the signed letter to prove it, so it must be true.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023"," Define “fast”. Turns out the movie that was billed as “the end of the road” for this car-crazy franchise, may be the start of a trilogy (with the twelfth instalment to be released in 2025). How much slower could an exit be? Still, it’s hard to stay mad at an ensemble that now includes Jason Momoa, Rita Moreno and cute 10 year-old, Leo Abelo Perry. Against all the odds, the ridiculously expensive Fast X (reportedly $340m) is both a bloated swizz and a cheeky triumph. Plot-wise, logic has always been a missing ingredient in the Fast franchise. And it’s true Vin Diesel’s hoodlum-turned-hero, Dom Toretto, looks the same whether seething or sad. That’s right: Dom’s as expressive as a bucket of drying cement. But no biggie. Where this series is concerned, it was ever thus. Back in 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew stole from and killed a Brazilian drug-lord, Hernan Reyes. All these years later, Hernan’s miffed son, Dante (Momoa), has finally got his act together and revenge is on his mind. With friends in high places, Dante is the antithesis of the loyal, family-obsessed, still-lives-in-the-old-neighbourhood Dom. When not bantering with corpses (a truly macabre sequence), Dante is purring that Dom is “so predictable... thinking everyone will end up on your side”. It’s a meta-moment: Dom’s foes really do have a habit of turning into allies; Dante is all but winking at the camera. Throw in the fact that Momoa is as larky as Harry Styles (it feels quite often like he’s ad-libbing) and the result is blockbuster bliss. The action is fine. In Rome, a big, flaming bomb rolls hither and thither. In Portugal, Dom drives down a dam. In F9, though, Dom’s bickering buddies took a Pontiac Fiero into outer space. Nothing here can compete with that set-piece.  Ultimately, these films about the atmosphere created by producer/star Diesel. The 55-year-old’s loyalty to original cast members, particularly Michelle Rodriguez and Sung Kang, and his willingness to let newbies do their own thing (Moreno and Perry are delightful as Dom’s granny and son), ensure the tribulations of Dom and his extended family really matter.  The franchise may be running on fumes. I confess, though, I don’t want it to stop. If Brie Larson has more to do in XI, I’ll probably give it 10 out of 10.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023"," Let’s play a game: Picture a Fast Saga action sequence. Dom’s crew dragging a vault down a highway in Rio. Vin Diesel dropping a parking garage on Jason Statham (who is somehow not horrifically crippled afterward).  Michelle Rodriguez harpooning Gina Carano out of a plane as it’s speeding down the tarmac. Doesn’t matter which one. Dreamer’s choice. Now, mentally swap out Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, etc. with any of the Looney Tunes. The effect is more or less the same. Love it or hate it, The Fast and the Furious brand has gotten so much mileage out of its cartoonish approach to action that it’s tough to dismiss its charm. Its latest installment, the big, messy, brazen Fast X, is every bit as silly and platitude-heavy as its predecessors, but with an added advantage: Jason Momoa. The guy is the chest-baring, twinkle-eyed embodiment of twisted playfulness, a show-stopping, femme-forward villain who immediately cements himself as one of the greatest characters in the series. Momoa is effortlessly outrageous and tough to categorize, as if he’s waited his entire career to shed the machismo of roles past and try out something a bit less archetype-y. If it weren’t for him, this entry would easily be among the worst in the franchise. Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), his brother Jakob (John Cena) and their chosen family as they square off against Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the vengeful son of deceased Fast Five baddie Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Director Louis Leterrier, taking the reins from franchise veteran Justin Lin, can’t bring the energy and polish that elevated the outstanding Fast Five, but he piles on just enough high-stakes action and ludicrous stunts to make its bloated runtime reasonably fun. But as gimmicky as they’ve become, there is something beautiful and brazen about the way these movies contort reality to fit their own outrageous needs. Gravity doesn’t apply to Dom and co. the way it does for the rest of us, and nearly every major character death – even seemingly final ones – has been walked back. Oh, and physics! Wait, what physics? Fast X is as disinterested in reality as any of its predecessors were, and it isn’t shy about it. The bottom line? Fast X is so dedicated to individual moments, so focused on maintaining its excess, that it forgets it’s all supposed to add up to a story. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it does mean you need to check your expectations at the door.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2023"," Traditionally getting the whole cast together – minus Paul Walker’s Brian, who is somehow still alive (but unseen) in the franchise despite Walker having died in 2013 – is reserved for a post climax reminder that in a world full of the Fast and the Furious, the only F that really matters is Family. But Fast X gets the get-together out of the way early; with the finishing line for the franchise only a movie or two away, it’s foot to the floor cliffhangers and shock reveals from here on out. The story is the usual crockpot of high tech gizmos and street racing and reminders that family is all that matters and missions that involve trashing major world cities and stopping off to check in with old friends before a whole lot of explosions. Flamboyant yet sinister new threat Dante (Jason Momoa), son of that dead Brazilian bad guy from Fast and Furious 5, is running around saying ‘never accept death when suffering is owed’, which means the usual supervillain antics instead of just hiring a couple of guys with sniper rifles to shoot alpha potato Dom (Vin Diesel) from a safe distance. The callback to Fast & Furious 5 with Dante’s origins – because seriously, they could say he was an alien come to Earth to drink petrol and it would make as much sense as anything else – is a move designed to signal a gear change. It’s time to ease off on the franchise’s trademark insanity and return things to that magical time when Dom and his crime crew were actually committing implausible crimes instead of spending every movie being hunted by some bad guy thinly connected to a previous instalment. This means much of the film is somewhat subdued by FF standards, which is insane to say about a movie where early in proceedings a neutron bomb the size of a house rolls through the streets of Rome (sometimes on fire) crushing all before it. But as Dante himself says, that’s a homage to the classic safe-stealing sequence from FF5, a film that did not have secret underground prisons full of laser-wielding robots or reminders that in the previous film some cast members literally drove a car into space. Does this reset work? Not really. The need for big destructive set-pieces means much of the action is clearly CGI – not that the effects look bad, but that (for example) there’s no way the city of Rome is going to let half the town get trashed. There’s no firm line as to what is or isn’t possible, let alone dangerous: minor characters are sidelined simply by falling out of a car or a flesh wound while others are basically indestructible, gravity is an optional extra and turning on the nitrous system in your street racer gives the car (and possibly you) superpowers. Despite Fast X’s best efforts to keep the action somewhat grounded (so mostly just over-the-top fist fights and car chases until the usual crazy climax), sometimes you can’t drive home again. Typically Fast & Furious villains have tried to out glower Dom – a futile effort that’s doomed to failure. Momoa steers hard in the other direction, playing a consistently gleeful bad guy relishing in chaos, as much at home conversing with the taped-up corpses of his former henchmen as he is mock-vomiting at the very mention of the word ‘family’. His willingness to weaponise the clichés at the foundation of the FF franchise makes him a real threat, even if his schemes are the usual over-complicated, loophole filled shenanigans the Dom Squad always find their way out of. He’s not the only over-muscled giant to flex his way out of the franchise’s gender roles. John Cena, whose professional persona has swerved firmly into the goofy dork zone since he frowned his way through the shock revelation last movie that he was playing Dom’s never-before-mentioned brother Jakob, spends most of this film on a road trip babysitting Dom’s son. It’s a charming and low stakes (until it isn’t) counterpoint to all the rushing around, even if at one stage it involves a high altitude-escape in a fold-up vodka-powered jet. The counterpoint is Vin Diesel himself, who showed more range and emotion playing a block of wood in the recent Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3. For a man so obsessed with family, Dom sure does spend a lot of time in these movies solo: whether that’s because the bad guys know the only way to weaken him is to isolate him from… family… or because literally every single other member of the regular cast up to and including his car can out-act him, is up for the viewer to decide. What isn’t up for debate is that this feels like the start of a victory lap (though with Vin Diesel recently announcing that there may well be two more films to come, who knows how long that lap will be). Dante’s link to FF5 means some lengthy flashbacks – Paul Walker is back! – while many of the action sequences feel like deliberate callbacks to earlier high points. And of course everyone else is back, including the entire core cast plus Scott Eastwood, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham (still using chumps as a punching bag), Helen Mirren, and at least one surprise guest that’s going to require some explaining. And as if the cast wasn’t big enough, Brie Larson joins ‘The Agency’ to provide exposition and get in a bar fight. The Fast and Furious franchise started off average, somehow became a lot of fun (that’s instalments 5 & 6), and has since drifted back to a much louder kind of average. This isn’t the hoped-for return to form, but if you’ve come this far then Momoa, the supporting cast and a couple of shock twists (don’t leave once the credits start) are reason enough to strap yourself in yet again. Can the return of a fully CGI Paul Walker be far off? If there’s anything that can bring him back in front of the cameras, it’s family. Anthony Morris is a freelance film and television writer.

"May 17, 2023"," I think there is a point at every trip to the funfair when you take one too many rides on the rollercoaster, and wind up vomiting your hot dog and soda onto the pavement. The rides were great, and you had a great time with them, but it turns out that you can have too much of a good thing. Now your joy is tinged with regret, you are feeling a little queasy, and there is a foul taste lingering in your mouth. Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel), accompanied by his ever-growing found family of street racers turned armed robbers turned international spies, has returned for a 10th ride around the track. Very few film series make it to 10 instalments – 11 if you count 2019’s Fast & Furious presents Hobbs & Shaw. If nothing else, Fast & Furious is a colossal achievement in franchise filmmaking. At their best they have presented outstanding and gleefully ridiculous action sequences paired with the most diverse cast of actors in the business. To an extent they have essentially become critic-proof: the cast stay on-theme, the storylines constantly get bigger and more ridiculous, and any adherence to realism has been deliberately abandoned. Dislike a storyline? The story is not the point. Neither is the suspension of disbelief. Ever since the franchise shifted from street racing to international espionage and heists in Fast 5 (2011), you have either been in on the joke or not. Logic? Common sense? The family craves not these things. Fast 5 is particularly relevant to discussions of Fast X of course, because latest villain Dante Reyes (a flamboyant Jason Momoa) is the son of the earlier film’s central antagonist: Brazilian gangster Hernan Reyes. Exercising a long-planned mission of revenge, Dante unleashes a plot that will separate and endanger Dom and his friends like never before. Or, to be honest, exactly like it has been done before. Not even the introduction of a new director, Louis Leterrier, seems to bring anything fresh. There are two key problems with Fast X that are actually worth talking about. The first is its narrative structure, which – given Fast & Furious‘ ever-expanding cast – is forced to juggle more characters than its story can accommodate. What is more, it has been promoted as the first part of a two-film franchise finale. There is no climax and resolution here, rather a formulaic cliffhanger ending following more than 140 minutes of action and chase sequences. To find a less satisfying Fast picture, you need to go back to the early 2000s. The second, far more egregious, problem is that as an ongoing franchise Fast & Furious is running on fumes. The reason Fast 5 felt like such an exceptional work was because it aggressively transformed and updated a tired film series with a new energy, a fresh direction, and smart action ideas. Not a lot has changed since, and the constant repetition has grown well past stale. There is no surprise to see the villains of one film somehow become the beloved co-protagonists of the next. Character deaths no longer have meaning because so many of them have subsequently been reversed. If no one can die, there is no suspense. With no suspense, there is no drama. Each new film simply becomes an exercise in making cars do impossible things with CGI. How weightless is death at this stage of the journey? Fast X includes a scene of a proud uncle gleefully encouraging his eight year-old nephew to murder a bunch of people, and it’s difficult to summon up enough energy to criticise that. It is well past time to get off the rollercoaster. I applaud Universal Pictures’ choice to end the franchise on their own terms, before the audience grows bored, but I honestly believe they have left the choice too late. Fast X has all of the over-the-top action that we are used to – but that’s just it. It is only all the over-the-top action that we are used to. I’m getting bored. Except for Tokyo Drift and – it was the first one that was basically a remake of Point Break with cars, right? – all of the Fast and Furious movies have blurred into one for me.  I think I’ve seen them all, but I could be wrong. Pretty sure the last one I saw had cars dragging a safe.
I’ve come around to the suggestion you once made that the Fast and Furious movies should become part of the MCU, even if it’s just so we can have Spider-Man say, “That car doesn’t obey the laws of physics!”",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," Fast X is a pileup of characters fighting to stand out and less spectacular action that feels more like marketing for future installments than a complete feature. Pedal-to-the-floor nonsense of the smashiest vehicular order continues in Fast X, but it's also one of the franchise's weaker efforts. The supposed ""beginning of the end"" for the franchise may make you smile at maximalist rubber-burnin' stupidity and guffaw aplenty, but clocking in over two hours and 20 minutes, the tank nears empty sooner than you'd hope.  An overly cluttered story executes like a toddler with too many toys who can't decide which to play with and loses itself to the ill-fated franchise pitfall of thinking too far into the future. It's brimming with series hallmarks from Corona toasts to emphatic family values, only to structure itself like a two-hour first act that smashes into the credits like Wile E. Coyote into a painted-on fakeout tunnel entrance. Writers Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin do their best to handle Fast franchise continuity held together with Scotch tape. The sins of Dominic Toretto's (Vin Diesel) past return in the form of wild card Dante (Jason Momoa), the flamboyant son of Fast Five drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Dante seeks vengeance for his papa's death, hellbent on watching Dom suffer an eternity's worth of torment. That means hunting down and killing anyone who's ever aided Dom, from blood family to his chosen siblings, with the ultimate goal of reaching Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) as the ultimate dagger to Dom's heart. Fast X upholds the franchise's upward trajectory of ridiculousness with absurd pride. Whether that's an intense sequence where Dom plays Rocket League through Rome with a flaming bomb or when Dom drives himself and Little Brian down an exploding dam like it's a sledding hill. Director Louis Leterrier took the reins when Lin vacated the position and doesn't fumble responsibilities when punching audiences with Nitrous-fueled action scenes where cars become anything from getaway transportation to usable weaponry. Fast X revs its engines loudly — that's not the issue. There's an incompleteness to Fast X that resembles marketing material more than a complete cinematic journey. It's a blatantly unfinished product to an embarrassing degree as Fast 11 is confirmed, with a possible Fast 12 being teased. Dom's crew is scattered across the globe from Antarctica to London, Rio de Janeiro to classified international hideous, which causes the story to jump around from location to location as a clip show of character introductions (and reintroductions) squeezed between metal-crushing mechanical mayhem.  Fast X would have enough trouble focusing on the core familiars before the inclusion of newbies like spiked-shoed Tess (Brie Larson) and tactical bruiser Aimes (Alan Ritchson), or the resurfacing of old frenemies like Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). As is, characters barely find enough time to squeeze out dialogue past an overserious monologue and a catchphrase. Now, I'm all here for hot nonsense blockbusters, and Fast X does not fail in broad entertainment value. Jason Momoa finds notoriety as an outstandingly out-of-his-gourd villain that mixes the Joker's psychotic dark humor with tropical linen wears and gooberish unpredictability. John Cena ditches everything about the sterner, stiffer Jakob Toretto from F9 to become the goofier and more lovable ""Uncle Jakob"" in Fast X. While hard to take the film's earnestness with a straight face, that doesn't negate the humor of Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej's (Ludacris) bonding through bickering, or Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) forever ""Can I just shoot them?"" face. It's just a shame how with so many relationships to maintain and new allegiances to form, emotions ring hollow as the movie becomes a celebrity guessing game of who will appear next (especially since deaths no longer matter). Of course, you're here to watch Dom's elite team of drivers and daredevils defy gravity once more. Fast X doesn't disappoint, as muscle cars again ""leap"" from aircrafts or toss around helicopters that foolishly try to separate Toretto's tires from the pavement. It all meets the visual standards of Fast titles that go ""vroom vroom, boom boom"" as the camera glides through passenger windows to set the anticipation of impending street races before more explosion. However, unattractive background green screens are used too frequently, and there's way more computerized ugliness compared to practical spectacle. Locations like the carnivalesque Rio de Janeiro pop with celebratory colors, unlike The Agency's uninspired den of floating screens that are entirely post-production additions. Blurry mountain ranges and washed-out skyscapes stick out in this slurry of digital landscape fill-ins behind Dom and others, which translates poorly in a blockbuster of this caliber. That may be why despite firing-on-all-cylinders, Fast X is a frustrating chapter that plays like hype material for what's to come later. Moments of unbelievable action extravagance exist as only a Fast movie can imagine, but not in a way that makes you pound the hood of your car in uncontrollable excitement. Nostalgia grabs and reveals registers disappointingly as a less well-oiled machine propels a Fast flick missing the usual obscene amounts of family-style thrills over substance. Fast X is never better than when highways full of ""car-nage"" resemble playtime with Hot Wheels collections, but it's more often worse as its outlandish ensemble approach fades from charm into parody without the self-awareness to pump those breaks early enough to course correct.

"May 17, 2023"," The sky was the limit in 2021's F9; having seemingly run out of exotic locales to ship the franchise's revolving roster of rev-heads off to – you can really cover a lot of ground in 20 years, especially if you've got a souped-up ride – F9's co-writer and director, Justin Lin, hazarded a trip to space. Fast X is not short on answers: Rio, Naples, Rome, London, Antarctica – no Lonely Planet guidebook is safe. No more space travel, admittedly, but even so, this latest and nominally 'last' instalment (in fact merely the first in a tripartite finale) still feels like an overreach. The mandate to up and up the ante has seen the so-called Fast Saga turn from dumb, hyper-stylish fun into something meaner and more airless. That there were competing visions for this home stretch is clear from the directorial changeover that took place a week into production: Lin, who had returned for another round at the helm, reportedly clashed with Vin Diesel, aka Dominic Toretto, the devoted patriarch whose steady heartbeat is the metronome of the franchise. Diesel is also one of Fast X's producers. (The scramble to replace Lin culminated in the hiring of Louis Leterrier, most notable for his work on the first two films in the Transporter trilogy, the launchpad for Fast's own Jason Statham.) For as long as we've known him, Dom has lived by a moral code consisting of a single principle: ""Without family, you're nothing,"" as he puts it in this latest film. Of course, the Toretto clan goes beyond blood: It includes almost anyone who's sat round the table for a barbecue lunch with a Corona in hand, raised in celebration of another triumph in the realm of pedal-to-the-metal hijinks. Making his Fast debut, Jason Momoa plays Dante Reyes, a swishy sociopath seeking to avenge the death of his father, Hernan Reyes, the Brazilian drug lord last seen dead on a sun-baked Rio de Janeiro bridge in 2011's Fast Five. Somewhere between Heath Ledger's Joker and Captain Jack Sparrow (no, it's not a good mix) and swathed in lavender silk, Dante also operates according to a succinct moral code: ""Never accept death when suffering is owed."" Consequently, he's made it his mission to torment Dom, whom he holds responsible for his father's murder – and to that end, to torment his family: Dom's beloved Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his siblings Mia and Jakob (Jordana Brewster and John Cena), as well as his impossibly resourceful crew (Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Tej, Sung Kang as Han Lue, and Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey). All are toy mice to Dante's devil-cat. (There are plenty of other familiar faces and names back in play – including one or two that shouldn't be spoiled, though no seasoned viewer should really be surprised to see any legacy character crop up in these films, alive or dead.) For a film so steadfast in its family values, the departure of Lin – the director of five Fast films, including Fast Five, the first film in the series to attract critical appreciation – feels perhaps more glaring than it should. Though he retains a co-writing credit on X and stayed on as a producer, his decision to vacate the driver's seat is a sign that the Fast family is not immune to in-fighting. Diesel, it seems, is committed to his character's mantra only so far. There's a lot at stake, certainly, both on-screen and off: With a budget of $US340 million ($512 million), Fast X is one of the most expensive movies ever made. To put that in perspective: The jackpot for which Toretto and co are willing to attempt to steal an entire bank vault from a Brazilian prison in Fast Five is a mere $100 million. That film – which, under Lin's guidance, began the series' shift away from racing for pink slips and towards Mission Impossible-style heists – is the primary touchstone here. Fast X opens with a retread of the vault-theft escapade, now seen from Dante's perspective – though the snazzy mustard suit he's sporting in the flashback, together with the use of a film-grain filter, suggests the 70s more than 2011. The retroactive shoehorning-in of the Dante character is indicative of a franchise getting tangled in its increasingly cumbersome lore. In two-plus decades, enough siblings have been invented and characters brought back from the dead to suggest that there's more of a resemblance between The Fast and the Furious and The Bold and the Beautiful than merely their titles. Lin's departure aside, the mandate to leave no family member behind may actually be getting in the way of putting on a good show. (Even Brian O'Conner, the character played by the late Paul Walker, remains alive in the Fast family-verse, and happily married to Mia.) With so much reverence for its players, these films have started to feel more like a CGI-augmented meet-and-greet; we're shunted from one gorgeous backdrop to another, lingering just long enough to witness our heroes barrel through the cobbled alleyways and ancient piazzas, leaving a simulated, rubble-strewn trail of destruction in their wake.

"May 17, 2023"," Ten movies later (not counting spinoffs), the meathead stars of these vacuous slogs look and behave like a group of retired gym teachers who’d be better off behind the wheel of a golf cart. But let it, they did, and now we’re buckling up for another moronic “Fast” film that plods along like “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall” and features increasingly fake chases.  Just like at the start of “Fast 9,” Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) are living in familial bliss with their young son when they’re pulled back into the underworld action. The screenplay is credited to Dan Mazeau, Justin Lin and Gary Scott Thompson, but I’m convinced this is the first major Hollywood film written by ChatGPT.  When the pair’s suburban home is attacked, they learn that their wisecracking comrades have been sent on a fake mission to Rome to be ambushed by a drug kingpin named Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). The new baddie has been plotting revenge on Dom for killing his pop in, um, an earlier one of these things. A large spherical bomb falls out of a truck and rolls miles and miles through the Italian capital, like the boulder from “Raiders of the Lost Ark” got lost in a “Benny Hill” chase sequence.  Dom, Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Han (Sung Kang) are framed as terrorists and pursue Reyes by way of Rio de Janeiro. Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena), meanwhile, races to get Dom’s kid to safety.  Oscar winners Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron return in their pointless criminal roles of Queenie and Cipher. They’re joined by another Best Actress victor, Brie Larson, as Tess, who helps Letty when she’s trapped in Antarctica.  Momoa’s villain, we learn, “showed sociopathic tendencies from an early age,” so the actor behaves in a generically crazy manner — giggling, squealing and making silly gestures — as the character with a God complex murders at random. He’s beginning to look disconcertingly like Steven Seagal. ",NEGATIVE

"May 17, 2023"," The evolution of the Fast And Furious franchise has been remarkable to behold. What started out as a relatively modest $38 million-budget action heist film in 2001 has, over the course of 10 instalments, exploded into a series of bombastic, globe-trotting blockbusters that revel in being as high-octane, death-defying and unbelievable as they can. They’re also extremely popular all across the world, too, and its films have a combined gross of more than $6.6 billion at the box office. Universal has such high hopes for Fast X that they even allowed its budget to balloon to a reported cost of $340 million. The studio will be hoping audiences return to the franchise in their droves after the disappointing box office returns of F9. To attract them, Vin Diesel recently confirmed Fast X is the first of a trilogy that will be bring the franchise to a close. Set several years after the events of F9, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) is living a peaceful life in Los Angeles with his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). This is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a wounded Cipher (Charlize Theron), the cyberterrorist who has thwarted Dom in the past. Cipher warns that Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is seeking revenge on Dom and his crew after they killed his father Hernan (Joaquim de Almeida) all the way back in Fast Five. Dante shows how dangerous he is by putting Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Megan (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) in grave danger in Rome. Soon the ensemble have to travel to the likes of London, Rio de Janeiro and Portugal to try to bring Dante’s exploits to an end. Fast X is equally ridiculous and fun. The stunts repeatedly defy the laws of gravity, physics, science and safe parenting but that’s exactly what you want them to do. If you leave your brain at the door and embrace the excitement that it’s trying so hard to provide, there’s no reason why Fast X shouldn’t deliver. At no point does its 2 hour, 21 minute running time drag. That’s despite the fact that its dialogue is as wooden and predictable as ever and its script lacks the genuine laughs of its predecessors. What really makes Fast X so thoroughly entertaining is the performance of Jason Momoa. The Aquaman star is having an absolute ball playing the dastardly villain Dante. Clearly inspired by Heath Ledger’s Joker, you can’t take your eyes off of Dante when he’s on screen, especially as he takes such great delight in being as psychotic and sadistic as possible. Every dastardly deed he commits is accompanied by a laugh that proves contagious, helping to make Fast X more pleasing and engrossing than it has any right to be. John Cena also excels as Dom’s younger brother Jakob, and his scenes with Perry are the funniest in the film. Considering how Fast X splits the Toretto crew up early on, and the film has to juggle at least five plots for long periods, screenwriters Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, and director Louis Leterrier deserve praise for their pacing and structuring, particularly Leterrier, who stepped in to direct Fast X when Lin walked out after the first week of production. While Fast X doesn’t quite deliver a satisfactory conclusion, its ending at least sets up the final entries in tantalising fashion. Ultimately, Fast X doesn’t get anywhere near the highs of the franchise, but it does lay down the road for what will hopefully be an explosive and crowd-pleasing farewell.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023","  Fast X races to the franchise finish line as an overblown popcorn cinema spectacle that audiences continually embrace. The first of the two-part finale brings all the players back in a convoluted game of retribution and revenge. Jason Momoa joins the jumbled fray as a quasi-androgenous, flamboyant psychopath spawned from the events of Fast Five. The film sticks to form as familiar characters engage in a violent CGI melee of bumper car explosions, gunplay, and savage brawls. There are laugh-out-loud moments as strained dialogue elicit the wrong reactions.   It's a blast from the Fast & Furious past with a memorable Rio de Janeiro robbery. Drug kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) is about to appoint his sadistic son Dante (Momoa) as successor. The backslapping festivities are interrupted by their vault ripped from the building in a daring heist. Reyes and his hulking scion pursue with deadly consequences.   Ten years later, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has comfortably settled into family life. He and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) raise little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) as a gearhead in a high octane school. They've left the Agency operations to a trusted crew. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) gets command of his first mission in Rome. He's still squabbling with Tej (Ludacris) while Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) watch in exasperation.   The gang reunites with Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their abuelita (Rita Moreno) for a family dinner before business commences. Faith in each other will always bind them. A late night knock at the door brings a shocking visitor. Letty secures Brian and joins Dom with her silenced pistol. A severely wounded adversary brings a dire warning. ""The Devil"" is coming for them. Dante isn't looking to kill Dom for his sins. He wants to destroy everything that Dom has built. Then suffer the pain of losing everyone he loves.   Fast X thankfully dials back the outer space and underwater follies of earlier installments. Burnt rubber hits the road for the majority of insane action scenes. French director Louis Letterier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) replaced Justin Lin, who helmed the previous five films, over creative differences. There's no discernible difference in the pedal to the metal approach. Letterier has action competence, and it's evident in the more realistic conflicts. Let me be clear. Fast X overall still feels like a CGI video game. But the scenes with actual cars on pavement look good and pump adrenaline.   There are too many characters. The franchise inexplicably can never let anyone go. People who should be dead, like Han, return but aren't zombies. Fast X then bounces back and forth around the globe with inane subplots. A busy script with cornball dialogue gives every actor a scene to strut their stuff. This honestly becomes tiring when they're not beating each other to a pulp. The ""we're arguing, but we really love each other"" shtick between Roman and Tej gets particularly tedious.   The story makes no sense and doesn't try to. That's sadly not an issue since the producers tossed logic out the window after Tokyo Drift. Momoa controls every outcome like a maniacal god. He spends half the film cackling and bloviating with remote controls on high overlooks. He's neither funny nor threatening but admittedly chews up the screen with his crazy antics.   Reactions will vary depending on the degree of fandom. Fast X is cut from the same tried and true narrative cloth. This supposed last lap is the same rev and repeat scenario we've seen before. The tank has long run empty for me but the box office numbers prove otherwise. Stick around during the credits.   Fast X is a production of Universal Pictures, Original Film, One Race Films, Roth/Kirschenbaum Films, and Perfect Storm Entertainment. It will have a theatrical release on May 19th from Universal Pictures.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. An ""unfilmable"" novel has finally made its way in full to the big screen. But dramatic liberties always have to be taken – here's what Dune 2 changed. Once upon a time, HBO was all about sports and nudity. That is, until they made their first scripted drama, one with a very well-known detective.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Wondering if FAST X is ok for kids? The newest film in the Fast & Furious franchise brings back what the fans love – action, family, and stunts that cars and drivers can’t do in real life. While perhaps it’s a tad more realistic than F9, isn’t the ridiculous what brings audiences back each time? Or have you experienced F&F fatigue? Here’s what parents need to know in this FAST X Parents Guide. Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path in their many missions. However, this enemy is the most lethal and evil they’ve ever faced. The film begins with a scene from Fast Five when the crew steals a giant vault and drags it through the streets. There we see Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), who has been planning his revenge for years. He is determined to shatter Dom’s family and destroy everything and everyone that Dom loves after Dom kills his father. Dom knows he must do whatever it takes to protect his son. But can he save everyone?  Fast X is rated PG-13 by the MPAA for intense violence, action, language, and suggestive material which means some content is not suitable for kids under 13. There is some profanity in Fast X including at least 15 uses of sh*t, a couple of bullsh*ts, damn, hell, a**, bi*tch, and words of Deity like g-ddamn and “oh g-d.” There is a lot of violence and death in Fast X which may be too scary for younger kids. Some of the deaths include “good guys” like CIA agents and cops. There is a lot of hand-to-hand combat, explosions, and death by guns, knives, and other weapons. A bomb blows up. Some close up shots include wounds and blood.  A villain is ruthless with no remorse. One scene includes close up shots of dead men, burnt, and used for comedy. They appear kind of alive, and it’s kind of gross. Other victims are tortured. The action is on par with a darker Marvel movie. There is no nudity in Fast X, but there is some suggestive material including a couple in bed kissing. There are no sex scenes. And with every Fast & Furious movie, there is a scene of scantily clad women dancing and gyrating. However, it’s short-lived, and not the main focus of the film.  In Fast X you can expect a lot of action, intense violence, car chases, some scantily clad women, and profanity used by some characters. To sum it up, Fast X is kid friendly for kids ages 12 and up. If your child has seen other Fast & Furious movies, then this film is on par with violence as the past films, so it’s up to a parent’s discretion on what is appropriate.  The Fast & Furious saga has turned into somewhat of a superhero genre. What started as movies about street racing and characters driving fast cars has now propelled itself into films about people doing superhuman things. Cars can even fly in space apparently. So while they continue to be entertaining, I wish they would have stayed in their lane. The tipping point for me may have been the mini Death Star rolling around Rome for 20 minutes. Fast X does try to mix it up a little with adding more emotion and deep conversations. I’m not sure they fit. I get it, family. But the speeches are getting to be too much.  Jason Momoa is funny and sadistic as Fast X’s villain. No conscience and a bit maniacal, he felt like a cross between the Joker and Jack Sparrow. And in true superhero fashion, nobody is ever really dead in the Fast & Furious movies, so I didn’t particularly feel any sadness with some deaths, because, well who knows, they may pop up later. I do appreciate that it seems the franchise is trying to give women better roles. They’re not just eye candy anymore. Letty’s (Michelle Rodriguez) and Cipher’s (Charlize Theron) fight scene was epic! And they weren’t doing it in bikinis, so kudos. Extreme and ridiculous, Fast X will entertain the franchise fans. Fast X definitely gets your adrenaline pumping!  It’s the kind of movie that gets people to the theater to make you forget about reality. And they always make you feel like family. I get the appeal, and I don’t. ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," The story: The movie, the 10th in the series, is the first piece of a three-part finale that will bring the Fast & Furious franchise to a close. Fast X opens with a flashback showing the events of Fast Five (2011). Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew steal Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes’ cash safe, leading to a car chase that results in the death of the kingpin. His son Dante (Jason Momoa) returns in the present day, seeking revenge on Dom and his family.  For a while now, the Fast & Furious franchise has sailed clear of any need to explain itself. You either get its maximalist approach or you don’t.  The laws of physics? They bend to the masculine will. There is no problem that cannot be solved with a car. Real men don’t converse; they strike a pose then drop cool one-liners. Dead people come back; enemies become allies with one act of mercy. There is a temptation to believe that the creative team is being deliberately cheeky, that it is aware of just how ludicrously over-the-top the series has become. Then, how do you explain Vin Diesel? Because in this movie and in previous ones, in the midst of the cartoonish excess, the weirdly static Diesel appears to take himself quite seriously.  He seems to think that in a movie featuring cars that can be launched into orbit, its touchstone of sincerity is Dom, a fossil of an action hero fished out of a 1980s flick.  Dom is meant to be the relatable working-class husband and dad, but Diesel manages to make backyard cookouts, canoodling with his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and playtime with son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) either dull or awkward  usually both. Seconds feel like hours. Dom, when not dropping platitudes about friendship and family like a gym-bro version of Barney the purple dinosaur, is grimly clutching a steering wheel, frozen in one seated position, even if the car is pointed straight up or down.  As Dom’s brother Jakob, he embarks on a Dom-free adventure that lets him show off his gift for comedy. If only the film had leaned harder on Cena’s agile expressiveness instead of Diesel’s dead-eyed delivery.  Ten movies in and the series still cannot work out how to combine the campy energy of its wacky plots and insane car stunts with the stodgy, conventionally masculine male characters played by the likes of Diesel, Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson.  Hot take: This is the third-last Fast movie, at least in the main franchise, and it offers conclusive proof that this saga’s COE should not be renewed.

"May 17, 2023"," If you’ve been following my reviews you know the Fast and the Furious series lost me as a fan 3 movies ago. The Fate of the Furious I found strangely bland in its supposed over-the-topness, Hobbs & Shaw was forgettable and wastes Idris Elba, and the last one, F9, was stupid but not in an entertaining way. I particularly dislike Charlize Theron’s character who spends most of these movies staring at screens, which I hate in action movies. So now we have Fast X which is supposedly the start to a final trilogy of these films. While I don’t know if that is needed I must admit to being pleasantly surprised by this film. It is over-the-top and ridiculous but there is more gritty action and racing than in the last films mixed in with the absurd spectacle, so that was very entertaining. The biggest difference between Fast X and the recent entries, however, is the addition of Jason Momoa as the lead villain Dante Ryes. He is the son of Herman Reyes from Fast Five (which is generally thought of as the best of this series.) Now he’s out for revenge and is completely unhinged but in an entertaining way. Honestly he’s one of the most compelling villains I’ve seen in a franchise film in a long time- not just this franchise but any franchise. He reminds me of Heath Ledger’s Joker in the way he is funny yet terrifying at the same time. It might sound like hyperbole, but I sincerely think Fast X is the best of this series since Fast Five. It was certainly the most entertaining for this critic. Your mileage may vary.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," We should have known something was wrong when Dominic Toretto started drinking a different brand of beer. The hero of the long-running Fast & Furious series, Dom (played by Vin Diesel), has always been known for three things: his fearless skill behind the wheel of a car, his fierce loyalty to his family, and his fondness for an ice-cold Corona. That is, until 2017, when the franchise’s eighth entry, The Fate of the Furious, saw Dom and his crew drinking—heaven forbid—Budweiser. That mistake was corrected in the follow-up, F9, but it was a subtle sign that the saga was losing its grip on the mythic, silly internal logic that made it so special. Now there’s Fast X, the 10th and by far the creakiest trip for Dom and company, who started out as brash young car thieves in 2001’s The Fast and the Furious but have since evolved into a cadre of vehicular super-spies repeatedly endeavoring to save the world. Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, follows the series’s standard formula: stacking Dom and his pals up against a merciless villain who wants to blow them up while also driving a car. But the sweet, coarse sincerity that once made these films sing is gone, replaced with jokes and stunts that feel patched together from earlier, better franchises. Part of that is due to the departure of Justin Lin, the closest thing the Fast & Furious movies have to an auteur (apart from Diesel himself, whose behind-the-scenes influence is reportedly substantial). Lin directed entries three through six and nine in the Fast saga, and he always kept the varied ensemble and absurd set pieces somewhat grounded, especially after the disastrous eighth film. He is credited as a writer and producer on Fast X, but he quit as director just days into production, handing the reins to Leterrier, a significantly inferior action craftsman. Problem A is the film’s villain, a preening gangster named Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), who is introduced as the son of Fast Five’s Brazilian drug lord, Hernan Reyes. Seeking revenge for his father’s defeat, Dante frames Dom and his friends for a bombing and sends them on the run. He torments their families, all the while monologuing with the goofy energy of a karaoke emcee. Momoa can be an imposing and charismatic screen presence, so his performance, which reads more Disney-sidekick crook than fearsome foe, is notably perplexing. Even when he’s threatening Dom’s loved ones with actual bodily harm, his buffoonery is just tough to take seriously. But the bigger issue is the story’s arc—or lack thereof. Even by the franchise’s easy-breezy narrative standards, nothing happening on-screen has a particular purpose. Dom mutters his usual maxims about family being important and then spends most of the film separated from his, speeding around furiously as he futilely tries to take down Dante. Dom’s wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is kidnapped and held in an underground prison alongside the crafty villainess Cipher (Charlize Theron), who has now been in three of these movies yet has accomplished zero impressive evil deeds. The rest of the core group—Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang)—bounce around, scratch their heads at the chaos befalling them, and endure cameo appearances from the likes of Pete Davidson. Perhaps most insulting, the main antagonist of F9, Dom’s brother, Jakob (John Cena), pops up here as a cheerful protector of Dom’s son, all smiles and groan-inducing one-liners despite having spent the entire previous movie trying to kill everyone. Yes, the Fast saga has pulled this kind of switcheroo many times before—the British master spy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) originated as a homicidal maniac way back when—but never quite so shamelessly and quickly. Cena is a lovable performer. However, he appears to be playing an entirely different character now, just so he can join in the high-fiving and Corona-swigging. Jump aboard, Cena, but be warned: The bandwagon is about to bust. Fast X is being billed as the beginning of the end; the next planned entry will function as a grand finale. Consequently, this movie doesn’t even bother to wrap up its storylines—instead, it signs off with a bunch of gratuitous cliff-hangers. At this point, Dom can stay dangling on those plot cliffs, for all I care. If I return for Fast XI, or whatever numeral it gets assigned, I’ll be there for the same reason these characters keep driving around angrily: grim professional obligation.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," The Fast & Furious films live in the ridiculous – or, at least they have predominantly for the last decade or so – and, at this point, that’s practically a compliment to call so.  Whether you think they have evolved or devolved over time from their humble 2001 beginnings of car-jackings and street races is a matter of personal opinion, but, either way, they’ve undeniably placed their own stamp on the action genre with their (now) signature brand of physic-defying stunts. And with Fast X, the inexplicable tenth entry in the Fast Saga (as it has been so dubbed), whatever bets were left are considerably off.  And how! Plausibility has always had a non-existent relationship with a Fast film, so there’s no reason it should start now, and when Fast X, once again, gives us a plethora of heroes and villains that switch agendas with no correlation to their previous embodiment (John Cena‘s villain-adjacent Jakob from F9 is now painted as a goofy uncle archetype) and devotes an entire bombastic sequence to an over-sized bomb rolling around Rome, destroying everything in its path on the way to eradicate the Vatican – which is arguably this film’s best moment – you know you’re in good hands because why would anything start making sense now? As directed by Louis Letterier (Transporter 2, Now You See Me), Fast X reignites the series with a certain energy that most would agree seemed to depart momentarily with outings 8 (The Fate of the Furious) and 9 (F9).  Vin Diesel‘s gravelly voice and penchant for sprouting the importance of “family” have grown exponentially over the last few entries, and Fast X is no different, but there was an almost bloated earnestness to how the material was approached.  Ironically, Diesel is this film’s weakest link, despite being the narrative glue that holds all these vehicles together, and as he continues to devote himself to proceedings as if he’s one of the great thespians of his generation, his surrounding cast all lean in to how ludicrous everything truly is. With 2011’s Fast Five oft-considered the peak of the series, it makes sense that Letterier would look to that film as Fast X‘s almost direct bloodline.  That film culminated with a dazzling heist that saw a bank vault traipsed across Rio de Janeiro as Joaquim de Almedia‘s Hernan Reyes, a ruthless drug lord, pursued.  At the time he felt like the series’ first legitimate villain and, quite ironically when you realise how he hasn’t been able to truly start his own franchise, Dwayne Johnson was introduced to the fray to further add some authorisation and imposing muscle to a film set that was already dripping in testosterone.  Johnson was dubbed “franchise viagra”, and though he undoubtedly added a certain appeal to the films – and the behind-the-scenes loggerheading between himself and Diesel meant the lengths the films went to to keep them somehow together was amusing – it’s difficult to say he saved them in any way. Johnson had his sweaty charm, but if anyone is saving this franchise it’s Jason Momoa.  When viagra doesn’t work, just inject yourself a dosage of him, as his flamboyant, sexually ambiguous supervillain is truly the burst of chaotic energy these films have long needed to go beyond merely being entertaining from a spectacle point of view.  The scope of action on hand has always been amusing, but Momoa’s Dante Reyes – yes, avenging son of our Fast Five big bad – adds a level of unpredictability and genuine terror that’s almost too good for a film of this ilk.  With his hair adorned in double pony-tails, his nails a mismatched shade of purple and velvet scrunchies wrapped around his wrists, Momoa’s aesthetic doesn’t seem too far removed from his own brand, but it complements his peacocking nature.  Every “whoop” he lets out and swan-like movement he makes the film is dialled up to 11, and when he’s not on screen he’s sorely missed. That’s certainly not to say this monumental cast don’t have their cake and eat it too, it’s just Momoa clearly has a much healthier appetite.  Dante wanting revenge for the slaying of his father is pretty by the books in terms of an action narrative, but the carnage is stretched out for 140 minutes because killing Diesel’s Dominic – or “Dommy boy”, as Dante likes to call him – would be too easy.  Dante wants him to suffer, so it seems justified that Dom’s crew are all separated across the world on their own individual missions, making it easier for him to target them; that, or when you have Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Michelle Rodriguez, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Jordana Brewster, Alan Ritchson, and the aforementioned Cena on your call sheet, getting them in the same room might be too much of an ask. With so many players it’s understandable that not all are going to get their moments to necessarily shine, and indeed the likes of Brewster, Eastwood, Statham and Mirren feel short-changed amongst the action, but with an 11th film already on hand – and, perhaps, a 12th if Diesel is to be believed – Fast X very much plays as if it’s the first half of a bigger story, meaning post-X arcs for their characters are likely; of the returning crew, Rodriguez and Theron probably have the most fun in that they finally get to put their combat skills to good use – against each other, no less – and their back-and-forth, whilst going completely against the fact that for the last two films Theron’s cyber-terrorist Cipher has been their sole enemy, is an amusing mix of banter and brutality. Being 10 films in now, Fast X has not been designed in any manner for the uninitiated.  Sure, Larson and Ritchson’s competing agents have a neat little exposition-catchup session early on in the piece to remind us of the timeline at play, but that’s not necessarily catering to audiences who have only casually viewed or shut out the series all together.  Because Momoa is just so damn good, I’d want to recommend people see Fast X for him alone, but outside of his performance there’s hoards of nonsense that only certain family can suffer through. With the film very much playing to its “We’re getting a sequel” mentality, Fast X‘s ending will likely shock those watching.  Certain post-credit movements have been spoiled (I won’t repeat, however), but regardless of this knowledge, it really can’t help but add a level of excitement for a film that will begin on a tragic and exciting note.  As long as Momoa returns, we’re in good hands, and, really, after so long you have to hand it to the Fast team for pulling a left-hand turn so unexpectedly when, no matter how high or far the road went, we always figured they’d stick to the right.

"May 17, 2023"," Vin Diesel and the fam face off against Jason Momoa in this tenth Fast & Furious movie, packed with all the stars you do (and don’t) expect. Fast X isn’t exhilarating in the way some films in the series have been, nor is it as infuriating or disappointing as some of the others, writes Daniel Rutledge. While it doesn’t recapture the glory of the Fast & Furious series in its prime, Fast X is a step in the right direction as an improvement on the regrettable eighth and ninth films. The particular flavour of goofiness this franchise specialises in has been tweaked back to a more palatable and enjoyable level, but rest assured, there’s no skimping on the comical stupidity. It’s hard to keep these movies exciting as the stakes have become so low. Not only do the characters behave like invincible superheroes, even when they do die, they always come back in a later movie anyway. Yet somehow the tenth main Fast & Furious is fairly exciting before it ends on a cliffhanger with less resolution than any previous entry yet. It’s definitely entertaining, yet while this is 142 minutes of pretty much nonstop action, none of it is very memorable action. There isn’t really one of the iconic ‘what about the bit where…’ stunts from the earlier films and there certainly isn’t one of the epic fistfight showdowns that were highlights of many Fast and Furious outings. But there is a constant onslaught of cool guys and cool girls driving cool cars really fast, crashing into stuff to blow it up and crashing into other stuff to stop it blowing up. Early on there’s a big cartoon bomb rolling through the streets of Rome, later there’s an update on the classic Fast & Furious-style highway car battle and then there’s some fairly spectacular action on a huge dam. The movie chugs along at a solid pace, the action sequences tied together with the typically hilarious cheesiness fans dig, albeit with fewer mentions of ‘family’ for some reason. We get the usual Corona sipping as well as some mechanic work and a barbeque. We even get a classic drag race complete with skimpily clad women gyrating to music in slow-mo, a once-essential part of the franchise that has been toned down in recent years. That drag race takes place in Rio de Janeiro, which is where Dante, the new big bad, comes from. I foresee a lot of people really enjoying Jason Momoa’s antics as Dante. He appears to be channelling Heath Ledger’s Joker but ramping the camp levels up to a crazy degree, and he’s allowed to seemingly mock the preposterousness of the movie he’s in from right there within it. I prefer Momoa in sinister sneering mode where you can almost feel the contempt radiating from him, which we get a bit of in Fast X, but he’s clearly having more fun going all Scooby-Doo villain with it. It is an undeniably fun performance that at the very least differentiates him from the generic Fast & Furious villains he follows. It would be a spoiler to say which characters are resurrected from the dead or otherwise brought back in this time, but it wouldn’t be a Fast & Furious movie without at least one and fans will be stoked with what happens in that regard. The abrupt ‘to be continued…’ ending is as frustrating as they always are, even though we knew it was coming this time as the franchise heads into its home straight. Still, this is a solid set-up for the following final one (or apparently now two films) Vin Diesel and the gang have planned. Fast X isn’t exhilarating in the way some Fast & Furious films have been, nor is it as infuriating or disappointing as some of the others have been. It’s a passable popcorn film and a nice hangout with these old knuckleheads as they race ever closer to their ultimate finish line, which thankfully now looks as though it isn’t going to be the disaster we were heading for.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," In the last exciting installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise, 2021’s “Fast 9,” the gang drove a car into space, tangled with a long-lost brother and pushed the physical limits of various vintage Dodge Chargers in far-flung locations around the globe, as Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is wont to do. Since then, there have been a few external shake-ups in the “Fast” world: longtime director Justin Lin departed the franchise only a week into filming on “Fast X” — now billed as Part 1 of a three-part finale — and he’s been replaced with a franchise super fan, “The Transporter” director Louis Leterrier, who swooped in to save the day like a member of Dom’s family piloting a muscle car out of an aircraft. But rest assured, family, in “Fast X,” the Coronas are cold, the booties are shaking and sleeves remain optional. Leterrier, working with a script credited to Lin and Dan Mazeau, takes his turn behind the wheel with the enthusiasm of a kid with a new set of toys, excitedly crashing together cars and characters. He clearly has a reverence for the lore of the franchise, which sprouted out of a tale of drag races and DVD player heists, but he doesn’t exhibit the restraint of Lin, which is somewhat hilarious considering that director’s automotive antics in this series. If Leterrier is making “Fast” fan-fiction, then Jason Momoa is doing parody as the franchise’s wildly flamboyant new villain Dante Reyes. In the opening of “Fast X,” Momoa has been ret-conned into the finale of Lin’s “Fast Five,” in which Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) and Dom dragged a bank vault full of drug money belonging to Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) out of a Rio de Janeiro police station with cables attached to their Chargers, naturally. Dante is Reyes’ son seeking revenge on Dom’s family because his own was destroyed. It must have been the head injury that turned Dante into the queer-coded bro Joker that he presents in “Fast X,” swanning about in satin blouses and scrunchies, giggling like Snidely Whiplash as he forces Dom to choose which members of his family to save, and yelling things like, “that’s awesome!” at particularly huge explosions. At one point he sarcastically refers to someone “in peril,” taunting Dom while inadvertently referring to the long history of action-adventure filmmaking. Because what is the “Fast” franchise if not “The Perils of Pauline” on steroids? If only Buster Keaton could get a load of this. At least Momoa and Leterrier are having fun in “Fast X.” The rest of the gang seems a bit lost, haplessly scattered about the globe, getting into pointless fisticuffs with one another. Diesel seems vacant, and at this point, he is merely the vehicle to keep this franchise moving forward, staring stoically at his new family members that seemingly pop up out of nowhere, and dutifully drifting the Dodges. Leterrier has a facility for car-based action sequences, and there’s a playful quality in the racing scenes as the camera swoops around windshields and wanders into windows to link close-ups of the various drivers. An early sequence where Dante sends a giant bomb pinballing around Rome is delightfully silly, and of course, the signature drag race scene in Rio delivers that reggaeton-flavored “Fast and Furious” thrill that we’re seeking. But the problems with “Fast X” exist on a more structural story level. It feels like Leterrier and the writers are just digging up loose familial relations and celebrity cameos and throwing characters together for the heck of it, tossing Oscar-winning actresses (count ‘em: four) in the audience’s face to create a distraction from the other weaknesses in the script. Brie Larson has all of four scenes in what is essentially a cameo appearance in a meaningless role; Scott Eastwood pops up then disappears; characters cross and double cross and then cross again, all while longtime franchise standouts Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and Sung Kang are left to wander around London for some reason. Leterrier and Momoa bring an energy and excitement to “Fast X” that juices the engine to deliver the goods that fans want. But the jumbled lore and odd treatment of characters may leave audiences with more questions than answers, and wondering whether the franchise is running on fumes.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Directed by Louis Leterrier.
Starring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Leo A. Perry, Luis Da Silva Jr., Michael Rooker, Don Omar, Tego Calderon, and Pete Davidson. Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved, and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past fueled by blood revenge and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. It would be unfair to say that the cast and crew of these Fast and Furious movies have no self-awareness of how preposterous and physics/gravity-defying the elaborate, extended, explosive set pieces have become, but Fast X (directed by series newcomer Louis Leterrier and from a screenplay by Dan Mazeau and saga regular Justin Lin) goes a quarter-mile further, with one character going on a hilariously confounded rant about how every opponent Dominic Toronto (Vin Diesel) and his family come across eventually somehow becomes indoctrinated into prioritizing family. There’s a blueprint to these movies, but also one for how they continue; villains become heroes, and the cycle restarts. Fast X knows that formula has become something to mock, so while it’s admirable that the filmmakers are in on the joke, they also have a better idea in introducing a morally irredeemable antagonist, even for this series. Enter Jason Momoa’s Dante, the sociopathic son of Fast Five‘s drug lord Herman Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), seeking revenge for the death of his father by punishing anyone associated with Dominic’s family and anyone who has ever helped them, with the alarming eccentricities, mischievous planning, and mentally unstable behavior as Joker from Batman lore. The character doesn’t just sport purple at one point (which feels like a nod to what the filmmakers are going for with this dastardly maniac) but even has similarly odd quirks, such as having conversations with a pair of dead henchmen stuck with a smiling facial expression. Also, remember that punishment doesn’t mean death but watching people suffer in disturbing ways or forcing Dom to make unthinkable choices, challenging his ability to do what matters to him most; protect the ones he cares about. Dante’s grand plan involves lulling the family into a trap in Rome, cutting Dom off from his family, including his current love Letty (a returning Michelle Rodriguez). They are warned of what’s coming by an unlikely associate, albeit too late, meaning that Dante successfully unleashes a gigantic bomb that rolls down the streets of Rome. Aside from serving as a callback to the bank vault heist in Fast Five, it also allows for an early action-packed sequence that shows yet another switch in directors is harmless and that there is no cause for concern. It’s also simply a ridiculously fun segment that practically operates on video game logic and physics, with characters driving their cars into the ball of death to knock it away and save civilians. From there, Fast X falls into a bit of a trap where roughly the next 90 minutes are setting up the next major vehicular mayhem sequence and high stakes that, unfortunately, feel hollow, considering characters in this saga come back from the dead all the time and continue to do so here. The bummer is that Fast X rotates between its seemingly endless supply of side characters, each with a small mission; John Cena’s Jakob is tasked with protecting Dom’s young son, Brie Larson is introduced as the daughter of Mr. Nobody and doesn’t really get much time to make a notable impression, Letty is locked away and finds an unlikely ally in breaking out, and the rest of the crew (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang, Nathalie Emmanuel) bicker and banter like usual while searching for a way to rendezvous with Dom. These situations are filled with action beats, mostly one-on-one fights that, while well-shot, solidly choreographed, and visceral, also feel meaningless and like the filmmakers are killing time as they insist this chapter must be a trilogy. The best among these sequences sees Jakob take on a small army of huntsmen inside a home, with John Cena channeling his inner WWE superstar and delivering an Attitude Adjustment from the top story and through multiple floors. His role as protector also allows him to express his sillier, more family-friendly comedic side as he tries to live up to the standards of Dom and come out of his brother’s shadow. The family also receives a noteworthy extension with Rita Moreno’s Abuela Toretto, who also preaches the importance of family. There’s also some faith-based material here, but much like the never-ending speeches about family, there’s sincerity through every word, no matter how nonsensical the story action becomes, that keeps these elements endearing where so many other films would end up annoying.  Once Fast X sets up its extravagant final action sequence set in Portugal, it certainly delivers in unabashed chaos, and while cliffhanger endings are not inherently bad, it’s difficult to say that these filmmakers have justified this installment to be two films, let alone a supposed trilogy. The beginning of the end of the road is bumpy for sure, but there is no denying that the big set pieces here are absolutely ludicrous and thrilling to watch. Jason Momoa is such a refreshing breath of fresh air as a villain so nasty that it’s impossible to see the character becoming anything else or finding redemption, and he is having such a blast being so despicable that he does make up for some of the above questionable choices, but not enough.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," By Lynn VenhausThe turbo-charged “Fast X,” aka “Fast Ten,” the latest entry of the 22-year-old “Fast and Furious” saga, continues to defy logic and physics in a dizzying grandiose globe-trotting revenge tale. A gimmicky gearhead grind, no. 10 features a sprawling star-studded cast racing from one continent to the next between massive explosions, shoot-outs, fisticuffs, and an enormous cavalcade of car crashes all staged to show off high-tech weaponry, fast-paced fight choreography and sensational stunts. As usual, the muscular hero Dom Toretto has a price to pay for antagonizing his foes, but his list of friends and enemies certainly has grown over the years. We pick up with doting dad Dom teaching his 8-year-old son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) his own set of rules on the road while his wife Lettie (Michelle Rodriguez) is helping Grandma (Rita Moreno) cook the family dinner, a time-honored ritual. The gang’s all there – the bickering yet bonded core group of Dom’s team: Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), mechanic Tej Parker (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han Lue (Sung Kang). In recent films, their certain set of skills have been in demand by an international government operation called “The Agency.” But even those seemingly fortresses of good can be infiltrated by evildoers, especially this chapter’s megalomaniac villain Dante (Jason Momoa). He’s the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, who was killed in “Fast Five,” and now comes calling with heavy artillery, having spent the last 12 years planning his retaliation. The hulking beefcake Momoa, best known as the DC superhero Aquaman, has a blast going over-the-top as a flamboyant, preening sociopath seeking vengeance. Part Cesar Romero’s Joker, part Jim Carrey’s Riddler, and all peacock-strutting and rooster-crowing swagger, Momoa ups the ante as a sadistic dominating presence. (His character is hastily explained as being institutionalized.) Dom’s sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), widow of Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker, who died in 2013, and was in five of the films), and brother Jakob (John Cena) also figure into the plot threads. And a noteworthy sentimental touch: Paul’s daughter Meadow Walker has a cameo as a flight attendant helping Jakob. Oscar winners Charlize Theron, as cyberterrorist Cipher, Helen Mirren as Shaw’s (Jason Statham) mom, and Brie Larson as Tess, daughter of Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), make brief appearances, and Moreno has one scene. But even the big-name cast – peppered with stunning cameos (must-see end credits) that the internet has already spoiled – is overshadowed by the mind-numbing number of pileups, combustible engines, bomb detonations, and burning rubber that result in a reckless high body count and ridiculous disregard for the laws of gravity. That’s not a surprise – it’s always expected in these big, bold and bravura blockbusters. Yet, for those who have been paying attention throughout the soap opera-on-wheels thrill ride sequels, some previous villains are now allies (well, maybe frenemies in a couple cases) and it will be established that former friends betray the good guys. That can get rather head-scratching – but really, thinking is not a requirement here. Nevertheless, the one constant is that the theme of family remains central to the core. It’s just that the death-defying action becomes a distraction as escaping without harm gets increasingly preposterous. When this popular franchise began, the personalities carried the minimal plot and maximum action adventures through, but as the scope became bigger, the plots became more convoluted. I can’t imagine anyone who hasn’t seen the last four or five really knowing – or caring – what has happened and what is going on now, as they’ve swelled from streetfighters to save-the-world in land, sky, and sea scenarios. Case in point: A submarine in the South Pole. Before you ponder this, keep in mind the latest cliffhanger ending is an intriguing tease for “Fast X Part 2,” now scheduled for 2025. Apparently, not the end of the road but “the last chapters” with another or two. This latest excursion through Brazil, Rome, Portugal, London, Los Angeles, and Antarctica is ultimately fan service. Let’s face it – few view these for interesting intricate stories. Now going into their third decade, people want bullets to spray, cars to fly and more pedals to the metal than in the last chapter. The stories are such a minimal template that I’ve accused them of being written by chimps, but now, after number 10, I’m convinced they are employing AI. The latest screenwriters – veteran Justin Lin plus newbie Dan Mazeau — touch on previous scenarios for some sense of a plot thread, but it doesn’t make “Fast X” easy to follow. The characters are based on those created by Gary Scott Thompson in 2001’s “The Fast and the Furious.” Lin, who directed the third through sixth movies (“The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift” in 2006, “Fast and Furious” in 2009, “Fast Five” in 2011 and “Fast and Furious 6” in 2013, returned for the ninth (“F9, The Fast Saga” in 2021), but abandoned directing this movie, over ‘creative differences,’ and Louis Leterrier, who made the first two “Transporter” movies, took over. Lin, however, stayed on as a producer and has a screenwriting credit. The entire canon includes “2 Fast 2 Furious” in 2003, “Furious 7” in 2015, “The Fate of the Furious” in 2017, and then “Fast and Furious Presents Hobbs and Shaw” in 2019. What happens next will determine the franchise’s grand finale. But harkening back to the early glory days would be a nice change of pace, for these increasingly ludicrous sequels have spun the original intentions out of control. After all, it’s supposed to be about family. “Fast X” is a 2023 action thriller  directed by Louis Leterrier and starring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Momoa, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, John Cena, Jordana Brewster, Brie Larson, Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Nathalie Emmanuel, Ludacris, Scott Eastwood, Alan Ritchson.

"May 17, 2023"," Believe it or not, we are now over 20 years into the existence of the Fast & the Furious franchise, evolving from a street-racing story to one that could be compared to the Mission: Impossible and James Bond series. Like those other two franchises, Fast now exists as a never-ending globetrotting adventure where the protagonists are called into action wherever their particular set of skills is needed. How being able to drive really fast in tight areas translates into world-saving derring-do is one of many reasons that the franchise is supremely absurd, with all logic thrown out from minute one of each subsequent film. Fast X, naturally, is no exception, although this time around they at least gift the audience with a great new villain, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who met his demise in Fast Five. In his pursuit of revenge, Dante lures/blackmails the core group – Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) – into traveling to different places around the world where he has set a series of traps. Along the way, old and new allies and foes like Jakob (John Cena), Deckard (Jason Statham), Tess (Brie Larson), Cipher (Charlize Theron), and more help or hinder the heroes’ efforts. Directed by Louis Leterrier and written by Dan Mazeau and Fast veteran Justin Lin, the film has the characters almost constantly on the move, which gives the illusion of action. There are, of course, plenty of car chases, explosions, fist fights, and shootouts, although the excitement they generate will likely depend on how hardcore a Fast fan you are. What’s undeniable is that the filmmakers do their best to make the film as over-the-top as any of the previous films, if not more so. This results in cars, usually driven by Dom, doing things that they are clearly unable to do in the real world, like stop a massive rolling bomb, careen down a dam, and more. As in at least the previous two films, the filmmakers are in on the joke, having characters make fun of certain situations or engage in stunts that are so preposterous that the only natural reaction is to laugh at the sheer gall of putting them on screen in the first place. The most enjoyable aspect of the film by far is the performance of Momoa, who has a ball making Dante into a cackling, monstrous bad guy who, despite Momoa’s beard and burliness, also comes off as androgynous in style and demeanor. For a series where the stakes are often ephemeral and death is rarely a true threat for the main characters, Dante feels like a breath of fresh air, offering something unique amid elements that often feel repetitive. On the flip side, great acting is not the first thing that springs to mind for the rest of the cast. Almost all of their characters are set in stone, so none of their performances offers anything surprising. The only fun to be had on this end is the various pairings that crop up due to plot machinations, most notably when Jakob winds up as the caretaker of Dom and Letty’s son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). It makes little difference whether Fast X is a truly good movie or not (spoiler: it’s not), as its legion of fans will show up no matter what’s put up on screen. The ridiculousness of the series is the point, and the first part of the two- (or three?) part finale more than delivers on that promise. 1.

"May 17, 2023"," At one point during Fast X, a mysterious government agent played by Alan Ritchson tells street racer-turned-crime fighter Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), “The days when one man behind the wheel of a car made a difference are over.” That’s a pretty potent statement for a franchise that has long tested the limits of what one man can do behind the wheel of a car, especially when that man is Vin Diesel. For instance: can a car fall backwards out of an airborne plane, crash land on two other moving vehicles, and continue speeding down the highway completely intact? Probably not. But then again I’ve never attempted anything quite so daring in my Volkswagen Jetta, so who am I to say? But there are a lot of things that cars do in this movie that defy the logic of physics, as they do in every Fast & Furious film (remember the space-bound vehicle in F9?). Yet the magic trick of this franchise – which Diesel promises is coming to an end with a three part finale – has been convincing serious-minded moviegoers to check their brains at the door and… well… go along for the ride.  The Fast & Furious franchise is so sprawling that you almost need a TV-style “previously on” to catch you up when the new entry begins. Fast X begins with a prologue set 10 years in the past, placing us at the end of Fast Five (still the best of the series). That film, you’ll recall, found Dom Toretto and his makeshift family pulling off a heist against Brazilian drug lord Hernan Reyes. Turns out Reyes had a son, Dante (Jason Momoa), who has spent the last decade hatching an elaborate scheme to avenge his father’s death. The plot, in broad strokes, involves Dante going after the one thing Dom loves more than souped-up muscle cars: his family. Through a series of Rube Goldberg-ian machinations, he lures Dom, his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and their pals Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) to Rome, where a bomb goes off right outside the Vatican. The explosion gets pinned on the gang, forcing them to split up and go into hiding. Meanwhile, Dante has his eyes set on Dom and Letty’s son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), who goes on the run with his Uncle Jakob (John Cena). The crew has few friends left in the government, since Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) has gone missing and his replacement, Aimes (Ritchson), isn’t too fond of them. (You’d think after 10 movies worth of crime fighting the government would give them the benefit of the doubt, but that’s bureaucracy for you.) They do have one new ally in the form of Mr. Nobody’s daughter, Tess (Brie Larson), who rightly suspects this was a setup. She conspires to spring Letty from a blacksite prison, where she’s being held alongside none other than cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron, the villain of Fate of the Furious). Letty and Cipher will have to work together to get out, but not until they’ve worked out their longstanding feud with some ass-kicking. There are a lot of old grudges that need to get hammered out in this film. With little money and few resources, Tej, Roman, Ramsey, and Han travel to London and seek the help of their old nemesis, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Deckard and Han go one-on-one out before they have to duke it out with the agents who are tracking them. You’d think with the government hot on their tails these folks would set their beefs aside and focus on their common foe, but then again this franchise wasn’t exactly built on logic. It was built on fast cars going “vroom vroom,” explosions going “boom boom,” and fists going “pow pow,” which Fast X delivers with aplomb. I must admit, I have a soft spot for movies like this. Generally speaking, I look at things like character development, plot construction, and execution of themes when assessing a film’s quality. Yet the Fast & Furious films have defied those metrics through sheer force of their entertainment value alone. The villains have always been hit-or-miss in this series, and you can place Momoa’s Dante squarely in the hit column. Momoa delivers a full ham sandwich of a performance as a sociopathic daddy’s boy, preening around in colorful outfits and painted nails. His flamboyant androgyny is a breath of fresh air in a franchise that’s become so identifiable with machismo. He’s at his best when gleefully tormenting his opponents, whether challenging Dom to a bomb-rigged street race in Rio or turning Cipher’s own men against her by holding their loved ones hostage. Momoa always finds the right balance between cartoonish sniveling and actual menace, no small feat for a film this outlandish. Fast X isn’t without its flaws. Since this is the first part of a planned trilogy, its plot functions almost like a first act, with new characters and exposition introduced throughout its 141 minute runtime (EGOT Rita Moreno and The Suicide Squad star Daniela Melchior join the ever-expanding family as Dom’s Abuelita Toretto and Brazilian street racer Isabela, respectively). As such, there are more scenes than usual of the gang setting up what they have to do through explanatory dialogue, which was never this series’ strong suit. With the weight of so much set-up, the pacing can feel sluggish at times, as we’re constantly waiting for the action to kick back into high gear.  Yet when the cars are speeding and the one-liners are flying, we’re reminded of why we keep returning to this makeshift family, and why we’ll be so sad to see them ride into the sunset. For a franchise whose best days appear to be in the rearview mirror, the film proves there’s still a little bit of gas left in the tank. ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Jason Momoa's Fast X villain is the best baddie in the entire Fast and Furious series -- and when the film keeps up with his energy, it's a blast.  The Fast & The Furious has never been restrained. Even from its onset, the traditional ""cop and robber become unlikely friends"" story beats were coated with a shiny turn-of-the-millennium flavor that made it instantly gaudy, ridiculous, and memorable. Since those comparatively grounded days of hijacking shipping containers full of DVD players, the characters of The Fast & the Furious franchise have faced all sorts of threats and dangers, pushing themselves and their cars to truly absurd limits to save the day. That's definitely the vibe of Fast X, which at times, feels like a culmination of the series. Weighed down when it tries to reflect on the blunt emotional beats, Fast X becomes a blast when it remembers the joys of going full throttle -- and no one understands that better than the series' latest villain, Jason Momoa.   Momoa plays Dante Reyes, the son of Fast Five's villainous Hernan Reyes. A sadistic and unhinged criminal ret-conned into the chaotic events of Fast Five, Dante has returned to take revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) for his role in shattering his life. His plans quickly scatter Dom and his allies across the globe -- with Dom and Dante having a series of face-offs in South America that grow more lethal as Dante gathers more weapons for his plans. Meanwhile, Letty (Michele Rodriguez) is forced to rely on some unlikely allies to escape captivity, Dom's brother Jakob (John Cena) struggles to protect Dom's son Marcos (Leo Abelo Perry), and the rest of the crew tries to stay ahead of the authorities who now believe them to be terrorists.   Momoa goes big with Dante, who feels more like the Joker than the typical criminals and villains found in the franchise. He's a very silly character, energetic and colorful, with enough ingrained menace to terrify pretty much anyone into obedience. Mamoa chews the scenery better than almost anyone in recent memory. He's a cartoon character in the greatest sense of the word, a magnetic and endlessly entertaining villain who might be the single best baddie in the series. When the movie reaches his level -- such as during a chase through the streets of Rome or the reveal of a car with multiple rocket launches attached to the front -- Fast X realizes its true potential.   Director Louis Leterrier is clearly keyed into that energy, too, as the scenes carry a chaotic but fluid approach to action that finds plenty of room for ridiculous turns, cool moments, and surprising jokes. When the rest of the film keeps that energy up, it excels. New characters like Brie Larson's Tess and returning players like Charlize Theron's Cipher and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw all have fun in their roles. The secondary subplot focusing on Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) is goofy enough to give audiences breathing room between scenes.   The problem is the central story, which pales in comparison to other Fast and Furious films. There's a good idea in the animosity between Dom and Dante, two characters who approach problems from different perspectives but are just as driven. But the film's attempts to pull at heartstrings with minor character deaths don't land, and the big emotional swings fall dead in the water. Dante is the kind of bombastic villain that requires an equal response, but the more muted approach to Dom's growing guilt and his resistant determination feels lacking. That's not to say Dom doesn't get ridiculous action beats. ",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," LOS ANGELES, May 17 (UPI) -- Fast X, in theaters Friday, certainly struggles under the weight of its prior entries. Nevertheless, it's never boring and is best when it embraces the absurdity of its continually evolving premise. Tying the new villain into a previous villain is a solid Fast and the Furious tradition. Dante's plan involves framing Dom's team for a bombing in Rome, thus splitting up Dom's family and making members vulnerable to Dante. Revisiting Rio de Janeiro gives Fast X the opportunity to stage action scenes in the same locations Fast Five used. Considering the series has traveled the world, returning to some pivotal settings inspires a clever redux. The hoops through which Fast X jumps to avoid collateral damage are impressive and admirable, because murdering pedestrians would dampen the fun. There are a few unseen casualties in Rome and any of Dante's henchmen are fair game. Momoa plays Dante as the villain whom even Fast and the Furious villains fear. He hijacks Cipher's (Charlize Theron) men and holds their families hostage to force them to work for him. Reformed Furious 7 villain Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) gets a taste of Dante, too. Momoa literally dances around all the cliches of action movie villains. Dante mocks Dom for taking the whole thing seriously, as if Dante is playing a video game with The Fast and the Furious characters as avatars. Fast X definitely misses the quality of Chris Morgan's writing. He penned the third-through-eighth entry and spinoff Hobbs & Shaw, and had a way of making the dialogue between set pieces sound sincere. One must admire the audacity of playing the ""Swan Theme"" from Swan Lake. That is the sort of highbrow meets lowbrow aesthetic that suits The Fast and the Furious, if only the film's script rose to the irreverence of new director Louis Leterrier's vision. In Fast X, the plot turns a little too quickly with unnatural transitions from sentiment to danger. It requires a lot of shortcuts to get characters from place to place, though it does include the ever growing ensemble and finds room to introduce still more characters. The most egregious is a scene in which Roma (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) fight each other for no reason. It's not even part of an arc about them drifting apart, and the film's running time certainly could lose extraneous material. Most of Fast X's new characters are related to previously established characters. It fits the franchise's theme of family, though it becomes glaring after a while that everyone had a daughter or sister. It plays a bit better than F9 having the characters question their own immortality in an attempted meta reference that threatened even the franchise's absurd reality.
 There is so much packed into Fast X that a viewer never waits for something cool to happen. It's less consistent than the best entries in the series, but still fun. Fast X leaves a lot of threads open, but gets fans amped for Fast 11. Before it's over, Fast X introduces possibilities for the sequel the same way Fast & Furious teed up Fast Five and Furious 6 teased Furious 7, and it can't come soon enough.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," It’s hard to keep being better and faster than the preceding movie, but somehow, the Fast and the Furious franchise is doing it. Fast X had a lot of work to do. After all, in F9, the team went to space. But what works about the tenth installment (unless you’re counting Hobbs and Shaw) in the franchise is that it’s just as wild as we’ve come to know these movies to be while still bringing the characters we love to life in a way that really works for the franchise as a whole.  You know going into any of these movies that there will be absolutely outlandish car chases, stunts that the team has to do, and more. But that’s what we expect from them, so that’s not nearly as important as the characters that we’ve come back for time and time again. We started this journey because of the cars and the music, and we’re staying because we love these characters so very much.  That helps to keep fans on their toes! As someone who loves Han (Sung Kang) most of all, this movie was a healthy dose of stories from each character while still being a story about Dom as he faces off against one of the best villains of the franchise. The world of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) continues to get bigger and better with each new entry in the Fast and the Furious franchise, and now, with Fast X (your seatbelts), fans were introduced to Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). The son of Hernan Reyes, who the team fought against back in Fast Five, has come back for revenge and proven to be their biggest villain yet!  The best way I can describe Jason Momoa’s performance as Dante Reyes is that he just truly came to set and had the time of his life. A twisted character who doesn’t care who he has to hurt in order to get revenge, Dante seems to be one step ahead of Dom and the team with each turn. But don’t worry, our family puts up a good fight against him.  Reyes just wants justice for his father. He doesn’t care how he gets to it but he just wants to see Dom suffer for what he did with Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). And that thirst for revenge has fueled his anger and almost giddiness over what pain he causes others. It is also the character that lets Momoa be the most like himself and the hilarious man we know him to be, even if Dante is evil to his core. It’s a nice balance between the public persona and lovable goof we’ve come to know with Momoa with a character who just wants destruction, and it is a performance people are going to think about for a long time. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) has disappeared. No one knows where he is, and the family and their connection to the Agency is rough. Aimes (Alan Ritchson) is now in charge and doesn’t trust Dom or his team, so their own connection to the Agency comes in the form of Tess (Brie Larson). Dominic notes that Mr. Nobody talked about his daughter, and we get to see Tess really shine as her father’s protégé and someone who cares about what Toretto and his family can do.  There’s not a lot of Tess in the movie, but what we do see of her is absolutely amazing and gives hope for a future where Russell returns to the franchise as Mr. Nobody and we can see more of her dynamic with him (and probably include them in the family, as well, just like the Shaw family has been).  Larson does really just fit right into this world. She’s powerful, knows what needs to be done, and isn’t afraid of getting her hands dirty. And it makes for a great look into how The Fast and the Furious franchise can continue to bring in new characters that are fresh and memorable. As I said, my favorite character is Han. The minute he came back in F9 and our dedication to the #HanLives movement became realized, I was excited to see where he was going. In Fast X, Han spends his time with Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Roman (Tyrese), and Tej (Ludacris). They go on a mission to Rome that Dom eventually learns is a trap from Dante, but Roman is heading the mission.  Even though Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) come to help them, they all still get separated, and for the most part, we’re left with Dom on his own, Letty on her own, and Han with the team from the mission. But it means that we get more time with them. Because they aren’t sharing the screen with Dom and his fight with Dante, we get to have fun moments between Han and Ramsey as Roman and Tej are fighting each other. We get to see Han just constantly eating something, and it’s nice to be back with him this closely. Yes, the family is separated. They’re not all on the same mission, and they’re trying to figure out how to stop Dante when the twists just don’t stop coming, and we don’t really know what is going to happen to them by the end of the movie because it does end on a cliffhanger. But still, we have one brief moment with everyone together and they’re all pretty separated from there on. It does, at points, make me long for the missions where the team is together and trying to come together for a common goal, which I do think is by design. I think we’re supposed to miss our team together so that when we do eventually get the next movie, we can finally cheer because they’re together again. But until then, we’ll just have to rewatch Fast X over and over again.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," At this moment in time, the conversation surrounding cinema has become about the battle between technology and human creativity. At one point in the Fast and the Furious series, it straddled the line between creative stunts and wild action, but after the passing of Paul Walker– and around the 8th installment– the series officially lost its way. Fast X, which sounds like a gas relief medicine, inches back to its once respectable status, but is still dragged down by its reliance on technology to make its production easier. The entire Fast family is back, new characters added, a new villain, surprise revelations, and ridiculous action sequences. It’s another Fast and the Furious movie but it’s also an embarrassing example of what passes as entertainment these days. Plot-wise– not like they matter– but we pick up after Fast 9. Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) are back at the house for a barbeque, coronas, and saying grace. We meet Abuela Toretto (Rita Moreno getting a nice paycheck for doing nothing) and see how much little Brian (Leo Abello Perry) has grown. We find out that Roman has been called by the agency to lead a quick heist in Rome but that is soon revealed to be a setup. Cipher (Charlize Theron) arrives bloodied at Dom’s door, letting him know that a man named Dante (Jason Momoa) is looking to hunt down anyone associated with the leader of the crew. He wants to tear down Dom’s family just as Dom had done to him long ago. What follows is an elaborate and excellent chase sequence through the streets of Rome. Cars crash, smashing, Letty is on a motorbike, and Tej and Ramsey are stuck on a truck with a giant bomb. The team must defuse it before it blows the Vatican. It’s an entertaining sequence but sadly all the excitement ends after. This leaves Dom alone to get back to his family. The agency has been compromised, with newcomer Little Miss Nobody (played embarrassingly by Brie Larson) trying to help, while Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) is in the position to protect little Brian and get him to his mom and dad by any means necessary. It’s in this middle section where all momentum stalls. The plot with Jakob and the little one is practically a Disney kid-buddy-road comedy. All the other sequences are exposition, with characters standing against green screens, and Tej-Roman jokes that feel recycled from past installments. The screenplay, written by Dan Mazeau and former director Justin Lin, is often lame, saved by the energy brought by Momoa– he’s having an absolute blast here– but even that has its limits. I must reiterate that I’m not a Fast series hater. I loved Fast 5 & 7 and I even championed it getting more ridiculous as it went along. By Fast 9, I was regretting all that I asked for because I got it and I hated it. Fast X is ultimately pointing in the direction up, compared to its two previous installments, but it’s a revelation of something darker at hand. Visually, Fast X is atrocious, with sequences that look pieced together through the magic of computers. If you told me a robot made this movie I would believe you (sorry, Louis Leterrier). Locations, stunt sequences, and even humans talking to one another in a scene look fake. Through the magic of post-audio, deep-fakes, and CGI that can whisk us away to various locations, Fast X is the cinema of the future and I absolutely hate it. That may sound like a completely different topic to argue, but it is the major problem with the newest Fast entry. What Top Gun: Maverick, John Wick: Chapter 4, and Mission: Impossible films have shown us is that making action films with the tangible is possible. Those are what real movies are. There is an artistry to making a great action film. It’s the reason why Jackie Chan is a living legend. It’s a reason why any movie that wastes Jason Statham the way this does should be ashamed. What Fast X is selling is a video game. It’s not a film where the cinematography matters because it’s definitely not cinema. If you’re entertained I am glad. But for those of us that want a lasting impact from our movies, Fast X will give you no relief.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," decade ago, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) led a heist of $100 million from a powerful crime lord in Brazil. While the theft was a success, it resulted in the creation of an enemy filled with unimaginable hatred and vengeance: Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the maniacal son of the slain kingpin. With only death and suffering on his agenda, Dante first frames Toretto and his loyal gang – including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) – of committing a terrorist attack in Italy, then drains their life savings to fund mercenaries hired to eradicate them. Now, with numerous police forces and paid assassins hot on their tails, Dom must attempt to stop Dante’s final goal of kidnapping his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), while the rest of his team will be forced to turn to unlikely allies if they hope to stay alive. As it jumps back a decade in the timeline to catch audiences up on revenge details, it simultaneously invents new coincidences and connections that didn’t previously exist. This isn’t some long game like in other franchises based on source materials, which cautiously built links needed for later revelations; shots are re-filmed in order to add items that simply weren’t there. This overly manufactured introduction does allow the picture to replay one of the better action sequences of the series, though – and it’s one of the first such moments that catapulted the unexpectedly long-running property from mere street culture to total superspy spectacle. It isn’t quite enough, however, to recap all of the important notes, considering that there are now nine previous entries, as well as a theatrical spin-off, which generate a colossal amount of backstory. And with a cast this large (it’s one of the most impressive aspects of this tenth chapter), every other scene seems to bring back someone whose involvement ought to be familiar – if only to diehard fans. “That’s not gonna happen again.” It’s back to the top-secret, nameless government agency missions, utilizing unrestricted resources, constant globe-trotting, and plenty of firefights. But it’s the type of action that often feels meaningless and inconsequential, particularly when the main characters remain perpetually impervious to harm. Once a role is brought back from the dead (and that has happened with far more than a single persona), it’s safe to say that everyone is relatively secure; death can’t even stop a valuable character for long. Resultantly, no real danger ever presents itself, regardless of the high-octane explosions, the machine gun shootouts, and the reckless car chases. The city of Rome is fairly well-demolished, but no doubt it will be in tip-top shape by the time the next sequel arrives. Further contributing to that lack of adventure-based potency is the inanity of the stunt designs, which are so disappointingly unrealistic (and physically impossible) that computer animation is surely used in the majority of it. And even the sequences that employ actual, practical vehicles tend to infuse CG supplementation or backgrounds or effects. This carries over into the onscreen technology, which is perhaps even more unworthy in the context of street-racers-cum-secret-agents; every immoderately-advanced doodad always has a kill-switch that can be triggered only at the last possible second, or it can be hacked with the rapid-fire tapping of an ever-present, exceptionally handy laptop. It often feels as if “Fast X” takes place in some sci-fi-saturated, distant future. The levels of destruction are pretty surpassing, even if cars remain operable despite absorbing major body damage. This is the kind of film that begs the question as to how any windows are able to stay intact after all the gunfire, collisions, and somersaulting across the pavement. The vehicles apparently brush off those damages like humans do with injuries; bodily wounds are never an issue beyond the first scene in which they’re incurred. Clearly, little about this movie is meant to be taken seriously, which is why it’s refreshing that Momoa is having such a grand time, playing his character so flamboyant and over-the-top. He must realize how silly the whole thing is (the other effective bits of humor revolve around Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges bickering). Certainly, the dialogue is somewhat self-aware, too, which explains why numerous lines offer up the very criticisms that critics will certainly identify. “If it violates the laws of God and gravity … they did it twice.” “It’s like a cult with cars.” “I hate barbecues.” “I only care about protecting the people that I love.” “Nothing’s impossible. You just have to have faith.” And, of course, the word “family” is spoken so many times that it tends to lose all meaning – especially since all of these characters are genuinely family-related in some way (and not just the heroes, but also the villains and the supporting and walk-on roles). Though the majority of the players are unmemorable, it’s admittedly amusing to see so many returning stars and cameos (each one engages in a fistfight for essentially no reason at all). With the plot’s unoriginality and constrained scope, there’s little for them to do, however, which leads to four of them spending the brunt of the bulky running time just traveling from one end of Rome to the other. The repetition is considerable, the drama and action are ludicrously exaggerated, and the cliffhanger finale reminds that this was never intended to be a complete story. Yet a portion of “Fast X” is so absurdly ridiculous that it’s mildly entertaining. And at least nobody drives a car into space. “Did you hit me with a helicopter back there?” Designed by Mike Massie | © 2006-2024 Gone With The Twins | All movie related images © their respective owners.

"May 17, 2023"," Has the Fast & Furious franchise earned a victory lap? That’s the key question behind an appraisal of “Fast X,” a film that brazenly plays like a Greatest Hits collection from a hit artist. Not only does it directly link to the massive, franchise-turning “Fast Five” in its narrative, but it constantly recalls other films in this series either through direct mention or action beats designed to recall similar moments in movies like “Fast & Furious 6,” “Furious 7,” and “The Fate of the Furious.” The script by Dan Mazeau and ""Fast Five"" director Justin Lin (who left the film after creative differences and whose absence is felt in terms of action choreography) is like a snake eating its own tail, often playing like a parody of the franchise more than a new entry that cruises on its own four wheels. Even as it’s spinning through enjoyably goofy action set pieces, most of them enlivened greatly by a fun performance from Jason Momoa, there’s a desperate familiarity to all of “Fast X” that makes it even more like reheated leftovers than it has before. This is reportedly the start of a trilogy that will close the series. Let’s hope they come up with at least one fresh idea in the next two flicks.

"May 17, 2023"," Fast X is easily the best Fast franchise film in years. This is Fast’s Avengers: Infinity War, plus Jason Momoa is living his best life. Fast X is the best film of the franchise in years, and it isn’t even close. Fast Five remains at the top of the list, but this one is a close second. The end of the franchise is near, we have been told this by Vin Diesel, so of course they decided to go big and bold, while also returning to the streets in Fast X. With Jason Momoa giving it his all as the villain, fan favorites returning to the screen, and a cliffhanger that will have your jaw on the floor, this one is a must see in theaters. I need to preface this review by saying that I saw Fast X in 4DX. Honestly, I am not sure if I would have enjoyed this film as much in a different format. With the 4DX motion and effects, I felt like I was a part of the family, right there in the driver’s seat alongside everyone as they raced through the streets of Rome and Rio de Janeiro. The whole experience felt like a two and a half hour theme park ride. It thrust me right in the middle of the action allowing me to become a part of the movie. The Fast franchise has always been known for pushing the envelope, so it should come as no surprise that it continues to do so in the latest installment. The races, the chases, the stunts, and the explosions… oh, the explosions… are massive in this film.  The longer the movie goes on, the crazier the stunts get. Last time they went to the moon. You might think there is no topping that, but just you wait. Fsat X has some truly incredible action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen, soaking it all in. It gets wild. It is pure insanity. And it is completely exhilarating.  Jason Momoa plays the villain of the movie, Dante, and this movie simply would not have worked without him. He is the star of the show, here. He soaks in every single scene that he is in, not just with his mannerisms but by his sheer presence. This man is having the absolute time of his life in this role, which is something the fans will appreciate.  Dante has a screw or two loose, which is what makes him such an entertaining villain. You literally never know what he is going to say or do next.  Is Dante’s dialogue cheesy and over the top? Of course it is. But would you expect anything else from a Fast franchise villain? These movie have always been on the silly side. At this point it feels as if they are just embracing it.  There are shocking surprises, exciting cameos, and a massive cliffhanger that will leave fans begging to see what happens next. Sounds a lot like Avengers: Infinity War, doesn’t it? With the franchise coming to an end, they really wanted to go out with a bang, and they are well on their way to accomplishing that. Fast X raises the stakes. It is intense and suspenseful at times, even through all the silliness that is going on. There are a few moments that are meant to be emotional, but they don’t fully get there. No tears were shed, but the impact was felt. Is Fast X perfect? Absolutely not. It is cheesy and silly, but that is how this franchise has always been. Most the plot points in this movie are predictable, but that doesn’t make them any less entertaining. Finally, we are returning back to the streets, for the most part anyways, and what makes the Fast franchise so much fun.  If it wasn’t for Jason Momoa, this movie would have been a lot less entertaining. He is giving his all in this performance and might even make you root for the villain. I honestly cannot see how this movie would have worked without him. No one else could pull of that villain in the way that he does.  Fast X is absolutely bonkers from start to finish. If you are looking for a movie that is pure entertainment and fun, this one is for you. Don’t go into this one expecting a detailed plot that will change your life, just ask for a good time at the movies. With the franchise coming to an end in the near(ish) future, Vin Diesel and crew were sure to leave us on a cliffhanger that will have us begging for more. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything–and everyone–that Dom loves, forever.

"May 17, 2023"," Let’s face it: At this point, you’re either in for the overamped, Saturday-morning-cartoon lunacy of a Fast and Furious movie or you’re not. Building from its humble roots as a 2001 street-racing Point Break riff to the gargantuan action tentpole it’s after a whopping ten movies (eleven if you count Hobbs & Shaw), the series has built quite the convoluted lore over the decades. There are dead characters who come back to life (Sung Kang‘s Han), living characters who can never come back because their actors are no longer with us (see: Paul Walker’s Brian), sworn enemies who join the familiar just one film later. It’s dudebro soap opera, fueled by nitrous oxide and every weird, bonkers thing the filmmakers can think to do with a car. But every road (even the 28-mile runway the crew race down at the end of 6) has to reach its end, and Fast X begins to tease the final miles of Dominic Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) adventures. And it’s a ludicrously good time for the faithful, even as the wheels threaten to come off with every new twist, cameo, or winking nod to the series’ complicated history and well-trod narrative rhythms. It’s the latter that provides X‘s basic plot framework: Flashing back to the thrilling safe-dragging climax of Fast Five (universally considered the point at which the series morphed into its current crowd-pleasing self), we learn that this triumphant moment for the series may have ushered in its eventual downfall. You see, the villain from the last one had a son, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), now awkwardly pasted into the proceedings as if he were there the whole time. Seeing Dom kill his dad has set him off on a decade-long campaign of revenge, and the chickens are finally coming home to roost. Luring Dom and his team into a trap, Dante sends them all scattered across the globe, as they alternatingly flee from Dante’s forces and a now-antagonistic Agency (the group that hired them for international spy stuff the last few movies; I told you this was convoluted) who’s tired of covering for a group of grease monkeys with car-based superpowers.  If that sounds like a lot to take in, you’d be right; Fast X is meant to be the first in a now three-part finale for the series. This means star-producer Diesel and Now You See Me director Louis Leterrier (taking the wheel from franchise stalwart Justin Lin, who left the series just a couple weeks into filming after some alleged beef with Diesel) pull out all the stops, and by that I mean all of them. Old characters return for quick cameos, even ones you didn’t care about in the first place (remember Scott Eastwood from number 8? He’s back too, kinda!); a bevy of new characters assist the gang in their various corners of the globe; villains from the last several movies find themselves teamed up with side members of the gang for their own journeys; and the car-based mayhem is bigger and blow-ey-up-ey-er than ever.  At any one point, there are four or five major subplots to cut between, which leaves Fast X feeling more than a little scattered. Some are better than others — John Cena, the film’s previous villain, returns as a wisecracking uncle in a cute little double-act with Dom’s young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), which is adorable as long as you forget the Jakob of Fast X is a completely different, lighter character than his glowering turn in F9. The rest are varying shades of place-setting: Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) plans a jailbreak from an Agency black site with the help of Agency turncoat Tess (Brie Larson) another previous villain, Cipher (Charlize Theron), and the rest of the Scooby Gang (Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Kang) go on the run to London, bickering and running into yet more previous villains meant to kick off further adventures in Fasts 11 and 12.  But the bloated roster of characters means very few of them get all that much to do — least of all Diesel, whose idea of an aging, wisened Dom just means a few more wrinkles in his brow and a quieter, more wistful utterance of “family.” And apart from a half-hearted throughline about Roman questioning his leadership abilities for the B-team, everyone else is just pieces on a chessboard, waiting for their moment to pop up, do their thing, and get out again. The sole (and vital) exception to this is Momoa, who’s having the absolute time of his life and wallpapers over much of the script’s weaknesses. It’s the first time a Furious villain actually seems like he’s having fun; with his skull rings, genderbending lavender blouses, and all-around peacocking attitude, Momoa’s Dante skips through this thing with all the chaotic glee of the Joker. (Ledger comparisons abound in other takes on this, but really, he’s more like Cesar Romero from the ’60s.) He cackles and grins maniacally through his shaggy goatee, and his verbal spars with the stone-faced Diesel almost feel like flirtation. Who knew that femme-coding one of the butchest action stars around would lead to such giddy results?  And yet, it’s hard not to feel like the franchise is losing its mojo in its final laps. Maybe that’s Lin’s absence; few directors, outside James Wan in Furious 7, have managed to recapture the high-gear joys of that glorious middle chapter in the franchise. As the stunts, the spectacle, and the family have all grown, so too have their ambitions, and the many plates they have to spin while still worshipping at the altar of Dominic Toretto. And here, especially as it revs up to a cliffhanger that will leave us all holding our breath until the next installment. It’s hard to gauge how well this will work in the grand scheme of things; that’ll have to wait till the whole trilogy is done. Until then, we’ve got to hope and pray that Diesel, Momoa, and the rest of the family get back in gear before the whole thing is done.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Even great, beloved TV shows and movie franchises can fall prey to the creative malaise of time. After a long run, new episodes or films can begin to feel like retreads of previous installments while even the most interesting characters grow stale. It happens all the time: Modern Family, Scrubs, The Office, Rocky, Die Hard, the list is endless. To combat this decline those in charge will often add a new character to freshen things up. But  the Cousin Oliver trope rarely stops the spiral into full blown mediocrity. That’s where it seems the Fast & Furious franchise is quickly headed after the tedious, mediocre  Fast X, a film that somehow thinks it’s a good idea to keep reminding you of its much better predecessors.  Fortunately it also stars the greatest Cousin Oliver in history, because Jason Momoa’s unhinged baddie is so good he almost saves a very flawed film in desperate need of much better script.  As its very first trailer revealed, Fast X begins with the most hilarious—and possibly best—retcon ever. Turns out the big bad of Fast Five had a son we didn’t know about. He’s a big, angry, vengeful, Joker-like sociopath/evil genius of a son who almost died chasing down his dad’s vault ten years ago. All of this is shown with an extended flashback to arguably the best scene in franchise history. And I do mean extended. It just goes on and on, a reminder that goes well past what anyone who would pay to see Fast X requires.  In the moment, the opening feels like a flex, as if the Fast & Furious knows it can get away with anything. That includes literally revisiting an old movie just because it wants to. Initially it works, too, because the whole premise is over-the-top and absurd in the best way. It’s the kind of wonderful dumb fun that has defined the latter half of the franchise and made it so successful. By the end of the movie, that flashback feels less like a fun flex and more like a warning. It’s retroactively a sign of the uninspired trip through memory lane the film delivers. Fast X thinks it’s rewarding longtime fans the way Avengers: Endgame did for MCU viewers. Instead it comes across like a legacy band performing the exact same greatest hits playlist its been using for 20 years. That’s not an indictment of the actors, but of the script. No one from the primary recurring cast is mailing in their performance. They’re all giving honest efforts since it’s clear they’re still having a blast making these movies together. The problem is they’re all doing the exact same things in the exact same ways we’ve seen a million times at this point. Nothing ever changes with them. Nor what happens to them. There stories are no longer fun because they’re familiar, their familiarity makes them trite and uninteresting.  Once more Roman and Tej argue like brothers as Ramsey laughs at them and Han is the coolest guy in the world with little to do. Meanwhile Letty must get back to her husband! You know, her only reason for existing in most of the films. And Dom, the philosopher king who is basically Confucius with a Dodge Charger? Well of course he’s super worried about losing his family! His family! But don’t worry! He’s still Superman without any kryptonite, a character who is now so boring and inevitable I found myself rooting for him to lose so something interesting would happen when he was onscreen. That’s far from the only time Fast X suffers from basic storytelling mistakes. The film is rife with them. Every person on the planet is suddenly really dumb. That includes the main cast, regular citizens, cops, and shadowy Agency figures. They’re impossibly clueless and don’t act like humans because the plot needs them to be stupid. But the failure to understand how to tell a story is best epitomized by one scene that made me think I briefly lost my mind. It forces a character to make a choice about whom to save. Only, we don’t know anything about one of the people in danger. We literally do not know who this person is or why we should care about them, so we don’t know why there’s much of a choice to make.  It’s only after the fact the film provides that necessary information, as though we’ll retroactively care about what just happened. It’s such a ludicrous sequence of events I might honestly believe director Louis Leterrier if he claims my theater aired the scenes out of order. The whole thing is a mess, which is a fitting way to describe most of the script which is often too stupid even for a Fast & Furious movie. And I say that as someone who loves the first nine! Seriously, I love every previous installment! (Yes! Really! All nine. No, not Hobbs & Shaw.)  The last film sent a car to space, but that was good stupid, the kind of thing we’ve come to love and expect from these movies. But that very fine line between “good stupid” and “stupid stupid” is crossed repeatedly in Fast X.  I know some won’t agree. Others will see little difference between this film and the last couple installments. But this movie also lacks the heart of those. Not from a lack of trying, but just because it never finds the special F&F sauce that made them both fun and lovable.  A big reason why is that the script doesn’t put the effort needed into making this feel like a new chapter in the Fast story. Instead it relies on a parade of both expected and unexpected cameos. Every few scenes it decides to revisit a much better previous installment, either with a rehashed location, action scene, or old character. Sometimes this works (really well even), often it doesn’t (at all). But combined, the whole thing feels like a collection of references and Easter eggs more like a cohesive story. That’s not to say the movie is a complete disaster. These movies now have a built-in high floor that prevents them from being unwatchable. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. And the action scenes that aren’t simply referencing previous ones are excellent in the way they always are in the Fast & Furios. But even those are disappointing if you watched the trailers. Good gravy they gave away the whole movie! That includes the final scene, which you’ll enjoy so much more if you don’t know it’s coming. Fast X has arguably the single most spoiler-y trailers ever.  In terms of its own merits this film’s real strength comes via its newcomers and big-name part-timers. The non-recurring cast is superb and adds freshness this stale movie so desperately needs. That begins with Charlize Theron’s Cipher, who is more interesting and dynamic than ever. Brie Larson’s mysterious Tess is also a much needed shot of fun and intrigue. As is Alan Ritchson’s Aimes, a larger than life figure who looks like he’s going to eat every other character if they look at him wrong. And Fast X also realizes that letting John Cena be a giant endearing goof is always a good idea. I loved all of them and without them this movie would be bad rather than okay. The real reason to see it, though, is the most important newcomer: Momoa. He gives the single most entertaining performance in Fast & Furious history. Forget chewing scenery. Forget even eating it. He’s ripping scenery down every time he’s on screen. Then he’s mashing it up, distilling it, and pouring it down everyone’s throat. He’s everything I wanted the rest of the film to be. Momoa is maniacal, flamboyant, charming, terrifying, hysterical, silly, and wildly entertaining. I’m not sure anyone has ever had more fun playing a character than he does as Dante Reyes. He’s so good it’s almost impossible this movie isn’t fla-out excellent based on his performance alone. (Note: I can’t speak for the queer community, but I’m buying stock in him becoming a queer icon. A lot of stock. Seeing the reaction to Dante is going to be way more fun than seeing the reaction to this film.) But by the movie’s bizarre and infuriating non-ending it’s clear even the best Cousin Oliver ever—a true Hollywood star operating at full power in all his glory—isn’t enough to save Fast X from itself. It’s a shadow of better movies. Worse is that we can’t help but notice that because it keeps reminding us of those better predecessors. All those callbacks and cameos also reminded me to keep checking my watch to see how much more of this movie I had to endure. And when it finally did end, for the first and only time since I started watching them, I thought it really is time for the Fast & Furious franchise to drive off into the sunset. ",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," “Ellos violan las leyes de la gravedad y hacen cosas inverosímiles”, comenta Aimes (Alan Richtson), uno de los nuevos personajes que se introduce a la saga. Este sujeto es el nuevo jefe de la Agencia y no tiene mucho cariño por el equipo de Dom. En este comentario hay una doble lectura. Por un lado, se asemeja a lo que fuimos escuchando por los detractores de estas películas a lo largo de más de dos décadas. Por otro lugar, hace uso de un recurso meta, de autoparodia, para reírse de sus inverosimilitudes. Segura de sí misma, Rápidos y Furiosos X (Fast X, 2023) es todo lo que sus seguidores estaban esperando. Bajo la dirección de Louis Leterrier (El transportador), la cinta comprende el comienzo de una nueva trilogía. Este universo que nos presentará será introductorio y, a la vez, a pura acción. Luego de lo acontecido en Rápidos y Furiosos 9 (F9, 2001), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) descansa con su familia y le enseña a conducir a su pequeño hijo. Pero, como todos sabemos, esa paz durará apenas unos minutos ya que un nuevo villano llegará para atormentarlos en pos de venganza. Como un espejo retrovisor, el nuevo largometraje mira al pasado. El gran acierto es que no lo hace como reciclaje, sino para forjar sus cimientos y darle un impulso emotivo. La historia se retrotrae a lo ocurrido en Brasil en Rápidos y furiosos: 5in control (Fast Five, 2011) en donde Dom y Brian (Paul Walker) se quedan con la bóveda del mafioso Hernán Reyes. Este es el puntapié principal para la presentación del nuevo villano, el hijo de este narcotraficante. Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) buscará vengar ese robo y el destino de su padre. ""Es muy sádico y es un poco pavo real... Este tipo tiene muchos problemas”, describió Momoa a su personaje. El actor de la serie Juego de tronos (Game of thrones) es un punto fuerte de la película al personificar uno de los mejores villanos que la franquicia nos regaló. El sadismo que maneja roza lo caricaturesco, pero no es grotesco. Con lúcidos pasos de comedia y cinismo, el intérprete está en su salsa y cada una de sus apariciones son atractivas. Además de Momoa y al ya mencionado Richtson, hay otras caras nuevas. Brie Larson como la hija del Sr. Don Nadie, Daniela Melchior (El Escuadrón Suicida) y Rita Moreno (Amor sin barreras), en la piel de la abuela de Dom, también hacen aquí sus primeras apariciones. Jason Statham, Michelle Rodríguez, Charlize Theron, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Scott Eastwood y John Cena, entre otros, vuelven para repetir sus papeles de las entregas anteriores. Ahora bien, este grupo de películas tiene un motivo por el cual sus seguidores están siempre a la expectativa. La acción inverosímil, la cual pregona que nada es imposible (y que ahora también la utiliza desde lo autorreferencial), la posiciona en un lugar difícil de emular. Sus persecuciones en autos, repletas de adrenalina, están siempre burlando los límites. La saga Rápidos y furiosos dejó hace un buen tiempo de ser una película de acción. La franquicia es única: monta un escenario real para ejecutar ideas de ciencia ficción donde no hay reglas (¡en Rápidos y Furiosos 9 fueron con un auto al espacio!). Eso, junto al sentimiento de “familia” que tan bien fue desarrollando (y del cual también se autoburla en esta nueva entrega), convergen un espectáculo a pura diversión para quienes están subidos al asiento y con el motor en marcha desde el 2001, año en el cual Rápido y Furioso (The Fast and the Furious) salió a la luz.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Whenever the newest chapter of the Toretto family saga isn't coasting off the past glories of Fast Five, it's desperately trying to be a superhero movie.  Anyone sitting down to watch Fast X is surely a fan of Fast Five… or at least, that's what the makers of the newest installment are counting on. The 2011 blockbuster still stands as the peak of this franchise, the one that turned things up a notch by uniting all the stars from the disparate first four Fast & Furious films into a globe-trotting Avengers-like super-team. The four sequels since then, alas, have gotten more than a little repetitive with their constant cyber-heists and celebrity cameos, so Fast X begins by trying to remind fans of past glories.
  The new film from director Louis Leterrier literally reuses footage from the climax of Fast Five, where Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and pals stole a bank vault by dragging it through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. This time, new character Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is clumsily inserted in the background. He's the son of Fast Five antagonist Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), you see, and was there the whole time! This is a cheap way to make a new villain seem menacing and meaningful. Though having Momoa glower and grimace through one of the high-octane highlights of 2010s action cinema is not quite as sacrilegious as Ghostbusters: Afterlife digging up the CGI ghost of Harold Ramis, it's definitely annoying.
  It would be one thing if Fast Five director Justin Lin were at the helm, as he was originally supposed to be after returning to the franchise for 2021's F9, but Lin mysteriously dropped out as director of Fast X less than a week into filming. That makes the recycled footage feel a bit too much like stealing valor by ripping off the work of a master action filmmaker to make this less-stellar successor seem more important.
  In any case, the plot of Fast X (out this weekend) follows Dante's revenge scheme against Dom for killing his father. This isn't ""eye for an eye,"" though; Dante believes that he should ""never accept death when suffering is owed."" So rather than kill Dom, Dante seeks to hurt him by targeting his beloved family that you've heard so much about. First introduced in 2017's The Fate of the Furious, Dom's son Brian Marcos has grown from a baby into a young teenager (Leo Abelo Perry) who's inherited his dad's love of cars. Naturally, he is Dante's primary target.
  Momoa plays Dante like a flamboyant Disney villain, which is a cute change of pace but fits uneasily in the world of the movie. No question this franchise is silly — remember when Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) went to space in the last one? — but having one character constantly ridiculing the others and making mockery of everything feels maybe a little too on-the-nose.
  After that opening retcon flashback, Fast X employs another tired cliche to artificially inflate Dante's menace. Within minutes, the franchise's former top villain Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up at Dom's door, beaten and bloodied, to moan about how Dante is ""the devil"" and way worse than she ever was. Okay.
  Fast Five's main competitor for ""best 2010s action film centered on cars"" was Mad Max: Fury Road, so it made sense to slot that movie's star into this franchise starting with The Fate of the Furious. Yet it's alarming how little they've utilized the greatest action star of our time. After two movies of mostly sitting around in glass boxes and performing hand-wavey feats of ""hacking,"" Theron finally gets a couple Atomic Blonde-worthy fistfights in Fast X, but the actress who played Imperator Furiosa still hasn't been allowed to drive a car. What's that about?
  Dante isn't the only new character introduced for Fast X, either. Reacher star Alan Ritchson arrives as Aimes, who has taken over the spy agency once led by Kurt Russell's Mr. Nobody but is a lot less friendly to Dom and pals than his former boss. Brie Larson, meanwhile, shows up as Mr. Nobody's daughter Tess, who does want to help the Toretto crew. With so many faces new and old squeezed into one 142-minute runtime — we should also mention that another former villain, Jakob Toretto (John Cena), is back in a more heroic role — it's hard to get a handle on who exactly Tess is or why we should care about her. There sure are a lot of references to the absent Mr. Nobody, though.
  It doesn't help that one of Tess' introductory scenes is set in a biker bar, which feels a little too much like a similar scene from Captain Marvel. In fact, whenever Fast X isn't trying to coast off the highs of Fast Five, it's desperately trying to be a superhero movie. Dom spends most of the movie trying to save lives, which is always nice, but at one point he literally deflects a hail of bullets with a car door like it's Captain America's shield.
  Several moments are so reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies that they feel intentional. Fast X's first action setpiece involves Dom trying to save a city from a gigantic bomb like the one that threatens Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises. When one character pleads ""you've done everything you could,"" Dom even replies ""not everything."" You can practically hear Christian Bale's voice completing the quote with ""...not yet."" Later, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tries to break out of an underground prison fortress like she's scaling Bane's pit. It's these seemingly serious stakes that sit oddly alongside Momoa's over-the-top campiness. Are we supposed to feel threatened, or is it all just in good fun? Why so serious, Dom?

"May 17, 2023"," There’s something heart-warming about the sheer ridiculousness of the Fast & Furious franchise, which has evolved to exist outside the laws of physics and general reality. Its well-established characters leap cars across skyscrapers, go to outer space and single-handedly thwart bombs from destroying the Vatican—all while staying true to their family. If you have no idea what’s going on in a given film, now packed with cameos and long-lost relatives, that’s okay: You’re not here for the story. You’re here because the action is good, the dialogue is entertaining and these high-budget blockbusters bring audiences together in a way that can’t be underestimated.  FAST X ★★★1/2 (3.5/4 stars)

Running time: 105 mins. The most recent edition to the franchise, Fast X, continues to rev up all of these elements. The movie, helmed by Louis Leterrier, who nails the tone, brings us back to Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his LA crew. Once street racers, the gang now works for the Agency, a covert organization that Dom has been entangled with for several movies. Although they seem to have settled into a reasonably happy life, with Dom contentedly raising his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) alongside his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), a former foe quickly resurfaces.  The script, written by Dan Mazeau and previous Fast saga director Justin Lin, retcons the events of Fast Five, which saw Dom and Brian heist $100 million from drug lord Hernan Reyes in Rio. The opening sequence of Fast X revisits the climatic theft, inserting new characters and scenes to allow Hernan’s son Dante (Jason Momoa) to be involved in the chase. Dante almost dies after plummeting off the bridge and it’s only now, years later, that he’s emerged to seek revenge on Dom. He’s going to make Dom suffer, he says, because death would be too easy.  After Dante ensnares the crew into a high-speed chase through the streets of Rome (sorry about any summer vacation plans, Rome is destroyed now), everyone is forced to go on the run. Letty is captured by the Agency and taken to a black site prison, while Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) make their way to London in search of help. Back home in LA, Dom’s son is in danger, so he enlists Jakob (John Cena) to get him to safety. Meanwhile, there’s trouble in the Agency. A beefy guy named Aimes (Alan Ritchson) is running things now and he believes Dom’s a criminal despite the best efforts of Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of Mr. Nobody. There are also sub-plots with Cipher (Charlize Theron) and a Brazilian street racer named Isabel (Daniela Melchior), who—you guessed it—has ties to Dom’s past.  None of that really matters, though. The highlight of Fast X is not the plot, which requires a cheat sheet to follow. It’s the action, which Leterrier handles with real flair. The car chases are exciting, of course, especially when they defy physics and gravity. Some moments are so ludicrous that you can’t help but laugh. Why wouldn’t a car be able to drive out of a flying airplane directly onto a highway without crashing? The fight scenes, which are doled out equally between the male and female characters to the film’s credit, are the best of the franchise so far. Rodriguez and Theron, in particular, hurl themselves into a knock-down fight that could propel its own movie.  And then there’s Momoa, the MVP of Fast X. Momoa transforms Dante, who could have been a rote villain, into an ostentatious psychopath with real motivation. The character, his hair tied up in scrunchies, is smart and undeterred but he also has a quippy, whimsical side that Momoa leans into with delight. It’s a relief, especially against Diesel, an actor who could stand to take things a little less seriously. By the end you’re almost rooting for Dante because he’s not grimacing and talking about family all the time. And since Fast X ends on a massive cliffhanger, it looks like we may have more Dante in our future. It would be easy to dismiss Fast X as another disposable sequel. And in some ways, it is. But for the past few movies, the producers and filmmakers have really tapped into what makes this franchise work. It’s that sense of ridiculousness that makes these movies so compelling. Fast X is an outlandish movie. Literally nothing in this movie could really happen, but isn’t that why we watch films in the first place? The imagined world of the Fast & Furious saga is exciting and that’s enough. Are there too many characters now? Yes. Do you always know what’s going on? No. But you’ll laugh, you’ll cheer and you’ll feel, for a few hours, like part of a family. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"May 17, 2023"," To call Fast X one of the most ludicrous action films ever made would be a borderline tautology for any instalment in the Fast and Furious franchise. But this one takes the cake. From its inception in 2001, the series has long since devolved from hot-rod street races into a kind of globe-trotting demolition derby, doing for explosive pile-ups on stretches of highway what Twister did for tornadoes. This time, all bets are off in terms of plausibility. Characters return and arbitrarily switch sides, introduce themselves out of nowhere as the peeved relations of major baddies who died 10 years ago, or try rolling a spherical megaton bomb into the Vatican, just for the hell of it. The series pursues no logic except what’s new, who’s available, and how to pack out the multiplex screens. In recent instalments, there’s been a danger of bloated earnestness, nicely curbed by the lunacy this time. Anyone who misses the peak shenanigans of the nifty Fast Five (2011), when a bank vault was dragged through the streets of Rio, will be reminded of that heist by a recapping prologue – a good way to show where the bar was set, then start leaping over it left and right. Who knew that Jason Momoa’s character, a drug lord’s deranged scion named Dante Reyes, was present on the scene, and has therefore been plotting revenge for the past decade? No one, until they lined him up last year. By now, we know exactly what all the series’ stalwarts have to give. When Dwayne Johnson came in, before a head-clonking feud with Vin Diesel soured things, they called him “franchise Viagra”.  Well, they just increased the dose. Momoa is what these films have been missing forever: a flamboyant supervillain and all-round chaos merchant, who likes to perch on the tallest landmarks and dial in carnage. He giggles and whoops, wears his hair in double man buns, and paints the toenails of the dead. Will it be a giant pearl necklace today, or shark’s teeth on a string? Metallic snakeskin or mauve silk? He’s basically Dennis Hopper in Speed meets Liberace. How the Fast series would now avoid grinding to a total halt without him is anyone’s guess. In between Dante’s attempts to blow stuff up in a range of exotic locations, the film plays spin the bottle, arranging knock-down fights between random characters – Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodriguez in a hi-tech prison, Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson in London’s tattiest internet café. It’s hard to see what Brie Larson in pantsuits (turns out, she’s Kurt Russell’s daughter) adds to the party, or why we need Rita Moreno and Helen Mirren as indomitable matriarchs. But Louis (Now You See Me) Leterrier is not a director to be daunted by maximalism or a stacked ensemble. If there’s an opportunity to smash helicopters together while flinging Diesel’s 8-year-old son back and forth between duelling drivers, Leterrier will grab it. His largesse is supremely trashy, and just what the doctor ordered.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Street racing has probably been around long before there were actual streets.  Centuries ago there were horse races, then illegal car races and now they have evolved into events all over the world with costly sports cars equipped with state-of-the-art technology.  Illegal street racing has also been depicted in movies since the 1950s if not earlier and even musicals, like Grease, had street racing scenes incorporated into their films.  In 2001, a movie centered on fast cars and street racing premiered in theaters.  That movie, titled The Fast and The Furious, created a culture and a legacy that has so far spanned 22 years and ten feature films.  Number eleven, Fast X, hits theaters worldwide this week. As with every Fast film, it is all about family, BBQs, and getting in and out of trouble while driving souped-up sports cars (and the occasional tank).  This time though it is not only about the Toretto family.  This time it is about a psychopath who blames his father's death ten years earlier on Dom (Vin Diesel; Guardians of the Galaxy 3) and his plot to torture and kill everyone associated with Dominic Toretto.  The psychopath is Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa; Aquaman) who watched his father die on a bridge in Rio de Janeiro while Dom and associates drove away with Dante's family fortune. Dante is maniacal, unhinged, willing to use everyone and everything without remorse to obtain his end result, and is rather flamboyant and ""over the top"" personality-wise. It is unsurprising that the budget for this film is estimated at over $300 million because cast salaries alone must have cost a small fortune.  The list of actors in this movie - from the main characters to the nostalgic cameos - is a list of who's who in Hollywood. The main cast is all there including Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez (Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Jordana Brewster (The Faculty), Tyrese Gibson (Transformers), and Ludacris (Crash). Recurring guest actors also join the team in cameos including Helen Mirren (The Queen), Jason Statham (The Meg), and Charlize Theron (Atomic Blonde) and some new faces get some screen time including Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Rita Moreno (West Side Story) and Scott Eastwood (Suicide Squad).  With all this talent it is difficult to imagine one actor standing out head and shoulders above everyone else but Momoa accomplishes that task and does it extremely well.  It isn't easy to see Momoa playing such an evil psychopath and when he was announced as part of the cast, there were already mixed reviews of the IDEA of him portraying Dante Reyes. However, he proves the naysayers wrong from the beginning with his characterization of this villain reminding one of Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. Momoa's Dante is ruthless, unapologetic, seemingly brilliant in a criminally insane kind of way yet free-spirited and humorous. The Juxtaposition is startling but he somehow makes it work. Dante is memorable for both his cruelty and his infectious smile and personality. While Fast X requires the audience to suspend belief as vehicles defy the laws of gravity, it is 150% better than Fast 9's ""launch into outer space"".  There are still some groan-worthy/eye-rolling moments throughout the film but the direction is better, the script is better, and the stunts are better than its most recent predecessor, which, let's face it, damn near killed the entire franchise. I won't reveal any spoilers (but if you have read anything online, you already know them) but at my screening the audience gasped, hooted, and hollered as planes crashed, submarines surfaced and masks were removed as the movie ended.  We all know The Fast and The Furious franchise isn't Shakespeare but it is heart-pounding fun and if Fast X is any indication of what is still to come then you better buckle up and hang on for what is certain to be a wild ride.

"May 17, 2023"," Vin Diesel can never fail me with his Family. Time and again for the last twenty-two years, with all the people coming and going, and as the stakes and feats get larger and larger, I’m still riding. My favorite modern action Franchise for sure, we are back again at the beginning of the end – FAST X. From whatever you might hear, this is the first of two movies to end things or the first of the trilogy to end things. FAST X begins with scenes from Fast Five connecting the new villain Dante to the villain of that film Herman Reyes, his father, and the fate of that big bad from the film of twelve years ago. Ten years later, Dom and Letty are still raising Little Brian, who’s now older, clearly around second or third-grader age, when they are visited by Cipher, who tells them they are all under attack. With Dante setting up The Family with a fake mission from the secret Agency they’ve worked with since Furious 7 puts The Family on the wrong side of the law again and on the run. Dante is on a mission to make Dom suffer for his part in his father’s death and for taking of his Family’s fortune. It’s scorched earth for him as Dom does whatever he can to save his Family from the newest, more dangerous threat. This film is completely over the top and sometimes has vastly different tones. Vin Diesel’s Dom is just as consistent as he’s been in the last few entries. He was completely sincere in his line delivery and performance. His storyline is the most franchise classic style of the storylines in the film. His issues with Dante, played by the gregarious Jason Mamoa, takes thing back to an earlier feel – Brazil, the setting of what is the best entry in the franchise. In this film, Momoa is just having fun with this villain; he’s over the top and chews up the scenery on purpose. There are times it felt like he’s playing a supervillain; that was a modern style of a Batman ’66 episode. The B-plot of Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang), as they try to get to a rendezvous point, is where they have a lot of comedic team action that doesn’t always work and at times feels a bit too long but is very comfortable with seeing our favorites have an adventure. Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty does get to do some good action fights and stunt driving. Her fight that, which you see a piece of in the trailers with Charlize Theron’s Cipher, was terrific and brutal. It feels like an outlier in just how brutal it is between two women on screen. Well paced, shot, and was clear to follow; it was good to see them both get to go a little ham on the fights. Speaking of Theron, she really gets to show some of that Atomic Blonde ability in this one. After just being the big bad in this one, she gets down and dirty and really wish she was in more films doing this level of fighting and action. John Cena is back in this as a former bad guy and prodigal brother Jacob Torretto. His adventure is with Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), who he needs to take care of to get to a meeting point, and here we get all that Cena charm and how good he is with kids. This is the make-a-wish John Cena on the screen where a kid is having the best road trip ever with this guy. Flying spy planes and riding a rocket shooting cars like something you’d see in Twisted Metal. Those are some of the most fun comedy scenes in the movie. Now I know for many, this film franchise has gone too far in what they can do with their cars and surviving events, but to me, at this point, it’s part of the charm. The comparison to superheroes is an apt one even though, for most, it’s missing the colorful outfits and “superpowers,” yet there really isn’t much difference between these folks and characters like Batman, Green Arrow, or Hawkeye. Super adept people, excellence at a high level to the point of looking like magic, but it also works within the world of the film. It’s one they now reference in the films at how amazing some of the things they do are. I’ve always told people that these films also work like a Dungeons and Dragon campaign, and at this point, all the characters are at such a high level that it’s like cheating. That and Dom always rolls a twenty. So go in and sit back and enjoy this bombastic and totally awe-inspiring action movie.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," The ""Fast and Furious"" series completely breaks down with the supersized, brain-dead ""Fast X,"" a loud, clunky, interminable exercise in engine revving and wheel spinning. The cast and plot of this monstrosity are so ungainly that even with several continents worth of action and a dozen big names — four of whom are Academy Award-winning actresses! — it never locates anything resembling a center, or comes close to embodying the idea of ""family"" around which the series is based. For a supposed high-performance sports car, ""Fast X"" runs like a broken-down jalopy. Even by the loose standard of the ""Fast"" films, a series which hit its stride with ""Fasts"" 5-7 and has been slowing down ever since, ""Fast X"" is a victim of its own bloat and lack of grounding. And this is a series whose last chapter, 2021's ""F9,"" notably saw Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson driving a car in outer space. The writing is on the wall from the very first scene, which tosses back the action to 2011's series rebooter ""Fast Five,"" and that film's memorable vault heist through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. That scene isn't recreated, it's just replayed, with new bad guy Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa, who we'll get to in a minute) retconned into the proceedings. Dante is the son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), ""Fast Five's"" drug lord baddie, and Hernan's death at the hands of Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and his gang leaves Dante with a score to settle, even though it takes him, oh, a dozen years to act on it. Until Dante starts mucking around, Dom and crew — there's Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Han (Sung Kang) and even Dom's grandmother (Rita Moreno) — are enjoying one of the Toretto fam's signature backyard barbecues, where the Coronas flow like unleaded gasoline. But trouble arrives when Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up at Toretto's doorstep, bruised and battered, after having been paid a visit by a very angry Dante. It seems Dante has a plan for Dom and crew, which involves blowing up Rome with a cartoon-sized bomb that rolls around the streets of the city like a 10-foot pinball. How does Dom's crew plan to stop it? With cars, of course. What franchise do you think this is? The action then bounces to London, over to Portugal, down to Rio and even to Antarctica, as Brie Larson is folded into the story as the daughter of rogue agent Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell, not on screen) and Helen Mirren makes a brief appearance as the mother of Deckard (Jason Statham, who does make an appearance). The cast is as scattered as the script, which is constantly introducing or reintroducing characters, and even Pete Davidson shows up in a scene involving, you guessed it, weed. It's a joyless slog of explosions, wisecracks and even sci-fi plot elements, with nothing to gravitate toward or hold onto. Director Louis Leterrier (the ""Transporter"" films) came on after Justin Lin left the director's chair (Lin is still credited as one of three contributing writers), and the behind-the-scenes tumult is evident on screen, and can be read in Diesel's blanker-than-usual looking expressions. As the axis of the ""Fast"" universe, he's never looked so lost. Back to Momoa: His Dante is described as the Devil himself but he's more like Heath Ledger's Joker filtered through Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow and ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure's"" Francis Buxton, as styled by Tyler Durden. (If that doesn't make any sense, neither does the performance.) Momoa plays him loudly and garishly but without any consistency or sense of creating a character, he's all flamboyance and grandstanding and ""look at what I'm doing!"" energy, which isn't as subversive or transgressive as he'd like to think it is. He's not serving the movie but he looks like he's at least having fun, which puts him on a short list among the cast. John Cena, returning from ""F9,"" is put to better use, as he's placed in protector mode, tasked with keeping Dom's kid Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) safe while Daddy's out blowing stuff up in cars. Cena, too, is on his own planet in his own movie, making a kid-friendly action comedy, but his scenes work, which stands out since so little else in ""Fast X"" does. Ten entries is obviously rare air for a series, and no one is expecting a tight character study at this point in the ""Fast"" experience. But the practical stunt work and clean visual effects that marked the series' best entries and moments has been left in the dust, replaced by pure absurdity and poorly rendered visuals that whoosh over the screen in a blur of fake-looking video game-style graphics. All things considered, the ""Friday the 13th"" series was in better shape when it hit ""Jason X."" (""Fast,"" notably, got to outer space one entry before ""Friday"" did.) The ""Fast"" saga has hit its share of bumps over the last 22 years — 2001's original ""The Fast and the Furious"" was by no means a masterwork, let's remember — but ""Fast X"" feels like the end of the road for the series. Of course it ends on a cliffhanger, which means it will live to race another day, but this one's tough to come back from. It's time to hang up the car keys for good.",NEGATIVE

"May 17, 2023"," The time has finally arrived, folks–the tenth film in the Fast & Furious franchise is upon us (insert Paul Rudd, ‘Who would have thought? Not me.’ GIF here). With 10 films spanning two decades that include many cars, racing, explosions, absurdity, and of course, family, Fast X aims to be one of the fan-favourites in the franchise. Much like its predecessors, Fast X begins with a flashback in Rio de Janeiro, followed by some stunt driving as Dom (Vin Diesel) teaches his son, Brian, a.k.a. Little B (Leo Abelo Perry), how to drive in an empty lot. After a heartfelt father-son moment, the pair had back home, where they are greeted by Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sung Kang), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) for a family barbecue. Here, audiences are introduced to Dom and Mia’s abuela (Rita Moreno), who gives an impassioned speech about–you guessed it–family. Of course, as most of the films in this franchise go, the bliss is short-lived as a highly unexpected guest shows up at Dom’s doorstep in the middle of the night. Cipher (Charlize Theron) is the last person Dom and Letty are prepared to see, but broken and battered, she comes with a warning. A new heavy hitter, Dante (Jason Momoa), is coming for Dom and his family. Dom and Letty must work with Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) to stop Dante’s dastardly plans. As usual, mayhem ensues, leading Dom and the team to trek across the globe to Rome, London, Portugal, and the familiar stomping grounds of Rio de Janeiro to stop Dante – whatever it takes. Directed by Louis Leterrier, Fast X is a step up from Fast 9. However, that’s not saying much. By no means is Leterrier a stranger to action-heavy flicks, his past directorial credits including films such as Transporter 2, The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans. Admittedly, these films are not “great,” but the expectations for what is to be expected from a Fast movie are clear. Leterrier fails to deliver. While there is plenty of action in Fast X, most are repetitive because we’ve seen similar sequences in past films. Of course, it’s one thing to pay homage to past scenes; it’s another to recycle them entirely or not bring anything new to the table. Sure, the last movie had that outlandish space moment, but at least it was an attempt at something new for the franchise. Ultimately, Leterrier’s efforts do not compare to those of Justin Lin and James Wan, who we can largely credit for the series’ considerably more creative, memorable, and absurd action. That said, 10 movies in, and you should know what to expect from the mildly entertaining but sometimes lazy script and cast of characters. As per usual, the banter between Bridges and Gibson as Tej and Roman, respectively, gave viewers some of the film’s best comedic performances and moments. The more of these films we get, the less invested I am in Diesel’s Dom and his story. It is always the same performance, with Dom’s character dealing with similar inconveniences and danger. Nothing has changed, and the lack of variety in the script is something that often took me out of the film.  The film’s saving grace comes in the form of its villains. Theron’s Cipher has been a thorn in the Fast family’s side for the past few movies, and it’s no different in Fast X. While she doesn’t play as big a part this time, any scene she’s in is elevated exponentially. Cipher isn’t in the film as much for an excellent reason: to make way for a new villain in Momoa’s Dante. Dante is reckless, bold, and endlessly hilarious. He’s one of those villains you love to hate, and Momoa gives an excellent performance in Fast X. Despite being the villain, you find yourself quietly rooting for Dante as Momoa’s charisma and the fact that he seems to be having the most fun out of anyone on-screen makes the character all the more engaging. Momoa is the MVP of Fast X.  All-in-all, Fast X is a fun enough romp if you look past the continuously clunky script and the cringe-worthy dialogue that has become a trademark for Diesel’s Dom. The fight scenes are great (look out for the one with Jason Statham’s Shaw), while the action sequences are repetitive but cool. The icing on this messy cake is the villains. If you’re a genuine fan of the franchise, you’ll be more than happy with this film; if you’re not, it’s still a fun and mindless time to enjoy watching something new in theatres.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Fans and critics may disagree over when exactly the “Fast & Furious” franchise jumped the shark, but there is only one correct answer: When the Pontiac Fiero went into space. Weightless and violating every physical law, the floating car — tasked with bumping a satellite in the ninth installment — was the very symbol of how bloated and crazed the once-plucky series had become. There really was no way down after that. And yet we have come to 10, part of a planned series of films finally saying goodbye. “Fast X” is, thankfully, shackled to Earth’s gravity — sometimes tenuously, it must be said — but it has become almost camp, as if it breathed in too much of its own fumes. “Fast X” reaches into the fifth movie — 2011’s “Fast Five” — for the seeds to tell a new story. In a memorable moment five movies ago, Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto wrecked a bad guy and his team on a bridge in Rio de Janeiro. Little did we know then, but that bad guy had a son who survived and now, years later, vows vengeance. That’s it. That’s the plot. That said, “Fast X” is monstrously silly and stupidly entertaining — just Wile E. Coyote stuff, ridiculous stunts employing insane G-forces and everything seemingly on fire. There are elements of “Mission: Impossible,” 007 and “John Wick,” as if all the action franchises were somehow merging. But here’s a warning: It careens to an end without a payoff, a more dangerous stunt than any in the movies themselves.  The film would not be near enough as fun without Jason Momoa, who plays the bad guy’s son as a full-on flamboyant psycho, licking a knife clean after killing someone with it and painting the toenails of a dead victim as he displays the corpse in a demented garden party. “Never accept death when suffering is owed,” he says. He is half Joaquin Phoenix from “The Joker” and half Jack Sparrow from “Pirates of the Caribbean.” Momoa has a penchant for planning explosions and then standing on a high spot and throwing his arms wide like Christ the Redeemer as the blast wave hits. The film sags as soon as he’s not in it. Momoa is part of the franchise’s familiar tactic of stacking ever more stars with not enough to do — this time we also welcome Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior and Rita Moreno. There’s even a Pete Davidson cameo. That’s on top of regulars Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood and Helen Mirren, whose attempt once again at a working-class accent is comical. This is a clown car of talent. The poster for the film includes 14 characters, like an Avengers movie. At the center is the always-sleeveless Diesel, who keeps getting exposed as a truly terrible actor, one who evidently only attended the Brooding 101 seminar in drama school. The filmmakers usually just prop him up in front of a wall of family photos and he stares at them intently. “I only care about protecting the people that I love,” he will growl.  Family — as fans of the franchise know well — is always central, or rather, a gothic zero-sum notion of blood’s bond explained with soap opera dialogue. Toretto must protect family no matter the cost (but apparently OK with leaving his 8-year-old son in someone else’s care as he drag races in Rio). “You know what your problem is?” teases Momoa. “Family. You can’t save them all.” New director Louis Leterrier — from a screenplay by veteran Justin Lin and newcomers Zach Dean and Dan Mazeau — take us from Los Angeles to Antarctica, threatening much of Rome with a 20 kiloton bomb along the way and ending the movie at the side of a dam in Portugal in a cliffhanger. Stick around for the credits and even more mega-stars are promised for the next installment.  What you get this time are two brutal hand-to-hand fights, a car smashing two helicopters and rush hour traffic, car bombs, remote-controlled cars (big and small), vehicles that leap into the sky like salmon and a plane that drops a souped-up racer from its belly onto the highway. Taking material from “Fast Five” means the delicate task of returning to Paul Walker, the franchise veteran who died in 2013. Old footage of Walker does appear in “Fast X” as the movie recreates events on that Rio bridge. It is handled respectfully and coolly. In a nice touch, Walker’s daughter, Meadow, has a cameo as a flight attendant. With a foot in the past, one in the future and one on the gas, “Fast X” is pure popcorn lunacy. Was that too many feet? Oh, excuse us, you wanted logic?  “Fast X,” a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material. Running time: 134 minutes. Three stars out of four.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," The Fast and Furious 10 release date is here, with Vin Diesel back for more crashes, punches, and gunfights. This is what the best action movies are made of. Blockbusters don’t come much more thrilling than this. It’s a punch-the-air juggernaut of silliness, which sets the franchise up for a nitrous burst of a finale. Two years ago, the Fast and Furious movies went to space. It felt like a logical conclusion for the franchise and something that had become such a meme that it basically had to get it out of its system. The best movies in this series had done everything possible on four wheels, so the only option was to strap a rocket to those wheels and send them into orbit. To be honest, it was very disappointing.
 Thankfully, having conquered the final frontier, Fast and Furious 10 changes tack and, as a result, the new movie feels a lot less desperate. In fact, this might be the tightest the franchise has grasped the laws of physics in a decade. I mean, there’s still a muscle car reversing out the back of a plane and an enormous explosive device bouncing through the streets of Rome like a cross between a Slinky and the boulder from Indiana Jones, but these things are relative.
 This isn’t a franchise trying to top itself for scale anymore, and it’s all the more healthy and inventive for it. With the focus away from looking to the stars and back on terra firma, it’s the best Fast and Furious movie in a long time.
 Part of that comes down to its narrative simplicity. The most recent outings have sent the Fast and Furious cast hunting for all manner of baffling tech MacGuffins, in lieu of any real character depth. Fast 9 had the team hunting for two halves of a weapon, as well as a key to launch the weapon — a key that was actually a woman. You can understand why people have trouble keeping up.
 But there’s none of that in Fast X. The action begins when Charlize Theron’s malevolent hacker Cipher turns up at Dom Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) house. Given that Dom still wants to kill her to avenge the mother of his child, that’s a strange move.
 However, Cipher is badly beaten and says she has “met the devil” in the shape of Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes. See, Dom killed Dante’s father at the end of Fast Five, and that has made Dante so angry that he wants to systematically tear our hero’s life apart by targeting his family, both biological and chosen.
 That’s right; more than ever before, it’s about family. Dom’s obsession with the word seems to have infected the world around him, with several supporting characters earnestly referring to Dom’s crew as his family as if it’s not a ridiculous thing to say.
 It’s a great example of the beautiful way in which Fast X uses its straight-faced tone as a cudgel, battering the audience into comedic submission and almost daring you to take it seriously, even for a second. No one on screen is laughing, and that just makes it funnier. To steal some social media parlance, they understood the assignment.
 It helps that incoming director Louis Leterrier, who reportedly rewrote much of the script while flying to the set, has decided to focus things squarely on Dom. The increasingly enormous ensemble cast gets relatively little to do, with the yin and yang face-off between Diesel and Momoa at the center of everything. They’re the two rampaging ids whose feud pulls in everyone around them, with bodies piling up in their wake.
 Momoa waltzes off with the whole thing, turning in one of the best movie villains in the history of the franchise and delivering delirious camp – smiling through punch-ups, painting the fingernails of corpses, and greeting his nemesis with a curtsey. But he’s also utterly ruthless and unpredictable, so his comic shtick never undercuts the level of threat he poses to everyone on screen, however fleeting their appearances.
 After all, we’ve spent decades with the best Fast and Furious characters, so they’re able to shine even with reduced roles. Tyrese Gibson is a real highlight this time around, and John Cena relishes the opportunity to ditch his super-serious villain act and embrace the goofy side we’ve seen in his comedic roles. At one stage, he’s watching a Minions movie for reasons that are never made clear, and a crunching fight scene drops in a perfect easter egg for WWE fans.
 The newbies, sadly, are a little wasted. Rita Moreno gets just a single monologue and Brie Larson, in particular, is mostly relegated to swaggering into each of her scenes wearing a different (and instantly iconic) look. Her costume team played a blinder, but she herself is mostly muscled out of the movie — and that’s a real shame because she seems to be having fun as the daughter of Mr Nobody.
 Of course, these are first and foremost some of the best action movies that Hollywood has to offer, and Leterrier’s skill set lends itself perfectly to the job. The hand-to-hand combat is thrilling and nasty, while they’re still finding different ways to turn a freeway car chase into something utterly unique.
 There’s still oodles of CGI, naturally, but this definitely feels more practical than other new movies in the franchise. Every somersaulting cop car and felled helicopter feels lived-in and real, which gives the over-cranked action a sense of stakes – even though Dom’s still saving lives by catching people on the rock-hard hood of his car.
 The aforementioned Rome sequence is utterly batshit, while the fiery climax finds time to blow up just about everything while leaving us on a big old cliffhanger for the next lap in Fast and Furious 11.
 And that’s certainly worth noting. This is very much the first chapter of a story we now know will take two more movies to complete. But, freed from the restrictions of having to tell a stand-alone tale, Fast X simply relaxes into something completely ecstatic and joyful. It slams the gas pedal to the floor, puts the Corona on ice, and drives off into the completely unpredictable unknown. We have no idea what will come next, but this is one family reunion we can’t wait to attend.

"May 17, 2023"," After years of increasingly wayward sequels and spinoffs, F9 got the Fast and Furious franchise back on solid asphalt with a renewed focus on the character dynamics of its increasingly sprawling cast and much-improved action direction from Justin Lin. Lin’s welcome return to the series signaled hopes of a strong finish for this bafflingly huge property that were swiftly dashed when he departed during production of this sequel. Worse still, Fast X was entrusted to Louis Leterrier, an undistinguished hack whose anonymous filmmaking hinted at a likely backslide for the franchise. Surprisingly, Fast X emerges as not only Leterrier’s best film but one of the most enjoyable entries in the entire series. A great deal of this can be attributed to the fact that this film, to an extent heretofore unseen, acknowledges and embraces just how absurd this franchise is. Repeated references are made to the fact that no one ever seems to die in this universe, that one-time petty thieves are now international spy assets, and that the assembled family of blood relatives, friends, allies and former enemies under the aegis of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has grown to a population roughly equivalent to Luxembourg’s. Even when the plot engages in the usual terroristic mayhem and vehicular combat, the tone is consistently goofy in its foregrounding of lunacy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the performance of Jason Momoa as incoming villain Dante Reyes, the son of the Brazilian drug lord killed at the end of Fast Five. Though Dante is willing to level entire cities to exact revenge on Dom and his crew, Momoa plays the man like he’s the first Fast and Furious villain with advance knowledge that he’ll likely end up a member of La Familia someday. Dressed like a disgraced Las Vegas magician, Dante hoots and cackles, lapses into ironic fannishness in their face-to-face confrontations, and regularly throws off the cadence of a line delivery with a sudden flourish of high-pitched mania that would make Nicolas Cage proud. Dante is such a hilariously grotesque maniac that in one scene he even chats to two gruesomely butchered and re-stitched henchman in what looks like a tribute to Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built. Dante’s over-the-top intensity translates to the action, which somehow keeps finding new and baffling ways to fight against formidably armed enemies with nothing more than cars. The relentless pacing of the sequences here sometimes threatens to lapse into pure incomprehension, but there’s just enough spatial coherence to thread together, say, Dom’s crew bouncing around a giant bomb rolling through Rome or a war of wills between a Dodge Charger and an attack helicopter. Every action sequence starts at an outlandish level and escalates rapidly, the deafening roar of turbocharged engines drowning out the brain’s objections to basic violations of physics. As this unwieldy, baffling franchise enters into its final instalments, Fast X positions it to go out on the goofiest note possible. Vin Diesel and his family kick it up a gear as they face off against old faces in Justin Lin's return to the high octane franchise.

"May 17, 2023"," The only deceptive thing about the Fast and Furious movies is that the people behind them pretend they’re still movies about cars. Don’t let the talk about torque and fuel-injection systems fool you: This series shifted into a different gear a long time ago. Specifically, it pivoted in 2011 with Fast Five, the movie that made Fast and Furious the hybrid superhero/superspy/super-heist franchise it is today. Since then, what was once a fresh (and, honestly, pretty funny) pivot has spun its wheels into the dirt. Which brings us to Fast X.  The villain in this latest chapter of the saga is Dante Reyes (once and future Aquaman Jason Momoa), the son of the Brazilian drug-dealer antagonist from Fast Five. Fast X opens with recycled footage from Fast Five showing Dante’s dad Hernan (Joaquim de Almeida) meeting his end in that film’s climactic bank heist/car chase. It’s a telling choice, because it reveals where the current incarnation of the series really began. It also reminds longtime fans what these movies used to be about — the car chase at the end of Fast Five is awesome, better than anything in Fast X — and what they’re ostensibly about now. The answer to that last bit is — say it all together now — family. Fast X could not underline this theme any more clearly. This is a film with zero subtext, where characters state their motivations and explain what they’re about to do in the clearest of terms right before they do it. (“It’s a big-ass bomb!” a character says at one point, upon the reveal of said big-ass bomb. “I’m going to go kill the guy who’s trying to defuse my bomb,” Dante tells a flunky a few minutes later.) This bluntness is mostly just giggle-inducing. But it is helpful in the sense that, if a viewer happens to miss one of Fast X’s many references to other Fast and Furious movies, another character will pop up to explain the connection moments later.  Fast X also lays out Universal’s master plan for the series by constantly underlining the importance of legacy and passing knowledge down through the generations, preemptively setting up a future reboot where Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) hands the car keys over to his son Little B (Leo Abelo Perry) after the epic three-part conclusion to the current saga is complete.  Fast X also passes the baton in terms of its supporting characters, introducing two new members of “the Agency” that controls the fates of Dom and his crew. Tess (Brie Larson) is the daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody, who’s currently “deep in hiding” (read: probably going to show up in a post-credits sequence at some point) after his plane was ambushed at the beginning of the last movie. Aimes (Alan Ritchson) is Mr. Nobody’s successor who’s out to get Dom and his friends until he isn’t. New characters related to old characters also pop up on the good guys’ side, and our familiar friends — Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) — are there as well. Jakob (John Cena), the antagonist from the last movie, has been incorporated into Dom’s circle of trust, and even super-hacker Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows some temporary loyalty to the crew. And that’s not including the cameos! At this point in their lives, Dom and Letty have settled down and become square parents — ones who keep guns with silencers in their night tables, but square parents nonetheless. They approach their lives and work with utter seriousness, whether they’re trying to stop a bomb or teach Little B the ropes. This makes them two of the least compelling characters in the movie. Their partners in crime (or heroism, depending on which movie you’re thinking of), meanwhile, are still cutting it up like old times. But while Han is on the dating apps and Tej and Roman still spend their days playfully teasing each other, the gags are starting to feel stale.  The characters having the most fun are both new additions to the franchise: Cena, doing a variation on his meathead rocker schtick from Peacemaker, brings fun uncle energy to his scenes. And Momoa? Well, the best way to describe his performance in this movie is as a nepo-baby Joker, embracing chaos and destabilizing Dom’s extended family while wearing pastel nail polish and silk shirts unbuttoned to the navel. He even rips off a line from The Dark Knight when he says: “Some men want to save the world. I just want to punish it.” Given Dom’s habit of acquiring family members (a point Aimes lampshades by complaining about the Fast and Furious “cult” that keeps recruiting former enemies), there are a lot of characters to keep up with in Fast X. By necessity, director Louis Leterrier (taking over from longtime Fast and Furious mastermind Justin Lin, who left in early production) splits them up into parallel globe-trotting adventures. Some of these are more exciting than others: Tej, Roman, Ramsey, and Han spend most of the movie shopping for underworld tech and catching up with old friends in London, for example. And when the action does come in, it’s a different style than in the best Fast and Furious movies. Leterrier obviously augmented the chase scenes with CGI, and the hand-to-hand combat is shot in that piecemeal way where not a single punch or kick is shown in its entirety from throw to impact. The whole thing is devoid of any sense of scale or location — and that’s before the nauseating drone photography comes in.  Even the excitement factor comes second to the almighty IP in Fast X, as audiences are encouraged to spend the duration pointing at the screen in recognition, like Leonardo DiCaprio in the Rick Dalton meme. This film is full of callbacks and references, repeating some of the series’ best stunts in warmed-over sequences that mostly reveal how this was more fun the first time. It’s disingenuous to bemoan a subtlety that this series never had, but the emphasis on lore in Fast X introduces an emotion that’s deadly for a film like this one: boredom.  Fast X suffers from the same condition as latter-day MCU movies, where it’s so laden with internal mythology that it feels more like homework than popcorn entertainment. “The days when one man behind the wheel of a car can make a difference are done,” Aimes soberly informs Dom in the buildup to the film’s fiery, physics-defying action climax, which naturally involves one man behind the wheel of a car. Aimes is meant to be wrong in his prediction, and wrong-headed for even thinking it. But the days when a goofy, overstated line like that is enough to keep audiences coming back to this franchise may be waning, too. ",NEGATIVE

"May 17, 2023"," “I’ll kill Dominic Toretto. I’ll kill ’em all.” So says the disturbed, ballet-loving Dante  (the movie comes pretty close to implying the two adjectives are interchangeable), the son of the Rio drug lord killed off in “Fast Five.” An extraordinarily campy Jason Momoa dines out upon this vengeance-driven role,  sporting dandy pigtails one minute and “Swan Lake”-ing around the next, when he’s not blowing up half of Rome or kidnapping Dom’s son. Momoa is the chief, merrily depraved reason to sit through “Fast X,” even as he becomes its emblem of code-switching, tone-juggling mania. The movie’s OK. Produced on a reported $340 million budget, it’s 340 million dollars’ worth of OK. On Instagram, while filming, star Vin Diesel called “Fast X” the “beginning of an epic ending.” Now, unless you’re “The Empire Strikes Back” or thereabouts, that sort of project can feel like time spent watching track getting laid for a train arriving later. There’s a ton going on in “Fast X,” with Diesel seething, and Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodriguez smashing each other’s heads against concrete or metal, while John Cena and Leo Abelo Perry kill assailants with cannonballs shot from their cannon car. Yet somehow it feels like you’re hanging off a cliff for 2 hours and 21 minutes, waiting for the cliffhanger ending, which isn’t technically any kind of ending. It’s a middling. Rita Moreno enlivens a couple of scenes as Abuela Toretto. She’s one of four Oscar-winning actresses without enough to do here. Theron, glowering away as the quasi-Bond villain, returns, as does Helen Mirren (as “Queenie” Shaw), who both came on board in “The Fate of the Furious.” Also, we get Brie Larson in “Fast X,” as the agency daughter of the AWOL “Mr. Nobody” (Kurt Russell, come back!). Performers with a comic edge, such as Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel — the series’ one-woman geek squad with cunning fashion sense — lighten the load. The film’s problems qualify as problematic only for those who like their action scenes a little less “Wacky Races” but meaner, and a little more sustained and suspenseful. Action filmmaking on a global scale requires more than location scouting and crowd control. Now that we’re in the Mid-Digital Age of filmmaking, we’re seeing an amalgam of practical and digital effects in practically every large-scale action sequence. Everything and anything is possible. But not everything is advisable. Building an action scene so that it actually builds, and peaks, and valleys, and adjusts its rhythm so that we’re fully invested while being constantly surprised — some movies leave all that stuff to the editing phase. The movie yanks Dom and his crew from Los Angeles to Rome to Naples to London to Rio to green-screen Antarctica. Defying “the laws of God and gravity,” weathering bad press (they’re framed for Dante’s terrorist attack on Rome), director Louis Leterrier slams it all together, dutifully. In Rio, Dante really really wants to race against Dom. Frustratingly, the drag race, like everything else in “Fast X,” has no time for racing; it’s all about detonators and Dante’s Joker-ripoff mind games. The bad man boasts an unlimited supply of remote-controlled vehicles, a neutron bomb and scads of machine gun-wielding minions. Now and then, we get a detour into comic-relief psychosis, as in one uneasily depraved sequence where Dante holds an extended, chatty conversation with two of his deceased and decaying victims, propped up as if joining their killer for backyard mojitos. Every franchise offering needs its mark of distinction; this is “Fast X”‘s. My affection for a lot of the earlier F&F movies has everything to do with the people on the screen, and the squealing of the tires. Not so much the world destruction. Outlandish mayhem needs better visual stylists than Leterrier. Here’s hoping that with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and the new “Mission: Impossible” due this summer, will do better than eh.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," “It’s like a cult, but with cars,” explains one new character to another in “Fast X,” the latest in the long-running “Fast & Furious” franchise, and that’s as good an explanation as any. Basically, these are superhero movies in which everyone’s superpower is that they can drive extremely fast in a very serious yet nonchalant way. Ten movies in, that’s still the basic idea — though, like Vin Diesel’s biceps, things just keep getting bigger. “Fast X” has an enormous cast (including four Academy Award winners, two of whom see little screen time but apparently just wanted in on the fun), a plot that sprawls all over the world, and action sequences of the sort that had me scribbling things in my notebook like “Wait, didn’t that bomb already go off?” and that leave the viewer thinking that a car turning cartwheels is just a perfectly normal part of the day. In other words, yes, “Fast X” — and do call it that, not the less-cool “Fast Ten” — is good fun. You don’t need to know anything about the plot, but I’ll try to tell you anyway: Um, we rewind back 10 years to “Fast Five” (aka The One Where They Steal a Vault And Drive Around With It), where it turns out that the evil dude that died on the bridge had a son named Dante (Jason Momoa, hammy perfection) who shows up in the present day with an excellent array of hairstyles and attitude. (Seriously, somebody get this man-bunned villain his own franchise, immediately. And perhaps a signature line of scrunchies.) He wants to kill Dom Toretto (Diesel), supposedly to avenge his father but mostly because he seems to just like attention. This means that everyone needs to go to various great cities of the world — Rome, London, Rio — and drive really fast. That’s basically it — isn’t that enough? Diesel, whose ember-voiced delivery remains leaden but who nonetheless makes Dom an endearing hero, says things like “Without family, you got nothing” a lot, and gives his little son L.B. (Leo Abelo Perry) some driving lessons with the poetic instructions, “Find the line, feel the car and let it fly.” (I confess that my favorite thing about Dom is his vast collection of sleeveless shirts with the arms ripped off. I like to picture him in the mornings, selecting a new shirt and then decisively tearing the sleeves off. Does he have a pile of random sleeves somewhere? Is his wife Letty making a quilt out of them?) Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges) banter, as they always do. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Cipher (Charlize Theron) spar. Jakob (John Cena) adorably shows off his car’s cassette deck to L.B. And newbies Tess (Brie Larson, a bit underwhelming) and Aimes (Alan Ritchson, teeth gleaming) explain the franchise to each other. “If it could be done in a car,” Aimes says, “they did it.” They did, and they do. Though I’d have preferred “Fast X” to have a little more driving and a little less fighting, and was disappointed to realize that the film’s climactic moment is pretty much in the trailer, this movie is good, silly popcorn fun — with a couple of scenes at the end (stay put during the first half of the credits) indicating even better times ahead. Soon, this franchise will be driving off into the sunset — “Fast X” is supposedly the first installment of a final trilogy — so let’s enjoy it while we can. “You still drive?” somebody asks a member of the crew at one point. There’s only one possible answer: “What do you think?” With Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, John Cena, Jason Momoa, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Charlize Theron, Rita Moreno. Directed by Louis Leterrier, from a screenplay by Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau. 141 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material. Opens May 18 at multiple theaters.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","  There’s a fine line between what’s entertainingly implausible and what’s insulting to one’s intelligence, and the “Fast & Furious” movies have straddled it mostly successfully for two decades. In the previous film, “F9,” our hero Dominic Toretto, the car-thief turned special agent played by Vin Diesel, swung from a steel cable across a canyon in his car, like a hot-rod Tarzan. Believable? Not even remotely — but boy, what a great scene.   All action franchises must constantly outdo themselves with bigger stunts and wilder concepts (in “F9,” the characters literally went to outer space), and so here comes “Fast X,” reportedly the first in a final trilogy. The movie is packed with nearly every star in its universe (from John Cena to Helen Mirren) and introduces a new one, Jason Momoa, as Dante, a criminal mastermind who blames Dom for the death of his father (a callback to “Fast Five”). This series’ charm has always been its street-smart, upstart, just-having-fun vibe, but “Fast X” has none of that. In its attempts to knock our socks off with over-the-top set pieces, superhero-style bombast and soap-opera twists, “Fast X” sails right over that aforementioned line of plausibility.   Describing the plot would be a fool’s errand, but the upshot is that Dante is so bad that even the bad guys (Charlize Theron as the cybervillain Cipher, Jason Statham as former assassin Deckard Shaw) unite against him. There’s much globe-hopping, of course: Dom’s buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) leads a crew to Italy but ends up in London, while Dom himself races against Dante in Rio (cue the usual montage of female rumps in high-cut shorts). Every few minutes there is an invasion by the faceless soldiers of The Agency, which has mistakenly marked our heroes as terrorists. And eventually we learn that Dante’s real goal is to swipe Dom’s 8-year-old son, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry).   Momoa, best known as DC’s Aquaman, has a tough time bringing his showcase villain into focus. The film casts Dante first as a scowling Latin gangster, then as a satanic figure in a frock coat and finally as an effeminate rich kid with a sick streak — the kind of guy who responds to Dom’s jaw-shattering punch by pouting, “Ow, you big brute!” Momoa throws himself into the role, but in the end his Dante isn’t so much fearsome as irksome.   Director Louis Leterrier knows his way around a fast car (“The Transporter”), but here he has to rely on CGI to stage every outlandish scenario — a giant bouncing bomb, an exploding dam — and the result is a movie that never looks or feels real. The “Fast & Furious” franchise certainly isn’t ready for the junk heap yet. But after 22 years, it’s showing signs of wear and tear. ",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Here’s your reminder “The Fast and the Furious” was based on a true story as chronicled in a 1998 Vibe magazine article, and that the original film from 2001 is a somewhat grounded crime film with Paul Walker’s LAPD Officer Brian O’Conner going undercover to infiltrate a gang of street racers and thieves led by Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto. Cut to the year 2023, and nobody, I mean NOBODY, expects realism or logic when it comes to the “FF” movies, which have grown bigger and more bloated, with Dom and his friends (and foes) performing feats of daring and strength and gravity-defying driving that would have Speed Racer and Captain America giving them a standing ovation. Everyone’s in on the joke now, eagerly anticipating the next insanely ridiculous set piece: Dom and Brian drag a bank vault through the streets of Rio! “Zombie cars” fly from a New York City parking garage! Tej and Roman fly a souped-up Pontiac Fiero into outer space! And when all is said and done, we get a speech about the importance of family—even though the carnage we’ve just witnessed has almost certainly created a ton of collateral damage, and a lot of families will be attending memorial services while Dom and his “fam” enjoy a backyard barbecue with some product-placement beer. With an unnecessarily long running time of 139 minutes, a globe-trotting and convoluted plot that careens all over the place and, yes, a bounty of entertainingly cartoonish action sequences, “Fast X” is like a classic rock band that plays a greatest-hits concert and pads every song with a guitar solo and a drum solo. It is arguably the most self-aware of the “FF” films (there’s a highlight-reel scene in which a government operative takes us through some of those most ridiculous stunts) and it features a number of twists and turns that surely will thrill some fans while irritating others due to the arbitrary nature of these developments—but it feels as if director Louis Leterrier is almost deliberately testing our patience by extending every single fight scene, every chase, every shootout, to the point where the excitement gives way to tedium. The chief antagonist in “Fast X” is Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, who as you might but probably don’t recall was killed back in the 2011 film “Fast Five.” Dressed like a Vegas magician, given to flamboyant gestures and crazy cackling, Dante is a psychopath obsessed with avenging his father’s death by destroying everything Dom holds dear before taking out Dom himself. (I guess he had to wait a dozen years before the right sequel came along.) As Charlize Theron’s villainous Cipher puts it, she thought she was the devil until she met Dante, but the guy comes across as more of a preening, performance-art, sociopathic clown than a truly menacing villain. Returning regulars include Michelle Rodriguez’ Letty, who is married to Dom and helping to raise his son, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry); Tyrese Gibson’s Roman and Ludacris’ Tej, who never stop bickering and bantering; John Cena’s Jakob Toretto, brother of Dom; Nathalie Emmanuel’s computer genius Ramsay; Sung Kang’s expert drifter Han Lue, and Jordana Brewster’s Mia, sister of Dom and Jakob. (The late Paul Walker’s Brian, Mia’s husband and Dom’s BFF, remains an alive albeit offscreen presence in the series.) Everyone slips comfortably into their roles and does what they can with the goofy dialogue and the death-defying, logic-defeating stunt sequences. (It’s particularly hilarious when Mia is under siege from a dozen heavily armed tactical officers and starts throwing them around as if she’s the Hulk.) As “Fast X” zips from Los Angeles to Rome to Rio (cue the swirling shots of the Christ the Redeemer statue) to London to Portugal to Antarctica, the dense screenplay packs in a myriad of cameos and surprise returns, while also bringing aboard new characters such as Brie Larson’s Tess, the daughter of Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior’s Isabel, a street racer with a secret tie to Dom’s past, and Rita Moreno’s Abuelita Toretto, grandmother of Dom, Jakob and Mia. (Let’s pause for a moment to consider that with Moreno, Helen Mirren as Magdalene Shaw, Theron and Larson, “Fast X” has four Academy Award winners in its ranks.) In typical “Fast/Furious” fashion, allies sometimes become opponents while former enemies become allies, and you never know who might pop up out of the blue. Dom, Letty and Jakob are each splintered from the core group, with Dom going rogue/solo/whatever to face down Dante, while Letty is held in a black site prison from which there is no escape (yeah right) and Jakob is tasked with protecting little Brian, aka B., who doesn’t seem the least bit traumatized by the carnage and destruction he’s witnessing while under the protection of Uncle Jakob. “Fast X” is just the first half of the franchise finale, as it ends on a number of cliffhangers. The closing moment features a development so insanely over the top, even for this franchise, that you can’t help but laugh at the sheer audacity of the filmmakers. Give ‘em this much, they’re wholly embracing the madness.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," Given this is a franchise that started in 2001 with Californian street racers ripping off Panasonic VCRs, then turned them into international secret agents last seen launching a car into effing space (in 2021’s F9), it was hard to fathom where the Fast Saga could possibly escalate to next. But, with a new and capable pair of hands at the directing wheel in Louis ‘The Transporter’ Leterrier, Fast X screeches in determined to top all that’s gone before — while clinging tight to the Fast & Furious formula that made the series an unlikely box-office phenomenon. It's all here: the perma-sleeveless Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) dispensing gravelly dime-store wisdom (“No-one starts at the finish line”; “Fear is the best teacher”; “Nothing’s impossible, you just have to have faith”). His ever-expanding team of heisters, bantering and bickering and making up and hugging. A token street race, featuring many close-ups of ladies’ bottoms. A bunch of ‘surprise’ guest appearances. Repeated use of the ‘f’ word (and we don’t mean ‘fuck’). A barbecue. And, of course, a fistful of OTT car stunts that “violate the laws of God and gravity,” as new Agency antagonist Aimes (Alan ‘Reacher’ Ritchson) puts it during one chokingly tongue-in-cheek monologue. So you’ll witness Dom tackling a flaming neutron bomb on the streets of Rome, using his car to fight with helicopters, and driving it down the side of a dam pursued by what appears to be an avalanche of fire. It’s utterly ridiculous. It’s kinda brilliant. The thin plot-tissue connecting these entertainingly preposterous set pieces is provided by a bit of retconning (another F&F tradition) that inserts Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes into the thick of the climactic action of Fast Five, where his evil pappy Hernan dies. Described as both “a monster” and “the Devil”, this vengeful villain is hyped up as the deadliest baddie the Toretto crew has yet faced. But, if we’re supposed to treat Fast X as Infinity War on wheels, Dante doesn’t convince as a muscle-car Thanos. He spends much of his time perched in a high place with an impossibly good view, remote-controlling vehicles while cackling like a chunky Joker, dressed in a style reminiscent of Everything Everywhere’s Jobu Tupaki and pulling off ballet poses. Momoa’s commitment to unhinged flamboyance almost works, but for the most part he’s just flummoxingly irksome. We’d like to have seen a bit less of Dante, and a bit more of the psychedelic muffin (don’t ask, just watch). After recent revelations by Vin Diesel about the film being part one of a climactic trilogy, it doesn’t feel too spoilery to say Fast X ends on a massive cliff-hanger, giving its final moments the vibe of those old-timey matinee serials where you know you can’t trust anything you’ve just seen — especially given this 22-year-old series’ predilection for resurrection. But, hey, one shouldn’t overthink such things. This is Fast & Furious. Logic is but a vanishing point in its rear-view. And we wouldn’t have it any other way.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," Now more than two decades old, the Fast & Furious franchise is racing for the finish line with all the outlandish action and rank sentimentality it can muster. “Fast X,” the first installment of what will reportedly be a three-part swan song, is literally the beginning of the end, which promises to be an “Avengers: Endgame”-style reunion of the series’s core characters, now including its most memorable villain, played with equal parts glower and gleeful camp by Jason Momoa. Viewers will remember that in 2021’s “F9,” the series literally went into space. Where to go from there? More outlandish stunts and set pieces, of course — in this case involving cars landing from an airplane onto a busy highway; a punishing girl fight executed between laser beams and shards of broken glass; high-tech wizardry; and, of course, several perilous car chases. But in “Fast X,” the stars are the most compelling special effects. Is anyone not in this movie? Fans will no doubt appreciate the cameos, callbacks and tantalizing clues of what’s to come in a movie that serves its fan base with extravagant, here-comes-another-one fealty. The gravitational center, as always, is Vin Diesel — a walking testosterone gelcap whose emotional spectrum ranges from determined scowl to papa-bear growl — as Dom Toretto, a former drag racer who now leads a ragtag group of miscreants and former criminals for a shadowy law enforcement entity called the Agency. Dom is at his Dommiest in “Fast X,” uttering terse one-liners like “I got this” and wincing after a hundred-foot drop as if he’d just clipped a curb before delivering one of several soliloquies about the importance of family. This is the “Fast” formula that, however creaky, has proved so irresistible since the first movie in 2001: visceral, progressively more preposterous action sequences — often involving promiscuous gunplay and bloody fights — punctuated by sermons on duty, honor and filial loyalty. In the grand tradition of American cinema, “Fast X” and its predecessors provide audiences what they crave most: a wish fulfillment fantasy of unbridled aggression that has the added advantage of being morally righteous. Boxes checked. Fire away. Here, the ones doing the shooting are a motley but sleekly attractive ensemble of usual suspects and returning faves: Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) return as Dom’s crew — sorry, family — along with his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and Dom’s now-8-year-old son, Little B (Leo Abelo Perry), named for Dom’s best friend Brian. That character, of course, was played by Paul Walker until the actor’s untimely death in 2013; he still makes an appearance in “Fast X,” by way of flashbacks to a heist he and Dom pulled in “Fast Five,” involving not just the theft of a bank vault but stealing the entire vault itself. In the course of that mission, they killed a crime kingpin named Reyes, whose son Dante (Momoa) has now surfaced to exact revenge. Mayhem, carnage, smash-ups and wanton destruction ensue — and that’s just in the first 10 minutes. As in previous iterations, “Fast X” takes its protagonists on a dizzying but somehow turgid tour of the globe, in this case laying waste to picturesque locales ranging from Rome (where a neutron bomb scuttles through the streets like a deranged megaton pinball) to Naples, Rio, London and Antarctica, all in service to a plot that resembles “Scooby-Doo” with fuel injection and more firepower. That might be the best way to appreciate “Fast X”: as an overstuffed live-action cartoon whose harebrained schemes and casual, stakes-free violence create the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of Froot Loops on a Saturday morning. At least that’s the spirit in which Momoa approaches this monumentally silly endeavor: His Dante is a funny, flouncing maniac, given to progressively weirder wardrobe choices and TikTok-ready hairstyles. In one memorably icky scene, he’s having a spa day kitted out in a fluffy bathrobe and totes adorbs pigtails, ignoring the fact that his companions are in no position to enjoy their mani-pedis. As the capers get more bananas (feeling more like filler every time), so does Momoa’s Big Psycho energy. Amid all the screeching brakes, roaring engines and guns a-blazing in “Fast X,” his Dante provides both a jolt of playful humor and an unsubtle wink at the homoerotic frisson that has always animated the most stridently macho action movies. Next to Momoa, the novelty of “Fast X” lies mostly in its cameos, which only a spoilsport would describe in more detail; suffice it to say that most work, and the most newsworthy come in the film’s final scenes, including the closing credits. Not surprisingly, “Fast X” brings new meaning to the term “cliffhanger.” There’s definitely more to come. There always is.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," After outrunning a submarine in sub-zero conditions in THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS and launching into space in FAST 9, there’s really no limit to what the FAST franchise can do with the help of some generous CGI. We’ve gone on a double-decade-spanning journey with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his makeshift family of outlaws, sitting shotgun with them on the bumpiest of roads (FAST AND FURIOUS) and through the toughest of times (losing star Paul Walker to a car crash, which made his character Brian O’Conner’s send-off in FURIOUS 7 especially poignant). And now the end of the road is closing in on the gang in director Louis Leterrier’s FAST X, the first of a two – possibly three – part finale. That finale is not a moment too soon, as the tread is fast wearing off these tires. While Jason Momoa’s vengeance-fueled conductor of chaos gives the picture the NOS boost it needs, it’s barely enough to win the race. It provides very little stakes to get invested in, specifically when it comes to the emotional crux. Insulting, baffling and maddening creative choices proliferate this entry, in addition to wrecking its legacy with the pothole-sized problems fans of the series are forced to swerve around. Honestly, it’s a surprise Dom doesn’t actually jump a shark during the plodding, padded run time. Similar to many of its predecessors in the series, the remedial plot is beside the point in contrast to the stunt-riffic spectacle. Dom and company think they’re set for life now acting as an extension of The Agency, a top secret government branch. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is taking the lead on an operation in Rome, bringing along Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Tej (Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges) and Han (Sung Kang). However, after Cipher (Charlize Theron) visits Dom’s doorstep warning him of a war coming, we learn it’s a set-up by Dante Reyes (Momoa), the unhinged son of the Brazilian billionaire baddie from FAST 5 whose death Dom and Brian had a hand in. He’s out for revenge and won’t stop until everyone Dom loves is wiped out of existence – specifically, since the overarching theme is centered on fathers and sons, Dom’s young son, Little B (Leo Abelo Perry). Given the inciting incident, this chapter has a big “Brian (O’Conner) Problem” in that his presence and purpose is detrimentally missing. It goes unaddressed, but it doesn’t fly that Mia (Jordana Brewster) – a mother herself – shows up for her blood-relatives’ BBQ celebrating family with her grandma (Rita Moreno), brothers and young nephew there, yet leaves Brian and their kid behind off-screen. That Dante, who is on the warpath, covering every skid mark left in the wake of his father’s death, wouldn’t seek out Brian to torture in the same way he does Dom is absolutely preposterous. Dom mentions “he’s safe,” but unless he’s in a bunker, Brian’s not that good at hiding from “The God’s Eye.” Later, when a desperate Dom faces a dangerous quandary, built up as an all-timer, it’s ridiculous that he doesn’t call in his bestie Brian for reinforcement. The senseless creative choices don’t stop there. Han is dosed with drugs and it’s played for one flat gag that lasts under 10 seconds. Yet the ludicrously-concocted fight Tej and Roman have during that same sequence – one that serves to test our patience – far outlasts Han’s bad high. It’s a tangible low for the franchise. Not soon thereafter, Letty and Cipher’s slug-it-out reunion in the sick bay fails to properly utilize all its moving parts, like the dangerous computer-operated surgical laser device: Instead of being on for only 5 seconds, it could’ve been going the entire time, providing an added layer of challenge in the pair’s smack-down.  Screenwriters Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin rely on lazy conveniences time and time again, letting them guide not only the plot, but also anything that resembles poignancy. We’ve been conditioned to recognize that death doesn’t mean much for characters in this series – maybe even less than in Marvel movies. Even so, the sacrifice one character makes late in the film carries little to no weight. The FAST filmmakers have brought back a character when it made sense (Han), but this time, it’s totally unwarranted and devalues another’s arc. The lack of cell phones and all other forms of communication to Dom’s splinter team in Rome is explained long after audiences incredulously ask, “How the heck are these folks absolutely unreachable in the year 2023?!” Even then, with a multitude of ways to reach others within their vicinity, Dom and the always-omnipotent (until they’re conveniently not) The Agency can’t figure out a way to do so in time. If they did, we wouldn’t get to see Dom use his car as a fire shield for innocent bystanders in a cafe, after the Death Star bomb bounces into a gas pump causing a massive explosion.  Blessedly there is the expected, wonderfully-welcomed amount of “so dumb, it’s delicious” in this bountiful buffet. The exposition dump tasked to The Agency’s boss Aimes (Alan Ritchson) is filled with winking self-aware humor, sounding like a glorious greatest hits mashup of FAST film reviews throughout the years. Its 3rd act spectacle gives way to a brawny muscle car that’s got cannons rigged its sides as if it’s some kind of proto-Mad Max vehicle. Dom lifts a car off its side with his bare hands. He drives his own car down the side of a dam with a fiery explosion on his tail. He also ponderously stares into the sunset after destruction has befallen his crew, as an auto-tuned singer gives voice to a devastated Dom’s inner monologue: “The world has fallen.” The music supervisor for LOVE IS BLIND would be proud. Performances range from deliriously diabolical (Momoa) to forced (mostly everyone else). Many in the overstuffed cast (most notably Oscar-winner Larson and any one of her multiple scene partners) talk and monologue at each other, rushing through their lines as if their paychecks won’t clear before they can finish their scenes. Ritchson was clearly chosen for his beefy musculature and towering stature, and not his acting chops, as his delivery is as dead as roadkill. The lightning-fast refashioning of John Cena’s formerly-embittered-brother-turned-loveable-goof does wonders, giving the film its cute-but-cloying comic relief paired with pint-sized Perry’s precocious pluck. Momoa’s electric, eccentric villain is a full-color mimeograph of Nicholson’s Joker turned loose in a Joel Schumacher film – noticeably channeling the maniac’s mayhem in an indelible scene involving his own deceased henchmen, Scotch Tape and nail polish. Momoa’s work is delightfully unfettered in his snarky quipping and bombastic showmanship. Still, all of its annoyances amount to a poor, deflating result. With many miles left to go (even more if Diesel gets his way to elongate it into three parts), this last stretch should be a victory lap. Yet this beginning of the end might leave many of its fans more furious than anything.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023",Fast X is the cinematic equivalent of a multi-car crash pileup&#46; It&apos;s a huge downgrade for the franchise&#44; which is a bloated mishmash of Oscar-winning stars and less-talented cast members saying a lot of awful dialogue while dodging guns and explosions&#46;,NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," If you love the “Fast & Furious” franchise, you will like “Fast X.” If you merely like the series, the new movie will leave you indifferent. And if you’ve never seen a “Fast & Furious” movie, “Fast X” is not the place to start. It’s a middling installment, a big step down from the stupid-wonderful “F9: The Fast Saga,” but with just enough of the crazy stunts and chases that you can’t find anywhere else.  For instance, Vin Diesel drives off two cliffs in “Fast X” — and that’s not even the best thing he does. The best is when he drives off the back of an airplane and falls about 100 feet onto a highway, right in the middle of a high-speed chase. Another good one: When two helicopters try to pull his car off the road with clamps and ropes, he does a fancy maneuver that causes the helicopters to crash into each other and explode. Then he drags the burning helicopters across the highway, turning them just the right way so the debris wipes out the cars following him. Jason Momoa is the colorful new villain, Dante, who goes through life cheerful, so full of self-love that he always looks like he’s about to hug himself. He likes a good joke, talks merrily to corpses, kills hundreds of people in Rome (don’t ask) and has one compelling obsession that gives his life purpose: He wants to make Dominic Toretto (Diesel) suffer. Remember 2011’s “Fast Five”? Of course you don’t. Well, in the best scene of that movie, Dominic and his buddy Brian (the late Paul Walker) steal a massive vault and, using two race cars, drag it through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, smashing cars, cafes and the sides of buildings. “Fast X” reprises some of the footage from the earlier film but intersperses it with new scenes involving Dante. Apparently, Dante is the son of the man whose vault was stolen, and he has been smoldering about this unfortunate incident for about 12 years. As always with this series, there’s a lot that’s ridiculous, as when the CIA and half the world’s criminals are on Dom’s tail, and yet he shows up for a street race in Rio and nobody finds out about it. But ridiculousness has never been a problem for this series. The best “Fast & Furious” movies don’t take themselves seriously. They pretend to take themselves seriously, but in a way that we know that they know they’re pretending, and we’re all in on the joke. Alas, “Fast X,” arriving saddled with a plot involving the potential murder of a child, must genuinely take itself seriously, and so we get a movie that leans hard into the series’ worst flaw — its tendency toward the maudlin — with lots of speechifying and evocations of family. Plus, the movie’s ending is annoying and the last shot is ludicrous — not gloriously ridiculous, but nonsensical. None of this is enough to wipe out the excitement of what went before, but it’s nonetheless a mistake to send audiences out on a low. Still, there’s one thing to be grateful for: At least the nice ladies in “Book Club: The Next Chapter” got to see Rome before Dante worked it over. ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Not too long ago, one could reasonably expect that when a new “Fast and Furious” film rolled off the assembly line, there’d be some fresh upgrades: a submarine chasing a Dodge Charger on ice, for example, or a Pontiac Fiero rocketing into space. “Fast X,” however, is mostly the same old vehicle with familiar features and accouterments, with one key (and extremely welcome) exception: Jason Momoa gleefully drenches this ride in neon and finger-paints flames on the side. Directed by Louis Leterrier, the 10th installment (★★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters now) is another globetrotting affair putting ex-street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his merry gang of world-saving hackers, gearheads and antiheroes through explosive situations, all-out brawls and, yes, some nitrous-fueled vroom-vrooming. While the “Furious” franchise is beginning to feel bloated with characters and subplots, “X” at least delivers a proper cliffhanger for its “Empire Strikes Back”-esque, heroes-in-deep-trouble chapter. Cautiously in domestic bliss, Dom hands the reins of a new mission in Rome to his old friend Roman (Tyrese Gibson) but it's actually a trap set by Dante Reyes (Momoa), the sociopathic and sadistic son of a powerful Brazilian drug lord the crew took out permanently a decade ago (see: “Fast Five”). This vengeful dude doesn’t just want Dom to die, he wants the big guy and everybody associated with him to suffer. Many nefarious machinations ensue, including blaming our heroes for a massive terrorist attack, Dom being placed atop the global most-wanted list (again) and the bad guys going after his son.  As usual, laws of physics are pummeled at length and all logic is shot out of a cannon amid a ""James Bond meets Popular Mechanics"" vibe, yet “Fast X” is particularly head-scratching in its bizarre character choices and decisions: Jakob Toretto (John Cena) spent most of the last film trying to kill his big brother and now he's a goofball uncle? For those who prefer nonstop action, no movie series is this good at sending a flaming metal bomb careening through Rome. That said, much of the spectacle in this 10th film rehashes bonkers situations and scenes done before (and better), a running theme that also pervades much of the narrative. In one sequence, buff lawman Agent Aimes (Alan Ritchson) runs down the plot of every film for Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of Kurt Russell’s mysterious Mr. Nobody. (Fun fact: ""Fast X"" is actually quite accessible for newcomers.) Dom is often seen looking at pictures from previous “Fast” movies, and the newest outing essentially begins with a replay of the “Fast Five” finale: The old footage is a bittersweet reminder of Diesel and Walker’s exceptional chemistry and how the films have never been able to replicate that magic. Dom’s wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) even tells him he needs to stop looking in the “rear-view mirror” and live in the present – it’s a lesson the movie could stand to learn. Thankfully, Momoa puts the entire film on his back as the preening, devilishly excellent Dante unleashes rampant chaos and mayhem. While “Fast” heroes and villains usually veer macho, Momoa embraces a playful flamboyance you miss whenever he’s not on screen. And while the script is awash in ludicrous dialogue, Dante winds up with all the good lines, even while doing his nails and conversing with corpses. He and the legendary Moreno are great additions, as is Ritchson – those who dug Amazon’s two-fisted “Reacher” series will love him in this. Both fun and frustrating, “Fast X” gets it in gear enough for a gutsy finale that leaves characters in serious peril. Yet with an end game in motion, and only one movie (perhaps two) left in this long-running franchise, it’s not the time to be stalling out this close to the finish line.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Perhaps the biggest mistake the “Fast and Furious” franchise ever made was in “F9: The Fast Saga,” when the characters suddenly became self-aware and realized that after all the physics-defying vehicular mayhem they’ve been through, they always miraculously emerge unscathed. How could they have defied the odds for so long? Are they truly immortal or are they merely blessed with impenetrable plot armor? And if any of those things are true why should the audience care one whit about what happens to them? Especially when even the characters who do die usually come back after a sequel or two. “F9” made a convincing case for letting this whole “Fast and Furious” series finally end. But just when you thought it was okay to check out, “Fast X” pulls you back in. Louis Leterrier’s installment does an impressive job of making all the old nonsense make a little bit of sense again. It’s got the absurd action sequences we’ve come to expect, but instead of following a small army of unstoppable heroes, Letterier’s film casts them as underdogs against an even more unstoppable villain. Jason Momoa takes center stage in “Fast X” as Dante, the son of the bad guy from “Fast Five,” who’s been planning his revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his extended family for ten years. Dante’s scheme is so convoluted it’s best not to even think about it. Suffice it to say that if the Toretto clan has plot armor, Dante has plot explosives. Every time something seems to be going right it’s because Dante’s about to make it ten times worse. After a high speed heist in Rome goes horribly wrong, Dominic and his many cronies become the most wanted criminals on Earth. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) gets sent to a super secret prison. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) cavort through the London criminal underground. Jakob (John Cena) — who is still Dominic’s brother and we’re still supposed to be okay with that — ends up on the run with his nephew, Little B (Leo Abelo Perry, “Cheaper By the Dozen”). And since the “Fast and the Furious” movies have a larger ensemble cast than “As the World Turns” did in its prime, the film also makes room for the return of Cipher (Charlize Theron), Deckard (Jason Statham), Queenie (Helen Mirren), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood), and some new international superspies played by Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson (“Reacher”). They all have something to actually do, if you can believe it. The screenplay by Justin Lin, who directed five of the previous installments (six if you include the indie “Better Luck Tomorrow,” which introduced the character of Han), and Dan Mazeau (“Wrath of the Titans”) does the usual “Fast” schtick of concocting bizarre new vehicle-based set pieces and writing a plot that works its way around them.  That is no easy feat, and it takes smart writing to get away with this movie’s silliness. There’s a monologue Alan Ritchson has where he explains the bizarre story of how street racers stealing DVD players gradually became international superspies who flew into outer space and for a second it almost makes this whole series seem plausible. There should be a special Oscar for exposition that good.  There should also be a special Oscar for Jason Momoa’s wardrobe, because no other character in the history of blockbuster cinema has ever looked this comfortably tailored. There isn’t an inch of fabric on this guy that doesn’t billow. Momoa plays Dante like Bugs Bunny sold his soul to the devil. He’s omnipotent and he loves it. He’s a bag of Funyuns with none of the yuns. He’s the polar opposite of Dominic Toretto, wild instead of taciturn, colorful instead of monochrome, femme instead of masc. More, please, I beg of you, and if Momoa could bring some of the same camp energy to the next “Aquaman” while you’re at it, we’d be ever so grateful. It’s been less than 24 hours since the screening of “Fast X” and already the plot is fading from memory, but the sensation of it all lingers in a pleasing, buzzy way. Everything that works about the “Fast” movies is here, and most of the junk that doesn’t is either gone or quickly brushed aside in favor of something better.  The action sequences are still trying to pick a fight with every physics professor in the world, but this time they’re here because they make the story fun, not because the story was so awful the audience needed a distraction. And if you gave any damns whatsoever about these characters, they’re all here, they’re all a delight and most of them get to do cool stuff in cars, motorcycles, airplanes, and — most importantly — a theater near you.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," ""Fast X"" concludes on a moment so shocking that it may take a few minutes to process the ending's multiple big twists, occurring only minutes apart. The latest installment in the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise includes much of what we've come to expect from Universal's over-$6 billion franchise: Explosive stunts, fast cars, ridiculous one-liners, multiple twists, retcons (""Fast"" has essentially become a telenovela), record-number mentions of the word ""family,"" and a zany villain. Originally announced as two parts (which now may turn into a trilogy), ""Fast X"" takes us back to 2011's ""Fast Five.""(If you haven't seen any other ""Fast"" movie you'll be fine, but I recommend at least checking out or rewatching ""Five"" before heading to the theater.) This time, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is out to destroy Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew, seeking vengeance years later for the death of his father.  Directly inspired by Marvel's final two ""Avengers"" movies, which also star Diesel, ""Fast X"" plays like an ""Infinity War'' wannabe, right down to its massive surprise ending and purple-clothed antagonist. But while ""Infinity War"" was a massive success at the box office, stealing its playbook isn't necessarily going to produce the same numbers now. ""Fast X"" faced a major hurdle during production — just days into filming, franchise director Justin Lin decided he'd had enough and quit. Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"") stepped in, but the end result isn't as clean as it should be. Disjointed at times, the setup for the finale comes across more as a strategic box office ploy than an organic conclusion.  Though a fun time, ""Fast X"" isn't the best in the franchise; I'd rank it near the middle. Despite a few exciting reveals and a must-see mid-credits scene, the cliffhanger is a risky move. I could easily see some viewers walking away feeling like they were only delivered three-quarters of a movie, unnecessarily dragged out to keep Universal's most successful franchise running. The lovechild of the Joker and Thanos, Dante is so wildly unpredictable and dementedly chaotic – licking faces, tasting blood, and blowing up vehicles – you never know what he'll do next, but every moment is gold.  Constructed as an antithesis to Dom, Momoa's a tour de force as a sadistic mastermind who's always several steps ahead of everyone around him, making him a terrifying threat. Unlike other franchise baddies, this guy's not getting invited to any of Dom's family gatherings — not that he'd want that anyway. The film does a good job of poking fun at Dom for befriending most of his enemies. Relishing every moment in this role, Momoa's not only the franchise's top villain but also the most stylish, often adorned in silks or leopard print.  But the movie suggests Dante's violent tendencies are rooted in mental illness and even tries to elicit a cheap laugh about it during a morbid nail-painting party where he speaks to dead bodies. It's a gross stance to take in general, but even more audacious considering the movie premieres during mental health awareness month. Though Momoa's the scene-stealer, Charlize Theron is finally given more to do than staying boxed in a prison cell or walking menacingly through a jet. The Oscar winner's action-film skillset is utilized in two big fight scenes. Just about everyone in the ""Fast"" fam — from Jakob (John Cena) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) to Han (Sung Kang) and Deckard (Jason Statham) — gets to throw down here. But the standout fight between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Cipher is a showdown that's been years in the making. An unnecessary appearance from Pete Davidson could've been trimmed in order to focus more prominently on an ensuing scene with Han and Deckard that's been heavily anticipated since ""Fast 9."" Instead, we get a brief, baffling sequence that's an insult to those who demanded ""Justice for Han."" (For what it's worth, Kang and Leterrier told Insider more justice is on the way.) Oscar winner and ""Fast"" newbie Brie Larson delivers the sequel's weakest performance. Subbing in for Kurt Russell's Mr. Nobody here, Larson's Agent Tess is stiff and awkward, seeming like the odd man out in the saga. This late in the franchise, the movie should focus on the core cast instead of introducing more new faces. ""Fast"" is at its best when Dom's extended family combines forces to save the world or a family member, and, other than the sequel's first 30 minutes or so, that's largely non-existent. Letty's paired up with Cipher. Dom's younger brother Jakob (John Cena), a ""Fast 9"" antagonist, finally gets to work with the good guys, but is on his own fun side quest most of the time. Dom mostly interacts with new characters. The only crew largely paired together are Roman (Tyrese), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han. It's a brilliant villain move to separate Dom's crew from one another (because in the ""Fast"" franchise, the family is unstoppable together), but ""Fast X"" is noticeably missing what makes the franchise so beloved. People love to trash the ""Fast"" franchise. Sure, some things are silly while others don't make sense, like Dante waiting a decade to get revenge or Jakob seeming to have an entirely different personality in this movie (Cena's basically playing Cena here). And yeah, there are some weird transitions. But that should be nothing new for a ""Fast"" fan. If you're familiar with the franchise, you're likely not expecting a cinematic masterpiece. But if it's entertainment you're looking for, the 10th installment delivers in that department, jumping from one action-packed explosive scene to the next. ""Fast X"" may not top going to space, but they did cover a one-ton metal ball in gasoline, set it aflame, and let Diesel chase after it as it rolled down the streets of Rome. The early sequence is goofy and absurd in the best way as Dom uses some combination of sheer luck, confidence, and the superpower of family to stop a bomb from blowing up the Vatican. For the entire two-hour and 21-minute runtime, Dom makes you feel like any problem in the world can be solved — as long as you're behind the wheel of a car. ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Make no mistake: despite their increasingly hectic ensemble structure, Vin Diesel is the entire organizing principle of the Fast & Furious movies—if they can even be said to have one. In Fast X, he isn’t onscreen overmuch, but when he’s not there the others talk about “Dom” the way Nathaniel Hawthorne’s parsons talked about God. What’s he doing? What should we do to please him? What would he do if he were me? It must be psychologically exhausting to be Dom Toretto’s friend.  That’s especially true in Fast X, where the villain’s sole purpose is to get revenge on Dom by knocking off enough of his “family” to make Dom suffer grievously before he gets popped too. The villain in question is a way-over-the-top Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes, psychotic son of Fast Five villain Hernan (Joaquim de Almeida), and heir to not  much of anything. Dom and company wiped Hernan out when they memorably stole his hotel-sized vault in Buenos Aires by dragging it away behind their cars. Dom then used it to bash the man and his mercenary armies to death on a freeway that does not exist, in a scene that arguably launched the demented lunacy phase of the Fast franchise, and which is recapitulated here both in flashback and in a new variation involving a rolling neutron bomb. Momoa is introduced in a couple of cutaways as a background character in all that Fast Five mishegoss and placed inside one of the anonymous vehicles Dom slaughtered, where Dante barely survived. Dante lost his dad, so Dom and him? Well, it’s personal. About Momoa: He is not a solid enough performer to overact exactly, but he’s overdoing, well, something (and scenes of him attempting ballet and painting the nails of a corpse raise the uncomfortable prospect that “something” is homophobia). Coming out of the press screening, one audience member cried out joyfully that Momoa’s performance was “so absurd, it’s awesome,” and that is a way of looking at it, one supposes. You get why Momoa would try to magnify whatever it is he thinks he’s emphasizing because the entire franchise is a hectic mess, albeit a beloved one. What started as a relatively plausible action flick set in the world of street racing expanded to become an Ocean’s 11 heist movie (Fast Five); then a Mission Impossible-style espionage action franchise (Fasts 6 thru 9), populated by comic book villains with names like “Cipher.” From around four movies in, every new development in this crazy franchise has been exponential: the recurring cast is around 30 actors deep, and the action scenes stopped trying to be CGI-plausible at least three movies ago.  These are blue-collar Bond movies now, scripted by your drunken uncle who is so impatient to get to the ’splosions and flying cars that he’s rushed past everything else to reach  the “good stuff.” Gravity bends for Vin and his crew the way it obeys the commands of the flying sword fighters in a vintage Wuxia movie. So if you came for plausibility, you aren’t doing this movie right. You either go with it or you don’t.  But the focus inside the avalanche of stunts, asymmetrical plot elements, and mismatched genre tropes is still what Vin, and his alter ego Dom, would call “values.” Faith. Family. Honor. Loyalty. Because Dom is the last of a dying breed. He’s seen things a man shouldn’t had oughta seen, and done things a man shouldn’t had oughta done. He chuckles a lot when he’s with his family, but he rarely makes a joke and he almost never laughs. He’s in a grief state all the time, attentive to what’s missing, like a war veteran who’s lost too many comrades to the enemy, except Dom’s enemy is Life. And Diesel believes in Dom so hard that for two hours and 10 minutes, he makes you believe in him too. No wonder Dwayne Johnson refused to come back for what we’re being told is an extended, multi-sequel last round-up for the Fast family. Johnson is inarguably the bigger star, but within a Fast film, there’s just no room for Dwayne and Vinnie’s self-love in even the widest of widescreen frames. The Rock is a modern action star after all—a charmer and a politician who never seems fully to buy into the  imperatives of the action films he stars in; even as he punches a bad guy through a wall, he already seems like he’s going to reach over and help the guy up, and maybe ask for his vote in November. In Vinnie’s world there are rules—what used to be called a Code of Honor—and the first but unspoken rule is that, while everyone can be heroic, only one guy gets to be the Vinimitable, Vinvincible, VinDomitable hero. The studio says Fast X is the first part in a franchise-ending storyline. But there is no other universe in which Vin Diesel can get paid $100 million dollars to grimace in front of green screens and spout aphorisms for about 40 minutes of screen time. End of the franchise? Don’t bet on it. Diesel has already intimated that the Fast movies might wrap up with a Fast XII. In one form or another, in whatever sequel closes this storyline down, something furious will this way come.",POSITIVE

"May 17, 2023"," Fast X is a breathless thrill ride that occasionally gets bogged down in melodramatic dialogue, but Jason Momoa's villain makes it a blast to watch.  Over the last two decades the Fast & Furious franchise has evolved from a simple movie about street racers into one of the highest grossing franchises in history. Newcomer to the Fast series, Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me), takes on directing duties for Fast X, working from a script by Dan Mazeau (Wrath of the Titans) and longtime franchise director Justin Lin. Continuing the story of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family of racers and car enthusiasts, Fast X flips the script by making Dom the target of an old vendetta. Fast X is a breathless thrill ride that occasionally gets bogged down in melodramatic dialogue, but Jason Momoa's villain makes it a blast to watch.   Fast X's plot is more of an excuse to jump from one action set piece to the next, with brief interludes about the importance of family that flirt with, but never truly convey, a compelling emotional heart. The story centers around revenge, with new villain Dante Reyes (Momoa) being retconned into the Fast & Furious franchise as the son of Fast Five villain Hernan Reyes. Years later, he emerges to cause Dom as much suffering as possible by creating an international incident and pinning it on Dom's family, who are then hunted by the Agency for which they previously worked. Though Dom's family is scattered across the globe and Dom himself does little more than play cat and mouse with Dante, it's one of the Fast franchise's more simple and easier to follow plots.   For Fast X, the more simple storyline works since the movie is clearly more interested in violating the laws of gravity and pushing the boundaries on what can be accomplished in a car. This creates an interesting visual spectacle, with death-defying stunts and exciting, gripping action set pieces broken up by what's become trademark quipping from its characters. Fast & Furious is a franchise that has become known for its action and stunts and, in this regard, Fast X exceeds all expectations. However, the script by Lin and Mazeau leaves something to be desired, largely because it's at odds with itself. Fast X wants to be a movie that smirks cheekily at its audience, letting the viewer know they're in on the joke, but it also wants to have a grounded and emotional throughline. Unfortunately, it doesn't pull off a compelling balance, waffling between nudge-nudge wink-wink jokes and soapy dialogue about family. It's almost, but not quite, a parody of itself.   Still, the film is by no means a slog to get through and a big part of that is the delightful deviousness of Momoa's Dante. While Diesel plays Dom at the character's most stoic and, as a result, most boring, Momoa has enough personality to carry the main antagonistic relationship of the movie. The actor is very clearly having a blast in the role, playing the flamboyant villain to Diesel's unflappable hero, and he makes Fast X a much more entertaining watch than it would have been without his performance. However, with so much screen time dedicated to Dante, it's less spent with the other members of Dom's family. While most get moments to shine, John Cena's Jakob is perhaps the next most entertaining of the bunch, getting a fun storyline as he protects Dom's son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). The rest of the cast is perfectly fine, but Fast X clearly starts to show the cracks of the Fast franchise's tendency toward too-large casts.   For all the issues with the script, Fast X is still a solid entry in the Fast & Furious franchise, offering what viewers have come to expect — over-the-top action sequences and brief moments of familial sentimentality. It's very much the Avengers: Infinity War of this franchise, putting a great deal of focus on the villain, splitting up the heroes and ending on a cliffhanger. Because of the cliffhanger ending, Fast X does feel a bit unfinished, but with Fast & Furious 11 already confirmed, we at least know we'll get some answers in the sequel. It's a risk to end a movie this way, but in a franchise that flouts the rules of gravity and storytelling all the time, it makes sense for Fast X.   Fast X is certainly a must-watch for any die-hard fan of the franchise. Though it may not live up to the heights of some of the franchise's past films, it's an entertaining action thrill ride from start to finish, one that will surely keep you hooked. Even casual viewers will find entertainment in the action set pieces, and thanks to flashbacks, it's fairly easy to jump into Fast X even for those who might have missed a previous movie or two. Though it's a little bit more over-the-top even in a franchise known for this very thing, Fast X is another fun and exciting ride tailor-made for the summer movie season.   Fast X releases in theaters May 19. It is 141 minutes long and rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material.  While Tom Hardy was a front runner for Bond 26's new 007, one forgotten flop proves the actor isn't right for the role of James Bond after all. The fates of several characters from The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes are unknown, but one line from Catching Fire offers a hint about one.",NEUTRAL

It must be gospel in Hollywood that every leading man reveres and studies Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning Joker performance, proven out by Jason Momoa’s outrageously flamboyant take on the aggrieved villain Dante. Often laughing maniacally at his own evil genius, Dante drives a purple car, and sports silk pants and purple nails, because: “It tones down the masculinity, which we all need these days.” This winking nod at shifting norms might be less complicated to enjoy if it wasn’t said while giving pedicures to a group of corpses. Instead, Universal is engaging in the oldest trick in the book, using flamboyance (read: queerness) to signal psychopathic supervillain. Pitted against the raging paternalism of Dom Toretto’s singular guiding purpose to protect his family at all costs, the moral edict is crystal clear.  Now 12 years old and able to sustain his own B-plot, Brian gets his own mini road movie while on the lam with Uncle Jakob (John Cena). Introduced as the tepid villain of “F9,” Dom’s long lost brother fits much more easily into the family as the good guy he was always meant to be. Tasked with keeping Brian safe, he and the kid set out on a charming little side adventure that offers a sweet diversion from the flashier antics. Cue adorable hijinks surrounding the nostalgic magic of mix tapes and lessons in swearing.  The same can’t be said for the other members of the extended family, though they certainly start things off with a bang. Running point on an operation in his namesake city Rome (a confusing choice), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) heads up the dream team of longtime favorites Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sun Kang), and recently introduced hacktivist Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). But the for-hire job ends up being a trap set by Dante in order to lure Dom to come to their rescue. When a truck of what they think is computer chips ends up carrying a massive bomb, suddenly a simple heist turns into a world-saving mission.  With their old CIA contact Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) mysteriously in the wind, Dom and the family find themselves the target of unsympathetic new boss Aimes (Alan Ritchson). Luckily, Dom is saved by a rogue agent determined to fulfill her father’s legacy, a cheerful but competent Brie Larson as his new CIA ally Tess. Defying her shifty new meathead of a superior Aimes, Tess tracks down Letty in a remote black-ops site, reuniting her with her old pal Cipher for an epic escape and survival plan.  With Dante’s fixation on proving to Dom that family isn’t forever, motivated by his back story, it’s only natural that the climactic battle end in an epic chase for Brian’s survival. Dom has to make some sacrifices along the way, but not before yet again landing a race car from a moving plane, and driving full speed down the side of a Hoover-sized dam. The action delivers, but the film‘s third act suffers from an excess of set-ups, cameos, and minor deaths played up as major losses. After all, they have (at least) two more to go.

"May 17, 2023"," Fast X almost immediately begins on the wrong note, setting the stage for Jason Momoa's big villain and the plot of this movie by replaying a major sequence from Fast Five. This is designed to catch audiences up on where things are in the world of this franchise, but also to retcon the existence of Momoa's character as having been waiting in the wings ever since the events of that movie. What this ends up doing, however, is showcasing one of the best set pieces from the entire series almost in full for the audience. It also reveals how few ideas there actually are for the rest of Fast X, because even the action beats are retreads with new paint jobs.  Picking up from F9, the family is all together again and prepping their next globe-hopping adventure. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is leading a crew made up of Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) on a mission to Rome that quickly reveals itself to have been a trap set by Dante (Momoa). As a result, the family is fractured, scattered to the wind through contrivances that only happen because that was the pre-agreed-upon plot for the movie. Clocking in at about two hours and twenty minutes, this side-story consists of maybe forty minutes of the entire movie, and contributes minimally overall.  One might consider that, thematically, separating Dom from his family is a good idea for the tenth movie in a series to try and reinvent itself, but the series already did this with The Fate of the Furious, and it already had a decades-long revenge plot just two years ago with F9. In short, the wheels are spinning in more ways than one. To make matters worse, almost none of the sequences with the cast that aren't Vin Diesel amount to anything throughout the entire movie, with all roads leading to nowhere. The group of four from Rome is sent on a goose chase that includes such pointless pit stops as a Pete Davidson-run internet cafe, while Jordana Brewster pops up in two scenes total. John Cena appears opposite the young Leo Abelo Perry as little Brian, Dom's son. The wrestler-turned-actor is starring in an entirely different movie from everyone else, as his baby-sitting scenes take on a tone that is antithetical to literally every other sequence.  Fast X is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously, even mocking its own brand of machismo. Momoa contributes to this in spades, naturally, but newcomer Alan Ritchson is introduced to the series with a memorable sequence that recaps the entire franchise to date. Ritchson's Agent Aimes delivers this extended monologue about the family by not only recalling their escalating feats from thieves and racers to super spies that once went to space, but by delivering one of the best lines in series history: ""If it violates the laws of God and gravity, they did it twice."" Very funny! You're in on the joke like we are! Unfortunately, Vin Diesel continues to strut around with his jaw wired into a grimace, confronting every ounce of fun with a dour look that fights against the movie's instincts to just have a good time.  Another key issue is the movie's cast. The Fast franchise is already filled to the brim with characters, but Fast X, of course, has to add even more – and because the cup is running over at this point, a lot of them are given thankless pursuits. Four Academy Award-winning women appear in Fast X – Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Rita Moreno, and Brie Larson. The only one with any scenes that really matter in this is Theron's Cipher. To make it even more thankless, her role in the movie is just introducing Momoa's character into the present day before being shuttled off to a B-plot that only sets up what's to come (though that B-plot does feature maybe the only title card in film history that earns the laugh it's aiming for).  All of these problems compound in the film's conclusion, and, though no spoilers will be confirmed here, there is an underlying issue with how it chooses to end ahead of Fast X Part 2, or whatever the next one ends up being called. How can the audience feel any of the stakes that happen at one moment in the movie's ending when the very next scene is one that confirms previous stakes didn't matter at all? It's an issue baked into a series that's made it this far, but Fast X shines a spotlight on it in a major way. ",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Universal doesn’t have X-wings, they have cars that sometimes fly. They don’t have superheroes, they have street racers from Los Angeles who steal VCRs and nuclear subs. With so many filmmakers taking the po-faced, gritty approach to keeping old favorite characters and series relevant in recent years, the Fast and Furious franchise’s open and growing embrace of nonsensical mayhem has been a delight. 2021’s F9 managed to pull off multiple outrageous action scenes based on the magic of magnets. It sent Tyrese and Ludacris to space in a Pontiac. It told us John Cena was Vin Diesel’s brother with a straight face, and we believed it. Or at least, those of us who were willing to suspend enough of our disbelief to go along for the wild ride. But it turns out there’s only so much mileage you can get out of that kind of absurdity without touching grass. The roaring joy of F9 gives way to the cacophonous Fast X, a sprawling and overstuffed opening salvo of a planned multi-part finale which stuffs a potato in the series’ tailpipe. It’s redeemed almost single-handedly by a deeply weird and very entertaining villain performance from Jason Momoa. It was all the way back in 2011 that Fast Five saw Hobbs chasing Brian and Dom while they were towing drug lord Hernan Reyes' safe through Rio. It was a watershed moment of cartoon logic worming its way into a formerly self-serious series, which paired best with a can of Axe body spray and a copy of Need for Speed Underground 2 on the PS2. And you know what? The movies that followed were mostly the better for it. There’s vulnerability and risk in significantly shifting the tone of a franchise midstream, and few could’ve imagined watching the 2001 original that not only would the Fast movies take that risk at all, but be so successful in transitioning it to something uniquely bombastic. As this series is wont to do, Fast X sloppily reveals that Hernan’s son Dante (Jason Momoa) was actually present during that whole chase scene and, after seeing his family’s ill-gotten fortune destroyed and his father killed, has re-emerged to wage war on Dom (Vin Diesel) - the ringleader of the world’s premier group of car thieves/international spies - promising no death while suffering is owed. His revenge motivation may be clear, and Fast X hammers his Anti-Dom foil status home at every turn, but the ways in which Dante brings that vengeance to bear on the Fast Family are as erratic as Dante himself. It’s only through the technology and mercenary forces that he is somehow able to amass that he’s able to do much of anything. He wants to make Dom suffer by hurting his family, but routinely ignores opportunities to twist that knife in ways that read as less patiently sadistic and more just… ineffective.  The looseness of the character demanded an actor ready to exploit that in their performance, and Jason Momoa showed up to set hungry. Dante’s effectiveness as an antagonist aside, the boundless chaos energy Momoa sustains throughout the entirety of Fast X is the one consistently enjoyable element. There’s no other way to say it: Dante’s a real freak, and Momoa flies that flag with gusto. It feels like he’s marathoned all these movies and parodies Dom’s machismo and predictable logic at every turn, both to Dom’s face and he’s completely alone. It’s the private moments of goatee-twirling that set Dante apart from other villains in the series to date, and Momoa deserves a huge amount of credit for keeping Fast X from sinking under its own weight.  Dom Torretto, by comparison, feels like he’s just drifting from one rumination on the meaning of family to another, and Vin Diesel feels checked out any time Momoa isn’t actively forcing him to push Dom in a different direction, as opposed to regurgitating what we’ve heard before.  None of Fast X’s clumsily orchestrated car Rube Goldbergs manage much of an identity of their own either, and that’s a shattering disappointment for a series that has historically found new and interesting ways to move vehicles through time and space and explosions. Multiple action scenes feel like rehashes of previous movies - remember when Hobbs and Shaw played tug of war with a helicopter? Well, now Dom’s gonna do the same thing with two helicopters! Does it escalate things? Yes. Is it stunningly original? It is not. It’s not a great bellwether for the symphonies of motorized mayhem that the hand-to-hand fights (especially one featuring Charlize Theron’s Cipher) feel like welcome shakeups. Dante’s weird sacrilegious scheme to roll a bomb through Rome to the Vatican represents the most satisfying action sequence – thanks again largely to Momoa’s unpredictability, and yet there’s a whole lot of movie left after that which can’t escalate the thrills any further. Director Louis Leterrier doesn’t succeed much at celebrating either the maximalism or the melodrama of the series, and it leaves Fast X feeling rather confused in both arenas. Dante’s attack on Rome forces the Family to initiate Ghost Protocol (or whatever the Fast equivalent of that is) and split up, setting the Agency on their tail and fragmenting the plot into way more perspectives on the action than the story has material for. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges”), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) continue their bickering support act, with Han (Sung Kang) tagging along because he had nothing else going on that day. Fast X grinds to a halt whenever it has to shift focus back to what feels more and more like a budding Peacock series in the wings. We’re only ever checking in on that group so Ramsey can spout some technobabble exposition while Roman and Tej slapfight and argue over hurt feelings caused by bobbleheads, or so that we have a reason to move the action to a city where another extraneous member of the ensemble can have their next mission set into motion.  John Cena’s Jakob is on babysitting duty for most of Fast X, and even though his corner of the story feels as inessential as the other supporters’, Cena’s ace comedic chops and chemistry with Little Brian actor Leo Abelo Perry are a welcome change from the forced schtick of Roman’s crew. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) gets sidelined, stranded in what is at once a prison of her character’s function being reduced to Dom worship and, you know, an actual prison. No one has anything meaningful of their own going on, and so time spent away from either Dom or Dante, or without solidly engaging action, gets harder and harder to justify.  There are certainly flashes of the camaraderie this group of performers share but, with the subplots feeling totally disconnected from each other, the recurring check-ins don’t really add anything of value. Since we already know that Fast X serves as the first of a two-part franchise finale (or three-part finale, if you believe Vin Diesel…) its efforts to marshal characters both old and new into position for that final lap feel inorganic – shoehorned in, even, for a series which has always celebrated return appearances and new seats at the proverbial dinner table. And like so many “Part One”s before it, Fast X forgoes – or, forgets – any kind of resolution for its own story. The time it starts rapidly raising questions to be answered next time in the last few minutes only feels more egregious. Couldn’t we have heard what Rita Morena thought of all this mindless violence?  Fast X is the beginning of the end, but the race to the end of that beginning is a bumpy ride. Jason Momoa’s bonkers performance as Dante Reyes deserves instant canonization on the Mt. Rushmore of Fast & Furious villains, but that feels like the one differentiating element of this movie. There’s not enough barbeque at the table to go around Dom Toretto’s ever-growing family, and director Louis Leterrier isn’t able to walk the tightrope between excess and self-awareness that the modern Fast films demand. There’s still time for the Fast franchise to cross the finish line in first, but this flat tire of a “part one” will make the last lap a nailbiter.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023"," What else is possibly left to say about the Fast & Furiouses? Fans excitedly devour each new installment with an oxymoronic combination of total earnestness and eye-rolling ironic detachment, laughing heartily at every invocation of “family” even while claiming to be moved. Every reality-defying action gag or nonsensical plot twist draws applause specifically because it’s hitting their pleasure centers dead on. It’s no fun to have to deny the cinematic joy that these movies are allegedly mainlining, but that doesn’t change the fact that, even by the standards of this endless franchise, Fast X is possibly the worst entry yet. Whether or not one thought F9’s journey into space represented some kind of shark-jump, this is the first one to not seriously up the fantastical or logistical ante, even while it sinks deeper and deeper into insisting that you care about these people who longer have any real character dimensions to speak of. Anyways, let’s reorient a bit. At the end of Fast Five, Dom (Vin Diesel, you remember) and the gang stole a giant bank vault filled with drug cartel cash and dragged it through the streets of Rio. Now, the son of the cartel boss, Dante (Jason Momoa), is out for revenge, and for some reason that means stealing the private mercenary army of Cypher (Charlize Theron), the baddie from Fate of the Furious, and framing the crew for attempting to detonate what’s described as a 20-kiloton neutron bomb at the Vatican (don’t worry, it explodes harmlessly in a river, somehow not wiping out the entire city of Rome). Now, they’re being chased by Aimes (Alan Ritchson), the head of “The Agency,” while getting a little help from Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of Kurt Russell’s supposedly gone super–spy, Mr. Nobody (part of this cinematic world since part seven). Sure, fine — obligatory convoluted setup complete. But what follows is truly, depressingly perfunctory: endless exposition followed by the hollowest of allegedly comic scenes, characters with absolutely nothing to do but constantly beat their chests at each other for no reason, constant ADR-ed dialogue “spoken” by the backs of people’s heads, and lots and lots of crushed cars. At one point, a group of our pals wonder aloud, “How are we going to get [insert tech gibberish] in London?” despite having done exactly that in multiple previous movies, and then they just wander into a random scene involving a Pete Davidson cameo, a pissing contest between two of the characters, and someone eating a “special muffin.” To top it off, all of that is entirely forgotten, and they don’t get what they came for. It’s obviously a fool’s errand to ding the Fast & Furious movies for being too silly or too underwritten. The problem is that underwritten stupidity would be just fine if there was anything the least bit thrilling otherwise going on. The action sequences in Fast X are sub-Marvel levels of generic — just a mess of cruddy CGI, pointless cutting, and undercranked shots of caravans of cars driving in a straight line. There’s absolutely nothing compelling to be found, just endless franchise-established visual motifs of the laziest quality. Worse, the hand-to-hand combat sequences saddle really talented and overqualified performers like Michelle Rodriguez and Theron with the worst kind of poorly-covered, second-unit dogshit. It’s frankly embarrassing. Director Louis Leterrier — a second choice after exasperated franchise maestro Justin Lin ankled the project a week into shooting… wonder why? — is usually a sturdy if not particularly gifted craftsman of action, but it’s clear that these films aren’t actually so much directed as they are assembled. In fact, this latest entry seems to be cobbled together entirely out of spare parts, perhaps the first instance of something that could have realistically been generated entirely by AI. Fast X marks a depressing nadir for the monolithic franchise.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," If family is everything to the Fast & Furious films – as lead lunkhead Vin Diesel would surely posit – then Fast X is a nuclear family reunion that goes atomic. The latest film in a remarkable megafranchise that is as gloriously stupid as it is stupidly glorious, this new entry is overflowing with burst-artery affection for its many fathers, mothers, sons, daughters and capital-F family members both real and metaphorical. While the first F&F movie was the cinematic equivalent of a backyard BBQ, Fast X is a love-in so magnificently huge that it can only be stadium-sized. Ten films deep – 11 if we’re counting Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, which we definitely are – you should already know by now whether the F&F films are your speed. Gravity-defying chases, skull-crunching fights, extra-gooey melodrama, copious shots of women’s butts and lots of Diesel’s marble-mouth mumbling about saving his fam: These are the high-gloss elements baked into the brand’s bones. The question that a new F&F chapter must answer, then, is whether it can pull off all that violent sexy nonsense with a renewed sense of energy, vigour, inventiveness and more self-aware ridiculousness than the instalment before it. This is not a movie requiring discipline, but out-of-control relentlessness. Go crazy, or go home, bro. Thankfully, and against all industry and existential odds, Fast X hits like a souped-up Dodge Charger whose engine runs on rocket fuel – a beast that knows no brakes. Once it starts, you’re strapped in till the jaws of life (the end credits) can set you free. And true blockbuster fanatics – audiences who can check their brains at the door with no compunction – will thank our lord and saviour Vin for every shard of twisted metal. Opening with a retcon of the franchise’s still-best chapter, 2011′s Fast Five, Fast X finds a new villain in Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of the Rio de Janeiro crime lord who Dom Toretto (Diesel) and his family of do-gooding thieves ripped off a decade ago. Turns out that Dante is still holding a grudge, and is now on the hunt for revenge, targeting Dom’s young son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), as well as anyone who might have collaborated with the crew over the years. This includes Dom’s wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), buddies Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris Bridges) and Han (Sung Kang), plus such foes-turned-friends as superhacker Cipher (Charlize Theron) and Dom’s once-estranged brother, the jacked mercenary Jakob (John Cena). Dante’s superevil plan is so dependent on everything going just exactly right that it recalls the “oh, c’mon now” antics of the Joker in The Dark Knight – a thread that Momoa seems particularly keen on picking up as he plays his Fast X villain as if Heath Ledger replaced his war-paint makeup and green hair dye in Christopher Nolan’s film with toenail polish and pink scrunchies. Momoa is having such a decadently flamboyant time here that his performance as the genderqueer psychopath Dante skates right past swishy stereotype into something resembling highbrow lunacy. In the same way that Dwayne Johnson injected the F&F franchise with a battalion’s worth of testosterone in Fast Five, Momoa electrifies the series with a jolt of unpredictable energy that takes the enterprise to new, heretofore unimaginably ludicrous heights. The rest of the story, it may not surprise you to learn, doesn’t make a lick of sense, even by F&F’s notoriously loose narrative standards. With Dom on the run for much of the film, his friends separated by circumstances both convenient and incoherent, it feels as if the plot’s splintered structure might have simply been Diesel’s vainglorious excuse to give himself more solo screen time. But in actuality, carving out separate globe-trotting stories for the series’ sprawling cast ends up showcasing everyone’s individual strengths. Once you start to think of Fast X as the Avengers: Infinity War of the F&F-verse, it all clicks. So, Roman and Tej get a banter-heavy buddy comedy in London that coasts on Tyrese and Bridges’s easy chemistry. Jakob is tasked with playing bodyguard to Little Brian, giving Cena the kind of gentle-giant comedy that the charming slab of beef excels at. And Letty finds herself in a prison-break thriller with Cipher, allowing Rodriguez and Theron to do what they always do best: beat everyone up, including each other. And if that’s not enough, Diesel has persuaded not one, not two, but three way-beyond-this actresses (Rita Moreno, Brie Larson and returning player Helen Mirren) to come along for the ride, too. The film’s ambitions are as big as Diesel’s biceps. But Fast X is all the more impressive given that it shouldn’t exist. Not in the existential sense – though that, too – but more in how regular F&F director Justin Lin abandoned the project shortly into shooting last year, reportedly no longer able to cope with Diesel’s many demands. For a moment, it felt like the film might fall apart or perhaps become the first studio tent pole to be directed by AI (it’ll happen eventually). Yet French director Louis Leterrier, best known for his Jason Statham-starring Transporter films and recruited in a studio-panic move that feels unprecedented, has made an F&F movie that is both a one-upped continuation of the franchise and a deeply affectionate, powerfully weird tribute to the series itself. Leterrier’s dual ambition is best illustrated during a mid-film scene in which Dom’s new secret-agent pal, played by Larson, meets up with her hard-headed boss (Alan Ritchson) to recap the gang’s previous exploits. After exchanging some deep-groan, exposition-heavy banter (the dialogue here is as bad as it’s ever been), the pair pause to watch clips of Dom’s various races and heists that don’t for a second pretend to be culled from, say, security-camera or newsreel footage. These are instead real-deal movie scenes ripped from the earlier F&F flicks and pasted into the new film, a bizarre bit of meta-cinema that is both narratively lazy and aesthetically inspired. It is, like much of Fast X, so stupid that it works. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe sputters and Star Wars can’t seem to get its act together on the big screen, F&F is a kind of blockbuster balm. You can choose your friends, and you can choose your enemies. But you can’t choose your family. If you’re already with Dom and his brood, you’re with them for life. Ride or die.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Vin Diesel and his ever-growing “family” return for a tenth instalment of the Fast & Furious franchise, with the signature staples of speedy vehicles, increasingly outrageous stunts and epic punch-ups all very much present and correct. Conceived as the first half of a two-part finale, Fast X is a frankly obscene amount of fun, making it one of the best films in the series so far. This time round, Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and their team of fast-car enthusiasts – tech expert Tej (Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges), motor-mouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson), hacking genius Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuelle) and expert drifter Han (Sung Kang) – are lured into a trap by Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), who’s seeking revenge for the events of Fast Five, when Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) dragged his family vault through the streets of Rio (helpfully repeated, in case you missed that one). Accordingly, Dante stages an elaborate homage by rolling a giant neutron bomb through the streets of Rome, the fallout of which essentially frames Dom and his team as terrorists. Pursued by various forms of law enforcement, including The Agency they usually work for, Dom and his team find themselves in different parts of the globe: Dom heads to Rio to try and track down Dante and ends up in a familiar-looking street race; Letty is captured by police and ends up sharing a black site prison with arch enemy Cipher (Charlize Theron); and Tej, Roman, Ramsey and Han head for London to call in some favours, while “Uncle Jakob” (John Cena) is tasked with keeping Dom and Letty’s adorable young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) one step ahead of Dante’s men. Jason Momoa proves an inspired choice as Dante, and he throws himself into the role with great gusto, clearly enjoying every second of it. As a result, he’s a flambouyant, somewhat androgynous and delightfully camp villain, whose delivery of the line, “I’m Dante, enchanté” is worth the price of admission alone. There are other new characters this time round too – including Brie Larsen as the daughter of Agency honcho Mr Nobody, rising star Daniela Melchior as a street racer with a connection to Dom’s past and Alan Ritchson as new Agency head Ames – but they’re all left floundering in Momoa’s wake when it comes to scene-stealing and creating memorable moments (it’s hard to beat Momoa having tea with two dead henchmen in that regard). In terms of the rest of the cast, they all know their characters inside out at this point, and their easy rapport reflects that – thankfully their back-and-forth banter has had a bit of a touch up since the dismal dialogue of the previous movie. On a similar note, it’s pleasing to see that the problems with John Cena’s character have been fixed – this time round his Jakob is much closer to Cena’s established comedy screen persona, rather than the po-faced hunk of no fun that he was last time round. Over the course of the last few movies, the series has become known for surprise guest appearances from previous stars. That’s the case here too, although fans of Jason Statham – who features heavily in the trailer – should prepare themselves for disappointment, as he’s effectively only in two scenes. The key question, however, is whether or not the film delivers in the outstanding stunts department, and on that score, the answer is a resounding yes. Director Louis Leterrier delivers spectacular set-piece after spectacular set-piece, with stunts so jaw-droppingly outrageous, they will make you laugh out loud. On that score, the early sequence in Rome is something of an all-timer, particularly when it comes to a moment of pure genius that involves a crane. Other highlights include Dom casually driving his car out of an aeroplane and an object lesson in what to do if you’re being chased by two helicopters. Leterrier also proves he can stage a punch-up with the best of them – the inevitable scrap between Letty and Cipher is yet another highlight, vicious and thrilling in equal measure. In addition, he gets the tone exactly right and maintains a suitably breakneck pace throughout, ensuring the film never drags, even at a posterior-troubling two hours and twenty minutes. In short, this is a thoroughly entertaining entry in the Fast and Furious series that will leave you wanting more. Oh, and stick around for a crowd-pleasing mid-credits sting, if you like that sort of thing.",POSITIVE

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. ‘No one starts at the finish line’ growls Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) at young son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) in this latest iteration of the Fast & Furious saga. And with nine films, one spin-off, and over 21 hours of tyre-squealing mayhem preceding it, you might well question the wisdom of making this instalment your entry point.  In effect, though, that’s what Louis Leterrier has done by taking over the directorial reins just as the franchise heads into its final straight. And a good thing too: the Transporter/Incredible Hulk helmer brings a welcome injection of energy and inventiveness to a series that has spent eight years striving to match up to the emotional and dramatic highpoint that was 2015’s Furious 7. But it’s an even earlier episode – 2011’s Fast Five – that provides the spark for Fast X, as it returns to that film’s audacious Rio safe heist to reveal the hitherto unknown role played by one Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). Turns out it was Dante’s dad that Dom robbed and he’s been hungry for vengeance ever since – something he hopes to attain by striking at the extended ‘family’ the Torettos hold so dear. After all the muscle-bound baddies the Fasts have given us, it’s undoubtedly refreshing to see a villain as flamboyantly hirsute as Momoa’s sadistic show-off. Although some of the character’s wilder excesses do somewhat diminish the threat level in favour of OTT laughs (notably when he’s found painting the toenails of a decomposing corpse).  Happily, the film’s on much more firm footing when alluding to its antagonists’ spiritual convictions, with Dom and the demonic Dante’s personal war going so far as to place the Vatican in peril. Indeed, it’s a central set piece involving a giant bomb rolling through Rome that gives X its most X-hilarating moments, recalling both the bouncing projectiles from The Dam Busters and the boulder chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark. With a massive ensemble to play with and new characters to introduce, it’s inevitable that some cast members (Brie Larson’s Agency operative Tess among them) get a little shortchanged. But with Fast XI on the cards for 2025, there’s still time to shine as brightly as John Cena does here as Brian’s genially protective uncle: a retooled part that fits him far better than the nefarious one he took in 2021’s F9.

"May 17, 2023"," Jason Momoa plays Dante Reyes, seeking vengeance on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, in “Fast X,” the 10th in the “Fast and the Furious” franchise. (Photo by Peter Mountain, courtesy of Universal Pictures.) The “Fast and Furious” franchise long ago was considered critic-proof, and in the last few installments has become critic-hostile — being so deliberately ridiculous and logic-averse that it flaunts its audience-pandering incredulity as a badge of honor. But even by the franchise’s harebrained standards — a submarine in “The Fate of the Furious,” space travel in “F9: The Fast Saga” — the newest installment, “Fast X,” sets a new standard for automotive silliness. Much of this is attributable not to the ever-growing cast of regulars who surround star Vin Diesel, but to the scene-stealing performance of Jason Momoa as this installment’s supervillain, Dante Reyes. Momoa’s flamboyance — flouncy shirts, a gag about nail polish, and a line of banter that makes Nathan Lane look butch — seems designed to be a counterweight to the revved-up machismo of Diesel and male co-stars Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and Sung Kang. It doesn’t always work, but Momoa is the one constant in the movie. We meet Momoa’s Dante in a prologue, set 10 years ago and retconning “Fast Five,” providing that film’s Rio drug lord villain (Joaquin de Almeida) a son (Dante) we never knew he had. Dante has made its mission not just to kill Diesel’s Dominic Toretto, whom he blames for his father’s death, but to make him suffer by going after everyone who means anything to him. Dante starts his work in Rome, where Dom’s cohorts Roman (Gibson), Tej (Bridges), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Kang) have a mission to heist some high-tech doohickey. The details don’t matter, because it’s a trap set by Dante to release a giant bomb headed for the Vatican, and putting the blame on Dom’s crew in the process.  Soon, Dom and his “family” are on the outs with The Agency, the shadowy U.S. spy organization with whom they have worked previously. The Agency’s leader, Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell in previous installments) is nowhere to be found, and the new boss, Aimes (Alan Ritchson), is cutting them no slack. The only person in The Agency on Dom’s side is Mr. Nobody’s daughter, Tess (played by Brie Larson, who’s new to the franchise). Dom gets separated from his “family” (the word gets used a lot here), and several threads run in parallel — often with members of the crew having to make uneasy alliances with former villains. Dom’s wife, Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), ends up in an Agency black site alongside Cipher (Charlize Theron), the baddie from “Fate of the Furious.” Roman’s group goes to London, and faces Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) — who thought he had killed Han after the end credits of “Fast & Furious 6.” And the previous movie’s villain, Dom’s younger brother Jakob (John Cena), now on the side of good, has the most important task of all: Protecting Dom’s son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). Director Louis Leterrier (“Now You See Me,” “The Transporter”) takes over the franchise from Justin Lin (who shares screenwriting credit here with Dan Mazeau), and keeps many of the series’ traditions. There are exotic locales (Rome, Rio, London and Portugal are mentioned here). There are moments where everything stops dead to explain the backstory from nine previous movies. There is one street-racing scene, featuring many young women in booty shorts leaning over the cars. There are villains turned heroes, and good guys turned villains. There is the return of a character we had long thought dead — which happened previously with both Letty and Han. There are mentions of Mia’s husband and Dom’s best friend Brian, alive in the canon even though the actor, Paul Walker, died nearly 10 years ago. And there is Dom’s Dodge Charger, defying laws of traffic, gravity and physics. There are small joys sprinkled through the film. Rita Moreno classes up the opening scenes as Dom’s grandmother. Helen Mirren does the same, as Shaw’s mum, for exactly one scene. And I would watch an entire movie built around Daniela Melchoir’s character, a Rio street racer with a connection to Dom. What’s missing from “Fast X,” after all the excitement of cars speeding, helicopters crashing and fireballs expanding, is an ending. The filmmakers have said “Fast X” will be the start of a story arc that will wrap up this 22-year-old franchise — but it will likely be a trilogy. That means we have to wait to see how this movie’s cliffhangers get resolved. My guess is they’ll pick the most preposterous option available. Opens Friday, May 19, in theaters everywhere. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material. Running time: 141 minutes.",POSITIVE

"May 17, 2023"," The ninth Fast & Furious movie, released in 2021, bundled its gearhead heroes into a rocket car and literally shot them into space. And that, you may argue, is as far as this franchise could ever possibly go. After brushing fingertips with the cosmos, you can only realistically go down. But the greatest mistake anyone could make with these movies is to assume they have any interest in our feeble, earthborn rules. Fast & Furious isn’t merely an action series – it’s Twin Peaks if David Lynch had guzzled nitromethane before calling action. Fast X isn’t driven by an impetus to “go bigger” but to “go more insane”. And while the crew may not visit outer space this time around – or ride dinosaurs or discover Atlantis, or any of the other wild predictions that have circulated around the internet lately – this biblically-scaled soap opera will happily rewrite the laws of gravity and physiology just to put a smile on its audience’s faces. And Fast X, in particular, is better than many of the series’s most recent instalments. It starts with a heist in Rome that involves an RC Racer, a gold Lamborghini and 12 canisters of laughing gas. A gigantic, spherical bomb then rolls, while on fire, through the city’s cobbled streets and straight towards the Vatican. It ends with the TNT-packed mother of all cliffhangers. The plot, let’s be honest, is arbitrary. Remember back in The Fate of the Furious (2017), when Charlize Theron’s Cipher was introduced as the ultimate baddie and most nefarious of masterminds? Well, never mind, because here she rocks up at the house of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) with a warning that the actual ultimate baddie and most nefarious of masterminds is a guy called Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). He’s the son of former Fast villain Hernan Reyes and here gets retroactively inserted into the climactic high-speed, safe-dragging car chase of Fast Five (2011). Dante’s vengeful crusade, which he apparently waited a decade to do anything about, is so all-consuming that he’ll happily go after everyone and anyone who’s been recruited into what one disgruntled authority figure describes as “a cult with cars”. What’s borderline miraculous is that, despite a cast list that’s on track to soon reach the population size of Luxembourg, director Louis Leterrier keeps everything relatively in check. He’s taking over here from series regular Justin Lin, who departed several weeks into production, reportedly over creative differences with Diesel. It feels like the only real guidance Leterrier gave his actors was to have fun and be themselves. Momoa is the film’s MVP by a country mile, playing Dante as an opera-warbling, knife-sucking, pink-scrunchie enthusiast. He giggles his way through the whole film. Brie Larson, as a sympathetic intelligence operative, turns up to a climactic fight wearing silver sequinned trainers and armed with a shotgun. She seems overjoyed to be playing in this particular sandbox. John Cena, miserable before as Dom’s long-lost brother, is now the goofball we know and love him to be. Theron finally gets to throw a punch. Sung Kang’s Han is actually allowed to contribute. So don’t ever say that the Fast & Furious films don’t care about their audience. This is the cinematic equivalent of ice cream for dinner. Dir: Louis Leterrier. Starring: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jason Momoa, John Cena, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, Brie Larson. 12A, 141 minutes.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," If you like fight scenes, fast cars and great actresses appearing for brief periods to give exposition, do I have a movie for you. Fast X asks you to shift your brain into low gear, power over a bumpy road of uneven dialogue, and hang on for some tight turns and incredible leaps—in the air and in logic. A film must be satisfying enough to overcome the demerits of whatever stupidity enables its fun factor. Your mileage will vary greatly depending on your personal appetite for sequel sludge, but if you’re the sort of person considering watching a Fast & Furious movie, you’re probably the sort of person that will enjoy it. Earnest dollars and ironic ones spend the same. Fast X is not an example of tight action cinema, nor is it an expression of how violence can be art. It is largesse in the service of wowing audience members—its greatest feat is the audacity it wields to impress. After expository archival footage, the opening barbecue creates a clearer direct connection between the family and the “Agency” they take missions from, which is soon thereafter severed by the plot. That severing is handled by Aimes (Alan Ritchson, who played Arthur Curry on Smallville, giving the film two Aquaman connections) after the family shares a botched mission in Rome with Mr. Nobody’s (Kurt Russell) former second-in-command Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood). They’re set up by Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa, the second Aquaman connection), the son of the late Río de Janeiro drug kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), on a revenge mission a decade in the making. Aimes gives Mr. Nobody’s missing-in-action daughter Tess (Brie Larson) highlights of the last two decades of Fast & Furious films (literal shots from the previous movies, as if the real-life camera crew was working for the Agency), noting the team’s humble beginnings and securing a capture-or-kill order from a council of shadowy profiles—images on screens, like the folks who ordered the nukes at the end of the first Avengers. Then it’s off to the races, as the playfully deranged psychopath and the extrajudicial governmental agency chase the drivers with superpowered cars.  A welcome and all-to-brief return to the world of street racing is shot and edited to feel both like a throwback and like it’s a commercial for the film—disruptive when it should feel cohesive. There are explosions, surprise cameos and advertised bit parts, gleeful death-dealing by a child and, of course, a cliffhanger. Fast X doesn’t completely do away with practical stunts and camerawork, a blessing considering the film’s frequent overreliance on CGI. The car and bike chases maintain tension, and the constant raising of stakes may have you nodding like a sicko as often as shaking your head at the impossibility of it all. But Fast X isn’t flawless, even for aficionados of over-the-top action blockbusters. Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty is very compelling doing physics-defying motorcycle driving, though insurance no longer allows her to do her own stunts like she did early in her career, but Vin Diesel’s best acting days were probably left in the ‘00s, between Saving Private Ryan and the first iteration of this franchise, when he felt he had something to prove. Here, he’s overshadowed by better supporting performers. Larson shines when on screen, but feels wasted in a surprisingly small role. Nathalie Emmanuel overpowers every poorly-written line with elegant delivery, expression and sheer force of will, selling pathos while surrounded by escalating absurdity. Charlize Theron and John Cena match their superior acting chops with their superior believability as combatants. And Ludacris and Tyrese’s confrontational bromance continues unabated. As expected, though, Momoa is the star of the show, strutting, chewing scenery and being playful with gender in a way this series desperately needs. Dante is the only F&F character even halfway glancing at not conforming to heteronormativity since Chad Lindberg’s Jesse had painted nails in the first film. Does music from The Nutcracker play after Dante name-checks it? You bet. Is Momoa doing enough of a Joker thing to feel like he was inspired by Ledger and Nicholson without outright stealing from them? Sure is. He’s brilliant, deranged, menacing—the sort of person that would be terrifying to meet in real life. Meanwhile, Diesel sells admirably self-serious, unfortunately clunky dialogue. In addition, the camera repeatedly zooms in on his familiar pursed-lip grimace to ensure us of Dom’s seriousness. If you’ve seen one of these movies since Furious 7, it isn’t a spoiler to say he’s also got super strength in addition to being so good at driving that he can defy logic and gravity with pure machismo. Though Diesel’s role as producer apparently precludes anyone besting him in combat (Dom has seldom been in any serious physical jeopardy since he was arrested at the end of the fourth film), it doesn’t seem like there are many other ideas he says no to. Justin Lin (replaced as director mid-production by Louis Leterrier) is one of four other credited producers (and one of two credited writers). There are parts early in Fast X where the music nearly overpowers the dialogue in the sound mix. Considering the state of the dialogue (Rodriguez, especially, is done few favors), this might be a preferable experience if the musical choices were more daring, but it doesn’t help with plot clarity. Granted, the story of the film itself grows unkempt from a relatively simple premise, the twists and turns coming from myriad reprises, cameos and double-crosses. While the tone is generally consistent, the franchise’s bloat may serve as evidence that Fast X would have been better with fewer cooks in the kitchen. Fast X doesn’t contradict itself as much as some of its genre-mates, but it increasingly strains credulity. Physics and mortality are abstract, hypothetical concepts: When everyone that dies can and will come back, death is a concern for the characters that the audience may struggle to take seriously. This is movie magic, and we only know one thing to be true: Family is everything. (Only the protagonist family though; any families that might be held hostage to coerce henchman cooperation don’t count.) Considering we went to space in the last film in a rocket-propelled Pontiac Fiero, it feels difficult to say that Fast X goes too far. And yet, it is an unbelievable experience. It is a continuing escalation of the Fast films echoing the “so bad it’s good” vibe of a bygone era of B-movies, augmented by a nine-figure production budget. If you haven’t bought into the franchise by now, this is as good a time as any, which means it’s as bad a time as any. This is unabashedly a film for the fans—ahem, the family. It will make billions; I wish studios tried to make something else. Kevin Fox, Jr. is a freelance writer with an MA in history, who loves videogames, film, TV, and sports, and dreams of liberation.

"May 17, 2023"," No one expects realism when it comes to Fast & Furious. Long gone are the days when Dominic Toretto and his crew boosted illegal DVDs. Now, the franchise is a globe-trotting tentpole that stands alongside the titans of action franchises. At least, that’s what Vin Diesel thinks.  For a series that’s all about the dumb popcorn fun of throwing cars out of planes, its star takes Fast & Furious strangely seriously. And without longtime writer Chris Morgan on board nor franchise veterans like Justin Lin holding him back, Diesel brings this self-serious attitude to Fast X with the help of Transporter director Louis Leterrier. The result is a ludicrous, patchwork blockbuster that strains the limits of even Fast & Furious reality. It only took us 10 movies, but Fast & Furious has become a parody of itself.  Fast X takes us 10 years back to the events of Fast Five and the chase sequence that changed the trajectory of the franchise: the bank vault heist. Only, it’s not the heist you remember. Intercut with footage from the 2011 film are extremely goofy scenes of Jason Momoa’s Dante, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, who was definitely there the whole time. Dante dutifully follows his father’s orders and gives chase to Dom and Brian (the late Paul Walker), but things quickly go south. Dante is thrown into the river and nearly dies, while his father is killed in Dom and Brian’s escape. Dante blames Dom for his father’s death and his family’s loss of fortune, thus kicking off the scheme that will force Dom to go through the greatest, most devastating reckoning he’s ever faced. Kind of. Despite the sky-high stakes of the film, which turns Dom and his crew into international fugitives after they’re framed for bombing half of Rome, 85 percent of Fast X is cartoonish hijinks. The rest of it is made of Diesel buying into his own delusions that Dom Toretto is a cinematic god — and that Fast & Furious is reshaping the pop culture landscape in its image. It’s almost endearing the way that Fast X builds up Dom to be some kind of new American mythic figure, one whose legacy is spoken of in hushed whispers or who’s treated as a cult-like leader by the secondary antagonist and new Agency leader Aimes (Alan Ritchson, instantly charismatic). But despite the movie’s many monologues spouted by villains who couldn’t cut it in a Mission Impossible movie, Dom is no Ethan Hunt. And as many slow-motion shots of Dom cradling yet another wounded lady (it happens several times), Fast X can’t convince us otherwise. Fast X’s bizarrely self-serious approach might be palatable if every subplot apart from Dom’s didn’t reduce its characters to Looney Tunes versions of themselves. The B-team — consisting of Roman (Tyrese Gibson, extra grating this time around), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang who, despite the material, is refreshingly always cool) — spend most of the movie futzing around London and getting into scrapes of their own making. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez, relishing some solo time) is forced to make a wary alliance with Cipher (Charlize Theron, who finally gets to fight this time) in a half-baked prison arc. Jakob (John Cena, channeling his dopey Peacemaker performance in a sudden personality transplant) is tasked with protecting Dom’s kid Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) in an action-comedy road trip subplot. Finally, Mia (Jordana Brewster) has one fight scene and disappears…? With its many disconnected subplots, Fast X feels like four movies in one, each with a wildly different tone. But Fast & Furious has balanced an unwieldy ensemble before. The drawback to Fast X is that it has to go through the pains of introducing new characters while forcing in several surprising cameos to lead up to the grand finale. While franchise newbies like Brie Larson (who plays the daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody) and Daniela Melchior (a spunky street racer with a familial connection to Dom) are given precious little to do, Fast X’s scenery-chewing new villain more than makes up for it. Momoa’s Dante is easily the best villain of the whole franchise, with the Aquaman actor chaotically prancing from setpiece to setpiece like he’s auditioning to be the next Joker. Bold, erratic, and lewd, Momoa’s Dante shows more personality in his messily-painted pinky finger than half of the brooding Fast X cast, which only makes Diesel’s many attempts at summoning emotion through his perpetually pursed lips more laughable. Momoa knows what movie he’s in, even if Fast X has been zapped of any of the self-awareness that Justin Lin brought with his return in F9. (Louis Leterrier is reduced to a journeyman director, occasionally dropping in stylistic flourishes like the odd split diopter or lighting trick to remind people that he can direct.) Thankfully, the stunts are just as wild and ridiculous as you’d expect 10 movies into Fast & Furious. But with each newly absurd setpiece, Fast X manages to stretch the limits of the keenest Fast & Furious fan’s willingness to suspend their disbelief. Jakob and Brian Jr. jump out of a plane in a kayak. Meanwhile, Dom uses his car to play whack-a-mole during a street race and swing two helicopters into each other. Even the most impressive setpiece, in which Dom uses his car to ping-pong a giant rolling bomb through Rome, is the action-movie equivalent of Batman’s “some days you can’t get rid of a bomb!” scene. The Fast & Furious franchise has never been high art, but until now, it’s have always known what kind of entertainment it is: pure popcorn fun.  But Fast X may be a tipping point — the moment when Diesel and co. buy into their own hype and build themselves up to be cinema’s new American gods. Fast X is big, loud, dumb, and on occasion, fun. Its biggest problem is that it wants to be more.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," 
""Fast X,"" the tenth film in the ""Fast & Furious"" series, was originally announced as part one of a two-part finale for the franchise that began with street racers stealing DVD players and eventually sent them into outer space. But then, producer-star Vin Diesel suggested the finale will, in fact, be three parts, to which this reviewer must say, ""Give it up, man.""





The ""Fast & Furious"" series has long held a special place within pop culture. Its ability to blend disparate influences with multicultural casts and electrifying action, all on the back of a love for the automotive industry and a sincere exaltation of found family, has made these movies a global phenomenon. But the vast majority of these universally beloved films were directed by Justin Lin, who quit this production in May 2022, and written by Chris Morgan, whose last script credit was 2019's ""Hobbs & Shaw"" spin-off. In their place, director Louis Leterrier took the steering wheel. He had to drive an unfinished car through an obstacle course of narrative pitfalls, budgetary overages, and the unenviable responsibility that comes with shepherding a saga he didn't build to a satisfying conclusion.





While we should definitely applaud Leterrier for performing under pressure and praise him for making ""Fast X"" a largely appealing moviegoing experience, its overall execution leaves a lot to be desired. The film is disappointing enough that the idea of adding an extra feature film into the mix feels not only ill-advised, but borderline insulting.

""Fast X"" is built upon two simple concepts. The first is that Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is now a family man more concerned with teaching his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) how to drive than with whatever the next mission or heist is for him and his crew. The second is a pretty ambitious retcon of ""Fast Five."" ""Fast X"" introduces Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of the big bad from that film, who is now out to get revenge on Dom by attacking all he holds dear. The film goes to pretty deep lengths to sell both of these ideas, whether it's stunt casting Rita Moreno as Dom's grandmother or having Charlize Theron's overused villain Cipher align herself with the good guys to sell how evil this new threat is.





Unfortunately, Dom's status as the patriarch of this world is so cemented that implying it's some new wrinkle and not the thematic core of the last four movies becomes an irritating errand for the audience to endure. Moreover, as much fun as Momoa seems to be having chewing the scenery and reliving the acting choices every heavy between 2009 and 2015 made after seeing Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker, Dante proves too inconsistent an antagonist to take seriously. In one scene, he's replaying beats from prior baddies like Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). In he next, he's riffing as a sassy and effeminate fop whose skirmishes with Toretto are still leagues less homoerotic or fascinating than Dom's tension with The Rock's Luke Hobbs.





There's a ton else thrown in for good measure; the cast has grown so large that too many masters must be fed for adequate representation to be reached. But between new players like Brie Larson as Mr. Nobody's daughter Tess and old favorites like Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw returning to the fray, there's little screen time left for the earnest tough-guy poetry Diesel brings to the franchise. Even when those moments arrive, they're bookended by an inordinate amount of comic relief from Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris, to the point that the comedy isn't relieving anything and the scant few moments of genuine danger and pathos must fight to be taken seriously.
Moreover, this is all wrapped up in the real problem: We've seen all this before.

""Fast X"" opens with a lengthy sequence re-litigating the best set piece from ""Fast Five"" (which is also, arguably, the best set piece in the entire series). Every significant character moment and action sequence that follows also reiterates or homages something earlier in the franchise — but never in a way that feels additive or necessary. Outside of a pretty fun throwback racing scene set in Brazil, ""Fast X"" just regurgitates what's come before, with little energy devoted to evolving the formula. Special mention must be made of Alan Ritchson's inclusion, though: His turn as Aimes, an Agency operative who's basically a cover song version of Hobbs, feels like the only time where this weaponized deja vu serves the narrative. Everything else, however, is a wash. There's nothing wrong with a new movie in a long series repeating what's worked before, necessarily. But when nothing feels exciting or alive, a problem emerges. It's just repeated gesturing at an entertaining past that's worthier of the viewer's time. There may be enough explosions, incredulity, and fourth wall-breaking here to deceive people who hated ""F9"" into finding this an improvement. But this is also a film that wastes no time turning that film's villain, Jakob Toretto (John Cena, as maybe the most compelling figure the series has conjured in years), into a complete cartoon.  The ""Fast & Furious"" films have never been afraid to wink at the viewer, but the thing that makes them special in comparison to every other shared universe is the sense that its creators aren't ashamed to be making these movies. No matter how absurd they got, Diesel used to ground it all in Corona-soaked sincerity. Here, that gets buried under too much debris. It's unlikely adding another movie to this prolonged finale will fish the franchise's heart out from under it all.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," This tenth instalment of Universal’s high-octane automotive action franchise puts its foot on the gas early on, and doesn’t hit the brake until the end credits — and, even then, leaves things open for at least one more spin of the wheel. That’s par for the course with these films, but what does come as a surprise is just how fun this well-trodden formula can be; particularly when framed as a fan-friendly trip down memory lane as Vin Diesel’s muscled hero, former street racer Dominic Toretto, goes up against a villain with connections to his past. The Fast And The Furious hit screens in 2001, with Diesel starring alongside the late Paul Walker, and has spawned a franchise which includes nine sequels, a spin-off (2019’s Hobbs & Shaw) and an animated TV show. While it has been cumulatively extremely lucrative, only two films — 2015’s Furious 7 and 2017’s The Fate Of The Furious — have taken over $1bn at the global box office. Universal will be hoping that Fast X, which opens globally on May 19, surpasses the $726k taken by F9: The Fast Saga in 2021, and it should appeal to post-pandemic audiences hungry for big screen spectacle. A family-friendly PG-13 (12A in the UK) rating is likely to help draw a crowd. The notion of family has always been at the heart of this franchise, and the screenplay by returning writer (and director of five instalments) Justin Lin with newcomer Dan Mazeau leans heavily on the ideas of love and loyalty. A soft focus opening sequence sees Dominic enjoying time with his young son Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and sister Mia (Jordan Brewster), together with his extended petrolhead family Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung King) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). Toretto matriarch Abuelita (a cameo from West Side Story legend Rita Moreno) drives the point home: “Hold us in your heart and you will never lose your way,” she tells Dominic. Diesel does his best to emote during this scenes, desperately urged on by Brian Tyler’s swelling score, but it begins to feels as though the film may never get out of neutral.  Thankfully, incoming director Louis Leterrier understands that the appeal of the Fast films lays squarly in their turbo-charged action. Soon, a knock on the door brings bloodied cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron) — who crossed the Toretto family in the previous two films — with a warning that Dominic is being hunted by psychopath criminal Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). He is the son of Herman Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), from whom Dominic and then-partner Brian (Paul Walker) stole $100m a decade ago (the heist that was detailed in 2011’s Fast Five, seen in flashback). Herman was killed in the fray and Dante is now targeting Dominic — and making the world burn while he’s at it. It all kicks off in Rome, where Dominic’s crew must stop a huge bomb which is rolling through the ancient streets like an explosive pinball; an incredible extended sequence which plays like a mash up of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Bullitt and Wacky Races. The action then spreads out across the globe – location work combining with sets built at the UK’s Warner Bros Studios Leavesden – as the team are tracked by the shadowy government agency they once worked for, but which has now turned against them. In London, Roman, Tej, Han and Ramsey catch up with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who helps them evade capture. In Rio, Dominic calls in old loyalties and faces off against Dante in a drag race that has deadly consequences. Along the way he is helped by familiar faces including his brother Jakob (John Cena), militia leader (and Deckard’s mum) Queenie (Helen Mirren), government agent Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) and rogue agency representative Tess (Brie Larson). It’s like a Who’s Who for fans of the franchise, and hints at what we can expect from future outings. (One hopes, however, these hold more in store for Rodriguez’s spiky Letty, who spends most of this feature locked away in an Antarctic prison.) The film’s geographical scope is matched by its visuals and stuntwork. Impressive lensing from Stephen F. Windon (who has worked on seven Fast films) moves in tandem with seamless digital effects to thrust the viewer in, out, over and under cars, into water, through fire and out of aeroplanes (one of which features Walker’s daughter, Meadow Rain Walker, in a cameo). Editing, too, is fast paced, ensuring the action never lets up for a moment; fluid camerawork means there’s a sense of things permanently in motion, even in the quieter sequences.  It helps, too, that the cast are obviously enjoying themselves, and there’s a lighthearted humour underpinning the mayhem. Ludacris and Gibson make for a wisecracking double act, while Momoa is having an absolute ball as the vampy, preening Dante, fully embracing the high camp Bondesque villainy. He, like everyone on screen and behind the camera, is unashamedly playing to the strengths of this franchise which, on this evidence, has a little more road left to run.  Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"May 17, 2023"," Forget the shark. There was never a shark. The Fast and Furious franchise jumped Leviathan. Then they kept looking for bigger adventures. It’s been 22 years since we started living life a quarter mile at a time. Over two decades we haven’t wanted to stop once. From then until today, we ride with our hands on the wheel, our hearts on the ceiling, and our fears on the floor. Why? It’s so easy to explain, as my colleague Julian Lytle says, “These are multicultural superheroes.” or if you prefer a quote from the new Fast X movie, “If it violates the laws of god and gravity, they did it twice.” Both those statements are true.  Before The Avengers, with far greater diversity—and you can forgive me or nah—with far greater heart, The Fast and The Furious remixed everything we loved about Point Break* and made it for “us.” Those of us who mostly played the background when the big actioners hit theaters. Not this time. This franchise gave us heroes on the level of the Shonen anime that we also love. We could see ourselves in these characters, our heroic fantasies, our desires to triumph over adversity, and our found families. And with Vin Diesel, Justin Lin (primarily), and this cast at the helm, The Fast franchise is “for us, by us”—We the people. Our love isn’t a mystery, it’s expected and it’s earned. This series truly is about family (not only the ones on the set or the screen) they gave us a seat at the table too. And once again it’s on. We’re fueling up for more of the ferocious fantasy and fantastical physics of The Fast and Furious franchise. Up next is Fast X. The tenth movie in the series and another breakneck, high-octane, non-stop, family-driven, physics-defying, festival of the most gorgeously entertaining spectacle possible. Or actually impossible, because you can’t do any of this unless, like the cast, you have faith.  We start with our family at another one of their backyard barbeques. Abuelita (the beloved Rita Moreno) is there to bless the table. Meanwhile, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is preparing to lead a mission to Rome with Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang), as a safety net. The idea of Roman as team leader probably means things are going to swing sideways, but Dom (Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are satisfied to let hijinks happen while they stay at home with their son Little B (Leo Abelo Perry) and work on cars. Or course, contentment cannot be allowed and the villainous Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up on their doorstep leaking blood like antifreeze.  Here’s the thing. If Cipher is scared enough to run for the safety of the Toretto homestead, who spooked the baddies? Time for a flashback to everyone’s favorite Fast movie. Which one? I plead the fifth. Way back when in Fast Five, you know the one, when Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) played Double Dutch with a giant safe while demolishing the streets of Rio De Janeiro. The safe belonged to Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a bad guy our squad mud-stomped into oblivion. But just like the franchise when revenge comes for them, it’s all about family. The next time we hear that quote it’s been translated by a new villain. “Never accept death when suffering is owed,” those are the words that Dante (Jason Momoa) lives by and the Toretto Family is about to learn he lives all out—by destroying everything they care about and giggling maniacally while doing it. Y’all, the style, the rizz, the drip, the pizazz and vicious audacity of this villain is art. Jason Momoa wants you to forget all others and remember only Dante as the author of Fast and Furious mayhem. Flowers! Elsewhere, the Nobody Family is back in play with a cameo from Little Nobody () and the introduction of Tess Nobody (Brie Larson). Mr. Nobody is still missing or in hiding and we’re wondering where that storyline might lead. The Shaws are back too. Queenie (Helen Mirren) returns with the good advice only a Gangster Mom can give, and you’ve seen Deckard (Jason Statham )in the trailers. He’s ready to dig some graves and he’s such a good undertaker.  I said it before but I need to say it again, Fast X is a breakneck, high-octane, non-stop, family-driven, physics-defying, festival of gorgeously entertaining spectacle. At one point, The Family plays streetball with a giant bomb. Who does that? My most beloved franchise of all time did that (okay, that might be hyperbole but the love is real) and I couldn’t have enjoyed it more if the theater pumped in laughing gas and french fries. The women aren’t relegated to girl fights and looking fabulous, they eat men, like candy, and they crunch on them bones. Joy! John Cena returns as Jacob, the fun uncle, and goes on an adventure with Little Brian that includes a cannon car. Glee! The action sequences, the loyalty, the betrayal, the jokes, the fingernail painting. Immaculate! When talking about Lethal Weapon, Joel Silver said the key to a successful, long-running franchise is to bring everybody back. Even the folks from Craft Services. The Fast and Furious franchise wants Silver to hold their NOS (nitrous oxide), bringing it in and going beyond is what they do. That is why I am tossing gravity-defying confetti at this series; May it never come down. *  Hands up if you want Keanu Reeves to show up in The Fast and Furious franchise as Johnny Utah or some mysterious guy named “Johnny” who was sent by Mr. Nobody as the cavalry? ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," After 22 years of fast cars, fantastic stunts, and family, Fast X revs up the action again, delivering an exhilarating ride for fans and newcomers alike. The film, directed by Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans, Now You See Me), reunites Dom Toretto and his crew in Los Angeles. Just when everything seems to be looking up for the family, the crew must face their most formidable adversary yet, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the vengeful son of events past. While Fast X excels in paying homage to the series’ best moments and stunts, it also showcases strong performances from series newcomers Jason Momoa and Leo Abelo Perry, who plays Brian Toretto. Fast X wastes no time in setting up the plot for the film, and Dante’s driving factor is to destroy the life that Dom has built for himself after the events of Fast Five. Coupled with a flashback to the day of the vault heist in Rio and homage to the best moments and stunts of the beloved franchise through pictures in Dom’s garage, the opening minutes serve as a fast recap of the events that have brought Dom and the family to this point. With the stage set, action ensues before the end of the first act putting the family in the crosshairs of a villain who is the sheer antithesis of our heroes. Dom spends much of the movie separated from his family, dealing with emotional and dangerous action sequences as Dante intended. As to not hammer viewers with just action and Dom stonefaced, Fast X introduces a refreshing shift in tone by allowing those emotional scenes to breathe and finding moments of levity through the comedic members of the family. This approach adds depth and complexity to the narrative, providing a breather from the high-octane action and allowing audiences to connect with other members of the family on a more personal level. This shift in tone showcases the franchise’s ability to blend action and humor seamlessly. It also allows all the characters a chance to shine in their sequences, which were sorely lacking in F9 that mostly relegated characters like Tej, Roman, and Ramsey to meta-commentary on the series. Even Jakob has his fair share of scenes that lean into John Cena’s charisma, allowing him to challenge the musclebound gearhead motif that is so prominent in the franchise. The interplay between emotional weight and lighthearted humor enhances the viewing experience, preventing the film from becoming a spectacle. While Fast X takes a step back from the grander spectacle, like sending a Pontiac Fiero to space, it doesn’t mean that Fast X has forgotten what has made the franchise so popular. There is still more CGI in the film than you can shake a wrench at, but there is a clear intention by director Leterrier to have Fast X return to more practical effects. By relying less on CGI-driven spectacles and embracing practical stunts, the film recaptures the gritty authenticity that captivated the earlier installments. Even stunts that see a bomb rolling through the streets of Rome or Dom using helicopters attached to his car as weapons incorporate enough practical effects that result in exhilarating sequences that feel more grounded than past films. This emphasis on practicality serves as a reminder of the franchise’s roots and commitment to thrilling audiences without sacrificing all sense of believability. The standout for Fast X is far and away Jason Momoa’s performance as Dante Reyes. Momoa brings a formidable presence to the screen, infusing his character with intensity, charisma, and a magnetic charm. While his portrayal may garner its fair share of laughs, it doesn’t detract from how downright scary Dante is. In the past, many villains in the Fast & Furious franchise typically relied on amassing more wealth or taking over the world. Dante goes past those types of trivial desires and focuses on Dom and the ones he cares about. He had no desire for money, his father. No family like the Shaws. No attempt to bring a new world order like Cipher. Just intense hatred for Dom. He pulls off a Joker-Scar-Jareth-type villain performance that makes what Cipher did look like child’s play. His ability to embody the character’s ruthless determination and unwavering focus on revenge elevates the film’s intensity, even while joking around with Dom. Momoa’s presence on screen steals the show and provides the perfect foil to Dom Toretto, creating an electrifying dynamic between the two characters. With all the things I love about Fast X, it has flaws. One notable misstep is the inclusion of scenes involving Momma Toretto, which ultimately lack payoff. Crammed into the film’s opening minutes, these moments feel disconnected from the main narrative and seem to exist solely for promotional purposes. While the intention may have been to add depth and emotional weight, the execution falls short, leaving viewers wondering about their significance. Trimming these scenes would have allowed for a tighter narrative focus and more time to integrate new characters into the family more substantially. The Fast & Furious franchise has always been about the ensemble. However, Fast X may show that the franchise is at critical mass with all the film’s characters. While characters like Tej, Roman, Han, Ramesy, Letty, and Cipher have their moments to shine in their subplots, characters like Ms. Nobody, played by Brie Larson, feel shoehorned. Frequently, her character just shows up conveniently but doesn’t do much other than show the flaws in the Agency. Her role could have been filled by Luke Hobbs or Deckard Shaw, who don’t have enough time. Additionally, Fast X attempts to tug on one too many heartstrings by adding more twists that connect new characters to the old, including a particular Brazilian cop. Like with Momma Toretto, eliminating scenes with Ms. Nobody and a long-lost family member could have given more time to characters we already know and love. A great example of including new characters that don’t take focus away from the older faces can easily be seen with Jakob and little Brian Toretto. The duo spends a significant portion of the film together, and it is some of the film’s best moments. Despite his age, Brian is more than capable of holding his own after being surrounded by some of the franchise’s smartest and most daring characters. His character almost fits perfectly with characters found in the animated spin-off Fast & Furious Spy Racers and could possibly hint at what’s to come once Vin Diseal looks to pass keys. Additionally, through getting to know Brian, Jakob’s character growth explored in F9 is continued. There is more than meets the eye, and John Cena delivers all of the charm, comedy, and action you would expect from the former WWE Superstar. Lastly, the series still does not know what to do with the O’Conners. Throughout the series, Dom’s relationship with Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) has been a cornerstone of the Fast and Furious universe. While the passing of Paul Walker was a significant loss, the character has continued to be referenced, and their presence has been felt. While his presence in the film adds a sentimental touch through references and flashbacks, it feels somewhat repetitive, given his prominent roles in previous installments. Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom’s sister and Brian’s wife shows up again to help save the day while Brian is nowhere to be seen. Given the events of the film, there is still no logical reason, as far as the film is concerned, that Brian would not be a part of this plot when even Queenie (Helen Mirren) is in danger of Dante’s wrath. As much as Paul Walker’s presence is missed from these films, it may be time to write off the character entirely and give him the final resolution as a fitting tribute to his contributions to the franchise. In all, director Louis Leterrier steers the franchise back to its roots as it rediscovers the balance between fantastical and family. Despite a few missed opportunities, Fast X still manages to deliver an entertaining and nostalgic experience for fans of the franchise. It pays tribute to the best moments and stunts, showcases Jason Momoa’s stellar performance as a unique villain, strikes a balance between emotional depth and comedic relief, and, most importantly, focuses on family. By the time the credits roll, the misdirection and cliffhanger in the third act will leave fans wanting more of the Fast Saga, as it looks like this ride is nowhere close to being over yet. Be sure to stick around for the mid-credit scene. In all, director Louis Leterrier steers the franchise back to its roots as it rediscovers the balance between fantastical and family. Despite a few missed opportunities, Fast X still manages to deliver an entertaining and nostalgic experience for fans of the franchise. I am just a guy who spends way to much time playing videos games, enjoys popcorn movies more than he should, owns too much nerdy memorabilia and has lots of opinions about all things pop culture. People often underestimate the effects a movie, an actor, or even a video game can have on someone. I wouldn’t be where I am today without pop culture.

"May 17, 2023"," Family, family, and family is the primary hook of “Fast X” the 10th (!) film in the sprawling, mind-numbing “Fast and Furious” franchise (not counting spinoff “Hobbs & Shaw”). The series itself has become a running joke at this point, including characters within the universe tongue-and-cheekily calling out how improbable it is they’ve managed to survive the outlandish and ludicrous missions in the 20+ years since we met Dominic Toretto and the gang when they were stealing DVD players.  Oh how far we’ve come. In “F9,” two characters catapulted themselves into space (!!) and then landed safely back on earth with no major injuries. During “Fast X,” I watched what was the equivalent of a live action Rocket League/Pinball match with a nuclear bomb in the middle of Rome and nobody was harmed or killed. Whatever is flowing through Dominic’s veins that allows him to emerge unscathed after his car goes up in flames should be studied by doctors across the globe.  Sure, the filmmakers and general audiences would say you need to “just not think.” Yet, we already reached that peak fifteen times before in “Fast Five” when Bryan and Dominic dragged a gigantic safe through the streets of Rio De-Janeiro, demolishing historical landmarks in the process; or in “The Fate of the Furious” when Dwyane Johnson kicked a missile into oncoming traffic while driving a tank on a sheet of ice in Antarctica. Obviously, we’re past the point of reality, because, you know, family. What’s really missing: is the heart. In “Fast X” every character from the filmography is brought back into the fold, including those we assumed had died (rule of thumb: if you don’t see it with your own eyes: it probably didn’t happen. Then again, I was convinced Han exploded in “Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift” and Letty in “Fast & Furious” after seeing it with my own eyes, so what do I know?) When you’re forced to juggle a million subplots on top of the convoluted mechanics of the main narrative thread, it doesn’t leave much for those intimate one-handers that became a cornerstone of the franchise when Paul Walker was still alive. On top of that, “Fast X” deepens the lineage by throwing new faces into the mix as if the deluge of secondary characters you forgot about from “Fast & Furious 6” wasn’t enough. You need a flowchart to keep everything straight. One face who seems to understand how far off-the-rails this series has gone is Jason Momoa, who is playing new franchise baddie Dante Reyes (the Thanos to Dominic and his vehicular Avengers). An opening prologue, set during the events of “Fast Five,” tells us Dante is out for blood after Dominic executed his father during that memorable stunt in Rio. Cut to the present, Diesel’s soft-spoken patriarch is raising his son alongside Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), content to leave his past life behind, settle down and teach the next generation about cars and life. That is until Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up on his doorstep with an omniscient warning about Dante’s army and his relentless attitude towards making Dominic pay for his sins (“Death is not substantial when suffering is owed”). This puts the entire crew in jeopardy, including fan favorites Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), but others get roped into the globetrotting revenge plot too, like Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, John Cena’s Uncle Jakob, and new characters Tess (Brie Larson), Isabel (Daniela Melchior) and some lackluster cameos. Collectively, they amass three minutes of screentime across the movie’s nauseating two-and-a-half-hour trek, which, in the end, isn’t even a complete movie considering it ends in the middle of a scene, teeing up what’s rumored to be the final installment. Director Louis Leterrier, who stepped in for Justin Lin one week into filming due to creative differences, does a serviceable job keeping the action kinetic, including the bonkers sequence in Rome, but also a scene where someone races their car down the side of the Hoover Dam as its exploding (seriously, you can’t make this up). And even though Momoa is trying something as the new baddie, his repertoire of zany one liners, memorable outfits, and painted nails wears thin by the hour mark. The laws of physics and gravity notwithstanding, “Fast X” is just a tireless exercise in Diesel trying to deliver lines of emotional dialogue while people scream into walkie talkies and blow things up. There was a time you could forgive those shortcomings, because the endearing quality of the earlier films weren’t so much rooted in the outlandish stunts, but stronger, grounded scripts that understood the stakes without being corny or cheesy (although the stunts had more spark than the CGI gunk here). We’ve already jumped the shark twice and supposedly, depending on who you ask, there’s either one or two movies left in the pipeline. I’ll believe it when I see it. Oh wait.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Is Fast X movie safe for kids? Is Fast X OK for children? Read the Fast X Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parents guide and mom review of the all-new Universal Pictures’ 2023 Fast & Furious 10 sequel film, starring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sun Kang, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, Alan Richtson, and Jason Momoa. No spoilers! #FastX May contain commissioned links. 22 years. A lot has changed for me in 22 years. But apparently, Fast & Furious keeps rolling out with the same old, same old. But with the advertisement of “the end of the road begins,” and the original cast only getting older and wiser, audiences wonder how long the Fast & Furious franchise can keep up with this “fast and furious” pace. Is 10 the magical number for Fast X? Or is this only the beginning…of the end? In this Fast X Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, I’m breaking down the visuals, the story, a full PG-13 age rating breakdown explanation for violence, adult themes and language, and what kids’ age recommendation is suggested to watch in this new 2023 Fast X parents guide to the Fast & Furious 10 sequel film from Universal. A no-spoiler parent review of Fast X, are we finally done with fast cars and explosions? Or is this only the beginning for a new of Fast & Furious saga? Fast cars, explosions, and intense action have been the signature visuals combo for the Fast & Furious franchise. And for Fast X, it’s more of the same. Add in a few creative camera angles and wanderlust locations – and you basically have a Fast & Furious action thriller film that fits like a glove, right within the genre. Photosensitivity Warning. Does pyrotechnics count as strobing lights? With the overwhelming amount of car chase scenes and explosions in this film, it almost feels like strobing. All jokes aside, overall I would say that Fast X is photosensitive friendly. There are no bright, strobing or flashing lights throughout the film. However, there are lots of fire and explosions, a few scenes with fireworks, and scenes in darkness. Directed by Louis Leterrier (“Clash of the Titans,” “The Incredible Hulk“), Fast X stars returning cast members Vin Diesel (“Riddick“) as Dom Toretto, Michelle Rodriguez (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves“) as Letty, Tyrese Gibson (“Transformers“) as Roman, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges (“Crash“) as Tej, Nathalie Emmanuel (“Game of Thrones“) as Ramsey, Jordana Brewster (“The Faculty“) as Mia, Sung Kang (“Raya and the Last Dragon“) as Han, Jason Statham (“The Transporter“) as Shaw, John Cena (“Peacemaker“) as Jakob and Scott Eastwood (“Gran Torino“) as Little Nobody, along with Helen Mirren (“Shazam! Fury of the Gods“) as Queen Elizabeth II and Charlize Theron (“Monster“) as Cipher. New cast includes Brie Larson (“Captain Marvel“) as Tess, Alan Richtson (“Reacher“) as Agent Aimes, Daniela Melchior (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3“), Jason Momoa (“Aquaman“), and Rita Moreno (“West Side Story“). The Fast & Furious franchise is entering their third decade of films – with many of the same cast members. And the secret to the success of over 22 years of Fast & Furious movie sequels? Spoiler alert – it’s not the story. Being that this is was my very first Fast & Furious film that I’ve ever seen (yes, get all of the teasing out of the way), I went in expecting an action thriller with cool cars, tons of ridiculous stunts, guns, fighting, and endless explosions – and that’s exactly what I got. The 2023 Fast X action thriller continues to wow crowds with pyrotechnics, fast cars and violence. What’s interesting to me as a Fast & Furious newbie is how the 100% impossible is so unrealistic (does every Fast & Furious film have a 1 in a million jump scene?), so fantastical (there’s no way that anyone would survive this – but they do!) – that we as audience members are instantly mesmerized and wowed. Fast & Furious fans will appreciate the cameos, side jokes and yes, an end credit scene. Is Fast X safe for kids? With Fast & Furious on their 10th film should parents be concerned about that PG-13 rating? It’s no secret that I am highly skeptical of all MPAA ratings (um hello, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not disclosing any language??). And as we know, not all movie and TV age ratings are the same. As a parent, it’s been rather heartbreaking to witness how ratings have shifted over the years with a G-rating no longer an option. PG ratings now oscillating between Turning Red intense to Christopher Robin calm, and even PG-13/TV-14 age ratings teetering on the edge of R or MA ratings (Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and Werewolf by Night, I see you!), there’s a wide range between the age of 0-14 years old for parents to consider. Having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or show is kid friendly – and safe for the whole family to watch together. Why is Fast X rated PG-13? In this Fast X Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, this 2023 Fast & Furious 10 film sequel is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material.” With film and TV ratings also unpredictable these days, having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or television show like Fast X is kid friendly. Is Fast X too intense for kids? Let’s breakdown that PG-13 age rating in this Fast X movie parents guide. Violence/Suspense. Intense sequences of violence and action – yup. Fast X has got this category covered. From beginning to end, Fast X boasts tons of action and thrills – including fast cars, explosions, and general mayhem. Add military grade weapons and guns along with multiple styles of hand to hand combat, and you have one semi-bloody action thriller film. Overall, the action is in your face. Intensity remains in the action thrill sequences. There are very minimal suspenseful jump scares. Blood and gore level is about mid level – cuts and bruising to face, face scraped alongside a building, fights with knives, licking knives with blood on them, gun shot wounds and one kill shot flashback (camera moves away at the very last milli-second). No dismemberment, or obscene guts/gore, but one bloody tooth extraction. There are plenty of deaths and inferred deaths. The most disturbing death scene is with 2 men who are presumably dead – but with their eyes and mouths taped open to appear “grotesquely” alive. (One fly tries to land on a man’s open eye.) Almost zombie like – but not moving as an alive person messes with them like mannequins. I would say that this is the most disturbing scene of the entire film – and may be too much for kids to watch. Adult Themes. Fast X has some suggestive material. At least this Fast & Furious film doesn’t advertise for “sexual content” like past films. Overall for adult content, the 2023 Fast X film is mild for suggestive material. Picture car racing with beautiful women in tight, very skimpy clothing as they gyrate and twerk on camera. One scene of kissing, cuddling in bed (clothed) between a married couple. One bare chested man scene. One scene of a man clothed in only tight white underwear walking around. One verbal reference to being an “underwear model” and “swiping right” on a dating app. But overall no sex scenes. So yay? Lots of alcohol consumption, mainly with open beer bottles and drinking from those bottles in between dialogue. One bar scene with people drinking alcohol of various forms, including beer. One inferred scene to consuming food with drugs in it – use of dizzy/wobbly camera work with human distortion visuals. Language. I expected a fair amount of swear words and foul language. And I got more than I bargained for. Double digit counts for language – that’s impressive. However, I still don’t think it’s overall as foul as Guardians 3. For this 2023 Fast X film, PG-13 rated bad language phrases include 18 “sh!t,” 2 “bullsh!t,” “b@stard,” 3 “d@mn,” 2 “g-d d@mn,” 3 “d@mmit,” 1 “g-d d@mmit,” 4 “@ss,” 1 “b!tch,” 13 “H-E-double hockey sticks,” and 1 “sucks.” With a runtime of 2 hours 21 minutes, the 2023 Fast X film is on the lengthier side for Fast & Furious films. But with even more action sequences, explosions and thrills filling every possible minute, there are very few lulls in the action. There is some adult focused dialogue, but with a very simple plot and superficial conversations to keep the thrills moving along, the on-screen visuals will more than likely keep kids mesmerized throughout the film. Obviously, we have a saga from 2001 to present to compare to. Fast X is very comparable to all of the Fast & Furious films – this time focused more on revenge and family than illegal drugs and heists. Fast X, aka the Fast & Furious 10 film sequel is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence and action, language and some suggestive material” by the 2023 MPAA. Yes! There is 1 end credits scene in Fast X that occurs mid credits (So 1 mid credit scene) that Fast & Furious fans won’t want to miss! Based on my 2023 Fast X parents guide and mom review above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Fast X movie to kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old. Considering the full PG-13 rating breakdown above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Fast & Furious 10 to kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old. This Fast X PG-13 rating is pretty spot on and easily comparable to the 9 other Fast & Furious movie ratings.If you shield your child’s eyes for 10 seconds of twerking, gloss over the language and laugh at the creepy dead guys scene and focus on the cars, action and explosions – your kids will enjoy this Fast & Furious film. With increased violence, increased action and thrill sequences, coarse foul language throughout, and overall one disturbing scene with a man using dead people as posable mannequins, I recommend parents prescreening Fast X for your child’s maturity level to handle many different fronts of intensity. Two words, testosterone drive. Yes, “the end of the road begins.” But this ride is far from over. Fast X is like a bad car accident and a tabloid combined. And that’s a dangerous combo. You can’t stop watching, and the onlooker traffic is worse than the accident. Insert deer in headlights look. My take on my first Fast & Furious movie – It’s so ridiculously over-the-top, but I guess that’s what people love. Not seeing any of the first 9 films, I think I caught up just fine without spending hours on a movie marathon. Momoa’s performance saves the film, and that’s saying much considering very little story to build off of. Fast X knows what audiences love. Cars, violence and testosterone. Give us the same old plot, add in cool cars, amp up more explosions and violence, and let me “escape reality.” By inserting even more action, more thrills, more violence and a few memorable one liners each film – it’s like a bad addiction. We just can’t get enough of a movie with little to no plot that’s basically just one messy pileup in overdrive – as long as there’s cars, explosions, violence, and famous people. And they probably won’t stop making Fast & Furious films until we stop watching.

"May 17, 2023"," Vin Diesel headlines a huge cast of new and familiar faces in this 10th film in the hugely successful, car-driven franchise, directed by Louis Leterrier. 
	The Fast and Furious movies may all be about fast cars, but the franchise has gotten so congested it’s a wonder they’re able to break the speed limit.  
	Considering the amount of money these films have made for Universal, and the fact that the series has gone longer than many of its current viewers will have been alive, it’s hard to blame Vin Diesel and company for taking a victory lap. Or laps, as this supposed end to the franchise (please contact me about the bridge I’m selling) has recently been rumored to be the first of not two parts but three. 
	That’s because Fast X is directly connected to that predecessor in that the main baddie in this one, Dante (Jason Momoa), turns out to be the son of the Brazilian drug kingpin killed by Dom Toretto (Diesel) and crew back in 2011. And don’t blame your memory if you don’t remember Momoa appearing in that elaborate chase on the bridge in that film. He’s been retconned into the footage to make it clear that Dante holds a very strong grudge over his father’s death. It seems that Dom isn’t the only one in this series who gets emotional over the loss of family members. 
	Momoa, it turns out, is one of the best things to ever happen to the franchise. He’s the best villain by far (not to mention that he does many of his own stunts) and thoroughly steals the film with his delightfully unhinged portrayal of Dante, who interrupts his nefarious activities to inform the ever-macho Dom that his “carpet matches the drapes.” Momoa is not exactly an actor associated with lightness, but here he practically dances the role as much as acts it, taking such frenetically gleeful delight in his character’s sadistic taunting that you practically root for him even when he threatens to destroy the Vatican. He gives the impression of having huffed nitrous oxide before every take. Dante makes the Joker look like a depressive, and he’s so damn entertaining that he lifts the series to new heights. 
	The core crew — including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, etc. — is back, except this time they’re divided into various groups scattered across the globe, the better to showcase locations including Rome, Lisbon and London, among others. (I assume the film didn’t actually shoot in Antarctica, where some scenes are set, but with this kind of money involved you never know.) Needless to say, most of these cities become the worse for wear from the experience, especially Rome, which suffers mightily as a result of an extravagant chase sequence and a massive bomb going off. With both this film and the upcoming Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning: Part One nearly laying the city to waste, it wouldn’t be surprising if skittish tourists avoid the Spanish Steps for a while. 
	Cena is another standout, displaying charm and solid comic chops in the numerous scenes in which Jakob protects Dom’s young son (Leo Abelo Perry, delivering perfectly calibrated wide-eyed stares) from Dante. This includes the pair escaping a passenger plane filled with bad guys by taking off in, what else, a smaller plane located in the cargo hold.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Loudly proclaiming, early and often, that’s it ‘all about family,’ Fast X proceeds to dismantle that bromide, bit by excruciating digital bit. Calling back to and revolving around key events in Fast Five (2011) from the adult perspective of Dante (Jason Momoa), the son of the earlier film’s principal antagonist, drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), the film imagines that Dante has been plotting revenge ever since and now intends to executive his vengeance upon them by MAKING THEM SUFFER (cue evil laugh).  By “them,” of course, the vengeful Dante plans to attack Dom (Vin Diesel) and his extended family of blood relatives and close criminal associates, who now number into the thousands, or at least to the point that Dom embraces every survivor of his kooky driving, shooting, and killing exploits as a member of his family and thus deserving of the kind of protection that only he can provide (cue 1,000-yard stare).  What follows is a blitzkrieg of images, hasty assembled into something resembling a narrative, and clearly meant to be taken dead serious, judging by the tone set by Vin Diesel, who exudes the same hulking menace, whether he’s crouching over his young son or ignoring the property damage he has caused or the enemies he has murdered to protect those that he loves.  The decision to circle back to Fast Five as a jumping-off point for the story is just the first in a series of bad decisions. Directed by Justin Lin, the film was the first in the series to leave behind entirely the constaints of time, space, common sense, and the laws of gravity. By embracing its entirely ridiculous excesses and having fun with them, acknowledging its own Looney Tunes mentality, the film simultaneously declared it would henceforth be making up its own rules and establishing its own (un)natural laws.  The films that have followed, especially after Lin departed the franchise after Fast & Furious 6, steadily embraced that wildly individualistic style with diminishing effect, especially noticeable after writer Chris Morgan departed after The Fate of the Furious (2017). Even with Lin’s return to the helm in F9 (2021), the series was reduced to treading water and felt desperate and ever more outlandish and untethered to any sort of guiding narrative throughline. That continues under the direction of Louis Leterrier, a journeymen helmer who has made seven previous action movies, none that are especially memorable. (Lin before work on this film before departing shortly after production began due to “creative differences.” Note that Lin co-wrote the script.) From the outside, Leterrier appears to be a hard-working sort of filmmaker who gets the job done, on time and on budget, but without much noticeable flair or hint of personal style. (He also claims to have re-written substantial portions of the script on his flight to begin work.) As to the acting, well, the franchise is a graveyard for Academy Award-winning actors (Rita Moreno, Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson) who, like Leterrier, get the job done (i.e. say their lines) without leaving any discernible marks.  Perhaps I’m missing the point (or the humor) entirely. In any event, it’s in an entirely different style from all the other performances, which makes it stand out; it’s as though Momoa thinks he’s in a comedy, while everyone else plays it as a family drama. At best, he’s a distraction from a lessening spectacle. More does not always mean better, as painfully demonstrated in Fast X. The film opens in Dallas, Fort Worth and surrounding cities on Friday, May 19, via Universal Pictures.

"May 17, 2023"," Fast X won’t welcome any new apostles to the familia’s way of cinema; this is a hysterical, NOS-fuelled ode to big-screen ridiculousness that’s beyond parody. Yes, The Fast and the Furious was a Point Break ripoff. But it was also a stylish, sexy, amped-up caper that was, rightly, viewed as fertile ground for a street-racing action series. The stakes were modest, but they felt massive – love, liberty, and family, all laid on the line of a quarter-mile. It took 10 years of forget-about-it-cuh’ing, continent-hopping, and reshaping before the franchise truly found its feet in Fast Five, a guns-blazing heist flick that struck a particularly potent blend of vehicular mayhem, humour, and serial potential: the world was dying for more missions with Dom Toretto and co., and they’ve always delivered. Now we’ve arrived at the (ante)penultimate chapter, and raising one’s tongue against Vin Diesel and his furious team feels totally pointless – for all its flaws, there’s a sincerity and well-intentioned sense of fun to his “mythology” that remains rather endearing. We’re still laughing with it, not at it. In Fast Five, we watched Dom and Brian drag a huge safe through half of Rio de Janeiro, before crumpling its owner, drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), in his car. They jetted off to start a new life – but his son, Dante (Jason Momoa), was left with nothing but a psychotic attitude and an axe to grind. “Never accept death when suffering is owed,” he repeatedly vows, a tenet taken from his dead daddy. A decade later – don’t think about why it’s taken this long – the last person you’d expect to turn up at 1327 arrives dripping with blood: Cipher (Charlize Theron). “I met the devil tonight,” she says. “The enemy of my enemy… is you.” Cue a worldwide game of cat and mouse, from a wrecking ball bomb tearing up the streets of Rome to the black market lanes of London, with a few returning faces along the way (no spoilers here), along with some new ones. The usual team are out doing their thing, but don’t expect much from them this time: Tyrese Gibson is on trademark form, but the gags rarely result in more than a sharp nasal exhale; Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges and Nathalie Emmanuel are a likable tech duo, but you could take stock of their character development in less than two seconds. We wanted justice for Han, but for this? Sung Kang is fine here, but the script gives him almost nothing to do but swipe on Tinder and face off with his reaper again: Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, who’s a complete scene-stealer among A-to-B characters (unsurprising, given director Louis Leterrier’s past work with him in The Transporter). Even Vin Diesel, for all that he tries in scenes with “little B”, can’t sustain the self-serious machismo that’s turned him into a blockbuster icon – sadly, the movie grinds to a halt whenever it focuses on him and his pouting, patriarch bravado. Michelle Rodriguez is innocent in all this: she’s a radiant badass, especially when she’s sparring with Theron’s Cipher, a tech villain who yada-yadas and ‘engineers’ her way out of any scrape – she would be nothing without the Oscar winner’s talent. The debuting and smaller characters shine the brightest: it’d be disingenuous to call Momoa a revelation – I’m pretty sure we all felt the serotonin from the “ma boy!” hugs in Dune – but he is operating on a different plane from everyone else. He chews up every line with maniacal glee; give me another actor who can pull off intimidating fart noises, peekaboos, and having a jaunty chat with two tape-mangled, toe-painted corpses (one of the film’s grimmest images). In some ways, he’s the Joker to Dom’s Batman; he sees pain as a game and family as a cursed prospect. “You want to control the world… I just want to punish it,” he says. Elsewhere, John Cena lights up the screen with his emotive, affable energy – I let out a soft “woo” at his entrance – while Brie Larson, playing Mr Nobody’s daughter Tess, proves to be a perfect replacement for Kurt Russell, aka the most charismatic actor on the planet. One actor brings serious heat: Alan Ritchson of Reacher fame, a real-life, bicep-bursting action man who’d walk away with the movie if it weren’t for Momoa. The sound mixing doesn’t do Brian Tyler’s score any favors (his theme is still a head-nodder), but the reggaeton vibe continues into the 10th entry’s soundtrack, plus the tear-jerking use of ‘See You Again’ as a motif for remembering Paul Walker’s Brian. As for how it looks, well, sorry Stephen F. Windon, but any visual flair is smothered by ugly CGI – there’s plenty of bombast, and excluding the obvious practical effects, none of it is particularly convincing. Leterrier seems like a good fit for the Fast family: The Transporter (particularly its sequel) is packed with hooting-and-hollering sequences on and off the streets; Unleashed features crunching, nasty martial arts action; and Now You See Me, while completely daft, aligns with the spirit of the franchise post-Five. It’s a convincing entry into the series, but the action needs some serious work; he’s at home in contained, small spaces (Letty pushing a man’s face against a plummeting wall was worthy of whitened knuckles), but the louder spectacle is more funny than thrilling. Cars don’t bump and bounce as they would, and there’s some Driver-level pedestrian survival on the streets these days. On this occasion, the buck stops with the script. There are some phenomenal lines – “If it violates the laws of god and gravity, they did it twice,” Ritchson says – and its pace never dips, but it doesn’t feel quite as nourishing as its predecessors. But, even then, it’s the theatrical equivalent of a Saturday morning cartoon – as long as we enjoy their company, little else actually matters. Fast and Furious 10 is a low-tier entry, but when it’s this knowingly preposterous and corny, it’s impossible to hate. Winning’s winning, and the Fast Saga no longer knows how to lose.

"May 17, 2023"," With the release of Fast X, we think it’s finally official: the Fast and Furious franchise ended with the death of Paul Walker. Walker’s untimely passing gave 2015's Furious 7 a resonance that took the series to a new level, really solidifying the notion that family, not action, is what makes this mega blockbuster car franchise so popular.  In the films that followed, the one-two punch that had been at the heart of every single Fast movie before it was gone. The next iteration, The Fate of the Furious, suffered for it, but at least it tried something new by making franchise hero Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) the villain. In 2021, F9 got around it by introducing Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena), who provided a new twist on that back-and-forth, tit-for-tat energy the series was built on. But now, with Fast X, that brotherly comradery and mutual respect are off the table, and so too with them are all the emotions that made the franchise so special. Now it’s just the Vin Diesel show, complete with a plot that specifically makes it so Diesel can be on his own for as long as possible. And, as much as we may love Vin Diesel, he’s never been the sole ingredient that makes Fast and Furious popular, no matter how hard Fast X tries to make it so. Fast X does have a worthy rival for Dom though, and, surprise surprise, he’s the best part of the movie by far. It’s Dante, played by Jason Momoa, and Fast X begins with a little retcon flashback into the world of 2011's Fast Five, where we see that the villain of that film, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), had a son named Dante who would have inherited all the wealth of his father—if only Dom and his team hadn’t stolen it. And so, we learn that Dante has spent the past decade studying Dom to not only be able to emulate him, but also to always be a few steps ahead of him. Dante is a joyous, hilarious, sociopathic character, mostly because Momoa plays him with a vibrancy and awareness that’s worth the price of admission on his own. Literally, Momoa could be nominated for an Oscar for this role and we wouldn’t be mad. He’s the anti-Dom and anytime he’s on screen, all you want is for him not to leave.  Now, if Dante was Dom’s friend, that core relationship that drives the Fast franchise would be intact. Because make no mistake, Dante challenges Dom. But Dante is the villain, full stop, and so the movie is still driven, pun intended, by Dom’s decisions. And  Dom, on his own, with no one to challenge him, just isn’t very interesting. So where are all the other people who do challenge him? That family from the previous nine films? Well, after an admittedly solid, entertaining first act that has all the elements of a great Fast movie (family barbeque, massive set piece featuring the entire cast in one place, working together), Dante’s plan is put into action. To defeat Dom, Dante decides to separate him from all his friends and family and the movie does just that. One story splinters into about six as Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) goes one way; Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang) go another, Dom is by himself, and later a few other stories following Cypher (Charlize Theron), Jakob, and Tess (franchise newcomer Brie Larson) are added in. Having all the characters scattered into their own stories makes one thing abundantly clear. It’s the same thing which was crystal clear in the Fast and Furious spinoff, Hobbs and Shaw. These characters do not work as well on their own. It’s an ensemble piece and if the ensemble isn’t an ensemble, what’s even the point? It also doesn’t help that the script here feels almost painfully uninterested in everyone who isn’t a Toretto. Dom’s story has a few standout moments, like a mid-movie race scene, as does the one where Jakob is protecting Dom’s son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry), thanks in large part to a fantastic rapport between those actors. Beyond that though, all the other tangents are stunted, boring, and loosely linked with lines like “We’ll meet Dom at the rendezvous,” as we clearly watch Dom have zero interest in actually going toward any rendezvous. Director Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me, The Incredible Hulk), who was brought onto the production after the departure of Justin Lin, does his best to keep the audience reminded of all of the different storylines. But with so many characters in so many places, we sometimes get like two minutes of them talking, only to cut away for another 20-30 minutes. Often those scenes feature some action to remind you this is a Fast movie, but it’s usually just some hand-to-hand combat or lots of gunplay, which all feels generic in a franchise that has been anything but. Along the way, characters in Fast X constantly make some of the most unexplainable, dumb decisions ever. Now, look. I know this is Fast and the Furious. “Dumb” is the brand. Flying cars, superhero jumps, I’m fine with all of that. But when characters stay in places where they can be easily located, are saved by random characters showing up out of nowhere, or say they’re going to do something only to go missing from the rest of the film, a sense of disjointedness and apathy towards the story intensifies. This is most evident in a scene featuring a very well-known celebrity cameo and a brief drug-induced hallucination, neither of which does anything to the movie except slow it down. Then, on top of all of that, at the end you’re reminded that “Oh right, this is part one of two,” and seemingly every single storyline is left dangling. It’s not all for naught though. As we said, Momoa brings such incredible charisma and energy to the franchise, you start cheering for him and his outlandish plans to work. Plus, the first major action set piece in Rome, as well as the final one in Belgium, are excellent. The problem with them is, for the first time in the franchise, you get the sense that the movie is not even trying to top the previous one. Which, on the one hand, makes sense. F9 literally took the characters into space. How do you top that? Well, this is Fast and Furious. Ingenuity is part of the special sauce, and that the two best action scenes in the movie feel like they could have been done four movies ago doesn’t help. After a promising start, Fast X devolves into a jumbled, uneven, nonsensical story that patches its problems with big explosions. Those distractions might be enough for some people, especially since this is the 11th film in the franchise, but just when the Fast movies should be getting more focused on ending, Fast X seems dead set on opening it up to more and more flaws.  Let us never forget, the Fast and Furious franchise has always been about family. So the fact that Fast X is a movie where that family rarely communicates or even shares the same scenes instantly feels off. And when the newly introduced villain is clearly the best thing in the movie, that’s an even bigger issue. Hopefully, the 11th (or maybe even 12th) film can make this one look better in retrospect but, as it stands, Fast X is the worst Fast film yet. Want more io9 news?

"May 17, 2023"," The Fast & Furious franchise reached the ideal level of sublime ridiculousness with Fast Five, which brought Dom Toretto, Brian O’Conner and four films’ worth of gearhead rogues together for a compact heist thriller that’s basically Ocean’s Eleven with cars. It peaks with the ultimate smash-and-grab job, as Dom and Brian attach a giant bank vault to their Dodge Chargers and drag it through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, occasionally thwacking their pursuers like an improvised wrecking ball. The films that followed have tried nobly to top the simple, lizard-brain pleasure of this moment – the skydiving cars in Furious 7 come the closest – but recent entries have started to grind like metal-on-metal, scrambling to figure out how to top itself. Fast X seems to recognize Fast Five as the top of the franchise bell curve, because it starts there, by retconning a super-villain out of a previous villain’s son. (It turns out there are unforeseen consequences for killing a crime boss with a flying bank vault.) By flashing back to the heist sequence, the film also announces itself as a return to the giddy excesses of the series’ best moments, embracing high camp and cartoonishly destructive violence while leaving behind the glum tone of entries like The Fate of the Furious. It may be dumb as a box of rocks, but there’s still something irresistibly vulgar about a film that nearly blows up the Vatican as a throat-clearing exercise. After yadda-yadda-ing through an eye-rolling paean to “family”, which have become as obligatory to the series as James Bond’s martini order, Fast X works quickly to set up a multi-film arc around Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the vengeful son of Rio kingpin Herman Reyes. With a nasty sadistic streak and his father’s incalculable wealth at his disposal, Dante doesn’t seek merely to kill Dom, but make him and his associates suffer for his own personal amusement. He doesn’t mind an entire city suffering, too: after luring the team on a fake agency mission to Rome, he activates a bomb in a massive circular casing that rolls down the street like the boulder in Raiders of the Lost Ark, leaving a trial of destruction across the ancient city. It’s only through Dom and company’s heroics that we still have a pope. From there, Fast X labors to assemble a cast of characters that’s swollen like a wasp bite over 10 films, in part because the series is so notoriously reluctant to kill any of them off – at least permanently. So new-ish additions like Charlize Theron as cyberterrorist Cipher, John Cena as Dom’s long-lost brother Jakob, Scott Eastwood as beefy law enforcement agent Little Nobody, and Helen Mirren as Queenie Shaw, the militia-woman mother of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), are all back, and more familiar faces are added, like Brie Larson as Mr Nobody’s daughter and Rita Moreno in the purely ceremonial role of a Toretto “abuelita”. That’s a lot of narrative mouths to feed, on top of the legacy characters and the film’s solution is to cut frantically through half a dozen subplots at once. Director Louis Leterrier has a long track record of mediocre blockbusters to his credit, including the Edward Norton version of The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans and Now You See Me, but in taking the reins from Justin Lin, Leterrier adopts a tone closer to his Transporter 2, which remains one of Statham’s better vehicles. His camera pirouettes wildly around the action – Leterrier is as addicted to drunk aerial shots as Max Ophüls was to dolly tracks – and he leans into the comic absurdity as much as possible, leaving the physics of suspense to the Mission: Impossible franchise. Dom and his friends treat missions like arcade games where they have all the cheat codes. The anything-goes mentality that drives Fast X backfires a little with Momoa, whose conception of Dante as a mincing, androgynous chaos demon owes a debt to Nicolas Cage in Face/Off and Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow, but leans uncomfortably into the gay killer archetype. In a series that celebrates tough-guy bravado, Dante represents a feminized reactionary threat, though the bigger problem here is that Momoa isn’t as gifted as Cage or Depp at devouring the scenery. He’s not as dull as Theron’s whispery Lecter-isms in the previous two entries, but he lurches in the opposite direction, plotting the apocalypse in pigtails, nail polish and an array of half-buttoned satin shirts. Still, there’s no better approach to a franchise this creatively exhausted than to stab it and steer. Like every Fast & Furious movie, Fast X wedges in a street race with sleek muscle cars and low-angle shots of hot spectators, but these films have long since ballooned into the über-action blockbuster series, a junk-food binge of world-saving, city-razing international spy missions never imagines a crash that can’t be survived or a dilemma that a nitro-boost can’t solve. It’s the type of bone-stupid enterprise where locations are established first by characters saying they’re going to Rome, then by helicopter shots of the Colosseum and other major landmarks and then by the title “ROME” in giant, screen-filling letters. Fast X has enough joyful self-awareness that resistance becomes futile. At a certain point, it feels better to give in and smile.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023","  “No one outruns their past,” a wise man once said. But Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) also said it in F9, a movie where the guy who sang “Pimpin’ All Over the World” went to space and John Cena ziplined over Edinburgh. As the Fast & Furious franchise has grown through 10 films, a spinoff, an animated series, a terrible theme park ride, and more, this group has grown from street racers stealing DVD players to freelancing for secretive government agencies. They’ve put a lot of road behind them, going from thieves to apparently the world’s greatest defense against terrorist threats, but one thing has always remained consistent: family.   Fast X is supposedly the beginning of the end (whether Fast X is the beginning of a two-part finale or the start of a trilogy is still unknown), which has the whole family going even bigger than ever before against a threat that could destroy them all. Especially in recent years, Fast & Furious has embraced the ridiculousness, expanding the possibilities beyond what we could’ve ever expected back when this series started in 2001, and that absurdity has been part of this world’s charm. Dwayne Johnson can redirect a submarine’s missile with a punch, and Dom can completely rewrite the laws of physics, and it’s this insanity that makes these movies the rare theatrical experience that makes you want to stand up and cheer at the screen. With the finish line in view, Fast & Furious is going big before it goes home (likely for a barbecue), and Fast X shows how this can be a double-edged sword.   The biggest, wildest, and most brilliant addition to Fast X is the new antagonist Dante (Jason Momoa), the son of Fast Five’s drug lord Hernan Reyes. Since Dom brought an end to Hernan in that film’s climactic chase, Dante wants revenge and to make Dom suffer. And since Dom literally can’t go more than ten minutes without mentioning how much family means to him, Dante knows exactly where to hit to hurt Dom the most. With tech stolen from Cipher (Charlize Theron), a deep need for vengeance, and the desire to destroy Dom’s family, Dante might be the most intimidating villain that the F&F franchise has seen so far.   And Momoa is certainly having the time of his life in Fast X. Not only does he play Dante as an unhinged maniac who seemingly has no chance of becoming yet another villain brought into Dom’s family, but he acts like the only character in this entire series to realize just how batshit bonkers this entire universe is. He’s an absolute flamboyant goof, popping up in wild outfits, ready with a slew of instantly quotable lines, and with a personality that is both hilarious and unpredictable. If Dom represents stoic, stern masculinity, Dante is the exact opposite, and Momoa is a true joy to watch as he chews every piece of scenery he can find. But Momoa manages to be one of the most entertaining new additions to this world in quite some time, and also the most intimidating villain within this series.   The problem with Fast X’s approach to going big in what seems like the final chapters is that there’s just too much to lasso in, even with a runtime pushing two-and-a-half hours. With this cast scattered around the world, there’s only so much time to spend with any one group of characters, and while part of what’s always made this series fun is the group dynamics, separating these groups from each other makes you miss the family not being together. With at least one more entry left in this specific story, that means there’s plenty of room to branch out, but as is often the case with films that are building towards a larger story that can’t be contained into one film, Fast X often feels more like it’s building towards what’s to come as opposed to what this film’s story should be.   This segmentation of the story makes this frequently seem like several mini-movies crammed into one incomplete narrative—many of which have their own tone. While Dom is after Dante, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is leading his own first mission with Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Han (Sung Kang), which primarily becomes about dropping exposition, random cameos, and classic Roman and Tej antics. Meanwhile, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has to escape her own strange situation, Mr. Nobody’s associates (newcomers Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson) have conflicting ways of handling “the family,” while John Cena’s Jakob is on his own family adventure with Dom’s kid, Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). This is already a sprawling story, but throw into that mix that Oscar-winners Helen Mirren and Rita Moreno pop in for only a few minutes without anything to do, Mia (Jordana Brewster) is once again mostly left out, and characters like Scott Eastwood’s Little Nobody quickly appear and are phased out of the story immediately. The scope and size of this series have always centered around the bombastic and truly unbelievable action sequences that this entire crew is a part of, so scattering this massive cast around the globe severs a major part of what makes these movies so fun to begin with.   It’s also a shame that because this film was made with future installments in mind, none of these stories find any sort of conclusion—instead, they’re just paused until Fast 11, whenever that may be. This fragmentation of stories also makes it easier to criticize what doesn’t work. Sure, when this group is all together, racing around and blowing things up, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of it all. But with some of these stories—especially Cena and Perry’s journey—managing to be fun, they seem inconsequential and even counterproductive to the larger mission. Again, it’s as if Fast Xhas to cram these characters into this film, and there’s just too much to handle.   Thankfully, despite there already being ten films worth of characters to draw from, the new additions are quite solid. It can’t be understated how great Dante is as a villain, while Larson fills Mr. Nobody’s shoes quite well, and Ritchson’s Aimes is a decent addition to this cast of massive actors who could snap any of us into a twig at any moment. Daniela Melchior, who doesn’t get enough to do, is still a nice reminder of these characters’ pasts, and it would be great to see more of her in later installments.   And considering the drama behind the scenes, in which Justin Linleft the production after filming had started, Louis Leterrier does a decent job with his first go at this world. He gets the over-the-top tone that this franchise needs, and working with a script by Lin and first-time F&F writer Dan Mazeau, Fast X acknowledges and has fun with just how wild this series can go. Characters comment on how this team went from low-level thieves to a major part of the world’s safety, and there are plenty of jokes at Dom’s expense and his frequent talk about family. Like F9, Fast X is in on the joke and wants to joke around with the audience about how insane this series is at its core.   Even though Fast X is spread too thin, and we’re starting to see the consequences of this ever-expanding family, it’s still a blast to watch. There are parts that certainly don’t make a lick of sense, and there are entire characters and stories that this installment probably could’ve done without. Yet that’s all par for the course with Fast & Furious, and at this point, it’s the type of series you either embrace with open arms, flaws and all, and enjoy the ride, or you don’t—and both are understandable. For all its flaws, Fast X is still an absurdly fun time at the movies that is ridiculous and charming in all the right ways, even at its worst.  Ross Bonaime is the Senior Film Editor at Collider.

"May 17, 2023"," I had been hemming and hawing over the past week, deciding whether I wanted to review this movie. Part of it is that I didn’t exactly see it under the best circumstances. I had another one of my infamous three-hour sleeps the night before, and by the time I got to my screening (after seeing John Wick: Chapter 4 a second time), I was dead tired. Also, this is now the second installment directed by someone I’ve known for a very long time (Louis Letterier), and I went into this with excitement for him but also with a little bit of trepidation, because let’s face it, this is the tenth movie in this series, and they haven’t necessarily been getting better with each one. The plot is easy enough to parse without much in terms of spoilers, because it involves another bad guy wanting to get revenge on Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto and his crew for some transgression of theirs. In this case, it goes back to that amazing heist chase with a giant vault in Rio de Janeiro from Fast Five, this time showing it from the perspective of Jason Momoa’s Dante Reyes, the son of an authority figure who died in that chase who wants to make Dom and his whole family suffer. He begins my luring a few of the crew to Rome where he unleashes a powerful bomb at the Vatican with most people blaming Dom’s team for the carnage. From there, we travel to a bunch of other places, eventually getting back to Rio where Dante challenges Dom to a race where the stakes are higher than usual, but it’s pretty standard for one of these movies. Although the story is just fine, it’s a little weird how all of these villains from past installments end up joining the family, there even being a joke about that in the movie, making it quite META. But there’s a certain point where you wonder whether that might be the least realistic aspect of a series of movies that have proudly worn the impossibility their bigger set pieces on its sleeve.  Possibly the worst example of this is how John Cena’s character from the last movie, Dom’s angry brother, has turned a new leaf and now is the fun uncle who goes on a side adventure with Dom’s tween son. That’s one place where “Fast X” goes way beyond the formula for better or worse. For the most part, those sections act more like the film’s comedy relief than the ongoing Roman-Tej feuding, which has gotten quite stale and is barely funny anymore.  Some people love how over-the-top Momoa takes his character, but it’s really hard to take the stakes very seriously when he’s constantly acting so flamboyant amidst all his killing and destruction. It’s certainly a change from all the stoic baddies of past movies, but there’s a reason why the movies are so successful, and part of that comes down to a formula that generally works for those who like it. So many actors are just flat-out wasted, whether it’s Rita Moreno, who is introduced early as the matriarch – one that has yet to ever be mentioned in nine previous movies – but one who never shows up again. Others like Dame Helen Mirren show up briefly for no particular reason and with no real purpose to the story. Remember Jordana Brewster as Dom’s little sister Mia? Well, she’s barely in the movie other than in the obligatory BBQ scene and another scene when Dante’s men invade their home. I was hoping that Jason Statham would be used more due to his prior work with Letterier (the first two Transporter movies), but Shaw (or is it Hobbs?) basically shows up for one scene, and not much more. Many of the problems come from the script, written by Justin Lin before he vacated the director’s chair, so you can’t fully blame Letterier for some of the movie’s main issues. Although no one will be going to see “Fast X” for the writing or acting, there is something to be said about those hoping to see their favorite characters in a movie and maybe not getting as much as they hoped. The action itself is perfectly fine with some impressive set pieces, but even those seem to be lacking compared to some of the bigger moments directed by Lin and other directors. The worst part of it is the visual effects, especially when it comes to adding fire to some of these big action moments, and that fire almost always looks fake. On the other hand, Letterier finds some great locations in Rome and Portugal to give those scenes suitable eye candy. It certainly will be interesting to see whether the fans appreciate this tenth installment more than I did. There’s a certain point where these movies have gotten too big for their own good, and it was a real struggle to find moments that really stood out in this one, even compared to F9. If Universal really plans on making two more of these, they really need to bring in writers more on par with Chris Morgan… after the WGA strike is over, of course.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," How much time has passed for the characters of the Fast universe since we last saw them in 2011’s F9: The Fast Saga? I couldn’t tell you if my life depended on it. In that movie, Dominic Toretto’s son Brian looked like a toddler. In the new Fast X, he’s old enough to receive his first driving lesson from his dad. (The actor who plays Brian in Fast X, Leo Abelo Perry, is 10.) Okay. So maybe six years have passed? Maybe more? But it also seems like Fast X happens immediately after F9, since that movie concluded with a confrontation between Han (Sung Kang) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a scene that is also in Fast X. Only when it happened in F9, Sung Kang had short hair, and when the exact same sequence plays out in Fast X — same location, same costumes, even the same guy tied up inside a punching bag — Han now sports a gorgeous, flowing mane. Fast X has a bunch of problems, but this is by far the biggest. Fast & Furious used to be the blockbuster franchise that rewarded attentive viewers. Now it punishes them. Actively caring about the characters only leads to wondering why some of them act differently in Fast X than they did in previous entries. And thinking about the story will just drive you mad as you try to make sense of this bland but confusing revenge tale and its saggy pacing. (One example: At the beginning of the film, Vin Diesel’s Dom and Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty get from Los Angeles to Rome in a single camera cut, but then all of the characters spend the rest of the movie endlessly wandering the globe to get to an all-important safe house.) Dom’s team needs a new hideout because they are being hunted by a dangerous adversary named Dante Reyes, played by Jason Momoa as if he watched Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and thought to himself “Nah, too subtle.” Dante is the son of a notorious Brazilian drug kingpin who was robbed and killed by Dom and his allies during the events of Fast Five. Fast X’s opening sequence inserts Momoa into scenes from Fast Five; it turns out he was a part of that movie’s big climactic chase all along, we just never happened to see him the first time around. And while Dante’s father died, Dante survived and dedicated the next ten years of his life planning his revenge. I would imagine if I had lost my father and my family’s illicit narcotics fortune, and then spent the next decade plotting and executing an intricate plot against a former thief turned super spy for a mysterious government agency known only as “The Agency,” I might be pretty upset about the whole situation. I would like to think I’d approach the task of murdering my enemies with the degree of seriousness such matters deserve. Not Dante Reyes. He is constantly cracking jokes, screaming, making big exaggerated gestures with his hands, suggestively stroking his henchmen’s guns, and talking about how much he loves ballet. He generally looks to be having the time of his life as he tries to kill Dom and his beloved Fast family. Dante claims he’s mad at Dom for taking everything away from him, but it seems like he should be happy about the situation. Dom gave his life purpose, and he set Dante on a course that he clearly enjoys and is quite good at. (Despite the fact that Dom stole the Reyes’ drug money, Dante has limitless resources, soldiers, and technology at his disposal anyway.) Dante even admits at one point he didn’t particularly like his father. Shouldn’t he thank Dominic Toretto for setting him on this path he obviously relishes? I suppose if he did that would make for a very short and very quiet summer blockbuster. Instead, Dante lashes out at Dom and his longtime allies, including his wife and fellow badass Letty, precision driver Han, fast-talking Roman (Tyrese Gibson), computer whiz Tej (Ludachris), and additional computer whiz Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) because you can never have too many people in one of these movies who can glance at a laptop and scream things like “I can break the encryption! Just buy me some time!” Death would be too easy for Dom, Dante says, and so he enacts an elaborate scheme to torture him first. After that opening action sequence in Rome, Dom’s team splits up. For the rest of Fast X’s 140-minute runtime, there are at least four different groups of heroes involved in four different parallel storylines. From that point on, no one in the cast is in the same movie — literally and figuratively. Most of the heroes wind up waylaid in London, where Han gets to finish the aforementioned F9 post-credits scene with Jason Statham, and Statham gets to collect a tidy paycheck for what amounts to a glorified cameo. Meanwhile, with Dom’s family under attack, Diesel goes into full suffering martyr mode, repeatedly welling up as he talks with total sincerity about the importance of fathers and sons and living without fear. Meanwhile, while Dom’s so worried about Brian, Brian is having the time of his life with his Uncle Jakob (John Cena) as they sneak their way to the Toretto safe house. Jakob was F9’s brutal, stern antagonist; scowling, sneering, and repeatedly trying to kill his own brother. In Fast X, Jakob constantly smiles, cracks jokes, and dances to ’90s hip-hop while wearing an “I Have Gas” T-shirt. Does he have amnesia or something? The movie makes no attempt to explain his complete personality shift. All of these threads sew together very uncomfortably, and they feel even more disconnected when you throw Momoa’s prancing, cackling villain into the mix. Is this a grim movie about unending cycles of violence or a wacky big-budget version of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles about how unending cycles of violence are totally rad? And why does it expend so much time and energy trying to convince us we should be worried about characters dying when a significant portion of the main cast has died and returned to life already? (If you want to get technical about it, Han has appeared to die multiple times.) Even in the weaker Fast & Furious movies there are still highlights, and director Louis Leterrier, who took over for longtime Fast helmer Justin Lin after he quit during Fast X’s production, provides a couple. Charlize Theron already appeared in two Fast movies as the villainous hacker Cipher where she mostly glowered at computer screens. Finally someone had the sense to realize that if you’ve got maybe the greatest female action star of her generation in your action movie, you might want to give her some action to perform; both of Theron’s big fight scenes are very entertaining. I also enjoyed Alan Ritchson as Aimes, the new leader of the off-the-books spy agency that has employed Dom and his team for the last few movies. Ritchson nails the tone of the Fast franchise from his very first scene, as he wryly insults Dom and compares his fixation on his family to a “a cult with cars.” He makes a nice addition to the ever-bloating roster of macho action heroes circling through Vin Diesel’s orbit. Befitting a movie with so many different storylines, Fast X — which is supposedly the first of two final movies in the series — concludes with a series of cliffhangers that range in impact from unsatisfying to confusing to borderline insulting. There was a time when Fast & Furious was arguably the best ongoing franchise in Hollywood. It was fun and playful, and had a wonderful cast and a surprisingly dense mythology, one it used to make you care about all of the over-the-top spectacle. Those days ended with Furious 7, which was also the final film starring Paul Walker, who died during its production. Walker’s presence in the Fast movies was the sweet, underplayed counterbalance to Vin Diesel’s ultra-sincere, ultra-sleeveless bombast, and the franchise still hasn’t found a way to fill the void he left behind. In hindsight, the series probably should have stopped after Furious 7, which not only marked the franchise’s farewell to Walker’s character but also to any semblance of logic or cohesion in its ongoing mega-narrative. Since then, Fast & Furious has basically been running on fumes. -What you want to do when you restrain extremely dangerous criminals on gurneys inside the world’s most top-secret black site prison is you want to make sure the controls for their restraints are within reach of the prisoners’ hands at all times, so they can break themselves out whenever they want. It really speeds things up when your movie is already running 140 minutes long. -I look back at what I have written here, and I see that in 1600 words I’ve barely talked about Fast X’s action. That is telling; for perhaps the first time in the entire franchise’s history, there isn’t a single sequence that outdoes what has come before. I can’t think of one set piece that feels destined to go down in Fast history like the Fast Five vault chase, or the Fast & Furious 6 tank attack, or the Furious 7 skyscraper jump, or F9’s magnet cars. That alone might make Fast X the worst film in the entire franchise.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," 
	Not too many film franchises stick around for more than two decades, but the insanely wild motorized antics of Fast X roar ahead without a thought of applying the brakes.  
	Many characters who have appeared in some earlier Fast films turns up in this one, along with some new faces. The most notable of the latter is the formidable Jason Momoa, whose unhinged personality as the villainous Dante Reyes makes this by far the funniest entry in the series to date. The abundance of hearty laughs gives this entry a welcome added dimension. 
	At the outset, most everyone in the Fast world seems to be thriving. There’s a family down-hominess to the handful of early domestic scenes that serve to reconnect the viewer to the characters. There is also a host of women, most of whom are basically in and out in short order — characters played by the likes of Rita Moreno, Michelle Rodriguez, Charlize Theron, Cardi B, Jordana Brewster and even Helen Mirren, back for more in what she must consider a royal lark. Or maybe she really does like fast cars. 
	Ancient landmarks, modern wonders and world capitals are destroyed as if they were mere Cub Scout tents, and the attacks are, to employ a far too commonly used word, awesome indeed. And Dante can get away with it, as no one, at least initially, has a clue how to strike back against such aggression. To the perpetrator, nirvana has arrived; he positively exults in his victories and becomes more and more destructive, and fascinating to watch, as he has his way with whatever landmarks — ancient or modern — the world might strike his fancy to be obliterated. The spectacle is, to reuse a far-too-commonplace word, awesome, and Momoa absorbing his exultant satisfaction with his accomplishments is something to see. On top of that, it’s a vastly amusing rendition of a maniac who probably believes that a destroyed world is the ultimate destination, with himself as the presiding survivor. 
	From a technical perspective, the effects are truly — to use an overused word — astounding. One could just behold the visuals and be gobsmacked, but top that with a trove of impudent humor as the fate of the world’s wonders is so blithely toyed with and you’ve got something.

"May 17, 2023"," You will either watch “Fast X” or you won’t. It’s not a film series that people are on the fence over, and they’ve probably made up their minds long before now. The multibillion-dollar franchise that kicked off over 20 years ago has left what it originally was far behind, eating its dust. However, this penultimate entry in the series has an ace up its sleeve that few will have seen coming. One of the franchise’s new additions, Jason Momoa, plays bad guy Dante Reyes. He’s the son of “Fast Five” villain, drug lord Hernan Reyes. He’s out for revenge after Vin Diesel‘s Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner stole the family’s fortune in a heist in Rio de Janeiro. Reyes Jr. has been plotting ever since, biding his time and putting pieces in play, but now he’s ready to crush Toretto, his crew, and his family, taking away everything he cares about. Momoa, under the encouraging eye of director Louis Leterrier, goes all in on creating a villain who is as flamboyant as he is menacing, stealing every scene he’s in. He’s fabulously megalomaniacal, part Joker and part pantomime baddie, mining the dark tones and comedy beats like his life depends on it. Momoa is always best when he is having fun with his acting, and what “Fast X” has given him is a role of a lifetime. The actor, who has described Dante as someone with “daddy issues” and “sadistic, androgynous and a bit of a peacock,” embodies and embraces those qualities flawlessly. Even though it is Vin Diesel’s at the top of this franchise’s Totem Pole, “Fast X” is Momoa’s movie. He is a revelationary riot. If you have never seen a “Fast” film before and this is where you decide to get on board, even if little of what is going on makes sense, his performance is worth the price of a ticket alone. Drink it up. After the messy and absolutely bananas “F9: The Fast Saga” and over-the-top but disappointing “The Fate of the Furious,””Fast X” takes pages out of the books of both, mixes it with lore, and kicks it up a notch. While the previous entry took some of Toretto’s collective into space, this is comparatively more grounded of the three, even though it is, for want of a better phrase, absolutely ridiculous. The “Fast” movies have always been larger than life but, in recent years, have required an almost entire suspension of disbelief, and this one is no exception. That said, even in its most extreme moments, “Fast X” grounds itself in the insane and unreal but with an accepting tinge of ‘Sure. Why the Fast not?’ part of the action movie Venn diagram. It’s exhausting and exhilarating, and when the audience has experienced what it has to get here, everyone knows all the bets have been off for a long time. Of course, the set pieces are breathtaking ballets of mayhem; one involving a bomb rolling through Rome might be the longest in the franchise yet, and like doing shots of pure adrenaline. Others are shorter but no less impactful and, in between being reminded of the importance of family, are as entertaining as they are captivating. However, now and then, the effects aren’t quite right and yank you out of it. Something not being real is one thing, but there is a line. The upside is that the carnage will draw you back in just as quickly. There are moments of hamfisted and clunky dialogue too, but if you’re looking for, or expecting, something more cerebral, you are in the wrong place. Perhaps the most surprising thing about “Fast X” is how it toys with multiple tones. Audiences expect mind-blowing action and intrigue, tender moments involving family, and some humor, but this is perhaps the first entry with moments where the comedy is much darker. Also, some of the straight darker moments have hints of horror. Leterrier has managed to juggle and mesh everything together without ever feeling overstuffed, messy, or lacking narrative or stylistic cohesion and should be given the credit it deserves. While best known for his film work on “The Transporter” films, “Clash of the Titans,” “The Incredible Hulk,” and “Now You See Me,” it feels like his episodic TV work has given him the skills needed to not only deftly weave this web of arcs but nail the cliffhanger. ",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Fast & Furious is one of Hollywood’s all-time most lucrative franchises. It is also one of its dumbest, and that inanity continues apace—by which I mean, at breakneck speed—with Fast X, the tenth (!) chapter in what has become a monument to absurd action-extravaganza excess, laughable platitudes about family, and Vin Diesel’s superhero-sized ego.  It’s additionally a summer-season series that allows myriad actors not on the Marvel and DC payrolls (and a handful who are!) to earn blockbuster salaries, which is about the only excuse for the majority of these individuals to be wasting their talents on such nonsense. It's been 12 years since Fast & Furious remade itself from a saga about street racing into some sort of bizarre quasi-Mission: Impossible rip-off, with Diesel’s Dominic Toretto reimagined as an invulnerable badass who works for a covert government agency (known as, ahem, The Agency) to thwart dastardly international criminals. That transformation never made sense, but from 2011’s Fast Five on, the franchise’s celebration of multicultural unity and vehicular outrageousness has helped obscure its baseline illogicality. Even so, the finish has begun to wear off, peaking with F9’s decision to send Ludacris’ Tej and Tyrese Gibson’s Roman—comedic foils who’ve yet to utter a legitimately funny word in eight movies—into space via a rocket-propelled roadster, which felt like a move designed to preempt any parodies about the dim-bulb lengths to which these films will go to one-up their predecessors. Fast X features no flights to the stars, nor similar instances of heroes doing ridiculous things like redirecting fired rockets with their bare hands à la Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in The Fate of the Furious. Nonetheless, there’s plenty of preposterousness to be found in this sequel, which barely revs to life when indulging in automotive mayhem and outright stalls every time its human characters open their mouths. No matter which cliché you choose—the series is running out of gas/spinning its wheels/stuck in neutral—Dom and company’s latest exploits are perhaps their most exhaustingly “extreme” to date, not to mention their dimmest. Turning inward on itself to a ludicrous degree, Fast X begins with a prologue that retcons Fast Five, revealing that when Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) dragged drug lord Hernan Reyes’ (Joaquim de Almeida) vault through Rio de Janeiro (killing the baddie in the process), they gravely injured the villain’s heretofore-unknown son Dante (Jason Momoa). Ten years later, Dante reemerges, intent on fulfilling his dad’s wish that Dom suffer before he dies for this theft. Why Dante waited a full decade to exact his revenge is never properly explained, but logic isn’t these proceedings’ strong suit. Neither, it turns out, is action, this despite director Louis Leterrier giving it his best over-the-top shot, employing an abundance of zooming, soaring, whooshing camerawork in an effort to keep the energy high. All that sound and fury, alas, feels tired and desperate, and the fact that Leterrier recycles a knocking-a-bomb-off-a-car’s-undercarriage trick from his Transporter 2 only underlines his lack of imagination. Virtually everyone who’s appeared in a prior Fast & Furious film pops up here, and none of them look particularly thrilled about it. Ludacris and Tyrese half-heartedly engage in ball-busting banter, Jason Statham flashes a few grimaces, John Cena does his earnestly goofy routine, and Scott Eastwood and Brie Larsen (the latter playing the daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody) blankly glare during their brief screen time. As Dom’s beloved Letty, Michelle Rodriguez snarls and yells per tradition, and Reacher’s Alan Ritchson struts around in shirts that are two sizes too small, the better to show off his massive frame. Charlize Theron mostly plays exhausted as super-cyber-criminal Cipher, while Sung Kang looks downright miserable as resurrected Dom pal Han. Even Helen Mirren and Jordana Brewster do some drive-by work, the latter in a scene that asks us to believe that the physically slight actress is capable of taking down a cadre of heavily armed soldiers. There are so many cameos and callbacks littered throughout Fast X that its story feels secondary. That turns out to be a good thing, since Dante’s plot—killing everything Dom loves, most notably his son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry)—is a drawn-out affair in which the fiend gives Dom every opportunity imaginable to escape harm. Momoa is the only one who seems to be having any fun, although there’s a debate to be had about whether his brazenly queer-coded performance (all hip-thrusting, brightly painted fingernails, ornate rings, shimmering shirts, chitchat about masculinity standards, and pronouncements like “I’m Dante, au chante!” and “The carpet matches the drapes!”) is colorful or distasteful. Either way, it’s still more tolerable than writers Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin’s third grade-level dialogue. Every utterance is a trailer-tailored bromide (“Sometimes fear can be the best teacher;” “Without honor, you got no family. Without family, you got nothing!”; “The fallout will be existential!”) and, moreover, worse than the last. Diesel himself glowers, bellows, and poses with typical He-Man-ish confidence, his Dom now so thoroughly rendered a cartoon that his impossible feats (knocking a flaming bomb off-course with his car; plummeting from a plane in his Dodge, and then driving down the wall of a dam) are less awe-inspiring than awfully dull.  Dom’s invincibility neuters any suspense, just as Fast X’s overpopulated plot shortchanges everyone. It’s a film that’s content to simply put new spins on old centerpieces, and the brief sound of a Harry Potter musical theme only exacerbates the sense that Leterrier’s installment is a retread designed to keep the IP afloat regardless of whether there’s anything novel left to do with these characters, their soap opera entanglements, or their turbo-charged vehicles. Intended as the first half of a two-part franchise finale (which may now become a trilogy, God forbid), Fast X closes on a monumental cliffhanger. However, given that there’s zero chance its main characters (save for one) are in serious danger of meeting their maker, it proves to be one more affected gesture in a fiasco stuffed full of them, be it sight of Dom crying over a deceased love, wistfully gazing at old photos of himself and Walker’s Brian, or clutching his crucifix as a means of expressing his deep (and oft-referenced) faith. Bloated, listless and unintentionally hilarious, it’s a spectacular wreck. Liked this review?

"May 17, 2023"," It's hard to believe that the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise began back in 2001 with a story centered around a criminal ring stealing electronics. In the two decades since then, the multi-billion dollar film series has turned into a global heist machine with technology that's way more advanced than a DVD player. Hell, ""F9: The Fast Saga"" managed to send two of the franchise's longtime characters into space. How the hell did we get here?  The answer is ""Fast Five,"" a sequel that reinvigorated the franchise with the best action that the entire series had seen up until that point and the badass attitude and beefy brawn of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. After the film's massive blockbuster success, and adding a boost to franchises like ""The Mummy"" and ""G.I. Joe,"" many referred to Johnson as ""franchise Viagra,"" so much that there was an entire ""Saturday Night Live"" monologue dedicated to the perceived phenomenon. Well, if Dwayne Johnson is franchise Viagra, then ""Fast X"" villain Jason Momoa is pure, uncut cocaine, and the usual physics-defying, explosive action and hammy melodrama of the franchise is made even better by the chaos that he unleashes on Vin Diesel and the rest of ""The Fast Saga"" family.  ""Fast X"" is packed with all of the unbelievable, high-octane action you've come to expect and love, but it is Jason Momoa's bad guy Dante who truly makes this a must-see blockbuster experience that turns this sequel into the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" of the entire franchise. Featuring echoes of ""Fast Five,"" this flick unleashes some of the series' best action sequences alongside a show-stopping eruption of endlessly entertaining insanity from Jason Momoa. However, the ride isn't always satisfying, as some of the story's side plots (and there are many of them) don't drive as smoothly as the rest of the movie, and perhaps most importantly, the emotional core is still missing a key ingredient that has been gone since the end of ""Furious 7."" ""Fast X"" actually begins in the past, providing a new perspective on the climactic heist from ""Fast Five,"" the one that found Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) dragging a vault loaded with cash that belongs corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) across Rio de Janeiro. That heist resulted in the death of Reyes, and as we learn in this expanded flashback, his son Dante was actually involved in the dangerous pursuit of the vault, but Dom's slick maneuvering launched him into the river, inadvertently beginning his long road to revenge. Flash forward to the present day, and we're attending another peaceful meal between Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family. Though his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) is in attendance, her husband Brian (Dom's ride-or-die) is again nowhere to be found. Brian doesn't even pull up late without being seen like at the end of ""F9."" But the late Paul Walker's presence still lingers. After a heartwarming toast by Dom's grandmother (a bit part for the legendary Rita Moreno), Dom reflects on their journey ever so briefly as the piano notes of Wiz Khalifa's ""See You Again"" play softly, complete with shots of publicity photos that now double as family photos. It's the only bit of genuine emotional resonance in the entire movie, which speaks to a larger problem in the sequels that have arrived in the wake of Walker's passing, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Meanwhile, Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang), and more recent honorary family inductee Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) are talking about a new mission that The Agency is sending them on in Rome. Coincidentally enough, it's Roman who's leading the charge, with Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) sitting this one out. After all, they have to look after Dom's son (also named Brian, played by Leo Abelo Perry) from another mother, who has already been learning to drive with Dom. Plus, it's more than implied that Dom and Letty are trying to have a child of their own. But they're about to be shoved headfirst into the danger that's yet to come.  Suddenly, their night is interrupted when Cipher (Charlize Theron) shows up on their doorstep, looking like she's just taken a beating. But who could have shaken the villainous Cipher to her core so much that the only person she felt like she could turn to was Dom, especially after blackmailing him and threatening to kill little Brian when he was just a toddler? Enter Jason Momoa as Dante, and it's immediately clear he's the kind of villain who has done his homework and will always be one step ahead of our heroes. But this is just the beginning.  One thing leads to another, and everyone realizes that the mission in Rome isn't actually an official assignment from The Agency. Instead, it's a deadly trap set by Dante that results in a massive boulder of a bomb tearing down the hilly streets of the Italian city. Dom and Letty arrive just as the faux heist has gone off the rails, and along with Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey, they try to stop the bomb from detonating, or at the very least, keep it from reaching Dante's target, The Vatican.  The entire action sequence in Rome is easily the most thrilling part of the movie, and it's one of the best action setpieces in the entire franchise. Director Louis Leterrier knows how to stage these massive sequences, and he keeps the momentum going with plenty of pieces in play. Dante spices up the usual heist formula by being an absolute madman, constantly taunting our heroes and trading blows with them in an extensive chase sequence full of total mayhem and destruction. Whether Dante is remotely controlling a truck with our heroes trapped inside like some kind of comic book villain or speeding into action himself on a motorcycle, it's clear this villain is fearless and reckless, and he's going to be the most formidable foe that ""The Fast Saga"" has ever seen. This first confrontation that Dom and his family have with Dante results in them being turned into wanted criminals. With Agency leader Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) nowhere to be found, his daughter Tess (Brie Larson) can't do anything to stop the de facto replacement Aimes (""Reacher"" star Alan Ritchson) from tracking down Dom and the rest of the crew, assuming that they've turned back to their criminal roots. Aimes is basically the new version of Dwayne Johnson's character Hobbs, but he's written a little more cleverly, especially in his introductory scene that finds him providing some meta-commentary in a quasi-recap of the exploits of ""The Fast Saga"" up until now, even going so far as to lament how long they've let this operation go on and poke fun at how many of their former enemies have inexplicably gone on to become part of the family.  From then on, it's a game of cat and mouse with Dante completely dismantling everything that the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise has become known for after all these years, all so he can make Dom suffer for a while before he decides to kill him. Inspired by his father, Dante says, ""Never accept death when suffering is owed."" Access to high-tech gadgets with a seemingly endless budget? Dante wipes out their bank accounts. A wager that brings incredibly high stakes to a street race with inevitable slow-motion shots of woman shaking their backsides in high heels and tropical colors as the hip-hop soundtrack pulses? Dante interrupts it looking like a flamboyant genie, and then literally blows up the racers. None of Dom's usual tricks are going to work.  Dante becomes The Joker of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, and ""Fast X"" is all the better for it. Jason Momoa's performance goes from being a gender-fluid cartoon character dressed in colorful, flowing fabrics and ample accessories (including too many rings, gold chains attached to his glasses, and even a silky scrunchie) to being a sadistic psychopath in the same breath. He's exactly the kind of villain this series needed. One scene finds him sitting with the propped-up dead bodies of two of Cipher's henchmen, talking about doing his nails and carrying out his grand plan as if they were still alive. Even more demented is that he's taped open their eyes and mouths into twisted expressions. It's darkly hilarious and may be the best example of how deranged Dante can be.  But for all the work that Jason Momoa does to make ""Fast X"" stand above the more recent ""Fate of the Furious"" and ""F9,"" there are still missteps that are a bit distracting. Some of them are issues that ""Fast and Furious"" has had since Paul Walker passed away and took Brian out of the equation. Others are the result of too many characters with big names attached who need to be given things to do and a need to establish set-ups that will pay off in the next movie, making the ""Infinity War"" elements of ""Fast X"" both a feature and a flaw.  John Cena is given the shakiest branch of the story. It seems that Dom's plan for keeping little Brian safe in these dangerous circumstances involves his brother Jakob taking him to an unknown safe location. Lest we forget, Jacob is coming off being one of the villains in ""F9,"" and now he's the person who Dom trusts with his son's life.  The sequence where Jakob has to stop The Agency from grabbing little Brian to use as bait to bring Dom out of hiding gets Mia in on the action, and all this does is call into question how Brian is able to stay away from the threat that Dante is unleashing upon everyone else. It's a major distraction early on in the movie, and it will always be a problem as long as Paul Walker's character remains alive.  From then on, Cena's portion of the story feels like it's from a family-friendly road trip adventure comedy where he plays a bit of a goober uncle trying to take care of Dom's fairly cool kid. It's like watching scenes from ""Cop and a Half"" in the middle of a ""Fast and Furious"" movie, and even though it's intended to be played for laughs most of the time, it's just not great. Meanwhile, Letty and Cipher have the honor of taking us on a journey that seems only to exist in order to set up a big reveal in the film's third act, which actually only functions as a tease for what's to come in ""Fast and Furious 11."" There's even a fight between the two women that is entirely unnecessary. Granted, there are some solid blows throughout that face-off, but that storyline mostly feels like a waste of time. But perhaps the biggest shortcoming of ""Fast X"" comes from the lack of emotional stakes. Ever since Brian was taken out of the action, the core of the film's heart has been missing. Dom and Brian's friendship was the driving force of this franchise, and try as several filmmakers might to shift that emotional center to Dom and Letty while still caring about the rest of the ever-growing family, it just hasn't been the same since Paul Walker passed away. Instead, the dramatic parts of the story feel like a soap opera that's trying way too hard to take itself seriously. Sure, that's typically been part of the charm of these movies, but there's still something missing.  Thankfully, none of the imperfections in ""Fast X"" keep the movie from being a bodacious blockbuster that knows exactly what fans want to see on the action front. There's still plenty of totally ridiculous vehicular havoc and lots of crisply choreographed hand-to-hand combat. As usual, the comedy is hit or miss, but honestly, these movies wouldn't feel the same if they had finely-tuned gags from expert comedians. The dad joke level of humor is perfectly suited to this franchise, and there's plenty of it on display. Of course, there are plenty of surprises along the way too, including a fun cameo that no one will see coming (not the one that was rudely spoiled by a major trade last week), and the kind of twists and turns that make this film series a joy to watch, including the biggest cliffhanger ending in franchise history. ""Fast X"" may be a far cry from the relatively grounded ""Point Break"" retread offered by ""The Fast and the Furious"" back in 2001, but this sequel has many of the hallmarks that have made for the best sequels, especially ""Fast Five."" Though it stumbles in parts, Jason Momoa is there to keep the car in drive before he hits the nitro and blows everything to hell. It's over-the-top, outrageous entertainment that is worthy of seeing on the silver screen with the biggest tub of popcorn you can find. BOOM!",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," It’s wild to think that the Fast Saga has been a part of my life for over 20 years. No, that doesn’t mean I’m having a family BBQ and knocking back Corona’s in honor of the racing/super spy efforts of Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto and his crew every month. Still, it’s not as though there isn’t some mention of living life a quarter mile at a time that happens at least once a year. Fast X is the tenth entry in this franchise and reportedly the first part of its two-part finale. Regardless of whether or not Diesel and this cast return in some form in spin-offs following these entries, the evolution of this franchise from dealing with street racers to contending with superhero spies is more apparent than ever here. Building off what feels like an attempt to capture the energy of Avengers: Infinity War, Fast X is a massive movie with many moving parts and a villain who will easily become iconic for fans of the series. And here’s the other thing – as ridiculous as this film is, it feels very thought out. Coming off of the more mixed efforts of the past few installments, this is the best entry since Furious 7. Given how much this series has always worn its themes on its sleeves, it also wants to make sure no one is lost in the proceedings, so Fast X has at least three different recaps to make sure everyone is caught up on who Diesel’s Dom is, what his family has accomplished over the course of two decades, and why the son of a drug lord wants to break it all apart. That’s really the gist of this film’s plot. Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa acting with Joker-level maniacal glee) wants revenge on Dom for taking everything from him based on the events of Fast Five (the one where they pulled off a bank heist by dragging a huge vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro – the best film in the franchise). To do this, Dante comes at Dom with everything. That means gathering a bunch of henchmen, stealing surveillance devices established in previous entries, and concocting elaborate plans that always leave Dante multiple steps ahead. Of course, as long as Dom has his car and his family, he’s pretty unstoppable. Here’s the thing though – Dante makes the right moves as far as splitting Dom from everyone for as long as he can. In doing this, the film can balance various locations featuring different cast members with better and lesser results. As far as the better goes, John Cena returns as Jakob, Dom’s estranged brother. He’s tasked with keeping Dom’s son (Leo Abelo Perry) safe. Compared to F9, where Jakob had to be stoic and mean, this film allows Cena to unleash the big kid energy we all know he’s capable of. As a result, there’s a lot of fun to be had in watching this big guy being a protector. On the other hand, the set of Dom’s crew that is Tyrese Gibson’s Roman, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges’ Tej, Nathalie Emmanuel’s Ramsey, and Sung Kang’s Han, is less exciting. Sure, a large action sequence set in Rome that features the entire Fast crew is as exciting and nonsensical as one hopes for. However, once split apart, this foursome’s escapades never achieve much beyond some scattered laughs. Their duties include visiting a location, finding information, realizing they’ve been compromised, and running away. It happens a few times (one featuring a cameo that is never as funny as the film wants it to be) and ultimately adds up to very little. There’s more to say regarding the rest of this ensemble cast, which includes the series’ knack for bringing a former villain onto the side of the heroes, as well as a return of Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, who seems somehow angrier than the last time he was with this crew. However, even with additions that include Brie Larson as a rogue secret agent (uh huh) and EGOT Rita Moreno as Abuelita Torretto (put her behind the wheel next time!), the real boost this entry gets is from Momoa. The Aquaman star has described his character as a peacock with a lot of issues, and that’s absolutely correct. Momoa is going all in here, complete with various costume changes and a level of flamboyance that counteracts his imposing image of machismo. It’s incredibly welcome and highly memorable, given how much fun he’s clearly having in the role. It really adds to this series in a positive way, given how much sincerity Diesel strives for, despite all the craziness around him. Honestly, this has to be the most earnest blockbuster series out there that is willing to rewrite the rules of physics as well as deliver monologues about the importance of keeping family together at all costs. Regardless, Momoa’s Dante brings a real sense of danger to the proceedings. Yet, his sociopathic menace keeps you wanting to see more of this guy. Director Louis Leterrier has stepped in this time around (replacing FF3-FF6 & F9’s Justin Lin a few weeks into production), and he seems to get what is needed. The director of a couple of Transporter films, among other B-movie fair (Unleashed with Jet Li rules), knows his way around this sort of movie, even at the blown-up scale it’s at, and seems to know how to stay out of the way of the stuff that works. That’s not exactly a compliment, nor is it a complaint. Really, while I wouldn’t say this franchise runs on rails, a certain kind of house style has worked for the Fast films, and Leterrier steps up to hit the marks as needed. The results allow for two guarantees – the action is insane. Yes, the idea that an ensemble cast serves as a nearly indestructible crew that can use cars to solve any problem is just plain dumb. However, to see this in action remains fun, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s still reliant on a lot of practical stunt work. Visual effects are all over this thing, and I’m not even going to get into the extremes to which they apply. However, there’s still a good amount of physical work going into making many of these car chases, fights, shootouts, and other sequences filled with spectacle possible. As far as the other assurance, it’s Diesel. It’s easy to go at this guy for what feels like his limited sense of range in the realm of action, but he’s very aware of himself. Honestly, I’d argue he’s perhaps better than usual as Dom in this film precisely because of the concern that’s pushed on him by Dante. Yes, so much of the dialogue is rubbish, but there’s a kind of delivery that Diesel can pull off in these flicks that feels satisfying if you’re into what sort of silly energy drives these films. When we get these installments of a Fast movie every so often, it provides a goofy sense of familiarity watching this guy, mostly sleeveless, growling and scowling his way to the film’s heart. I dig it, much like I dig this franchise as a whole. Fast X is by no means perfect or even great as a film. It’s pretty long, although it packs those minutes with all it can. With that said, there’s more casual killing on the part of our heroes, which felt off. Say what you will about the destruction going on at times, but there’s always a willing acknowledgment (however slight in mention) that this crew has their goals in mind and they specifically do not want to harm civilians (seriously, watch these movies). This time around, however, the various agents that come after Dom and his crew are ostensibly just government employees, right? So, I don’t know, watching Cena, Statham, Diesel, etc., continually destroying these people instead of just Dante’s people seemed oddly cruel. Despite this, however, as far as big, explosive blockbuster entertainment goes, I have little doubt that some of the other films arriving this summer (ahem…Mission: Impossible) will crush in all the ways I hope. Still, the Fast family is humming along, and this series hasn’t let up in its style of craziness either. Not hurting is the focus. This globetrotting action flick features muscle cars vs. helicopters, heavy-duty cars with missile launchers attached, and Diesel lifting cars to protect family. It’s got everything! And most importantly, it has a wild Momoa performance to help center it all. This film leaves things off on a cliffhanger of sorts, and it’s an accomplishment to have me genuinely curious about where it all goes next, as I had quite a fulfilling ride with this one already.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," 
	With a new director (Louis Leterrier) in the driver's seat, this first part of a vaguely defined finale spins its wheels while Vin Diesel & Co. try to decide where the franchise is going. 
	Every race needs a finish line. For the “Fast & Furious” franchise, the studio keeps shoving it farther down the road, at least according to Vin Diesel, who suggested at the world premiere of the 10th installment — a brainless but action-packed thrill ride billed as “Fast X” — that Universal might split the “finale” over three movies. Why not seven? Or 20 more, for that matter? That might allow Diesel to merge these increasingly desperate sequels with his other running-on-fumes franchise, “XXX.” 
	“There’s a war coming. Sides are being chosen, and everyone you love will be destroyed,” warns Charlize Theron’s super-hacker Cipher, who was also a villain last time we checked. But “the enemy of my enemy” and all that. I told you to ignore the script. The filmmakers did, to the point that “X” marks the spot where the property’s most dependable director, Justin Lin, called it quits. You may be tempted to do the same. Then again, if you’ve made it this far, you may as well hold on till “F11” or “FasTwelve.” 
	Leterrier’s bad with story but reasonably strong on the action front. Characters are constantly jumping in and out of speeding vehicles in these movies, and Leterrier’s job here must have felt somewhat similar, clambering aboard the juggernaut that is the “Fast” franchise in full steam. Fans may forgive the giant leaps of logic, the way pointless scenes (like Pete Davidson’s cameo) devolve into fistfights for no good reason, since such conflict keeps things exciting. 
	Most of the time, it’s hard to follow why Dom and company are doing what they’re doing, apart from the obvious point that they’re trying not to repeat themselves — which is ironic, since the movie opens with a six-minute rehash of the “Fast Five” climax, with Momoa inserted into the action. He gets blasted off that bridge in Rio, dies for a few seconds and then dedicates the next decade (off-screen) to studying Dom’s every move. 
	Dante is one of those characters who knows way more about the franchise than you do (Marvel is full of them), making casual viewers feel like they should have done their homework before watching a movie that otherwise asks them to park their brains at the door. Between his Prince-meets-Tiger King wardrobe and the theatrical way he treats mass destruction like a Siegfried and Roy show, Dante’s a weirdly ambiguous character — a curious case of queerbaiting (or just a bad actor’s attempt to make an impression) that coexists alongside the series’ clearly hetero appetites. As always, “Fast X” features extended montages of unnamed and often faceless women in booty shorts twerking before each street race. 
	Daniela Melchior plays Isabel, one of two new female characters who actually get a name. As Agency operative Tess, Brie Larson is the other. Both are related to friends of Dom’s from previous movies — which makes them “family,” too, by his logic. The trouble with having such an extended circle (apart from it being tricky to give them all things to do, with some, like Helen Mirren, showing up for just one or two scenes) is that it makes Dom super vulnerable to the kind of “suffering” Dante intends. 
	First, he unleashes a sloppily rendered, giant rolling neutron bomb on the streets of Rome, nearly blowing up the Vatican. There are explosive scenes in Brazil, Portugal, Los Angeles and Antarctica, all of which seem to be a five-minute commute from one another. While Dom spends much of the movie trying to protect his 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry), a whole bunch of beloved long-timers wind up “dying,” although these movies have shown such a flexible understanding of mortality (not to mention physics and plausibility) that it doesn’t make sense to mourn them just yet.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Ten movies in, it's not hard to see use car-related puns to talk about how the 'Fast and Furious' franchise is running out of fuel or that the wheels are starting to come off, or that the brakes need to be pumped, or that it will probably fail an NCT test (if it could get one with these waiting times). There's very little left for 'Fast X' to do when each movie has outdone the last one. For example, 'Fast 8' had the Rock punch a submarine torpedo. The same movie had a supercar drive from one skyscraper in mid-air to another. For a movie that began as a 'Point Break' rip-off and has expanded with the cast of characters it has now, it's impressive how far it's gone, how silly it's gotten, and how many seemingly respectable actors have gotten caught up in the silliness. This movie boasts no less than four Oscar winners in fairly substantial roles, including screen legends Rita Moreno as Vin Diesel's granny, and Helen Mirren as Jason Statham's mother. There are cameos aplenty, including some familiar faces from previous movies back to wave at the camera before heading off. Yet, it rattles through them all like it's the last of a soap opera because that's essentially what the 'Fast & Furious' franchise has become - a soap opera with expensive stunts. There's even been a main character that had amnesia and turned evil for a period of time.  The plot for 'Fast X' is no less of a soap opera. Jason Momoa plays the son of Joaquim de Almeida, the big bad from 'Fast Five' who was pancaked by a flying car in the physics-defying chase through Rio de Janeiro with a giant vault attached to two Dodge Chargers. Momoa plays Dante Reyes with about as much restraint and subtlety as you'd expect from a character that sounds like he's walked off the set of 'Falcon Crest' circa 1987. Far and away, Momoa is the best thing about this movie and it reminds us that he's probably better playing a villain, or at least an anti-hero, than he is anything else. Where 'Fast X' should excel is in its stunts. Hiring Louis Letterier, he of 'The Transporter' fame, should have brought a kind of kinetic energy that's slowly ebbed away from the franchise. Instead, Letterier seems content to keep the action as before - lots of CGI cars, lots of fancy locales being trashed by CGI cars, and those ridiculous camera moves across speeding cars that just completely take out of it. 'Fast X' doesn't shy away from defying the laws of gravity, human physiology (somebody gets shot in this and walks it off, pretty much) and physics. Still, if audiences wanted to see actors doing all this, they could watch a comic-book movie. When you look at 'John Wick: Chapter 4' or the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning', you see that action cinema can be done better - thoughtfully, artistically, and convincingly. Instead, 'Fast X' just drives at full revs, burning out the engine entirely and leaving audiences trying to catch a glimpse of it all as it whizzes past us. It's not without some fun moments, and when the action switches to one-on-one without a car, there are some well-choreographed punch-ups - one of them including a house effectively being destroyed from the inside out. Instead, this and a couple of other standout moments are squeezed into a movie that's already rammed with two hours and twenty minutes of constant and, ultimately, exhausting car-crash action that rings hollow.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," It was startling to see such a bloated cinematic travesty of Fast & Furious 9, easily one of the worst movies in the franchise since 2009’s Fast & Furious 4 (and among the worst movies of 2021) still managed to rake in US$726.2 million (!) at the worldwide box office. The movie may fail to crack the US$1 billion mark previously achieved in the seventh and eighth entries but the fact it could earn this much at the height of the pandemic era is beyond me. I guess no matter how outrageously dumb and silly a Fast & Furious movie gets in each instalment, there’s always a loyal fanbase large enough and audiences alike to prove it otherwise in terms of its sizable box office earning. Now here comes Fast X, which is supposed to serve as the first entry of the two-part conclusion before Vin Diesel recently teased the possibility of a twelfth instalment, making it a trilogy if everything goes well as planned (read: depending on the box-office outcome). The initial idea of concluding the franchise with a two-parter has already overstretched and not to mention overstayed its welcome because frankly, it should have ended on a high note in Fast & Furious 7 a.k.a. Furious 7 after Paul Walker’s untimely death in 2013. This time, Louis Leterrier from the first two Transporter as well as The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans fame is in charge of the direction after franchise mainstay Justin Lin chose to step down due to creative differences. Leterrier is no stranger to directing big-budget Hollywood blockbusters and even trashy B-level actioners seen in the Transporter movies, making him the right candidate for the job. Just like how Fast & Furious 9 managed to find an excuse for a plot shoehorning Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto’s long-lost brother played by John Cena (yes, he’s back in this one too), the tenth instalment continues the same tradition by retroactively adding a new role connected to the past character or story in the franchise. That role in question is Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), who turns out to be the son of Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan (Joaquim de Almeida). If the latter’s name sounds familiar, that’s because he’s the main antagonist in Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist a.k.a. Fast Five. For a quick recap, the last time we saw Hernan was seriously injured from the result of a vault hitting his car before Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) executed him point-blank to avenge his team’s death. With the “magic” of retroactive continuity (retcon), we learn that Dante happened to be there at the time when Dom and his gang pulled off the Rio heist and they were the ones responsible for his father’s death. He orchestrated a long-term plan for vengeance by not only targeting Dom but also the rest of his family including Dom’s tween son, Little Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). So, the whole story — credited to Dan Mazeau of Wrath of the Titans fame and Justin Lin, who also co-produced the movie — is about Dante’s ultimate quest for vengeance and the good news is, Jason Momoa certainly has a field day playing the long-running franchise’s latest antagonist. His Dante is all flamboyant and sadistic — a full-blown psychopath that Momoa portrays his role with gleeful abandon and a dash of devil-may-care charisma. It was as if he already knows well he was in a franchise where logic barely matters and simply here embraces the silliness by going full throttle. As much as I enjoy Momoa’s performance in Fast X, the movie’s 141-minute length sure feels like it’s unnecessarily overstretched. Dante’s elaborate revenge plot may see him unleash everything he has at his disposal, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. And yet, for all the chaos that he caused throughout the movie, he accomplishes so little when comes to inflicting serious pain or trauma against Dom and his family. Make no mistake, casualty does happen in this movie but it hardly matters who survives or dies at the end of the day. Blame it on the franchise’s penchant for resurrecting some of the past characters whenever the filmmakers see fit regardless of whether it makes a lick of sense or not. Sung Kang’s Han is one of them, where we last saw him return in Fast & Furious 9 even after his character was killed off in a car explosion in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Because of this, I no longer care about any character’s demise unless the franchise stops with all the retconned nonsense and made them stay dead. Speaking of the retcon, the ending got me all baffled with the what-the-heck-did-I-just-saw moment on the big screen. Seriously, I couldn’t stop laughing about it. I get that a Fast & Furious movie is reminiscent of a big-budget, over-the-top telenovela with action. I can tolerate movies that contain over-the-top elements and John Wick: Chapter 4 was a recent example, which did a great job at it. The ending in Fast X? It’s just too much to swallow. For an action movie that costs a mammoth US$340 million, the CGI is pretty inconsistent in some scenes. The action is a mixed bag (Dom’s souped-up muscle car vs. the helicopters highway chase scene feels like it tries too hard to upstage the tank chase in Fast & Furious 6), even though credit still goes to Louis Leterrier’s flair for some wildly extravagant action set pieces and spectacular stunts (the extended Rome chase scene revolving around the tonne-heavy rolling metal-ball bomb is easily the most entertaining moment here). The hand-to-hand combat scenes such as Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) vs. Cipher (Charlize Theron) in the lab are well-choreographed, thanks to Patrick Vo’s thrilling fight choreography, who previously collaborated with Leterrier in the underrated Jet Li-starred Unleashed (2005). Back to the cast, Momoa steals the show here while the recurring stars of the franchise from Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto to the usual comic-relief duo played by Tyrese Gibson and Chris “Ludacris” Bridges are all business as usual. Franchise newcomer Brie Larson, who plays Mr Nobody’s (Kurt Russell) rogue-agent daughter, Tess looks typically robotic as if she can’t get rid of her Captain Marvel’s deadpan persona. Since Fast X is originally conceived as a two-parter (before it was later revealed to be a possible trilogy), the movie ends with a cliffhanger and it even comes with a mid-credits scene that will most likely get the fans excited. Fast X may have been a slight improvement over the severely lacklustre Fast & Furious 9 but even with Jason Momoa’s scene-stealing performance and some worthwhile moments, I’m not sure how much gas they have left to (forcefully) stretch this into a trilogy.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," Fast & Furious is nearing its finish line and if you thought the Fast Saga was going to end quietly, then you've clearly never watched the series. We had thought Fast X was going to be the first of a two-part finale, but Vin Diesel recently let slip that it could well the first movie of a climactic trilogy. It would be a fittingly, uh, understated way to end a series that was originally about street racing, but has become an entirely different beast. Subtlety has never been in the Fast Saga's wheelhouse, so it will be no surprise to learn that their approach to a multi-part finale is to go massive, setting up far too many plot threads that one movie can't tie up. In fact, Fast X barely manages to complete any and decides to just leave most of them open. The result is an overstuffed blockbuster that doesn't satisfy as a complete whole, but works as another ride that's often ludicrously entertaining and elevated by the best villain in the series. Fast X continues the series' penchant for retcons by revealing that Fast Five's villain Hernan Reyes had a son called Dante (Jason Momoa). He was there during the safe heist and the final battle on the bridge but we never saw him, and he's been concocting his revenge against Dom (Vin Diesel) for a decade. Don't worry if you either haven't seen Fast Five or haven't seen it in a while because Fast X recaps it whenever it can. All you really need to know is that Dante is pissed and he doesn't want to kill Dom as you ""never accept death when suffering is owed"". It marks a refreshing change-up for the series which had increasingly fallen into comfortable plot mechanics: bad person wants some world-threatening high tech, Dom and his familia have to stop them.  Here, director Louis Leterrier plays with that expectation during a first-act heist in Rome which delivers everything you'd expect from a Fast movie. There's incredible car and motorbike stunts, a massive bomb rolling through the streets and a scarcely believable way for Dom to save the day that defies the laws of physics. But rather than the set-up for the same old Fast movie, the heist is all a knowing misdirect as Dante is playing an entirely different game. It leads to Dom's familia being scattered around the globe, leading to a more grounded – well, in terms of this series – outing that avoids outlandish spectacle like space travel. The issue is that the sprawling cast means that there are multiple subplots going on. As Dom tries to track down Dante, we've got a few of the gang in London, while Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and nemesis Cipher (Charlize Theron) are at a CIA black site and Jakob (John Cena) is being a protective uncle in Los Angeles. You'd assume that all of the subplots, including the shenanigans of new Agency head Aimes (Alan Ritchson) and Mr Nobody's daughter Tess (Brie Larson), would combine for a big finale. However, Fast X never really does this and each subplot seemingly exists to just set up the next movie. Fast X might not go to space or have multiple huge set pieces, but it's still a massive movie because of this. The pacing isn't on the mark though, so we leave subplots for extended periods and if you didn't know there was a second part coming, you would leave frustrated with how the movie ends. However, there is one shining light that just about keeps Fast X on track: Jason Momoa's Dante Reyes. He's the strongest villain of the series to date and Momoa is having the time of his life, delivering an excellent performance as he does so.  Dante is a flamboyant and theatrical baddie who absolutely loves what he does and as much as he hates Dom, he's also a bit of a fanboy and relishes battling wits with him. Like the switch-up with the plot, Dante is a world away from the usually serious Fast & Furious villains who are evil just because. Momoa is so good that when Fast X has to switch lanes and catch up with the other subplots, his presence is sorely missed despite the typically reliable turns from the extended cast.  There's a playful edge to Dante's villain that spreads through other aspects of Fast X too. It's a series that's increasingly in on the joke,  such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson) talking about invincibility in Fast 9. A standout scene here sees Aimes moan about family BBQs and deliver deadpan lines about violating the laws of ""God and gravity"". Fast & Furious fans certainly won't feel shortchanged by Fast X because as much as it changes the formula, it still delivers a lot of the same. There are deep-cut references, unexpected cameos and spectacle that no other series can deliver – after all, where else can you see helicopters used as wrecking balls?  The final act will certainly create discussion too that will tide Fast fans over until the 11th movie arrives in 2025 (assuming the writers' strike doesn't delay it). You'll know it probably won't do what it's teasing, but it'll be fun to speculate endlessly over. But as much as the ending has an impact, it's hard to escape the feeling that Fast X is only half a story and forgot to tell a cohesive story of its own. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"May 17, 2023"," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Heading into the screening for “Fast X,” I figured the “Fast & Furious” saga was no longer capable of surprise. Besides that one time two guys drove a rocket car into outer space, these movies started to feel interchangeable around “Fast & Furious 6″ ten years ago when Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his ragtag crew of drag racers leveled up from smuggling to international espionage. That’s why I fully expected to file essentially the same review I wrote for “F9″ in 2021. Something like, “Grumble-quote, grumble-quote. Caveat: I enjoyed every minute of it!” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"May 17, 2023"," The Fast & Furious family reached the final frontier when it sent Tej and Roman to literal space in F9. So where does the franchise go from there when it’s been all over the world and beyond? The answer is not very far. With Fast X, the franchise is reaching the end of the road with it acting as the starting flag for a now trilogy of films to close out the main storyline. As Dom’s ever growing family continues to get bigger and bigger, their adventures have also grown to exponentially ridiculous proportions. That all reaches a tipping point in Fast X. The film is a buffet of action set pieces dense in adrenaline but lacking in any real substance. Sure, you’ll get a quick sugar rush from it all, but the crash that comes afterwards comes equally fast and furious and will leave you exhausted. Dom is pushed to the limit when Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes who had his vault ripped straight from the building in Fast Five by Dom and his crew, emerges from the shadows and enacts revenge against his family. Dante blames Dom for the death of his father, and plans to make him suffer as he takes everything and everyone from him. 10 films deep and the Fast & Furious franchise continues to get more and more complex as it rewrites old stories to fit in new characters and motivations. This time it focuses on Fast Five to introduce Dante Reyes, played brilliantly by Jason Momoa. Fast X opens with a replay of scenes from the film’s vault heist with new footage featuring Dante spliced in. It’s interesting to see because Dom and Brian tethering a massive bank vault to their cars and speeding through the street of Rio de Janeiro is arguably when the franchise went off the rails and the street racer thieves first became superheroes. From there, the film pretty much follows the same action format as the previous entries in the franchise; new villain, same story. I’ll start with the good; Jason Momoa. Dante Reyes is one of the most exciting characters to be added to the Fast & Furious franchise. He is outrageously over-the-top, even by Fast standards, and Momoa plays him with a devilish charm and excitement that feels lacking elsewhere in the film. He’s constantly taunting Dom with one-liners while taking out his crew one by one or causing destruction all over Rome. He’s the kind of guy who will casually paint a guy’s toenails after brutally murdering someone sitting right next to him. There’s a sadistic glee to Dante, and no one does it better than Momoa. He’s smart, successful at getting to Dom, and flashy on every level. Jason Momoa is having fun with the role, unlike everyone else who looks like they’re exhausted and out of gas as they’re trying to reach the finish line. Fast X struggles because the franchise has reached its breaking point. The family has gotten too big for its own good. A lot of that has to do with the fact that Vin Diesel refuses to let any moment leave a lasting impression. These characters are now superheroes who are practically invulnerable to anything and everything. It was entertaining for a while, but now it has lost all meaning. What’s the point of someone’s death when they’re likely to return alive in a film or two down the road? Dom and his family are flying through the streets, blowing up cities, and doing all of these outrageous stunts, but there is no tension at all because everyone is invincible. While cool to watch, the moment you start to think about anything the walls start crumbling. It’s especially awkward when they keep mentioning Brian O’Conner, who is alive in the franchise but “retired” due to Paul Walker’s tragic death. It’s strange to have all these big scenes without his character and they’re trying to explain where he is. And because none of the decisions are finite and everyone comes back for “one more ride” Fast X is overburdened with trying to fit too much stuff into too little story. Everyone is spread too thin in the end. There is a lot going on in Fast X. For the majority of the film, Dom and his crew are all off doing their own thing trying to get to Dante. Dom sets out to Rio in order to learn more about his new adversary. Tej, Roman, Ramsey, and Han lay low and hack their way back after being set up by Dante. Dom’s brother Jakob returns to protect his nephew Brian. Meanwhile everyone is on the run from the Agency, now led by Aimes after Mr. Nobody’s disappearance. There are so many storylines going on all at once, and Fast X does a poor job at making you care about any of them. Yes, it’s cool to see characters like Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw return but there’s no substance to it when they have little to do. There are only so many balls you can juggle before gravity makes them all come crashing down. The Fast franchise continues to keep adding more and more balls to the franchise, and it’s becoming overwhelming. Sometimes it is necessary to cut family out of your life. It’s time for the Fast & Furious franchise to do so. The family has become too big for its own good. While the action has never big bigger, the stakes have never felt lower. Jason Momoa is the best thing about Fast X and quite possibly the entire franchise. He is that entertaining. It’s a shame that can’t be said about the rest of the film. Fast X struggles to keep control as it races towards the finish line. All good things must come to an end, and it’s time for the Fast & Furious franchise to hit the garage before it ends up in the scrap yard. The film is a buffet of action set pieces dense in adrenaline but lacking in any real substance. Sure, you’ll get a quick sugar rush from it all, but the crash that comes afterwards comes equally fast and furious and will leave you exhausted.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," My relationship with the Fast and the Furious franchise has always felt like a turbulent rollercoaster ride filled with unwanted loops. Still, through all the bumps, I’ve remained a fan. With F9, I thought the track was finally off the ride, and my expectations for any subsequent entries were low. A franchise that began as a 2000’s Point Break was now on its last legs, and with news that the final entry, Fast X, would be split into two films and now this week’s rumors of a final trilogy, I’d be more excited for a sequel to Tommy Wiseau’s The Room than Fast X. However, as it sometimes arrives with films with little to no expectations, Fast X has an Infinity War-like feel to an eventual Endgame. There’s suspending your disbelief, and then there’s Fast X. A film rich with dazzling and stunning set pieces that leave The Fate of the Furious and F9 in the dust. Fast X brings cinephiles back into the lives of Dominic Toretto and his beloved family. While Dom and his family remain “freelancers” for The Agency, a face from Dom’s past, who we’ve never seen, reenters Dom’s life as Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of Fast Five’s baddie, Hernan Reyes, seeking revenge for the loss of not just his father but his family fortune. Fast X shines brightest in its action set pieces and production design, led by a bombastic sequence in Rome that rivals the best in the series thus far. Channeling both the over-the-top nature of the franchise and homaging Raiders of the Lost Ark‘s iconic boulder sequence, its cinematic destruction has never looked more stunning. While nothing in the rest of the film matches Rome, the ridiculousness that stems from every entry is on display. It’s as though Zack Snyder injected his slow-mo mentality into the movie with sequences that bring unwanted laughs. Speaking of hilarity, a franchise not known for its compelling screenplays may have arrived at its worst. Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin’s script evokes unintentional cringe reactions that can lead some to believe Chat GPT assisted in the making of this screenplay. Unfortunately, it’s not just wrong. It’s astonishingly poor. Along with the action set pieces, the film shines brightest in the chemistry between its cast. It’s not like most of this ensemble hasn’t worked together for two decades. In regards to the newcomers, the return of John Cena is welcomed as his strengths are on full display, and his comedic timing and chemistry with Leo Abelo Perry is one of Fast X’s highlights. Jason Momoa deserves a standing ovation for his zany, campy, hilarious and menacing performance cementing his place at the top of the franchise’s best villains. Momoa’s charm is fully displayed and commands the audience’s attention anytime he enters. He understood the assignment and we’re all the better for it. Fast X will not bring new fans into the fold. However, the film does its best to get faith back to those who felt the tires were coming off this car. So if you’ve suspended your disbelief for 20 years, prepare for even more nonsensical summer blockbuster action and surprises leading to jaw-dropping and eye-rolling results.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023"," The Fast & Furious saga has taken its diverse cast of former street racers turned tight-nit international spies to almost every location imaginable. If they can drive a car there, they’ve driven a car there at some point. In fact, even if they can’t drive a car there, like when they actually went to space in F9, the gurus behind the wheel of this franchise have found a way to make these movies run. They’ve utilized all forms of camp, goodwill, and promises of a barbecue finale to keep audiences coming back for one more ride. Which is why Fast X marks a true first for this saga, in that it actually teases a satisfying exit ramp. Now sure, there will be spin-offs galore after the mainline franchise wraps things up with its supposed Avengers: Endgame  two-part follow-up starting in 2025. But that indeed makes Fast X this series’ Infinity War, especially in how it delivers a villain who is more compelling and fun to watch than any of the protagonists. Vin Diesel returns, naturally, as Dominic Toretto, the man who can do anything with a car, and in this movie, even just a car door, holding it up like Captain America’s shield at one point. Now firmly a family man with a young son (Leo Abelo Perry) and loving wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), he has more to lose than ever. A point the film goes out of its way to heartstring pluck when the late Paul Walker’s send-off song from Furious 7 sprinkles into the background. Dom doesn’t care if he dies as long as he can protect his family. But what if he can’t even do that?  Enter the answer to Dom’s nightmares and the true MVP of Fast X, Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes, son of the Brazilian baddie in Fast Five. The film actually opens with a re-contextualized “previously on” scene straight from that 2011 installment, considered by many to be the outright best film in this franchise.  This time, we see one of the saga’s most iconic set pieces through Dante’s perspective, who was definitely there the whole time. He’s spent the years since that incident studying Dom and his Family, concocting a convoluted, world-spanning plan of suffering for these characters that would make the Joker blush. Which is probably why Momoa practically inhabits a take on Heath Ledger’s Joker performance from 2008 and makes it a gender-bending force of nature into its own.  The established camp and insanity of the Fast Saga is what makes his derivative Jack Sparrow Joker persona work far more than it should. Maybe because it’s simply nice to see villains in movies having fun being bad again, even when their motivations are about as flimsy as it gets.  Returning villains-turned-frenemies (and outright friends) certainly squeeze into the frame as well. John Cena is back as Dom’s still unexplainably Nordic estranged brother turned “fun uncle” as he escorts his nephew to safety when the Agency comes after the Family on a worldwide manhunt. Charlize Theron gets paired up with Michelle Rodriguez after she gets burned by the villain who makes a devil like her look like, well not an angel, but let’s just say a slightly less maniacal devil. And Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Sung Kang have their own sideline misadventure trying to recruit other ghosts of franchise past with limited resources and patience for Roman’s antics. So it’s odd and actually a bit refreshing to see Dom mostly on his own. He has more interactions with Dante than his own crew, a brilliant decision in how it chips at the seemingly invulnerable mythology around the patriarch who truly does rely a great deal on the people closest to him. We’ve seen other villains exploit this weakness, sure, but Fast X is the first one to really deliver that punch in a way that stings. Dante doesn’t just understand and prey on Dom’s insecurities, he seems to relish in isolating the man from opportunities to be the hero, a humbling meta-criticism on the franchise thus far. This is Louis Leterrier’s first time directing a Fast movie — with franchise regular Justin Lin handling a co-scripting credit with Dan Mazeau — but you can tell he truly gets what makes this series click for so many people. And he elevates and innovates upon that formula without overstating or over-relying on cheap self-awareness bits, at least too often. In fact, this meta-lampshading goes to even nicely comical heights when the new Agency head, Aimes (Alan Ritchson) confronts Mr. Nobody’s daughter, Tess (Brie Larson) about how nonsensical the Family‘s journey over ten movies has been. We got a little of this “what a long, strange journey it’s been” grandstanding in F9, but it’s just more fulfilling to see the guy from Jack Reacher explaining in great detail why the Family is bad, actually. Imagine a video essay explaining why Johnny Lawrence is the real protagonist of The Karate Kid, and you get the gist. The normal issues with the Fast Saga are all here, of course, and most of them are as easy to gloss over if you’re already belted in. The editing and dialogue continue to be wildly uneven and absurd, sometimes effectively and sometimes not. It’s honestly hard to know if you’re laughing at the movie or with it about half the time. At 141 minutes, this is a pretty long installment that somewhat peaks in terms of massive set pieces early on with a Rome sequence that does its job and then some, but then leaves a lot of the rest of the movie to settle for close-up fistfights and visual gags. Though one great exception is a street race from hell, and every single one of these movies deserves and should demand a true racing sequence. It’s called honoring your ancestors. And, as mentioned, the movie is a lot of set up without payoff, unless you count surprise cameos you’ll see coming hours away as payoff. The gang is either all here or about to be here, and not everything on display is at the same level in terms of smart writing and propulsive storytelling. There’s no way to know yet if the true ending they have in mind will fulfill all the promises made in Fast X. But isn’t that what these movies are really after? Not just a race, but the human race and all that. The friends we made along the road, etc. Jon is one of the co-founders of InBetweenDrafts and our resident film editor.

"May 17, 2023"," For all the frothy motions of the Fast & Furious franchise, whose characters at this point practically qualify as superheroes, the films have traditionally tried to ground their full-throttle, physics-defying set pieces with goofy yet good-hearted characterizations around relationships to family. You don’t come to these movies for interpersonal drama, but the best entries are aided by their attempts to keep things within the stratosphere of the relatable. Fast X jumps the shark in that regard. On a scene-to-scene basis, Louis Leterrier’s film, which suggests a Masala production by way of the MCU, isn’t any more implausible than The Fate of the Furious and F9. But between its overly lit, ultra-saturated images and hammy performances, Fast X recalls the old Batman TV series, or a spy parody like Austin Powers in Goldmember. The plot, such as it is, follows Dante Reyes (Jason Mamoa), the son of Fast Five’s Brazilian banker villain, going on a sociopathic revenge mission to destroy the thing that Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) prizes the most and which, he feels, Dom took from him: family. The narrative dangles from such a thin premise that the only thing that sustains momentum, however unfortunate, is Mamoa’s bizarrely queer-coded maniac. In the one actual racing scene of the film, the actor shows up in what amounts to a purple kaftan, his face and hair bedecked with jewelry. As Mamoa limps his wrists, his arch performance suggests a transmission from a time when representation of gay men in popular entertainment was one-dimensional at best. Dante is part Joker and part Blofeld, and perhaps the strangest “evil” thing that he does is set up what’s essentially an installation art piece. As Dom enters a room with wall-to-wall TVs playing impossibly attained footage of his life, Dante mocks him with blustery quips. It’s a strange performance that reaches its nadir in a throwaway scene in which Dante paints his toenails while surrounded by dead bodies and musing to himself about masculinity. Dante is the film’s biggest problem, but Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin’s screenplay isn’t completely to blame here, as Mamoa seems perfectly keen to let the “joke” be that his character is gender fluid. By comparison, the other characterizations practically feel like triumphs of refinement and purpose. If John Cena was woefully miscast in F9 as Jakob, a villainous mercenary with a chip on his shoulder, here the part is retooled in ways that play to the actor’s strengths as an over-muscled teddy bear. Perhaps inevitably, then, the film wants for his charming and funny presence whenever he isn’t on screen. Sure, it’s a bit of a logical stretch to see Charlize Theron’s Cipher still in the picture, but at least when she and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) land inside a glass-filled black site prison, the result is Fast X’s tensest and best choreographed fight scene. Early on, Dom and his crew’s attempts to stop a massive rolling bomb from destroying the Vatican results in one of the franchise’s most dizzyingly fun set pieces. Elsewhere, Jakob wards off a cavalcade of attackers in the Portuguese countryside while riding a Mad Max-style car replete with projectile bombs, and Statham proves again that he’s a master of taciturn derring-do in a scene that sees his Deckard Shaw practically dancing around SWAT-like mercenaries. Being as this is the first of a possibly three-part finale, though, Fast X’s sense of fun is constantly deflated by all the table-setting. (The film utilizes a metric ton of Fast Five footage, so that its cold open turns into something of a “previously on” segment.) As a result, most of the lesser characters, new and old alike, seem like they’re just biding their time, providing nominal color to the proceedings until they get, presumably, the chance to take center stage. For one, Tess (Brie Larson), the daughter of Mr. Nobody, shows up at one point to shoot guns in a turquoise fashion suit and, given Larson’s blank-faced expression, you may be excused for thinking that you’re in the front row of a Fashion Week show. Tess is there as one of the few remaining allies to Dom’s family, but her scenes feel dropped in without any sense of what the long game is. Fast X’s appeal depends on one’s ability to ride its often nonsensical wavelength. Compared to Fast Five, the franchise’s arguably most self-contained and sharpest entry, it’s closer to fan fiction or self-parody than the real deal. For better and worse, Fast X feels generated by an AI, as if its sole purpose were to provide one outlandish moment after another in order to elicit the audience’s incredulous gasps. A lot of the time that translates into good fun, but it’s a low bar even for a wacky and often unapologetically dumb franchise such as Fast & Furious.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023"," When interviewing actors about antagonist roles, you often hear a lot of the same sentiments shared. “I don't view [insert character name] as a villain,” they say. They explain that nobody in real life views themselves as a villain. They are dedicated to expressing a reasonable perspective that justifies their character's actions. They denounce mustache-twirling, instead aiming to ground their performance in reality. This is a standard acting method… and a playbook that Fast X's Jason Momoa sets on fire and gleefully runs over with a steamroller while wearing a pastel suit and hair done up in pom-poms. As Dante Reyes, the Aquaman star is the latest foe to go toe-to-toe with the found family of Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto in the long-running Fast & Furious franchise, and he not only wins you over with his psychotic, merciless, and cartoony antics, but provides a breath of fresh air into a blockbuster series that has grown stale in the last few years. Dante is the best villain to be unleashed in these movies, and it's because of both his special personality and how his presence shakes everything up. Looping the story back to the events of Fast Five, the new sequel introduces Dante Reyes as the son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), the corrupt politician/businessman whom Dom Toretto and his friends robbed in a heist that saw Hernan's giant safe being towed and dragged around the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Dante was nearly killed in the chase that followed, but he survived, and he makes plans to kill all of the Fast & Furious heroes in an act of vengeance – but not before causing them immense suffering. Setting up a bogus mission in Rome that's actually a trap, Dante successfully gets the family's handlers at The Agency to turn on them and declare them terrorists. This has the effect of putting the heroes on the run and forcing them to split up. While Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is captured and thrown in an Agency black site, Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges), Ramsay (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) head to London to recruit some help, and Dom goes to Brazil via Naples to try and find Dante and stop him before he can fully execute his big plan. The Fast & Furious movies have rolled out some high profile stars as villains, with the last three respectively unleashing Jason Statham, Charlize Theron and John Cena as the main heavies, but none of them leave a mark quite like what Jason Momoa does in Fast X – his personality outshining everyone else in the talented ensemble. He is the franchise's version of The Joker, blending flamboyance with sadism and a smile, and while the plotting at which he is the center is ridiculous, it's made digestible by the character's ludicrousness. You do wonder why Dante waited so long to execute his bloodthirsty plan and how he is able to get oh so many bombs everywhere he needs them to be, but the totality of the chaos he unleashes ends up being satisfying enough for one to look past those queries. The guy is operating on a magical level pretty much from the beginning, his post-flashback entrance into the film having him slice up a guy with a knife and lick the blade clean. But his whole vibe is really summed up in a second act scene where he hangs out in the sun and makes moves to drain the bank accounts of the protagonists: before fiddling around on a computer and initiating the next step in his complicated plan, he paints the toes of a couple of corpses whose faces are wrapped up in tape to form grotesque smiles. It's demented, but it's a much-needed lightning bolt bringing a fresh, bold energy to what has become a threadbare franchise. Momoa's Dante is by himself a much needed new flavor for these movies, but what's also exciting to see is that his presence cascades some other much changes into the proceedings of this franchise. Fun and exciting as it was to see the main Fast & Furious characters evolve into becoming super spies over the course of Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7, the last two movies rendered the brand exhausting and tired. Fans were given the satisfaction of seeing characters go into space in F9 (a long awaited plot development), but larger experience was rendered unsatisfying by non-existent stakes and recycled plotting. With Jason Momoa's performance as the film's backbone, Fast X doesn't make the mistake of once again reprising those issues. Dante's mission and drive proves to be a true threat that imperils the lives of the main characters, and (without giving too much away) there are specific moves made to first highlight one of the franchise's central clichés and then upend it in hardcore fashion. The filmmakers have heard the criticisms about these movies, and they have made moves to address them. Of course, while Fast X is an overall improvement for the trajectory of the series, there is also plenty about the film that is either straight-up stupid or just comes across as lazy. There are a number of eye-popping and thrilling set pieces – the standouts being the race to contain a giant bomb that is rolling toward Vatican City and a third act pursuit on a highway in Portugal – but far too often action unfolds simply for the sake of action (be it Brie Larson’s Tess randomly kicking the asses of a bunch of patrons in a bar prior to a secretive meeting with Dom, or Agency mercenaries showing up at a secret location in London so that Han and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw can fight side-by-side). Multiple plot threads feel like they are included just for the sake of keeping key characters in the game, and some end up being forgotten about completely by the time the third act rolls around. The script, credited to Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, is shoddy – but Jason Momoa is the Kintsugi glue that holds it all together and lets it work. The Fast & Furious movies may be past their prime era (which came to an end with Furious 7), but Fast X at the very least makes efforts to deviate from formula and successfully leaves you wondering what’s going to happen next in Fast & Furious 11.

"May 17, 2023"," With his every peacocking gesture, every grand spreading of his epic arms and epic smile, every flounce, prance, steely-eyed threat — “You want to control the world, I just want to punish it!” –and every darker-than-dark joke, Momoa becomes the villain’s villain in “Fast X,” the tenth film in the never-ending franchise that began waaaay back in 2001. But let’s not mince words. “Fast X” is a stunningly stupid movie, reviving more “dead” characters than every NBC soap opera ever, “fan servicing” the crap out of a crap script, wrecking more cars (NOT those indestructable Product Placement Dodges) in more digital crashes than one can count, and featuring more scenes demanding the impossible from Vin Diesel — acting.  Dante learned one and only one thing from his dad (de Almeida returns to reenact his death scene, and so that Dante can be inserted into the story).  Another past rival (Oscar winner Charlize Theron) becomes an ally, but not without an epic girlfight, co-starring “Girlfight” alumna Michelle Rodriguez, still the baddest bad-ass in these films.  Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris carry their characters’ ongoing “family” feud to Rome and London, and Brit-fam member Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) can barely keep the peace. John Cena, playing Dom’s brother, provides more comic relief as the “sensitive” but bulked-up uncle who needs to hide Dom’s kid from Dante’s fury.  There’s a high-stakes drag race scene in Rio, rendered ludicrously over-the-top like everything else, but which reminds of us of how this saga began — a simple undercover cop and drag-racing thieves tale that morphed into a “family,” with the only character truly “gone” and not forgotten was played by the late Paul Walker. Diesel, years past getting that AARP card in the mail, is still in shape but his action beats are mostly limited to changing gears…with authority. He’s the one who uses “family” the most. And Dom is the guy who seems to be “extending” this extended  family with every film, every moment Dom turns protector for someone new, generally some old friend’s kid these days.  Impossible digital explosions, scene after scene of digital “fire,” impossible plunges into “Bugs Bunny Physics” time and time again, “Fast X” wraps no storyline up, gives up on NO one (save for Walker) who has ever appeared in this series, and no character receives her or his just deserts.

"May 17, 2023"," Death has been tamed in the realm of the Fast and the Furious, a universe where mortality is less of a concrete reality and more of a minor inconvenience. Explosions, vehicular disasters, bullets, and even cosmic escapades seem to have lost their lethal touch. Notably, Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner, who we mourned back in 2013, has somehow cheated death’s finality to make posthumous cameos in four subsequent films. It’s an impressive work ethic that redefines the very essence of ‘life after death’. Why die when resurrection is but as plot contrivance away? Fast X, the latest installment in this increasingly fantastical franchise, is an adrenaline-infused roller coaster ride that leaves the viewer feeling more nauseous and offput than genuinely exhilarated. Despite its truly eye-watering budget of $340 million – a figure greater than the GDP of at least three different island nations – it’s a borderline cinematic abomination that features laughably poor visual effects and an equally embarrassing script. The sheer fact that this film, with its PS3-esque graphics, ranks among the top five most expensive movies ever made is nothing short of scandalous. Explosive, globe-trotting set pieces, which should be a visual feast for action enthusiasts, instead resemble a smorgasbord of dated graphics and tired set piece antics. A sizable chunk of the budget was allocated to accommodating the vast cast, but this investment too seems far from a payoff. The film is so overpopulated with characters—most of whom are as one-dimensional as a line on a page or a single defining trait—that some actors have merely blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearances, despite their faces being plastered across promotional materials. There’s Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, Scott Eastwood, Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, John Cena (in a total different – though more enjoyable – turn this time around), as well as Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno for some reason. It’s reminiscent of Wes Anderson’s ensemble films, albeit without the nuanced writing or charm. The grand puppeteer of this hot mess is none other than Vin Diesel, or as he’s known in this sequel, “St. Dominic.” Fast X is essentially a shrine to the unchecked ego of this one man and his stranglehold on the the franchise. The narrative positions him as both a selfless hero and an unparalleled badass, with Brian Tyler’s score practically groveling at his feet, pleading with the audience to recognize this monosyllabic muscleman as the divine incarnation of humanity. All hail St. Dominic, this universe’s family-obsessed Christ incarnate. After some behind-the-scenes drama, industry veteran Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans) assumed the director’s chair, taking over from longtime franchise supervisor Justin Lin due to, ahem, ‘creative differences’. This is not a first for the franchise, which has a history of losing talent due to similar issues and BTS in-fighting. Many accusations have been lodged at Diesel and his domineering personality on set, most notably with the ongoing beef between him and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Leterrier’s direction could be best described as nondescript and aimless. His lack of direction is glaringly evident, with a narrative that lacks focus, action sequences that lack cohesion, and an overall vision for the movie that seems haphazard at best. This isn’t even to comment on the fact that Fast X is in fact not a complete story, despite being nearly two-and-a-half hours of movie. One can’t help but wonder how different Fast X could have been under the direction of a more capable, or perhaps more committed, director – or just one trying to make a name for themselves in this universe. but at this point, it’s hard to imagine the franchise finding any footing again before finally driving off into the sunset. Especially when this is the best they can muster with such an offensively greedy budget. In Fast X, Dominic Toretto finds himself defending his crew and family from Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the scion of a powerful drug lord hell-bent on avenging the loss of his father and family fortune. This is the result of our heroes’ Rio de Janeiro heist as witnessed in Fast Five, back when the series was just discovering that it was allowed to be good. The plot, while ostensibly passable on paper, quickly devolves into a convoluted mess of over-the-top action sequences, contrived plot twists, weirdly useless cameos, more characters being reincarnated from the great beyond, and a few dozen grumbled mentions of the word family. The franchise’s gradual shift from reality-rooted street racing to the realm of the utterly absurd continues unabated. Much like a car with a jammed accelerator, Fast X careens wildly down the path of implausibility, its narrative held hostage by the relentless pursuit of bigger, bolder, and more outrageous stunts. The problem is simple though: it’s just not very fun anymore. The franchise’s trademark absurdity, which once lent it a certain cheeky charm, has now become an unbearable weight around its neck. Like Dom’s beloved Charger, the franchise seems to be rusting from within, its appeal eroding as Diesel’s stranglehold on the series grows more powerful. A cast overstuffed with underdeveloped characters and forced lame humor further muddies the waters, turning what should be a high-octane joyride into a gridlocked freeway of confusion. Yet, amid the wreckage of Fast X, there’s a singular beacon of entertainment: Jason Momoa. Embracing the role of a flamboyantly defiant criminal hell-bent on taking down Dom, Momoa offers a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stifling environment. His performance is a delightful cocktail of mischief, charisma, and unapologetic flamboyance. It’s like watching a peacock strut through a junkyard – utterly out of place, but captivating nonetheless. Despite a plot that’s as stable as a three-wheeled car, performances that would make a high school drama teacher wince, and a disturbing trend towards the superheroic, Fast X manages to cling onto a shred of the series’ original appeal. But it’s a tenuous grip at best. The franchise desperately needs to take a pit stop, examine its worn-out tires and sputtering engine, and chart a course back to the grounded reality that made us fall in love with it in the first place. However, as things stand, it appears as though the franchise has committed to its path, hurtling towards a future where cars might not just fly, but possibly travel through time or even dimensions. It’s a wild spectacle, but one that seems increasingly detached from the spirit of the original films. The joyride that was once an exhilarating exploration of car culture and familial bonds has lost its joy, becoming a hollow spectacle of excess. Fast X may be a milestone, marking the franchise’s tenth outing, but it’s a milestone that signals a need for change. It’s a stark reminder that bigger stunts and a bigger cast don’t necessarily make for a better film. The Fast and the Furious was never about superheroes; it was about street racers with a penchant for danger and a deep-seated sense of loyalty. It was about family. And it’s hard to be much of a family when you have an attention-seeking patriarch demanding so much spotlight. It’s high time the franchise took a pit stop, examined its worn-out tires and sputtering engine, and charted a course back to the semi-grounded reality that made audiences around the world fall in love with it in the first place. Until then, we’re just passengers on a joyride that’s lost its joy. CONCLUSION: ‘Fast X’ floors the Fast & Furious franchise beyond the brink of absurdity, delivering a spectacle as deflated as a punctured tire despite its astronomical budget and star-studded cast. It might be in the final stretch, but it leaves us wondering: perhaps it’s past time we leave this once-thrilling ride in the rear-view mirror.

"May 17, 2023"," FAST X ***1/2 (141 minutes) M
You know, it’s quite some testament to the structural integrity of the Fast & Furious franchise that here we are, 10 films in, and the lark is still loads-a fun, with enough energy and spectacle and vehicular mayhem to satisfy all comers, even those outside the coterie of discerning filmgoers who have made the series one of the most successful in history – as well as one of the loudest. We have at the helm franchise first-timer Louis Leterrier (Transporter 1 & 2; Clash of the Titans; Now you See Me) who, despite his newbie status, hit the chair with a sufficiently thorough knowledge to hit all the necessary buttons to deliver a polished product that fans could swallow whole. To his credit, Fast X is totally consistent with the tone and style of the series since F&F4, the film that revived the franchise by blending magnificently preposterous over-the-top action with faith-based family values, the latter said to account for why the films appeal so much to its Latino fanbase. Indeed, this time around our car-loving hero Dom (Vin Diesel) isn’t just powered by heavy weaponry and suped-up street machines, he’s got God on his side, with a slightly over-sized crucifix starring as a visual motif, punching up faith much more so than in previous efforts. And as if that none-too-subtle salute to Catholicism wasn’t enough, the film features a prolonged, very exciting demolition derby through the streets of Rome as Dom chases a giant spherical bomb as it careens towards Vatican City and The Pope. Talk about spiritual devotion. Dom must have been one heck of an altar boy.  Dom’s adversary this time around is revenge-hungry Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), son of crime boss Heman (Joaquim de Almeida, so good in A Clear and Present Danger) who owned the vault Dom and his crew stole in such unique fashion in 2011’s Fast Five.  A cheeky enemy with devilish facial hair and a flamboyant dress sense – Momoa does a great job as a sort of sociopathic dandy musclehead – Dante is keen to exact payback over the robbery and for his father’s death, which he blames Dom for. The characteristically frenzied storytelling consists of the usual jumble of colliding sub-plots, the overarching theme being Dom’s quest to protect his cherished family, in particular his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry). It matters a great deal, of  course, that family values are at the core of the film – though it doesn’t matter quite as much as all the marvellously over-the-top vehicular mayhem in which cars, trucks, bikes and helicopters are flipped, tumbled, totalled and detonated with a flair and grace that is borderline balletic. Only Michael Bay stages destruction so beautifully. The only snag to all the volcanic action is that there’s so many digital VFX meshed with all the work from the film’s huge stunt team that it’s impossible to tell what’s actually been staged practically for the cameras and what’s been created by the film’s army of mouse jockeys. As great as it looks, so much of the action in Fast X is so obviously animated and impossible to physically stage, that visceral element isn’t there any more.  For over 20 years now filmgoers have been conditioned to presume that anything in a film that’s big and spectacular has either been created with digital animation, or had plenty of digital assist.  Consequently, what we’ve seen in the Fast & Furious films to make up for the synthetic quality of the action is to up-scale with action scenarios that are increasingly wild and outrageous.  Take, for example, the sequence in Fast X where Dom’s car is tethered by two helicopters. It’s brilliantly done, yet lacks that distinctive analog edge because we know that the fiery extravaganza we’re watching is essentially a photo-realistic cartoon. How good would it be to see a future F&F – and rest assured there are more to come – focused on using practical stunts with no – or minimal – VFX. It’s a dream, but a sweet one. The film’s momentum does sag a tad in the lead up to the third act rush, and some of the story direction is a bit fuzzy, though that is likely due to leaving it up to the next installment to tie up all the loose ends. As an interesting side note, the production of Fast X ran into a snag when director Louis Leterrier was brought soon after shooting began, replacing F&F veteran Justin Lin who, despite having made episodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, suddenly found himself at odds with series star Vin Diesel, who he found unpunctual, unprepared (couldn’t remember his lines) and, apparently, out of shape. If that’s the case, Diesel hides it well. While he’s unlikely to win any awards for his overacting, he holds the centre of the film together as well as he usually does. So props to him. The rest of the cast – including Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, John Cena, Brie Larson, Helen Mirren, Jordana Brewster and Scott Eastwood – go through the motions with the required adequacy. If, perchance, you sense that Fast X often seems over-eager to please you can likely put that down to it being anxious to keep faith with its fan army after the box office damage Covid did to F9. Bravely released in 2021 during the global turndown in cinema attendances due to the impact of the virus, F9 set box office records for the pandemic era by taking around $US720 million. Still, that’s about $500m less than F8 in 2017 ($1.2B) and $700m less than F7 in 2015. So, in a way, Fast X is the franchise’s post-Covid valentine to its fans, with all signs suggesting fans will be delirious with delight over the film’s signature blend of super-sized action, family values and chronic over-acting.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023"," Fans of the “Fast and Furious” franchise are sure to enjoy the latest model, “Fast X” — and that’s Fast 10, not X, in case you’re wondering. The title is in keeping with the rest of the franchise's nonsensical naming scheme. You remember “The Fast and The Furious,” “2 Fast 2 Furious,” “The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift,” and then just “Fast & Furious,"" right?  All the usual elements are there in this iteration: Fast, sexy cars, sexy people, ridiculous stunts that “defy God and gravity” as one of the characters says, and of course the big F — family.  The plot this time revolves around a new villain played to perfection by Jason Momoa. Dante, as he’s called, styles himself as a punisher for Vin Diesel’s Dominic. By the way, been said, but saying it here anyway: Diesel has the perfect name for this franchise. Also, can someone had the guy a cough drop? Or some lemon-honey tea? It sounds like his vocal cords on the verge of being damaged with all that vocal fry. Without spoiling too much, Dante goes after everything Dominic loves and cares for. Along the way, we have epic car chase scenes through Rome and São Paulo and in some small village in Portugal. There’s some hand-to-hand fighting as well. The best fight scene in the film, although not the best-choreographed fight I’ve ever seen, is between Charlize Theron’s Cipher and Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty.  There are other big names fans know and love like John Cena, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson and Brie Larson. Rita Moreno makes an appearance as Abuelita Toretto. And of course, the incomparable Dame Helen Mirren gets a scene as well.  Despite the star power, “Fast X” is just another stunt-fest with little substance. Even for this franchise, which has never been know for stunning dialogue, the writing felt weak. The only redeeming quality is Momoa’s Dante. Momoa brings a streak of levity in an otherwise ponderous film that oozes masculine machismo and fossil fuels.  While evil, the Dante character brings a cavalier bravado and humor to the film. A villain who wears pastel silk blouses and pants? Sure. And he pants his nails in pretty Easter colors? Yes, please. Is he over the top and just ridiculous? Of course, but so is this whole movie. Like Loki in the Thor movies or Moriarty in the BBC “Sherlock” series, Dante waltzes around with a devil-may-care bliss while relishing destruction and violence. And isn't that what we all came to see?",POSITIVE
