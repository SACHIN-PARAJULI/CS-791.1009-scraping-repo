"Apr 8, 2024"," Did you ever have an imaginary friend? Director Jeff Wadlow showcases this question in Imaginary, a new Blumhouse horror movie about a woman named Jessica (DeWanda Wise), whose stepdaughter, Alice (Pyper Braun), discovers a teddy bear named Chauncey. Alice is happy to have an imaginary friend, but Chauncey begins to ask strange things from her in this classic horror movie premise. This film feels familiar for a few reasons while featuring a few strong ideas. Although it’s an ambitious movie with some strong aspects throughout, it can also feel generic and derivate overall. Wadlow has had a long history directing horror films for Blumhouse. He previously helmed films like Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island, both panned by critics. With Imaginary, there is a sure improvement. From the opening scene, there are a few moments where Wadlow gets creative with moving his camera. However, he can’t refrain from the occasional ineffective jump scare, where a character will show up, accompanied by a jolt of music. He makes the wise choice not to make the noise insufferably loud, but it still feels like it doesn’t fully work. The movie also attempts to establish a few ideas surrounding the characters. Jessica has married a musician named Max (Tom Payne) and is still warming up to his kids from his previous marriage. Their relationship and chemistry are quite average, but the strongest emotional core surrounds Jessica’s relationship with her father, who is in a mental hospital. They have a complex relationship that started in her childhood. There are a few necessary moments that could have made it stronger, but it’s a worthy attempt. One of the weaker elements is the relationship between Jessica and Taylor (Taegen Burns), the bratty teenage daughter. There isn’t a lot to latch onto because Taylor is not a particularly likable character. There is another attempt to show the sadness of this family with a storyline surrounding their birth mother. However, much like many of the ideas in this movie, it also feels undercooked. This screenplay has a lot of elements that could have been very strong, but instead, they are simply a bunch of mediocre threads that don’t create something too worthwhile by the end of it. But when it comes to horror, there are a few scenes that work pretty well. Imaginary works the least when Wadlow goes for jump scares, but it works the best when he plays with darkness. There are a few scenes where Wadlow has something creepy lurking right around the corner, or deep into the background. When he does this, the film works wonderfully. You can see Wadlow putting in effort to make something that could be unsettling, especially during a few moments where he plays around with the background of a scene. This movie has no shortage of good ideas, but the movie can ultimately play a bit sillier than intended. Another fascinating concept is the fact that many creepy doll movies like Annabelle and Child’s Play make the doll look scary right from the get-go. Chauncey does not look very intimidating. He looks a lot like a normal teddy bear that any child could have. And this is a strong idea. Horror films work well whenever they take something mundane and harmless and force you to look at them in a new light. However, once Chauncey’s “true form” gets revealed in the movie, a lot of that impact gets lost, and it becomes ridiculous. It definitely goes for it, especially during the final 45 minutes. However, this is where the movie seems to borrow a few ideas from James Wan’s Insidious. There are a lot of similarities in how Imaginary and Insidious handle their ideas, particularly the idea of entering another dimension, but when you have a film like Insidious that already did the concept in a much scarier way, it does not benefit this film. Furthermore, by the end of it, Imaginary feels as if it overstays its welcome, spending far too much time tooling with its viewer and getting wrapped up in a very ludicrous series of events. One character has a deranged monologue that really takes you off guard. By the time the credits roll on Imaginary, you will have mixed feelings. There are a few good ideas here and there, but the characterization needed a bit more work, and the scares needed to be polished a tad more. It’s a film where the script could have used another draft or two to really land its ideas. However, Wise and Braun give excellent performances. They are very convincing, and they commit to these ideas quite well. Ultimately, this is far from Wadllw’s worst work as a director, and even though he’s not quite there yet, this is a step in the right direction for him. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 5 equates to “Mediocre.” The positives and negatives wind up negating each other, making it a wash. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve.

"Apr 3, 2024"," The imagination can be a hell of a scary place, where the worst fears — about the world, about others and about the self — can manifest and compound. But what happens when the worst parts of one's imagination not only fester, but materialize and give chase? The latest Blumhouse horror miss-terpiece attempts to explore these themes with very mixed results. Directed and co-written by Wadlow, Imaginary tells the story of Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a children's book author and illustrator who moves back into her childhood home with her husband, Max (Tom Payne), and two stepdaughters, Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun). Jessica's dreams and memories are haunted by her own creations, but they subside once the family moves into her old house. When Alice finds a teddy bear named Chauncey in the crawlspace of the house, she begins talking to him, developing a strong bond with her new imaginary friend. Chauncey starts to have an overwhelming and dangerous influence over Alice, and when she starts behaving erratically, it becomes apparent that there is a malevolent force hidden in the guise of this cute teddy. With the help of Taylor, Alice's therapist Dr. Soto (Veronica Falcón), and neighbour and former babysitter Gloria (Betty Buckley), Jessica must unravel the secrets of her traumatic childhood and solve the mystery of Chauncey before it's too late for Alice. Although the film wastes no time in the ""I'M GONNA SCARE YOU!"" department, starting off with a nightmarish chase through Jessica and Max's apartment, it quickly dips in energy and takes too long to amp up and start telling an interesting story. It spends too much time establishing the familial dynamics, many of which are redundant and should have been excised. Max is especially superfluous, disappearing at the start of the second act to go on tour even though we haven't been given any indication that he's a musician until his unceremonious exit. Fortunately, when the film does get interesting midway through, it makes some surprisingly effective storytelling choices, and its central conceit — the fate of abandoned imaginary friends and their response to this rejection — is sinister and well developed. As the latest film from production powerhouse Blumhouse, Imaginary is essentially a gore-less affair, relying on mood, tone and atmosphere rather than body count. While it uses the requisite jump scares (mostly to unremarkable effect), it also makes ample use of the terrors that lurk in the darkened corners of our homes and our minds, the scary things that move in the shadows and go bump in the night (or day). Although moments of blood-letting are very few and far between, when they do happen, they feel uninspired, even obsequious, appealing to the lowest common horror fan denominator. It's obvious when the film is trying to frighten, yet when it wants to disturb and unsettle, it actually succeeds, thanks in no small part to Pyper Braun's superb performance as Alice. Braun is a performer with enviable skills, putting to shame not only other child actors, but also most of her adult costars. She's frightening and sympathetic, cold and terrified, amused and distraught, and she explores these contradictions with the talent and power of someone far beyond her years or experience. Putting kids in peril has become de rigeur for Blumhouse productions; Braun's tour de force turn as Alice is a case where the cliché works. What the film does have going for it, apart from Braun's performance, are the practical effects, which are surprisingly well done. The imaginary world is chaotic and disorienting (even if it does ape a bit too much from the works of M. C. Escher), while many of the creature effects are practical and have a disturbing, and welcome, weight to them. Chauncey's indifferent eyes, coupled with some well-timed repositions, are particularly effective, as are the startling appearances of a humanoid shape throughout the house. Early in the film, when Chauncey is being cuddled by Alice, he turns to face her, which makes for a disconcerting visual. It's a small, almost insignificant turn, but it's this kind of unexpected shift by an inanimate object that helps give him both life and power — and that's actually scary. These moments and manifestations force us to ask who or what Chauncey is exactly, which the writer's gleefully withhold until the third act. Of course, Blumhouse films love exposition, and Imaginary is bursting with explanations and unexpected recollections. There's the requisite Creepy Lore section, where a character who has been researching and/or documenting the villainous entity/creature — in this case Gloria, who has been chastised and called crazy for her beliefs — finally gets to explain to the other characters (i.e. the audience) the true nature of the evil they've encountered. Unfortunately, the film gets confused by, and even lost in, some of its own lore. There are a number of plot holes, and it introduces elements that are completely unnecessary for our understanding of Chauncey, simply because the writers feel it's necessary for the creep factor. The film also tries to explore some incredibly complex social and personal issues — mental health, trauma, abuse, neglect — yet it often does so flippantly, introducing these elements with little to no resolution. Its treatment of individuals suffering from mental health issues is particularly unfortunate, even irresponsible. The girls' institutionalized mother is vilified in both of the scenes she's featured in, while a side-plot with Jessica's similarly institutionalized father is horribly underdeveloped. Adding insult to injury, a cruel and entirely unnecessary twist late in the film dashes any hope for an on-screen reconciliation or vindication for her father. Overall, Imaginary offers a somewhat unique take on the Blumhouse formula. It relies on the production house's (sub-)standard approach to psychological horror, but mixes it with a creature feature, eschewing violence for something more fantastical. Although the film has a surprisingly effective emotional core, it gets diluted by exposition and opportunistic reveals, as well as its creators' insistence on twists and false endings, all of which feel manipulative and underwhelming. Tonally, Imaginary tries to present itself as looser and more accessible compared to some of its dour and nihilistic Blumhouse siblings, yet it still ends up taking itself and its premise way too seriously. There are some poorly structured ""gotcha!"" moments that are insincere and mean-spirited (the ending is beyond cynical), and these make for some of the film's laziest moments. There are some creative scenes and set-ups, including a frantic, climactic search for a missing character through the imaginary realm, but Imaginary ultimately ends up feeling dull and under-stuffed. It's flimsy, cheap and easily forgotten — much like an unloved stuffy decaying in the darkness of some dusty box that will never be opened again.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 29, 2024"," Some vague discussions about the power of imagination, but nothing concrete or meaningful. Communication among family members proves valuable, but this happens late in the movie and rather suddenly. No clear role models here, only people trying to survive. Family members (a stepmom and two daughters) do learn to communicate better with one another, but it happens rather suddenly. This is a woman-led story: Black stepmom Jessica (DeWanda Wise) and her two White stepdaughters (Taegen Burns and Pyper Braun) are at the center. Betty Buckley plays a wise neighbor who knows a little about what's going on. Mexican-born Veronica Falcón plays a child therapist in a key scene. And Black actor Samuel Salary plays Jessica's father in several scenes. Sympathetic portrayal of relationships in a blended family. Children and other characters in peril. Jump scares and monster attacks (including spiders). Bloody handprint. Monster stabbed with scissors. Attacks by mysterious figures. A man panics and grabs a woman's arm, hard (""you're hurting me!""). A child tries to impale her own hand on a rusty nail, but is rescued at the last second (she gets a small scratch on her wrist). A character is viciously attacked by a monster and dragged behind a door; a pool of blood oozes out from under it. Creepy, scary images (characters with no eyes, etc.). A person stabs her own hand with scissors; bloody bandages and blood on the scissors. An ax smashes through a door, narrowly missing a character. Video of a child who apparently chopped off the tip of his own finger. A character falls, hurts foot/leg. Person with blood on their face. Scars on child's arm (parental abuse is suggested). House burns down. Arguing, shouting. A teen boy urinates in the toilet, is startled, and dribbles on the floor and his shoes. One teen tries to get another to take Molly, but the white pills turn out to be allergy medicine. A teen says to himself, ""be cool ... you're just tripping""; he also grabs liquor bottles from a shelf, then opens one and drops the other (no drinking). Parents need to know that Imaginary is a horror movie about a young girl who finds a mysterious teddy bear named Chauncey and starts behaving strangely, events that may be connected to her stepmother Jessica's (DeWanda Wise) past. Violence includes jump scares, children and others in peril, blood, characters being attacked by monsters and mysterious figures, stabbing with scissors, some creepy/gross imagery, and more. Infrequent language includes one use of ""f--k,"" plus ""a--hole,"" and a few uses of ""s--t,"" ""goddamn,"" ""bitchy,"" ""oh my God,"" ""psycho,"" ""idiot,"" etc. One teen tries to get another to try Molly, but the white pills are revealed to be allergy medicine (the teen imagines that he's ""tripping""). A teen also tries opening bottles of liquor but winds up breaking one. A married couple is shown being affectionate, kissing and cuddling. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In IMAGINARY, children's author Jessica (DeWanda Wise) is having trouble with nightmares. She's preparing to move with her new family—husband Max (Tom Payne) and his two girls from a previous marriage, teen Taylor (Taegen Burns) and young Alice (Pyper Braun)—into her childhood house. Once they're there, the nightmares stop, but other strange things start to happen. Alice finds a teddy bear called Chauncey and makes it her imaginary friend. She begins to play a scavenger hunt game with him that requires her to do odd things, like hurt herself. A child therapist (Veronica Falcón) is called in, but the more they dig, they more they discover that Chauncey is somehow connected to Jessica. This mostly terrible horror movie relies on chunks of ideas recycled from older movies, several predictable jump scares, and monster lore that wobbles all over the place and makes little sense. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, Imaginary begins with a cheat of an opener, a sequence involving a giant spider attack that's—guess what?—only a dream. Once it really gets going, the movie has trouble establishing exactly what the characters are facing. It could be the teddy bear, or the creepy-looking blurry figures that leer at people and bare their teeth in the dark backgrounds, or the spider, or a giant, demonic version of the bear, or even another monster that incorporates the collected imaginations of millions of children. This movie doesn't know what it wants, and in the end can't summon up much more than a handful of dumb jump scares, half of them ""fake"" ones intended to make viewers jump and then laugh (neither of which is likely to happen). Audiences will spend at least several minutes recalling earlier movies that did all of this better. At least the family dynamic—with stepmom Jessica trying to relate to and communicate with her new stepdaughters—feels fairly close. But Imaginary is, overall, an opportunistic movie that didn't bother with creating a solid story before it went in front of the cameras. Families can talk about Imaginary's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? What is the relationship between the sisters and their stepmom like? What are their struggles? How well do they communicate? How does this compare to your own relationships?

"Mar 27, 2024"," Imaginary is the latest horror movie to join the Blumhouse catalogue, following in the footsteps of recent scary titles like M3GAN, Five Nights at Freddy's and The Black Phone., but it doesn't quite stand out from some of its predecessors. The movie, directed by Kick-Ass 2's Jeff Wadlow, follows Jessica (DaWanda Wise), a woman who moves back into her childhood home with her family. Soon after arriving, her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey that she finds in the basement.  From there, Alice starts playing games with Chauncey the Bear that begin playful and harmless, but soon become increasingly sinister. Jessica intervenes and realizes that Chauncey is not just a stuffed bear, and it becomes a race against time to protect the family from this malevolent presence. On paper, this is a strong concept. Plenty of horror movies have tapped into the idea of creepy dolls or toys like Annabelle in the Conjuring series, Chucky in Child's Play, and Billy the Puppet in Saw who, while isn't sentient himself, does serve as a freaky disguise for his creator, Jigsaw. So the idea of a scary teddy bear is a strong one. To take something that is meant to bring comfort to children (and often adults!) and make it horrifying is an intriguing basis for a horror movie, and it's a shame it didn't quite hit the heights it could have. There is a disappointing lack of Chauncey in a movie about a sinister teddy bear, and the movie seems to focus more on the family's drama than the main antagonist. While there's nothing wrong with set-up and some tension building, the filmmakers could have done more to utilize him, a la Poltergeist where things are moving when they really shouldn't be. The few instances where we do see Chauncey are creepy, and there are some decent visuals even if some of the special effects aren't great. It's also very repetitive, once you've seen the same creepy shadow technique a few times, it starts to get a little old. All of this is very disappointing considering they had such a fun idea to play with. Despite an unnatural script with some strange dialogue choices, the actors involved did their best to give their all, especially DaWanda Wise who plays the concerned stepmother trying to figure out what's going on. Performance-wise, none could really be faulted, even if it does feel like a family drama with background horror rather than the other way around. Aesthetically it's good, with decent sound design and an atmosphere that mirrors some old-school horror movies, but the style over substance approach is disappointing when the movie could've gone a lot harder than it did. The third act takes a very interesting turn and, without giving too much away, mirrors Insidious in taking characters and viewers to a strange new place. While it attempts to provide some answers about why Chauncey is acting like this, it's a little jarring in places. There are also a few questions you'll never get answers to, so don't go into this expecting things to be tied up in a neat little bow. It leaves things frustratingly ambiguous and the ending itself is a cliffhanger, doing that classic horror tactic of ""Will there be a sequel? Wait and see!"" which has certainly had mixed results over the years. Ultimately, Imaginary is fine, and it's not the worst horror offering out there but when it's competing with recent smash hits like Talk to Me, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. But if you fancy seeing a teddy bear terrorizing a family for two hours, you could do worse, and it beats a chaotic visit to Build-A-Bear on a busy Saturday afternoon. Just about!

"Mar 25, 2024"," Blumhouse returns to familiar stomping grounds with Imaginary, a story about a malevolent entity who latches onto a small child (in this case, Pyper Braun), determined to snatch them away to their secret realm – The Further. Sorry, no, The Never Ever, it’s called this time. It’s a formula that has worked well for the studio, scoring them five Insidious films, plus a less well-received one about a haunted swimming pool in Night Swim. And now it’s the turn of the imaginary friend to get scary. Save your Bing Bong jokes – Imaginary is well ahead of you, and makes plenty of them itself. But Chauncey Bear is no cuddly pink elephant; an unsettling stuffed toy with a lopsided face and spooky button eyes. Sinister shape-shifter Chauncey is a great design and, in the right hands, we could have been looking at the next Pennywise or Freddy Krueger. Sadly, these are the hands of Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island director Jeff Wadlow and Chauncey doesn’t get much chance to cut loose. Save for a scene between CB, Alice (Braun) and a therapist (Veronica Falcón) he’s fairly hopeless and less intimidating than one would hope. While the final act plays with Chauncey’s form a little (including some genuinely good practical effects), this supernatural horror story is disappointingly crayon-by-numbers – snatching wholesale from Poltergeist, Insidious and Coraline. Visually and structurally, it’s unimpressive, too, and features reams of dialogue which shouldn’t have made it past the first draft. Star DeWanda Wise gamely gives it her all but is ill-served by the writing and clumsy character work; meanwhile, Braun and screen sister Taegan Burns give spirited performances but wind up on the wrong side of grating. Likewise, a one-note Betty Buckley and The Walking Dead star Tom Payne, whose stupid hat garnered the only reaction (a derisive laugh) from this theatre audience.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024"," “Imaginario: juguete diabólico” es la más reciente película de Blumhouse, aquella casa productora dedicada al cine de terror de bajo o mediano presupuesto, (casi) siempre haciendo uso de premisas atractivas y actores poco conocidos para generar interés en el público, y maximizar las ganancias. Suena como un buen plan, pero desgraciadamente no siempre ha pagado dividendos. En algunos casos, hemos terminado con producciones verdaderamente escalofriantes, como “El hombre invisible” o “La noche del demonio”. Pero en otros casos, nos han entregado experiencias nefastas como “La isla de la fantasía” o “Firestarter.” Imaginario: juguete diabólico”, pues, se encuentra un poco en el medio, tirando para los últimos ejemplos. Lo que tenemos acá es una cinta con, efectivamente, una premisa llena de potencial y actores capaces, que sin embargo es desperdiciada en una experiencia previsible y poco escalofriante. Y de hecho, ese es el mayor pecado que “Imaginario: juguete diabólico” comete: no da miedo, y hacia el final de la historia, hasta da un poco de risa, lo cual, considerando el género al que supuestamente pertenece la película, es bastante grave. No es necesario aclarar, entonces, que los amantes del terror encontrarán acá algunas ideas interesantes, pero una ejecución que deja mucho que desear. “Imaginario: juguete diabólico” tiene como protagonista a Jessica (DeWanda Wise, de “Jurassic World Dominio”), una artista y escritora de libros para niños que se está mudando a una casa con su nueva pareja, el músico Max (Tom Payne), y sus dos hijastras, la adolescente Taylor (Taegen Burns) y la pequeña Alice (Pyper Braun). Muy aparte de los problemas que tiene con las dos chicas, todo parece estar yendo más o menos bien… hasta que Alice encuentra un oso de peluche mientras investiga en el sótano de la casa. El juguete se llama Chauncey, y parece ser la representación del Amigo Imaginario de la chiquita. Hasta ahí todo bien… hasta que el Amigo Imaginario demuestra no ser tan imaginario. De hecho, parece estar dándole órdenes a la pequeña Alice, obligándola a cumplir una serie de tareas, algunas más dolorosas que otras. Es ahí donde entra la señora Gloria (Betty Buckley), una mujer mayor que solía cuidar a Jessica de niña, y que ha dedicado los últimos años de su vida a investigar el fenómeno aparentemente paranormal de los Amigos Imaginarios. En pocas palabras, le dice a Jessica y a las chicas que Chauncey está utilizando a Alice para llegar a la primera, y que no descansará hasta cumplir su cometido, sin importar a cuánta gente termine dañando. Nuevamente: el concepto central de “Imaginario: juguete diabólico” es sólido. La idea de utilizar a los Amigos Imaginarios como entes paranormales que pueden abusar de la inocencia de los niños se presta muchísimo para una película de terror, y de hecho resulta, durante la primera mitad de la historia, en una que otra secuencia suficientemente tensa. El filme utiliza bien, por ejemplo, el recurso de La Niña Pequeña en Peligro, lo cual ayuda a que el espectador empatice con los personajes, y se quiera morder las uñas en ciertos momentos (por ejemplo, cuando Chauncey trata de convencer a Alice de atravesar su mano con un clavo; los padres en el público seguramente se pondrán súper nerviosos durante aquella escena). Sin embargo, las cosas se terminan por ir al demonio (ja) durante el último tercio de película. Lógicamente no incluiré “spoilers”; solo diré que es aquí donde la película abandona cualquier intento por generar suspenso o tensión, convirtiéndose en una suerte de aventura paranormal o fantástica con sets baratos, efectos visuales poco convincentes, y un uso poco terrorífico de animatrónicos. Amo a los animatrónicos y los trajes de criaturas como cualquier otro cinéfilo, y me dio gusto verlos acá, reemplazando el uso de efectos visuales digitales que tanto vemos en filmes estadounidenses; el problema es que no están bien utilizados (ni iluminados), lo cual resulta en escenas más absurdamente graciosas que verdaderamente terroríficas. De las actuaciones me puedo quejar poco, felizmente. DeWanda Wise (y sus ojos hipnotizantes) es conveniente como Jessica, una madrastra que está intentando hacer lo mejor que puede con una situación compleja. Taegen Burns tiene el rol ingrato de la adolescente sufrida; el estereotipo de chica que odia a todos, se rebela contra los adultos, y toma malas decisiones. Mejora hacia el final de la historia, y felizmente, los problemas del personaje tienen más que ver con caracterización que con su trabajo. La legendaria Betty Buckley no está mal como Gloria (aunque cierta escena con ella hacia el final destaca por lo fuera de lugar que se siente), y eso sí, debo resaltar el trabajo de la pequeña Pyper Braun como Alice. Pocas veces se ve a una niña actriz tan convincente y versátil; creíble tanto cuando le habla a su amigo imaginario, como cuando interactúa con su familia. Me dejó gratamente sorprendido, la verdad. No hay mucho más que se pueda escribir sobre “Imaginario: juguete diabólico”. Se trata de una película de terror que da poco miedo; que logra desarrollar algo de tensión durante su primer acto, pero que se desinfla increíblemente durante el segundo y especialmente el tercero, y que lamentablemente desperdicia una premisa con potencial. Las actuaciones centrales son buenas, y ciertas ideas funcionan (hay cierto giro narrativo que me sorprendió, lo cual no sucede con frecuencia en este tipo de producciones), pero el producto final en general no logra destacar ni positiva ni negativamente. “Imaginario: juguete diabólico” es una película de terror más de Blumhouse que pasará al olvidó, desgraciadamente, y que prontamente será reemplazada en el imaginario de los cinéfilos por la siguiente producción sangrienta perteneciente a aquel popular género de cine.

"Mar 24, 2024"," Directed by Jeff Wadlow, Imaginary follows DeWanda Wise’s Jessica as she becomes increasingly convinced that her step-daughter’s (Pyper Braun’s Alice) imaginary friend is actually real (and malevolent). It’s a stirring premise that’s employed to progressively unwatchable effect by Wadlow, as the filmmaker, armed with a script written alongside Greg Erb and Jason Oremland, offers up a deliberate and often astonishingly sluggish misfire that contains little in the way of compelling, attention-grabbing attributes – with the arms-length atmosphere compounded by an almost total lack of scares, a distressingly low body count, and several laughably inept periphery performances. And while the early part of the picture contains a very small handful of engaging sequences, including an effective scene wherein the teen next door is menaced by the central antagonist (although the lack of a satisfying payoff diminishes the impact of this interlude), Imaginary, which admittedly does boast a decent twist at around the halfway point, builds towards an absolutely endless third act that ensures the whole thing peters out to a fairly stunning degree – with the end result a hopelessly underwhelming and uninvolving disaster that squanders its promising setup.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 20, 2024"," *** If you’re foolish or stubborn enough (or in my case, both) to still spend time in the contemptuous wasteland formerly known as Twitter, you may be aware that Late Night With the Devil has come under fire for its use of AI-generated images for its interstitials. This is a regrettable turn of events, not only because the filmmakers denied actual artists work in favor of a cheap facsimile, but because this one unforced error distracts from the fact that the movie is actually an effective low-budget thriller that uses the familiarity of a retro aesthetic to deliver some potent scares. Our story takes us to Oct. 31, 1977, the day (fictional) talk show host Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) goes all out for his Halloween special in an attempt to finally outperform his longtime rival Johnny Carson. Unfortunately, Jack’s lineup of guests includes the sole survivor of a Satanic cult’s mass suicide (Ingrid Torelli), who understandably still has demons to deal with. Writers-directors-editors Colin and Cameron Cairnes create slow-burn dread in the first act, letting the audience get comfortable with the setting before ramping up to a bonkers finale involving gruesome body horror, false realities, and Torelli doing a killer Regan MacNeil impression. Plus, Dastmalchian (The Dark Knight, Dune) doesn’t miss a beat in his first starring role, giving Jack an affable, self-deprecating charm that slowly gives way to a profound sadness mixed with a desperate need for attention. While its mistakes may haunt it, Late Night With the Devil still boasts impressive filmmaking in front of and behind the camera, making it a trip to hell worth taking. R. MORGAN SHAUNETTE. Bridgeport, Cascade, Clackamas, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Movies on TV, Oak Grove, Vancouver Mall. **** Set during a heavy winter in an isolated Turkish town, the latest drama from director Nuri Bilge Ceylan (Once Upon a Time in Anatolia) takes wild swings yet strikes brilliantly understated notes. Deniz Celiloglu stars as Samet, a teacher perplexed by allegations that he’s too familiar with female students. His roommate and colleague, Kenan (Musab Ekici), faces similar accusations—and the two share a budding friendship with a female teacher, Nuray (Merve Dizdar), from a neighboring town, complicating their unspoken resentment. Working with cinematographers Cevahir Sahinand and Kürsat Üresin, Ceylan favors long, static shots, putting you in the room with his characters during extended conversations, but never in their heads (aside from the Terrence Malick-like philosophical introspection by Samet). Yet strategically sudden camera movements sometimes remind you you’re watching a movie…and what a movie it is. Is About Dry Grasses about a work scandal or a love triangle, or is it truly about dry grasses? The answer is elusive, and the ideal viewer will stop asking what Ceylan’s film is about and accept it for what it is: a masterpiece. NR. RAY GILL JR. Living Room. ** More than any other screen idol working today, Mark Wahlberg has that dog in him. The former poster boy’s presence all but guarantees an impassioned overcommitment, scruffy adorability, and bucketloads of nervous energy aching to be let loose—reliably cinematic qualities that his best films (Boogie Nights, Three Kings) have unleashed. Alas, Wahlberg’s star vehicles too often dispense with any hint of nuance or conflict to focus on bravura stunts unfurled at breakneck pace as an end unto themselves requiring no greater justification. Hence the new docudrama Arthur the King, about a quartet of weekend warriors who risk life and limb (and the titular mutt they find along the way) to climb, kayak and bound across hundreds of miles of mountainous old-growth canopy. Hyperfit cardiophiles may thrill at the prospect of performative self-abuse within the forest primeval, but does anyone besides participants and their long-suffering loved ones even know this race exists? Playing our hero’s better half, Juliet Rylance joins a long list of Wahlberg wives with little choice but to offer tearful support for their life partner’s wanderlust each time he grabs hold of an intriguing scent. A more humane interpretation of events (the film is based on Mikael Lindnord’s nonfiction book Arthur: The Dog Who Crossed the Jungle to Find a Home) would’ve at least questioned the wisdom of a career spent so ferociously chasing one’s own tail—though self-prescribed incredible journeys are rarely about the destination.

Casual fans might rightly question the sheer amount of material wholly dependent upon the undimmed adorability of Black’s slow-rolling fave phrase (skadoosh!), but for better or worse, these are children’s cartoons. As opening info drops in Kung Fu Panda 4 make clear, prior installments had neither the talent nor the inclination to sow seeds for an eventual world building of this luxe wuxia pastiche—and failed efforts at moralizing through Po’s long-suffering spiritual adviser (Dustin Hoffman) spotlight how little meat is left on this particular bone. Any actual philosophical tenets are clouded with pan-Asian greeting-card mysticism that divorces martial arts from violence altogether, implying that fighting is really just kinetic yoga. As with that other express Panda franchise hawking oversugared flavors plucked out of context, a creative vision ungrounded by larger perspective and unconnected to cultural context leaves a nauseating aftertaste.

That’s the concept behind director Jeff Wadlow’s latest horror film. A soulful DeWanda Wise stars as Jessica, a children’s book author who moves into her childhood home with her new family. Her young stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) soon finds a stuffed bear in the basement and names him Chauncey. Creative, Alice, but lordly monikers aside, Imaginary hits routine beats, including predictable fake-out scares, an old woman who delivers exposition, and a therapist who acts nothing like a real therapist (is there any other kind of movie therapist?). Imaginary finally gains momentum in the third act once the plot gets nutty (or nuttier), but by then it is too little too late. Wadlow has certainly made worse horror films than Imaginary (including the hilariously bad Truth or Dare), but his latest effort is still mostly toothless and unimaginative. PG-13. DANIEL RESTER.

Anguished by overdraft fees, Alejandro (Julio Torres) begs a Bank of America employee to acknowledge the injustice of his plight. Her response? She whips out a pistol, shoots him, and declares, “I stand with Bank of America!” Savagely funny and direct, that punchline is the opposite of everything else in Problemista, a satire of immigrant dreams that parries when it should stab. Written and directed by Torres (co-creator and star of Los Espookys), Problemista finds Alejandro in New York struggling to become a high-concept toy designer—his ideas include a stairs-hating Slinky—but Hasbro keeps rebuffing him. If he doesn’t want to be deported home to El Salvador, he needs a work visa, but the only person who will sponsor him is a deranged art critic (Tilda Swinton) curating an exhibition of her cryogenically frozen husband’s paintings of eggs (quirkiness alert!). Torres is a delightfully nimble performer, but Swinton’s Elizabeth is surprisingly staid, lobbing cruel, witless jokes at service-industry workers as if she were auditioning for a Z-grade Seinfeld ripoff. Problemista seeks to cultivate an aura of absurd wonderment, but its stock characters and forced whimsy are so wearying that when Alejandro is offered putatively soul-killing work as a paralegal, you want to cry, “Take the job, kid! Creativity ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.” R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, Hollywood, Laurelhurst. ** It would be difficult to declare the 1989 Patrick Swayze vehicle Road House a “good” film, but it does provide some trashy fun and has a cult following for a reason—which is more than can be said for director Doug Liman’s remake. Stepping into Swayze’s boots, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dalton, an ex-UFC fighter who heads to the Florida Keys to become a bouncer, attracting the attention of Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen), a crime boss who wants to control a particularly rowdy joint. While Gyllenhaal is solid as Dalton, the supporting cast is mostly indifferent (the exception is a scenery-chewing Conor McGregor as a henchman named Knox). Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow) delivers slick imagery and welcome chuckles (Dalton kindly brings some of his opponents to the hospital), but for the most part, Road House is a generic and forgettable action flick missing its predecessor’s lurid spirit. The 1989 film is many things, but bland isn’t one of them. R. DANIEL RESTER. Amazon Prime.

"Mar 19, 2024"," If there’s anything I’ve learned from Blumhouse Pictures movie Imaginary, it’s that we don’t talk enough. The horror genre is full of so much mystery around the evil being faced. There’s also a lot of denial. But what if we actually talk to each other? What if when that serial killer that’s coming after us, we sit down and try to figure out who it is? Or that demon that has haunted us, what if we tell our loved ones what we saw? Things would be solved way faster and the movie would be over. But what if it wasn’t over? What if talking to each other to solve what’s going on with the big bad, leads to new ways of storytelling? That’s what I feel with Imaginary. To be crystal clear, I don’t think that Imaginary is re-inventing horror. It’s a pretty basic film that kind of reads like a book. While watching, I couldn’t help but think that I would totally devour this kind of book. After all, the most powerful thing when it comes to horror is how we imagine the monsters within these books. And this movie is pretty cookie-cutter and predictable from start to finish. Keeping that all in mind, it does push into uncharted territory where the people in the movie talk about what they saw, confront the monster, and don’t end up having a sad ending where they sacrifice themselves for the rest of the family. They themselves are rescued by said family and get to live happily ever after. And I want to see more movies like that because I’m sick and tired of the plot twist where the bad thing got them. Now that is predictable. Happy endings aren’t. Besides Imaginary making me realize that 100% of horror movies could be solved by talking, I really enjoyed having DeWanda Wise as the lead. I have personally never heard of this actress and now I will be thoroughly going through her IMDb to see what she’s up to or what she has done. But just like my post the other day about Breathe, we are in desperate need of horror movies with Black leads. Because if there’s anything that Hollywood likes to do when it comes to showcasing any minority story is by leaning into stereotypes, often harmful ones. And the horror genre is absolutely guilty of that if we look back to the running gag that if you’re a Black character in horror, the chances of you dying skyrocket. Which, if you’re looking for a movie that looks at that stereotype right in the face and flips it the bird, I would suggest watching The Blackening. Imaginary went and fleshed out Jessica’s story in welcome and unexpected ways. It made her a mom to an interracial marriage and the children that came with it. We also got to see Jessica’s career and how art had always been such a pivotal thing in her life that it led her to a career making children’s books. We also got to see her and a white picket fence kind of neighborhood, that horror movies have statistically only made a residence for its white stereotypical leads. Jessica was just living her life. Everything wasn’t perfect when it came to Jessica’s storyline though. We got to see her as a child, have joyous moments with her mom, and the aftermath of confronting that monster when it destroyed her dad. And it would have been great if there were more Black characters along for the ride with Jessica. Contrary to popular belief, more than one minority can be the central focus of a story. And I’m saying this as someone who isn’t Black, but who is sick and tired of watching movies with Latinas, where there can’t be more than one of us. There can be. I can’t finish this review without talking about the special effects of this movie. I think that Imaginary found a really good balance between letting our imagination set the tone of how malicious Chauncey was. The bear was simple and something any kid would own. And I like the buildup to whatever this demon was. I do think though that the giant bear monster was something straight out of a nightmare, so A+ for making that fever dream come alive. But there were some things like the spider eyes and that ghost-like face that almost got Jessica, that just didn’t work for me. It was a little too cheesy and it made it seem like the demon could transform into multiple things. So I wasn’t sure if it was a teddy bear or a spider. Or maybe it was just everything because of imagination. Ultimately, Imaginary was cookie-cutter with a dash of making me contemplate something fresh for the horror genre. And that last bit, having me think about what I love and what this genre can do better, makes it more worthwhile than plenty of horror movies that I’ve seen lately. And that’s saying a lot.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 14, 2024"," La película Imaginary, dirigida por Jeff Wadlow, cuenta con un guion escrito en colaboración con Greg Erb y Jason Oremland. Aunque Wadlow es un habitual en la producción de películas para Blumhouse, ninguna de sus obras anteriores (como Verdad o reto en 2018 y la desafortunada nueva versión de Fantasy Island en 2020) ha tenido un éxito destacado. Sin embargo, en Imaginary, el director muestra una mejora en su enfoque, especialmente lo cuidado de los escenarios en la parte final de la película. A pesar de esto, el filme se queda en la mediocridad y solo satisface a un público que busca un entretenimiento más bien básico. La trama gira en torno a un amigo imaginario con una mente propia y una vena sádica latente, pero en lugar de explorar ideas originales, se limita a seguir las pistas de otras películas de la compañía. El problema central de la película radica en la construcción de los personajes, que se asemeja a dinámicas familiares recurrentes en numerosas películas de terror. DeWanda Wise interpreta a una escritora de libros infantiles y artista cuya creación principal es 'Simon la Araña', un monstruo de dibujos animados inspirado en sus pesadillas de la infancia, donde era perseguida por un demonio arácnido en su antigua casa. A pesar de los malos augurios y otros traumas relacionados con esa casa (como mudarse allí tras la muerte de su madre y luego abandonarla rápidamente cuando tenía cinco años debido a problemas legales de su padre), ella anhela regresar allí con su esposo Max. Además, el guión de la película es otro gran obstáculo. Escrito por los ya citados Wadlow, Erb y Oremland (estos últimos responsables de Monster High: La película y Playmobil: La Película), la trama de Imaginary está plagada de cosas que ya hemos visto antes, escenas superfluas y momentos que ponen a prueba al espectador. Una de las ideas más inverosímiles es la inclusión del personaje de Gloria (interpretada por Betty Buckley), una vecina que solía cuidar a Jessica y que, sorprendentemente, sabe demasiado sobre los amigos imaginarios. Gloria no solo es una experta en el tema, sino que también ha escrito un libro sobre los amigos imaginarios de los niños. Sin embargo, incluirla no logra dar coherencia a la historia y queda como un intento fallido de dar sentido al conjunto.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 14, 2024"," El tópico del juguete malvado, convertido en vehículo de fuerzas oscuras, ha sido analizado con frecuencia en el cine de terror durante los últimos años. De la saga Annabelle a la tecnológica visión del tema en la más reciente de Chucky y Megan. La idea del mal alienado y oculto detrás de un símbolo de inocencia, se ha vuelto cada vez más singular en su aproximación. Este año, Robert Morgan profundizó en el punto a través del duelo y el dolor en Stop Motion, en la que marionetas exorcizaban el sufrimiento de su creadora, pero a su vez se convertían en herramienta de un tipo de mal inquietante y desagradable. Imaginario: Juguete Diabólico de Jeff Wadlow intenta unir todo lo anterior en un escenario genérico y la mayoría de las veces, torpe. La cinta, que explora la idea de la imaginación como un puente con lo desconocido, comienza con una premisa blanda. Jessica (DeWanda Wise) ha hecho una fortuna, precisamente, gracias a lo que puede imaginar. Tanto, que la película deja claro que el personaje es la demostración del lado brillante de todo lo que un niño puede soñar. Escritora de libros infantiles, no solamente es una figura reconocida. También logró reconciliarse con su pasado, para narrar su propia vida entre símbolos y brillantes dibujos. Por lo que cuando su hijastra, Alice (Pyper Braun), insiste en que el oso de peluche que encontró en el sótano es su mejor amigo, Jessica lo asume como un hecho corriente. Mucho más se esfuerza por tratar de comprender a la niña, como protagonista de una dimensión encantadora de la cualidad para fabular la realidad. De hecho, buena parte del primer tramo de la cinta, Jessica y Alice podrían ser espejos la una de la otra. La escritora comprende los lugares ambiguos y extraños de la capacidad para imaginar. Y ambas, al fin y al cabo, ven el mundo de la misma forma. Hasta que el lado oscuro de esa habilidad comienza a deslizarse entre las sombras. Alice está obsesionada con Chauncey, el oso de peluche que encontró por un giro conveniente de la trama y que ahora lleva a todas partes. El guion del mismo Jeff Wadlow, Greg Erb, Bryce McGuire y Jason Oremland, intenta convertir la imposibilidad en algo siniestro. No solo no lo logra, sino que pierde su efectividad casi de inmediato. La cinta no intenta plantear la percepción de lo sobrenatural desde la dimensión de lo inexplicable. Al contrario, dedica tiempo e interés, en dejar pistas falsas sobre el origen del muñeco y hacia dónde le conduce su aparente misterio. A saber: cómo se une la infancia de Jessica — que incluye la tragedia de haber perdido a su madre y el extraño comportamiento posterior de su padre — con lo que le está ocurriendo a Alice. Pero a medida que el argumento acumula capa tras capa de algún tipo de enigma, la trama decae por blanda, genérica y superficial. De hecho, el principal problema de Imaginario: Juguete Diabólico es Wadlow es incapaz de sostener todo lo que plantea. Una y otra vez, la premisa se pierde en medio de diálogos que no llevan a ninguna parte y aparentes indicios, que solo son la excusa para un Jump scare sin la menor lógica. Todo va para peor, a medida que la cinta se hace una especie de laberinto de lugares comunes cada vez más evidentes. Desde incluir a Gloria (Betty Buckley), cuyo único objetivo es brindar información sobre el fenómeno centro del conflicto, hasta Liam (Matthew Sato), un evidente artificio de la trama para causar una sensación que todo lo que muestra en pantalla, bien podría ser una trampa elaborada. Pero a medida que la historia transcurre, se vuelve más tediosa y sacrifica su coherencia en favor de intentar asustar sin lograrlo nunca. El peor y más grave problema con que esta apoteosis de malas decisiones argumentales debe lidiar.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 14, 2024"," A warrior princess, a terrifying teddy bear, and giant sand worms… here’s the best and worst of the films the Pop Culture Planet writers have watched this week. In Damsel, Millie Bobby Brown plays Elodie who gets sworn into a life of royalty to help her people. This is no fairytale as the prince she’s marrying comes from an ancient kingdom that owes a centuries long debt. In order for the kingdom to live on, a sacrifice must be made. Brown is astounding as the sacrificial princess. Her performance keeps you engaged as she displays trepidation and determination to get out of her predicament. Brown does an excellent service to Elodie’s character as an endearing and witty young woman that felt authentic on screen.  Though there are CGI flaws, such as the glowing worms, the film does a very great job with the dragon voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Aghdashloo brings not only a haunting sense, but also a depth in vulnerability to her role. Taking what could’ve been a simple revenge story and adding a more sentimental aspect to her makes it enjoyable to unpack. The bond Elodie and the dragon create is an unexpected twist that adds to the tension towards the kingdom that lied to both of them. Compassion for the misunderstood is at the forefront of this film and makes for a compelling narrative.  In Dune: Part 2, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) unites with the Fremen while seeking revenge against those who destroyed his family. When he’s faced with a terrible future only he can foresee, he has a choice between love and the fate of the universe. Based on the sci-fi epic book series by Frank Herbert, Dune: Part Two wasn’t for me — and that’s okay. I found the film to be long and dragged out, while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed. The film is star-studded with actors like Christopher Walken that felt more like glorified cameos that don’t add much to the story. There is also a Blonde-level moment of cringe around Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that comes off as ridiculous. The highlights were the epic action with the sand worms and Florence Pugh’s gorgeous wardrobe as Princess Irulan. It’s been a great time for original horror in theaters, but Blumhouse hasn’t been getting it right. From lackluster entries like The Exorcist: Believer and Night Swim, Imaginary is another L on the list. The film follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who moves back into her childhood home with her family. The behavior of her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) becomes concerning when she finds a stuffed teddy bear named Chauncey that is much more that he seems. While Imaginary has surprising twists and turns, it’s ultimately cheesy and unserious. It is full of weak performances and even worse dialogue, including an awkward line from a therapist asking if Alice has taken on new hobbies like ventriloquism to explain Chauncey’s voice. Chauncey is more silly than scary — although under the right direction, he could’ve come across as more campy to win over audiences. My theater was laughing a lot but more from weak dialogue, which I don’t think was the intent. The stand outs in the film were the positive relationship that builds between Jessica and her stepdaughters, breaking the mold from typical stereotypes, and the unique practical set of the imaginary world of the Never Ever, which gave off Labyrinth energy.  A young woman, eager to earn some cash, arrives in a new town and secures a night shift at a sketchy motel managed by Teddy Miles (Lamorne Morris), who is friendly but slightly on edge and eager to leave. Miles assures Gwen (Phoebe Tonkin) that the place is harmless, despite all evidence to the contrary. When Miles leaves, Gwen is sure she is being watched by someone from her past, but as the night progresses… she becomes convinced the motel is haunted. Night Shift is a movie that offers a few jump scares, but takes too long to pick up. The plot falls very flat and, while the actors are good, the characters introduced along the way are underdeveloped and underutilized. While I thought the choice of committing to one location was just right for the film, it could have been stronger if the story had more moments of spontaneity. The story was pretty lackluster and predictable. Though the major plot twist was intriguing, it created a rushed ending that failed to add to the story.

"Mar 13, 2024"," How so? Well, Wicked Letters takes two of the best actresses of the modern era, and has them using some of the worst words in the history of the English language. Oscar-winning star Olivia Colman (The Favourite) and her equally accomplished counterpart Jessie Buckley (Wild Rose) have their reasons for swearing so hard and so often. Wicked Little Letters is based on a true story, you see. A true story in which the humble insult – whether it be spoken or written – is wielded as a devastating weapon. Why anyone would send this pious homebody who still lives with her parents (Timothy Spall and Gemma Jones) such filthy correspondence is not immediately clear. Edith’s near-neighbour Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley) certainly profiles as a profane author. She’s Irish, she’s a single mum, she can drink like a fish, fight like a bloke, and cuss like a wharfie. Oh, and Edith and Rose were almost friends once upon a time. Until there was some kind of falling out. Case closed? Yep, that should just about do it. Not so if you are local police officer, Constable Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan). Her take on proceedings: Rose just doesn’t seem the type to hide behind a veil of anonymity. There has got to be more to the story, believes Gladys. The rest of Wicked Little Letters fudges around with a modestly challenging mystery that the likes of a Hercule Poirot could solve inside 60 seconds. However, the lively language in play – particularly when Colman and Buckley share the screen – and some shrewdly relevant commentary about the cowardice of not putting your own name to your opinions makes this quite a spicily satisfactory affair. For a little kid, Alice (Pyper Braun) has some big problems. Her dad cares more about his wonky career as a rock musician than he does about his own children. Alice’s new-ish stepmom Jessica (DeWanda Wise) has moved everybody to a property with a slightly sinister history. And just to cap it all off, the basement of Alice’s new home is also the long-term address of an evil teddy bear named Chauncey. How evil? Well, this instantly forgettable horror film dictates we are just going to have to take young Alice’s word for it. Chauncey is her imaginary best friend, and all the sneaky suggestions and devilish demands he is supposedly making can only be reported by Alice herself.  Though there are many low-impact scares to be found in Imaginary, too few pack the kind of aftershock needed to truly creep out a seasoned horror fan. While the diminutive Braun does a fine job reacting (and, just as importantly, sometimes not reacting) to the freaky events around her, the adults in the cast are left looking sillier by the minute. To make a relevant comparison, this moderate affair is roughly in the same league as Night Swim, the recent ropey thriller where the villain was a demonically possessed pool. This week’s other movie about the multiple dangers that come with having an imaginary best friend is a cheeky, blokey and unapologetically dirty-minded comedy that feels as if it has time-travelled from the late 1990s for your viewing pleasure. There are just enough big laughs to be had if you can forgive the number of un-PC jokes that land with a dull thud.  Most of the plaudits for the salacious stuff that does work must go to John Cena (last seen doing that scene-stealing birthday-suit bit at this week’s Oscars). He plays a desperate actor hired by a trio of just-as-desperate best friends (led by Zac Efron) to play the role of someone who does not exist. The friends created Ricky Stanicky as a fake buddy whose name has got them out of all kinds of scrapes over the years. Now they need to prove Ricky is real. Otherwise wives, families and jobs will disappear forever. Cena has a goofy knack of selling gags that really shouldn’t be bought, which saves this so-so movie time and time again.

"Mar 13, 2024"," We’re in between Hollywood’s biggest night and another nostalgia take from Hollywood (they ain’t afraid of no ghosts) this week. Still, here we are with a new set of smaller and streaming features. This set of write-ups includes a Blumhouse horror flick, a medieval action movie, a hitman drama, a coming-of-age story, an LA comedy, a sci-fi drama, and a Farrelly brother comedy. The following features reviews for Imaginary, Damsel, Knox Goes Away, Uproar, First Time Female Director, The Animal Kingdom, and Ricky Stanicky. The Setup: When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter, Alice (Pyper Braun), finds a stuffed bear named Chauncey. As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize that Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be. Review: There’s a decent idea for a horror movie here, and there’s even an attempt to go pretty big (for a Blumhouse film) in the third act that involves the results of a deadly imaginary friend. And yet, this is a pretty whatever sort of thriller, where the scares are never that effective, the rules surrounding this supernatural being are thin at best, and the child performances aren’t very good. Wise is good enough as the film’s lead, reckoning with a traumatic past. The younger daughter, played by Braun, eventually gets more to work with, thanks to how Chauncey influences her. With that in mind, Betty Buckley pops in here to scream exposition at the characters, and it’s jarring to the point that I wish this film was campier. As it stands, any visual choices from director Jeff Wadlow are undone by the self-seriousness of this ordeal, combined with the low-key nature of how certain actions take place. Better than the killer pool movie, but not by much. The Setup: A young woman (Millie Bobby Brown) agrees to marry a handsome prince (Nick Robinson) — only to discover it was all a trap. She is thrown into a cave with a fire-breathing dragon and must rely solely on her wits and will to survive. Review: In the realm of fantastical Netflix films, I had more fun with this than Rebel Moon. Much of that comes down to how purposefully stripped down everything felt in terms of story. On the one hand, it leads to a couple redundant action scenes (characters literally escape areas only to return to them again), but it also reminded me of old-school dungeon-crawler games. With that in mind, this has the feel of a video game I would play. The Setup: Diagnosed with a rapidly evolving form of dementia, a contract killer (Michael Keaton) gets the chance to redeem himself by saving the life of his estranged son (James Marsden). Review: It’s been 15 years since Keaton’s directorial debut, The Merry Gentleman, but now he’s returned with another sad hitman movie. I guess this is just the type of character he can connect with most as a filmmaker. Regardless, the film is decent, at least from an acting front. Keaton works well with his actors (Marsden in particular) and even imposes a quirky subplot involving the detectives trying to piece together some of the murders that have taken place. In roles that feel like small favors, Al Pacino and Marcia Gay Harden show up to add a bit more esteem to the cast, with the latter doing a lot with very little, while Pacino does a lot with his hair (and sure, Pacino is still having fun here). Given the nature of Keaton’s character, there’s enough to admire in watching him portray a man trying to settle his affairs before his mind goes. I’m not sure how personal this may be for him, but as a loose way to reflect on his public career, there’s enough to intrigue. A bit on the slow side at nearly two hours, Knox Goes Away eventually gets away to an end, and I felt positive enough about it. The Setup: Set in 1981 New Zealand, a 17-year-old (Julian Dennison) is forced to make some choices about his life and stand up for himself, his whānau, and his future. Review: What a joy this film was. Uproar may have a familiar arc, but there’s little to scoff at when it’s done right. Dennison, who impressed myself and plenty of others thoroughly in Taika Waititi’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople, gets to show off even more range here as a teenager going through a true push and pull as far as where he fits in. Watching his progression, which involves figuring out his interests, sorting out his family life, and realizing what it means to be Māori at this time in New Zealand, provides a real emotional ride. It is only made better by this supporting cast that includes Rhys Darby underplaying it as a thoughtful teacher, Minnie Driver as the mom, and James Rolleston (from Waititi’s Boy) as the older brother. Directors Paul Middleditch and Hamish Bennett provide many specific details that serve the story well and even manage to bring in more rugby than I can remember seeing at this level in a film. Made to find a balance between brighter moments and dramatic ones, Uproar is quite affecting for a coming-of-age story, and a real winner. The Setup: In a world hit by a wave of mutations transforming humans into animals, François (Romain Duris) does everything he can to save his wife. As some creatures disappear into a nearby forest, he and their son (Paul Kircher) embark on a quest that will change their lives. Review: This film reminded me a bit of the 2018 Swedish film Border (a Best Makeup & Hairstyling) nominee for how it built a fantastical plotline into a story clearly built around social commentary. Naturally, one could also call something like X-Men to mind when considering what director/co-writer Thomas Cailley is going for here. This fits, thanks to the approachable way this story plays out. Working as body horror, a coming-of-age tale, a father and son story, and a sci-fi parable, there’s enough material here to feel as though it actually was a comic adaptation, and yet it’s all presented in a relatively grounded way to the benefit of the film. Strong performances throughout, including Adéle Exarchopoulos showing up in a more minor role, there’s just the right amount of imagination and wonder to balance the saddening side of how the public and those in charge would respond to this sort of phenomenon. The Setup: A writer (Chelsea Peretti) steps in as a first-time director to avoid putting the play she’s written in jeopardy. Barely surviving rehearsals, Sam vents to her therapist (Amy Poehler) and tries unconventional tactics to wrangle her eclectic cast and make her play successful. Review: So, this is a shame. Peretti is a very funny comedian who can easily be a scene-stealer in any movie or TV show she’s appeared in. Sadly, her directorial debut is not entirely up to snuff. Structured very similarly to Christopher Guest’s Waiting for Guffman, sans the mockumentary approach, this film lacks more consistent comedy, let alone attempts at humor extending beyond the cringe brand, emphasizing how seemingly doomed the eventual big show just may be. First Time Female Director is not devoid of humor, as there are too many funny people from various corners of the modern comedy world to not land some jokes. Max Greenfield has a good running gag about his attempts to attain more stardom. Poehler is always a guarantee of fun. Still, first time or not, it’s not the most auspicious attempt and there’s a lack of finesse that shows. The Setup: Twenty years after creating the imaginary Ricky Stanicky, three childhood friends (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermain Fowler) still use the nonexistent pal as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet him, the guilty trio hires washed-up actor Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. However, when Rod takes his role of a lifetime a little too far, they begin to wish they never invented Ricky in the first place. Review: Following two Oscar wins and a down-the-middle war comedy, Peter Farrelly is back in full-on comedy mode, even if he’s missing his brother Bobby. Perhaps Pete needed him to better round out what we get here (he was pretty good on his own last year with Champions). Fortunately, Ricky Stanicky isn’t the worst the Farrelly’s have offered up (it’s actually one of their best pure comedies in over a decade). However, it’s still just not all there. Typical for the filmmaker, the balance of raunchy gags, heart, and a display of respect by involving mentally challenged and disabled individuals are all there, but not strong enough to support this premise. The chief issue is Efron, who was so good in The Iron Claw but again shows how much support he needs to headline these comedies. Surrounded by a weak script, he’s forced to flounder. Next to him, while some zingers are fun, Santino and Fowler just aren’t bringing what’s needed either. However, holding this entire movie on his back is Cena, who is having so much fun embodying the role of Rod/Stanicky. His timing is excellent (and he once again shows how much better at riffing he is than his one-time enemy, Dwayne Johnson). On top of that, William H. Macy also pops in to score some laughs. The overall plot is too slapdash and sitcom-y to stand up to Farrelly greats like Kingpin, or There’s Something About Mary, so it’s not really a film I’d call “good.” However, if you’re a Cena fan, you could do worse than good ol’ Ricky.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 13, 2024"," No hace mucho desde que se estrenó ‘La piscina’ y ya vuelve a las pantallas otro típico popurrí marca Blumhouse con muñecos monstruosos, amigos imaginarios y una inesperada fuga a la fantasía infantil. El viernes 15 se estrena ‘Imaginary’, que parte de una serie de premisas con potencial, pero acaba concurriendo en una entretenida aventura de terror algo blandito que confirma que el enfoque comercial de la “casa del terror” cada vez busca más ampliar a un público no demasiado interesado en el género. Si algo parece decirnos esta nueva producción es que hay un lavado de cara definitivo de Blumhouse para crear terror casi para niños, puertas de acceso al género como ‘Five Nights At Freddy’ que adoptan las formas de sus películas más famosas, con fotografías ricas en azules fríos y abundantes juegos de plano y contraplano para los momentos intensos, para encajar historias sin peligro real, amenazas más o menos manejables y escasa presencia de la muerte. Esto por sí mismo no es un problema, ya que hay grandes películas de miedo para adolescentes muy dignas y es una tradición respetable que cumple una función necesaria para introducir al género a nuevas generaciones, lo malo es que este terreno se confunda con una excusa para permitir un guion lleno de conveniencias, clichés y sustos de garrafón. Y es que ‘Imaginary’ tenía suficientes giros, vueltas y sorpresas para haber sido una buena película de terror, pero la ejecución es demasiado vaga y sin ideas. Las escenas de jumpscares están telegrafiadas, básicamente hay una cada vez que aparece un personaje por el lateral del plano, acompañado de su subida de volumen hasta llegar a parecer una parodia. Como las interpretaciones de las niñas de ‘El exorcista: creyente’, los gritos de la protagonista infantil dejan momentos de humor involuntario y el guion tiene demasiados parcheados entre situaciones de plantilla que acaban resultando paródicas, como esa mujer apostillando todo lo que pasa con descripciones de lo que están viendo el resto de personajes. Esta costumbre de exposición en ladrillo, sirve de cemento para remendar proyectos que parece que se han unido en postproducción, empezando por el osito de peluche como objeto siniestro, un reciclaje completo del episodio ‘Ursa minor’ (1985) de la serie ‘Tales of the Darkside’, jugando de nuevo con ""lo cuqui"" como algo monstruoso que parece sello de marca en la actual deriva de Blum hacia el terror PG-13, tornada aquí en algo casi para todos los públicos. Mezclando esa idea con la de la película de amigo imaginario ‘Z’ (2019), desconocida pero mucho más rescatable, no faltan tampoco momentos de terror fotocopiados de éxitos recientes, como la escena del juego SIMON de ‘Verónica’ (2017), que ya fuera fusilada sin reparos por ‘Annabelle vuelve a casa’ (2019), y aquí se transforma en algo parecido, tampoco sin mucha vergüenza, confirmando su esencia de cine de retales conspirado por una AI que solo reproduce lo que come. Utiliza los clásicos dibujos creepy, el papel recortado y otros símbolos de un terror para adultos reciente que parece despistar sobre el hecho de que la película juega sobre seguro, sin sangre y un tono de drama de sobremesa cursi donde Blumhouse ha acabado acomodándose en sus últimas películas, como ‘M3GAN’ y ‘La piscina’. Por si fuera poco, se une al club de las películas (‘Annabelle’, ‘The Prodigy’) que reutilizan plano a plano el susto del pasillo de ‘Shock’ (1977) de Mario Bava, que se está convirtiendo en uno de los más influyentes (o más copiados) de la historia. Lo mejor que se puede decir del guion es que no deja de moverse hacia adelante, pasando del horror psicológico al de sustos o al de presencias sobrenaturales a un terreno mucho más libre de ataduras que podría haber llevado la película a otro terreno con algo más de valentía. Llegado cierto punto comienza un festival de ideas prestadas de otras películas sin mucho disimulo, aunque la que se lleva la mayor parte de préstamos es ‘Coraline’ (2009), desde puertas secretas a personajes familiares con ojos opacos, como puede comprobarse en el mismo tráiler. Su fuga hacia la imaginación de cuento de hadas oscuro coge un poquito de las claves de ‘The Hole’ (2009), mucho de la saga ‘Insidious’ y su otro lado, hasta planos escherianos planteados en el mundo imaginario de ‘Dentro del laberinto’ (1986), de la que no es la única idea que vemos reflejada. Una macedonia que muestra posibilidades de un género sin miedo a entrar en espacios fantásticos y sin las reglas físicas, pero que tampoco se esfuerza en esconder su falta de originalidad. Con todo, no es eso lo que decepciona en ‘Imaginary’, sino la apatía de la puesta en escena de Jeff Wadlow, encarnando el espíritu de agarrar el dinero y correr de la productora en los últimos tiempos, donde sus máximos esfuerzos parecen enfocados en crear un concepto lo suficientemente bobo —una piscina asesina, una muñeca letal que baila, un peluche maléfico— como para generar una campaña de marketing ocurrente y efectiva, sin prestar mucha atención al contenido, mientras las verdaderas nuevas voces del género se van descubriendo en productoras como Neon, XYZ, Vertical e incluso las renovadas 20 Century Pictures y Paramount.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 13, 2024"," Blumhouse’s theatrical endeavors have taken somewhat of a nosedive in recent months, with a triple threat of certified stinkers: The Exorcist: Believer, which foolishly assumed it could imitate its historic ancestor; Five Nights at Freddy’s, which was more concerned with empty-calorie fan service than being a movie; and Night Swim, which suffered from a wickedly weak foundation more than anything; all of them seemingly doing all they can to drag the name of a great filmmaking house down. Imaginary doesn’t suffer for any of the reasons that plagued its production brethren, but unfortunately, it decided to utilize its own imagination to dream up new ways to manifest as an absolute misfire. Okay, so maybe a distressingly weak script and acting that said script frankly deserves aren’t exactly “brand new ways” to gut a movie, but Imaginary also boasts the unique weakness of having picked the wrong genre with which to tell this story. This genre misfire is a testament to both the potential of its premise, and how severely it fails as a horror film. Imaginary follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a children’s book author who’s looking after her two stepdaughters — the teenage Taylor (Taegan Burns) and small child Alice (Pyper Braun) — while their father Max (Tom Payne) is away on a tour. The family have recently moved into Jessica’s childhood house, where Alice discovers an adorable stuffed bear named Chauncey. She bonds with the toy sweetly at first, but when the “games” they play become increasingly hazardous and disturbing, Jessica is forced to confront her past in order to protect her new family. Now, there’s not a single good performance in sight here (although the young Braun shows an ability to render emotions that’s quite impressive for her age) but not even Dionysus, Greek god of theatre nor any of his disciples would have been able pull off anything engaging in the face of Imaginary‘s excruciatingly poor writing.  And further still, it’s not entirely clear whether such a weakness manifests by way of the script itself, the cutting room, or some combination of the two; on the one hand, the film’s dialogue is industriously flat and unnatural, with the second-greatest offender (we’ll get to the biggest one later) being Betty Buckley’s character, Gloria, who can be most aptly characterized as “Madame Exposition.” But on the other hand, the movement both within and between each scene is just as inorganic, giving the impression that, if the script ever had a grasp on the concept of telling a story with “therefore” rather than “and then” — a crucially important skill to have for this craft — that grasp loosened in its translation to the screen (though it’s also not insincere to assume that the aforementioned dialogue was an isolated flaw). To the latter point of its jarringly stilted flow, Imaginary doesn’t seem to understand how to be a horror movie, which is different than being a film that isn’t scary. That’s not to say that Imaginary is scary, because it isn’t. Still, horror films are more than capable of being great movies without necessarily being scary (“scary,” of course, has such a mercurial threshold across humanity that it’s pretty fruitless to judge a film based on raw fear factor), but Imaginary, again, is not either of these. Indeed, anyone familiar with the genre has a shared understanding, whether they’re conscious of it or not, of a certain language that’s effectively native to horror movies; a language that most recognizably takes the form of those second-to-second beats and camera movements that prelude jumpscares and faux jumpscares. The problem with Imaginary is that, while it seems to be aware of this language — at least based on how it frames the meat of its “scary” scenes — the clumsy rush that permeates the whole movie destabilizes that horror language, therefore causing it to fall apart as a horror movie on a mechanical level. And it’s not any better on a cerebral level, either, especially considering that there’s a wealth of solid-to-excellent ideas one could conceptually pull out of Imaginary. A teddy bear as the main villain? Plenty of space to play around with the real and in-canon psychology built into a symbol of a safe and happy childhood suddenly turning into this malicious presence. An imaginary friend whose violence stems from the pain of abandonment, with a step-mom protagonist trying to win over her stepkids, no less? Go all in on exploring the darker nuances of love; the unrequited breed, the grief (which, by definition, is love that has nowhere to go), the paradox of the fact that real love is given without expecting anything in return, despite all of us needing to be loved, on some level, in order to survive.  Imaginary has vague impressions of that second thread, here and there, but any piece of the plot that even suggests the possibility of an arc or a theme is quickly buried under another round of cumbersome writing before it even has a chance of a chance to take shape, and nothing captures this frustrating faceplant better than the film’s ending (which is the script’s biggest offender that I alluded to earlier). After anti-climactically resolving what appears to be its final tension, the film kicks off a new scene where Jessica is reading her new book to her ill father, only to pull a fast one and effectively repeat the same pseudo-ending we just watched, after which the film actually does end. The thing is — and I’m not just saying this to be grossly hyperbolic; this is straight-faced, dispassionate observation — the ending of that fake children’s book that we only heard the ending of is, thematically, a better ending than the one we got in this movie, and I don’t even know what else to say about that, which is perhaps all that needs to be said anyway. In closing, Imaginary shouldn’t have rolled the dice on being a horror movie. The sheer amount of lore implied in the world of this film, which does actually pique genuine curiosity, tells me it would have been better suited as a full-blown urban fantasy feature; in that scenario, Imaginary wouldn’t have been burdened by the dark weight that an out-and-out horror movie more or less requires, and so could have thrown itself to the winds of a unique, more upbeat adventure — one whose writing, even if it was just as poor as that of the film we got, at least wouldn’t have been felt as harshly as audiences got sucked away in imaginative reverie. But Imaginary is, in fact, a horror movie, as well as a dissonant canvas depicting just about everything you shouldn’t do, if you hope to tell a good story. Indeed, considering he had to sit helplessly through roughly two months of that particular filming, I don’t blame Chauncey one bit for being so pissed off.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 13, 2024"," Unfortunately, most everything that precedes that overlong, climax-to-anti-climax and onward ending is just as “drawn out.” This Jeff Wadlow (“Truth or Dare,””Fantasy Island”) thriller grabs a simple concept and overthinks it into a dumb and rather dull 90 minutes surrounding maybe a dozen minutes of delivering chills. DeWanda Wise of “The Harder They Fall” and “Jurassic World Dominion” stars as Jessica, a children’s book author and illustrator happy to escape the nightmares of a city apartment and move, with her new musician husband (Tom Payne) and his teen (Taegen Burns) and pre-school (Pyper Braun) daughters back to the house she grew up in somewhere in Louisiana.  Her books are about Molly the Millepede and her struggles with Simon the Spider, mild-mannered scary material aimed at the very young. Might they somehow tie into her past and that prologue that saw a Black family struggling with something demonic hidden behind a crawl-space door? Jess overhears this chatter and is charmed and amused by it. Some of it even inspires her next story about that millipede, a real help to an illustrator with a deadline. And it’s a welcome break from the drama of the rebellious teen whose criticism of her various “step-mom” moves is not a help.  The performances are mostly competently indifferent,  although young Miss Braun packs a punch as a mouthy child who isn’t shy about asserting herself to an imaginary friend who seems bent on causing her harm.  The narrative steps on familiar touchstones of the genre — “irresponsible” fifteen year-old not taking care of her sister because there’s a cute teen boy next door, Chauncey “testing” Ally and making Jess anxious, the tuned-out husband who has to go “back on the road,” and the “chatterbox” neighbor (Buckley) who seems to know all about Jess’s past and what might be going on with Ally. None of it’s handled with much pace, humor, suspense or style until our third act journey into the NeverEver. And even that, derivative as it is, misses the mark in terms of real frights.  “Explaining” is almost always over-explaining in horror, because the best jolts come from the shock of the unknown and unknowable. The “Imaginary” is always lot spookier than the “explained.”",NEGATIVE
"Mar 13, 2024"," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzThis is the first film writer-director Jeff Wadlow (“Kick-Ass 2″/”Never Back Down”) has made for the Blumhouse franchise. Wadlow co-writes it with Greg Erb and Jason Oremland. They provide the usual horror pic scares and tropes for a silly film that is not good but might be strangely watchable if you’re an adult who never grew up. That is, it might be watchable to some horror pic fans who can relate to its supernatural thrills even with the film’s bad acting, undeveloped story and putrid dialogue.Imaginary is an unimaginative creepy horror pic about an imaginary evil friend, a children’s doll, found in a suburban household, that was left behind by the child who possessed it and grew up and moved on without taking him along.Jessica (DeWanda Wise) and her new husband Max (Tom Payne, Brit actor), and his two children from a former marriage, Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), move into Jessica’s childhood home, hoping for a fresh start.Both of them have experienced some prior grief–for her, there was no father at home as a child; for him, he had to deal with the mental problems of his ex-wife.When the youngest daughter Alice finds an old teddy bear in the house, she calls it Chauncey and refers to it as her new friend. Well, the doll turns nasty and real, and becomes a problem. Thereby the couple have a problem, as the doll ingrains himself into the household and has no intention this time of allowing the family to move on without him–as it plays demented games to make sure of this. Which I guess proves, you should never expect to safely retrieve a childhood doll you abandoned. ",NEGATIVE

"Mar 12, 2024"," Alrededor del 30% de los niños posee algún amigo imaginario durante su más tierna infancia, según la Asociación Española de Pediatría. Muchos de ellos se inventan personas, otros tantos animales o seres mitológicos, pero también los hay que acuden a figuras terroríficas que acaban provocando que los adultos se preocupen, como es el caso de la pequeña Alice en Imaginary, la nueva película de Blumhouse y Lionsgate.  Protagonizada por la joven y solvente actriz de 10 años Pyper Braun, Imaginary intenta innovar al entremezclar amigos imaginarios con ositos de peluche diabólicos. Pero, el filme yerra al caer en los arquetipos del cine de género, aunque termina resolviéndose con efectividad. La impronta de Blumhouse se siente demasiado presente, con un claro homenaje a Insidious y al plano más onírico en el que habitan los demonios. Además de la pequeña Pyper, DeWanda Wise, en el papel de su madrastra, y Taegen Burns, en el de su hermana, sobresalen en un título que maltrata especialmente a personajes secundarios con un gran potencial, quienes desaparecen con la misma facilidad que aparecen. Esto lleva a exponer la artificialidad del guion y su búsqueda de avanzar en la trama, desaprovechando a actores de la talla de Tom Payne y Betty Buckley. Jeff Wadlow demuestra una vez más por qué es un director más de series que de películas, después de descalabros tan sonados como Verdad o reto (2018), Fantasy Island (2020) o El Espíritu de Bridge Hollow (2022), y aciertos tales como las series Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television, Bates Motel y The Strain. En estas dos últimas ejerciendo como productor y guionista.  Imaginary llevará a muchos a cuestionarse si se trata de una película de transición entre grandes hits taquilleros de la compañía Blumhouse, con M3GAN y Five Nights at Freddy's encabezando sus últimos grandes éxitos. Y más después del secretismo que ha rodeado al filme. Aunque resulta muy loable su intento de visibilizar los traumas y los monstruos que nos acompañan desde nuestra niñez, Imaginary fracasa al mirar demasiado hacia el pasado de Blumhouse y no hallar su propio camino alejado de los clichés del cine de terror.  Jessica regresa al hogar traumático de su infancia junto a su nueva familia, después de convertirse en una escritora de éxito.

"Mar 12, 2024"," Blumhouse is a horror force to be reckoned with. Its unique, industry-disrupting business model — give up-and-coming horror directors a shot at the big time; keep the budgets modest; profit? — has been hugely successful, and it’s proved to be an important launchpad for filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Rob Savage, Mike Flanagan, Nikyatu Jusu, Nahnatchka Khan, Christopher Landon, and more. But with that model perhaps comes a certain expectation of volume. Imaginary is the studio’s eighth film to be released in the past 12 months, and while it is not a complete nightmare, lately it’s hard not to feel quantity being favoured over quality. Directed by Blumhouse alumnus Jeff Wadlow (2018’s Truth Or Dare), Imaginary seems at first glance to be one of those horrors attempting to introduce some spooky iconography. Chauncey the teddy bear is presented as a kind of cross between two Pixar characters: Toy Story’s evil Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear and Inside Out’s imaginary friend Bing Bong (the latter is in fact frequently referenced throughout). But the film doesn’t quite have the sense of how to make Chauncey feel iconic or portentous enough — ending up more like Fozzie from The Muppets than Billy The Puppet from Saw. Instead, what follows is rote horror tropes: a creepy kid; a spooky old house; a dingy basement with flickering lights; and ‘trauma’, the thing that all modern horrors must apparently be underpinned by. Indeed, there’s more trauma here than the film knows what to do with. Illustrator and author Jessica (DeWanda Wise) is haunted by the memory of her mother’s death from cancer; her father has been institutionalised (and appears in her dreams, with spooky spiders); she is insecure about step-children learning to accept her as a parental figure; and their biological mother is, also, dangerously disturbed. So, with a vague theme of parental anxiety, Jessica frets and worries as youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) spends a little bit too much time with Chauncey the teddy, and eventually some supernatural secrets begin to emerge. Some of the these secrets come from one of the world’s worst child psychologists, who breaks patient confidentiality in order to forward the plot; some come from an eye-rolling ‘twist’, if you can even call it that; and some come from Jessica’s neighbour, an elderly woman named Gloria (Betty Buckley), who might as well be called Basil Exposition, with lines of dialogue like, “Every culture has a name for it... the Spanish call it ‘El Coco’...” Nothing here is especially awful and the cast, Wise especially, are not really to blame. Everything just feels a bit flat. It’s not particularly long but it moves at a tedious pace. Dialogue is tired and thoughtless. The visuals are dull and repetitive; some impressive M.C. Escher-inspired production design does come through in the more fantastical final act, but even this feels too little and too late. Most crushingly, the imaginary friends, the evil spirits, the things that the Spanish call ‘El Coco’ — they’re simply not that scary. They never quite land. It all feels like something we’ve seen before, executed so much better. There’s much talk of superhero fatigue at the moment, but at this rate, maybe we need to start worrying about horror fatigue, too.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 12, 2024"," ‘He’s not imaginary and he’s not your friend’ Alice says, a line that resonates all the way to the tag-line on the poster for Wadlow’s underpowered film. Soon Chauncey the bear is organising jump-scare packed Scavenger Hunts and helping Jessica with her creepy-ass illustrations. In a scenario almost identical to the equally insipid Nightswim, these ‘projections from the spirit world’, are eager to see off any interlopers who might disrupt the family unit, interruptions like Taylor’s dorky boyfriend. He’s keen to pass off his mom’s allergy medicine as some kind of molly that will help her ‘see 12 seconds into the future,’ a line that gave this critic unwanted flashbacks to my own repressed memories of watching Madame Web. Imaginary isn’t going great by the time we take a ‘cognitive break from reality’ and Jessica, Gloria, Taylor and Alice conjure up a blue door that leads them to a world of pure imagination called the Never Ever to confront the spirit that’s messing with their heads. ‘Sometimes we create by tearing things apart’ says Jessica , but Wadlow’s film doesn’t do enough ripping up of rules or offering original or creative thinking; this feels very low-rent even for Blumhouse, and one wonders how the director of such one star fare as Kick–Ass 2 and Fantasy Island is getting gigs like this in the first place. There’s no flavour here but the Blumhouse house style, and that’s wearing very thin these days; the only thing that’s imaginary here is the entertainment value, it’s weak, weak sauce even for the easily pleased.

"Mar 11, 2024"," Despite some fun performances, this comedy about socioeconomic class and human connection is driven by quirks and contrivances that undermine any authentic emotional grounding. Phil (Peter Dinklage) is a misanthropic finance professor whose elusive dream of home ownership prompts him to accept an unusual offer from an eccentric widow (Shirley MacLaine) to buy her estate for cheap — if only she can live there until she dies. The resulting consequences send Phil into an existential crisis, down a personal and professional spiral. Favoring broad slapstick over edgy satire, the film produces scattered laughs to offset its gaping logical inconsistencies. The cast includes Matt Dillon and Danny Glover. (Rated R, 98 minutes). The aesthetically pleasing sights and sounds can only partially compensate for the meandering nature of the multicultural queer romance at the center of this earnest tribute to 1990s indie rockers Indigo Girls. Their music provides the backdrop for the whirlwind summer of love involving a circus performer (Alex Diaz) and a struggling musician (Alan Cammish). As their relationship deepens, however, realities and uncertainties about the future threaten to tear them apart. Despite some nostalgic appeal and accompanying heartfelt intentions, weaving the songs together with a coherent narrative resonates intermittently but lacks a deeper emotional hook. The supporting cast includes Tig Notaro, Missi Pyle, and Ming-Na Wen. (Not rated, 116 minutes). The best parts of the latest biographical documentary from director Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) have little to do with the titular fashion designer’s bold visions or couture collections. The conventional first half gives way to a dissection of Galliano’s fall from grace after a series of embarrassing drunken taunts and antisemitic rhetoric made him an outcast for more than a decade. Although too eager to embrace his redemption, the film is a moderately intriguing exploration of celebrity ego, cancel culture, remorse and self-awareness. It’s an illuminating portrait for fashion aficionados and also an indictment of the morally ambivalent industry that supports him. (Not rated, 117 minutes). The lack of imagination is what sinks this hackneyed thriller from director Jeff Wadlow (Fantasy Island) that functions mostly as a parade of cheap thrills and genre cliches.  It follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise), who moves her family back into her childhood home, where her young stepdaughter (Pyper Braun) becomes attached to a stuffed bear she finds in the basement. While their interactions are initially playful, things turn sinister for the girl, forcing Jessica to confront her troubled past along the way. Beneath the jump scares, film lacks the consistent suspense to tap into juvenile paranoia and fractured families with any meaningful level of provocation. (Rated PG-13, 104 minutes). You might want to reconsider your childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut after watching this moderately insightful documentary, which examines the psychological toll of extended space missions. It centers on a NASA psychologist tasked with preparing potential candidates for a three-year voyage to Mars sometime in the next decade. The film tracks families impacted by emotional challenges on past missions, and research that has helped to develop to artificial intelligence and other tools to help combat anxieties from being in close quarters so far from home. The result is enlightening but not especially cinematic considering its subject matter. However, it raises worthwhile questions without easy answers. (Not rated, 87 minutes).",NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024"," When horror nerds describe Jason Blum’s approach to the filmmakers he recruits for projects at Blumhouse, they’re likely to compare him to The Big Dawg, Roger Corman, in the way that he, similarly to the king of New World Pictures, has an eye for good talent that can deliver him a solid 90-minute release under-budget and on-time. To be fair, there’s plenty of support for that claim – the guy’s nurtured some fantastic filmmakers through their first projects (Damien Chazelle, Jordan Peele, etc.) and helped the Old Guard give their smaller-scale works a decent home (BlackkKlansman) – but Blum’s at his funniest when he’s actively imitating Menahem Golan and Yoran Globus, the men behind Cannon Films, who were hucksters supreme and brought gloriously trashy and entertaining concepts to life, with a fair amount of Hollywood-adjacent skullduggery along the way. The historical parallels aren’t there as often as they should be for a consistent comparison, but they’re hilarious when they line up as they do with Jeff Wadlow’s Imaginary, another PG-13 horror flick from the man who brought you Truth or Dare and the feature-length Fantasy Island remake. It’s dumb, too long, and oftentimes deliriously funny in unintentional ways. Still, if viewed as a massive troll job meant to directly fuck up a competitor’s forthcoming release, it becomes kind of brilliant. The subject of that troll job is, of course, John Krasinski’s IF, which will hit theaters in a few months and is a similar take with a significantly larger budget on the concept within Imaginary – imaginary friends need kids to hang out with. If there’s no more room in Foster’s, the specters will walk the Earth, hoping to latch themselves on to some poor child needing a pal and get the free room and board that comes along with it. If I – a dude who has to keep up with the coming-and-goings of the multiplex release calendar so that I can make 2,000-word dick jokes every Friday – got confused between the two for months, I imagine that there’s gonna be a lot of parents who take their kids out to the theater this weekend thinking that they’ll get fuzzy Steve Carrell creatures and Ryan Reynolds ad-libs for a few hours. Instead, they’ll get Chauncy Bear, and at least you could visibly tell the difference between Chuck Norris and the Missing in Action crew when sized up next to Stallone and the Rambo: First Blood Part II gang. I don’t know if Krasinski’s script was floating around Hollywood for long enough to have a cheaper project like Imaginary get fast-tracked and 360 no-scope schedule-snipe it, but the similarities between the two are enough for me to believe it. Imaginary works best when viewed in that (albeit self-limiting) light – it is a hilarious prank pulled on a dude who’d much rather you’d saved your money for some of his Good News. When you get past all that, though, you’re not really left with too much – even if IF sucks, this will likely still be The Illusionist to Krasinski’s The Prestige – even if Wadlow and company got to the better title first. The film is so stuffed with the cliches of modern Blumhouse that you’d assume they were making their own variation of the scavenger-hunt checklist that Chauncy Bear – a plain teddy bear in a little red vest — asks little Alice (Pyper Braun, who is a shockingly good actor for her age) to make for him. See, Alice found Chauncy in the basement of her new house during a game of hide-and-seek with her step-mom, Jessica (DeWanda Wise), and the two have slowly become inseparable. At first, Jessica and her partner Max (Tom Payne) assume that it’s a cute new way for the girl to adjust to her new environment after suffering a great deal at the hands of her birth mom. Jessica assumes she’ll grow out of it, especially in the security of what was once Jessica’s own childhood home, though that has its own dark secrets to go with it – her father snapped one night when she was a girl, and he was never quite the same, the scars he left on his night-of-rampage reminding her each day of what terror can be around every corner. She privately doubts her ability to be a good mom, especially when her other step-daughter, 15-year-old Taylor (Taegan Burns), is sending her evaluations in the form of some “bitchy” text messages whenever Jessica does something she doesn’t like. But Chauncy has other plans for the girl, and his “scavenger hunt” might be a little more mystical than a childhood make-pretend quest – and Jessica, an artist with an overactive imagination, might be essential to this monster’s plans than it may seem at first blush. Now, Wadlow’s budget hampers what he can do with his nightmares and dreamscapes – this, of course, goes to the same type of mystical fantasy land that Insidious: The Red Door and Night Swim goes to – and it’s kind of funny that Wadlow gets outcompeted in this department by a Disney Channel original movie (Don’t Look Under the Bed, which is probably the single best thing that company ever put on cable). And it also doesn’t help that Chauncy spends the movie mean-mugging, his expression going from mild to glowering in a way that involves the doll’s model being substituted instead of just lit in strange ways. You don’t need to manipulate an object as much to make it that scary – the stillness and the dark contrast between its innocence and its evil works is the spooky thing. It gets particularly funny at certain points, especially in a post-Ted world. Maybe if he had a dispensary down the street, Chauncy would have been a little cooler and more relaxed, but we get the Chauncy we deserve and not the one that we want – and this one is unintentionally hilarious rather than intentionally so.  It’s beyond Wadlow’s powers to make this bear scary, and a third-act reveal about him is especially silly, given that it throws the entire conceit into disarray (and justifies the name – imaginary friends aren’t usually objects). Imaginary is more boring than anything else – the film moves forward at a creep, going through the motions of your standard non-gory teen-friendly horror March release, and ends ultimately in a dull Poltergeist reference that might make you wish you were at home watching that instead. But as a way for Jason Blum and company to rain on Office Jim’s parade, it’s transcendent, so who knows – if you really hate the Quiet Place movies, maybe go check this out.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024"," IMAGINARY plays something like if ALICE IN WONDERLAND, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and INSIDIOUS all got together and had a lively tea party that never went fully mad. That IMAGINARY has a PG-13 rating probably has something to do with its relative restraint, but so does the filmmakers’ evident desire to hit a specific set of notes. Children’s book author and illustrator Jessica (DeWanda Wise) suffers from nightmares. Jessica’s musician husband Max (Tom Payne) has two daughters by his previous marriage, angry teen Taylor (Taegen Burns) and sweet little Alice (Pyper Braun). Jessica is determined to be a good mom to both girls, even though Taylor makes it clear she feels the best thing her new stepmom could do is leave. The whole family moves into Jessica’s sprawling childhood home. Although Jessica left at age five, she remembers being happy here. This was before her mom died when she was five, her dad became unable to care for her, and she was raised by her grandmother. The house still has crayon drawings on the walls of Jessica’s old bedroom, and plenty of her childhood artwork in the basement. The basement has all sorts of nooks and crannies, where an exploring Alice finds teddy bear Chauncey. Chauncey has a pull string, but it just plays music. However, Alice acts like Chauncey is talking to her. She engages with him. Jessica, Max, and even Taylor think it’s cute when Alice adopts a slightly different voice for Chauncey. Is it really a spoiler if it’s on the poster? The audience is clued in that whoever or whatever Alice has befriended, he’s not imaginary and he’s not a friend. There’s some intriguing, textured back story. Alice and Taylor still miss their mother, even though she is unstable to the point of having been violently abusive. Jessica has an unacknowledged memory block about details of her childhood, and Jessica’s old babysitter (Betty Buckley) clearly knows more than she’s telling. The maze-like sets and evocative décor, courtesy of production designer Meghan C. Rogers, add a lot to the proceedings, giving IMAGINARY a suitably dark fairytale vibe. For a good while, director Jeff Wadlow, who co-wrote the script with Greg Erb & Jason Oremland, demonstrates skill in suggesting dread. Then there’s a big twist, which at first is impressive, but then loses its initial significance and becomes confusing. Why does this twist matter in the larger scheme of things? We also start wondering about matters of selection, geography and numbers, to name a few questions that arise late in the proceedings. The movie has to pack so much new information into its concluding section that it starts to seem a bit thrown together. Since IMAGINARY seems to be actively aimed at becoming a franchise, it is highly possible that its mysteries may yet be explained. Meanwhile, it’s diverting and prompts a few shivers, even if its climax leaves something to be desired.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024"," 
Writer and director Jeff Wadlow has a storied history crafting creepy tales for Blumhouse, the modern mogul of horror features. For his latest, he’s taken on the “creepy kids and surrogate parents” sub-genre to tell the tale of a spooky friend named Chauncy who terrorizes Jessica (DeWanda Wise) and her new husband’s children, Alice (Pyper Braun) and Taylor (Taegen Burns). His version starts off as a less exciting version of its flood of cohorts, but it later commits so hard to its own bit that it becomes the zany Halloween treat that aged fans of Mary-Kate and Ashley spooky movies might beg for. Jessica isn’t a reluctant surrogate mother; she’s a zealous one. Taking on her husband’s children, who’ve been left behind by their mentally ill mother, is a challenge for the children’s author, who is excited by the idea of having a happy family, something she lost out on in her own childhood. But it’s not easy being a stepmom (especially with a brand tarnished by fairy tales), and Jessica butts heads with the older daughter, Taylor, and has a hard time managing the specific needs of the younger, Allison, a playful and warm child scarred by the experience of her mother. After struggling with nightmares in their shared apartment, Jessica and the gang move into her childhood home, which has become available since her ill father had to move into a place with full-time care. Her husband insists he knows it’s her happy place and that she will be happy there, even though she left there at age five after some trauma she can’t really remember. This is the first of the story’s unfortunate disconnects from logic that signal a lot of it was made without a reliance on crafting a quality script. But it doesn’t matter much. After some runtime stretching beats by way of a trouble-maker neighbor, an eccentric old lady, and something about children’s illustrations and deadlines, the story takes a turn when the imaginary friend Allison has latched onto pushes her to some dangerous acts. A visit from Alice’s therapist turns sour, and new secrets are revealed, which sets the story off from another in a long line of ‘same old’ and into a zany tale of occultism for kids. At the risk of doing my usual listing of cohorts, this feature has more in common with the recent (terrible) Five Nights at Freddy’s than it does with Mama and The Babadook. It’s easier to compare it to the criminally underseen Z, though that one is much more grim, despite following the same premise of a shared experience with an invisible pal. Imaginary could have so easily been relegated to being the next boring take on creepy kid bologna, and its first half full of nonsense filler and ridiculous conversations made me think that’s where it would live. But the moment after its best scare (you’ll know it when you see it, it’s not so different from what you might see in The Conjuring 2), the story flips from being a daylight The Boogeyman into a wacky fright that exploits, dare I say it, liminal spaces. There’s a temptation to scrutinize ratings for horror movies, us recently experiencing what happened to Black Christmas, and the complaints splashed all over the bloodless M3GAN, but maybe not all scary movies are made for those of us comforted by sharp weapons piercing skin and releasing gallons of crimson fluid. I can’t guess why Imaginary is PG-13, but it thrills me that younger audiences might see this as a bridge from Phantom of the Megaplex to Malignant. Imaginary is the kind of stupid movie that’s played with such earnestness that it begs to be accepted into camp or cult standing, though it probably won’t be. It’s not going to break the internet the way other new zaniness did, but for younger audiences looking to wade into terrorizing features, Chauncy is like a predator holding a nut trying to pull a squirrel into a horrific space.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024"," The premise of “Imaginary” is a rather good one, and writers Jeff Wadlow (who also directed), Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland deserve that much, but the execution, especially as it pertains to a convoluted narrative, could’ve used some, I dunno, imagination. Rather than lean into the script's strongest element-a teddy bear comes to life and stalks an unsuspecting household-”Imaginary” falls back on lame horror troupes, laughable dialogue, half-baked side characters, and a bewildering finale that creates an experience far from wondrous. Aside from some decent practical effects and commendable camera movements in the latter half, there’s not much creative flair.  The story involves strange family dynamics from the start: It follows children’s author Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who desperately wants to connect with her stepchildren Taylor and Alice (Taegen Burns and Pyper Braun) after their biological mother was hospitalized for mental health issues. That crucial plot detail isn’t used in any meaningful way and is casually thrown into the movie for the sake of a juicy argument rather than an enhancing/teachable story development. The patriarch of the house, Max (Tom Payne) is also pretty useless, leaving about midway through to pursue his musical career while Jessica babysits. It’s almost as if the writers needed to come up with a quick way to get rid of him.  Their family has moved into Jessica’s childhood home and with it comes a handful of memories, though she’s conveniently replaced the traumatic memories with those of happy ones, because if we knew about the bad ones, then “Imaginary” would have no place to go. And that journey begins when Alice stumbles upon a stuffed bear in the basement named Chauncey. Of course, what starts as a seemingly harmless child’s relationship with their stuffed animal predictably veers into sinister territory as the imaginary friend sends the young Alice on, among other things, a scavenger hunt from hell, and the family is left to pick up the pieces.  There's no way you could guess where “Imaginary” takes its third act, but, without revealing too many details, let’s say its production design resembles a sadistic funhouse with various supernatural elements. With a tighter script, characters we cared about, and less investment in trying to conjure silly twists, this imaginary realm could have set the stage for a grand climax, but alas, it merely suggests ideas more than acting on them. Wadlow tries combating these problems by having characters, especially a wild Betty Buckey playing the neighborhood snoop Gloria, over-explain scenarios beyond the point of satire, but, as the credits roll, all you’re really left with is to imagine there was probably a more fulfilling way to use your time.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024"," In the crammed video aisle of supernatural horror films, the introduction of a villainous teddy bear in Imaginary might initially raise more eyebrows than pulse rates. Directed with a keen eye for the absurd by Jeff Wadlow (director of NOFS fave Cry_Wolf) and penned by the trio of Wadlow, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland, this latest offering from Blumhouse Productions – the powerhouse behind a slew of commodified villains – might seem like it’s scraping the bottom of the horror trope barrel. The film stars DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, and the delightful Betty Buckley, in a narrative that threads the familiar needle of haunted playthings and the unseen horrors they sneak under our beds. The premise of Imaginary tiptoes around the edge of being all too familiar: Jessica (DeWanda Wise) and her family, including the youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun), move back to her childhood home, only for Alice to unearth a seemingly innocuous stuffed bear, Chauncey, from the basement. As expected, Chauncey is no ordinary bear, and Alice’s attachment to it heralds a series of increasingly sinister events. Herein lies the film’s first stumble; the well-worn path of imaginary friends and malevolent childhood relics feels somewhat exhausted. Any anticipation for innovation is met with a premise that feels as if it’s been pulled from an already dog-eared page of the horror genre’s playbook. However, Imaginary manages to swerve unexpectedly from eye-roll-worthy to surprisingly delightful. It’s as if the film looked into the abyss of its own absurdity and decided to embrace it with open arms. Chauncey, with his adorably menacing facial expressions, becomes an unlikely anchor for the film’s charm. The campy special effects – including the memorable, though hardly frightening, teddy bear eyes on human characters – contribute to a sense of gleeful, self-aware absurdity. Imaginary leans into its silliness with such enthusiasm that it’s hard not to be swept along for the ride, despite a small echo of Coraline’s vibes in its approach. The extended horror sequences, highlighted by a suspenseful game of cat and mouse involving nothing but a teddy bear and its ripcord, are executed with a finesse that contrasts the film’s otherwise fluffy antagonist. Here, Imaginary excels, ramping up tension without resorting to cheap thrills or redundant scares, a strategy reminiscent of James Wan’s most celebrated works, like Insidious. The film commendably refrains from undercutting its own suspense, choosing instead to maintain the integrity of its frights, even with a 2-foot antagonist at its helm. Among the performances, DeWanda Wise’s portrayal of Jessica shines brightly, even if her relentlessly positive vibe sometimes feels out of step with the film’s darker turns. Taegen Burns shines as the quintessentially sullen stepdaughter, and Betty Buckley delivers a memorable turn as the nosy neighbor with a library’s worth of crucial exposition. As Imaginary careens into its finale, it throws in everything but the kitchen sink – a not-so-beloved hallmark of the genre. The film’s endgame, while brimming with the kind of over-the-top, campy energy that marks its best parts, feels like a somewhat disjointed conclusion to its dual ambitions: to tell a profound story of family and trauma, and to revel in its identity as a ‘cheeseball movie about an evil bear’. It’s in its unapologetic embrace of the latter that Imaginary finds its sweet spot. Despite flirting with some of horror’s more overdone clichés, Imaginary manages to carve out a niche for itself with its embrace of the absurd. It proves that all a good horror flick might need is a dash of creativity and a willingness to lean into the madness. So, if you’re game for a movie that doesn’t skimp on the cheese or the thrills, Imaginary might just be the teddy bear-themed horror movie you didn’t know you needed.

"Mar 10, 2024"," There can be a very thin line between cute and creepy. Just look at Chucky, M3GAN, or the Cabbage Patch Kids. Not all of these are killer toys, but all of them could be believably beloved by children while giving grown-ups the heebie-jeebies. Coming to join their perturbing plaything ranks is Chauncey Bear in Imaginary.  Plus, like Blumhouse's other recent killer toy offerings, M3GAN and Five Nights at Freddy's, Imaginary is PG-13, allowing budding horror fans to get in on the freaky fun.  Written by a quartet of scribes — Greg Erb, Bryce McGuire, Jason Oremland, and director Jeff Wadlow — the plot line to Imaginary is a bit convoluted. Sure, at its creepy core, it's the tale of a girl and the teddy bear who might just kill her. But the framing has flourishes, maybe too many.  DeWanda Wise, who is the best part of bad movies Poolman and Jurassic World Dominion, stars as Jessica, a celebrated childrens' book author tackling a new challenge: stepmom. Moving into her childhood home with her husband, Max (Tom Payne), his surly teen daughter, Taylor (Taegen Burns), and his sugary youngest, Alice (Pyper Braun), Wise has the chance to be the mother she never had. But she must also face the dark secrets of a past she's long forgotten. (Also, she'll deal with her musician husband going on tour, her elderly father suffering from some form of dementia, a nosy neighbor, and finding inspiration for her next book.) All of those threads will tie back to Alice's new imaginary friend, Chauncey Bear, who loves scavenger hunts, is always hungry, and demands obedience. As Jessica begins to realize something is definitely wrong in her home not-so-sweet home, she must bond with her daughters to conquer a ravenous evil.  Wadlow, who's helmed such twisted slashers as Cry Wolf, Truth or Dare, and Fantasy Island, isn't breaking new ground with Imaginary. Scare setups rely on the old classics, like an out-of-focus figure lurking in the background of a dark basement. A creepy toy appears out of nowhere and moves inexplicably. But these oldies are still goodies, executed with terrific timing. So, a bump in the night leads to our horror heroine peeking under the bed for a jolting jump scare.  Plot-wise, there are similarities with Mama, the Andy Muschietti horror treat, where a reluctant foster mom must protect two young girls from a mysterious, vicious force. But Imaginary is less haunting and more playful in its approach, inviting in younger audiences exploring their personal fear factors.  Creepy kid stuff makes its way in as Alice is influenced by Chauncey, leading to tense scenes of therapy and slight bloodshed. But much of the violence is offscreen or implied — a scream there, a pool of blood there. The PG-13 rating keeps gore at bay. Still, the creatures make this feature frightful fun.  The design of the bear is smart; it's cuddly but ratty-looking, and it's features sometimes contort slightly to suggest something sinister at play. But in nightmares and a labyrinthian climax, bigger badder beasties come out. And while a grown-up's eye might see a man in a terrific costume (perhaps with some CGI enhancements), it's still delightfully devilish. Unnatural silhouettes, gaping maws, protruding claws, and hissing warnings paired with kids' fare like a music box and a twisted scavenger hunt offer a spooky twist on playtime.  The plotline gets cluttered with characters who feel more like plot points than people. A cocky teen boy shows up to be awful, then terrified. The requisite husband is sidelined comically early, so he'll be no help to the girls or hindrance to the plot moving along. Even a creepy neighbor, played by Carrie's Betty Buckley, feels awkwardly wedged in, dampening the surprise of her third-act involvement.  Despite the clunky story, Wise and Braun ground their characters, making the movie undeniably compelling. (To her credit, Burns as the older daughter is earnest. But, saddled with lots of clichéd dialogue dripping in teen angst, her character is wincingly one-note.) Wise weaves her way through exposition dumps to create heartfelt emotion, whether Jessica is hit by a shock from her past or a crisis in her present. In scenes where she fears her own failure, the very real terror of being a parent brings chills. But Braun is the show stealer.  As Alice, Braun is chipper and cheerful, with rosy cheeks and a smile that won't be denied whatever it requests (a paintbrush? A toy? Some payback?). But — as seen in the trailers — when Chauncey talks, he talks with her voice. There, Braun spits out the kind of scary voice you might expect from a kid, low and grumbly. Enhanced with audio effects, it becomes an ungodly echo that bellows horrid things, making for a tantrum that is terrifyingly next-level.  Overall, Imaginary is overstuffed with plot points, constructing not only a story of a fractured family but also a growing lore clearly intended to spark a new franchise that can appeal to a broad demographic. And yes, the PG-13 rating means Imaginary is fairly soft for horror. Its scares are more spooky than harrowing. However, Wadlow has a solid sense of timing his tension. Wise grounds the emotional stakes, while Braun gives us a child to worry over and a monster to shiver over. So, while a bit unwieldy, Imaginary is a playfully deranged movie that's sure to be a hit at slumber parties.

"Mar 10, 2024",Imaginary comes across like a halfway decent story that another writer got a hold of and retooled into something much more stupid,NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024"," When I was a kid, I had a menagerie of imaginary friends that followed me wherever I went. We had made-up languages and customs, an entire world that just existed in my head and was acted out as a strange one-child show that surely looked like utter madness to even my parents. In short, I had a very active imagination. That imagination was my refuge in a strange childhood navigating divorced parents and mixing families. So it comes as no surprise that Jeff Wadlow’s new Blumhouse film Imaginary piqued my interest. And despite his best efforts, Wadlow’s latest shows only faint glimmers of what could have been, hiding behind a confused, trauma-obsessed plot that never quite sticks the landing. The cold open shows promise as DeWanda Wise’s Jess runs from a man covered in blood and a spider demon. She jolts awake from her nightmare in bed with her new husband Max (Tom Payne) in their small apartment. Trying to cheer her up, Max says they should just move into their new house now, a fresh start for everyone. Importantly, this is Jess’s family home, bequeathed to her after her father was placed in assisted living. This house is meant to be a beacon of hope, a new chapter not just for Jess and Max, but for his daughters Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), as well. All have undergone unspoken traumas that lurk at the surface of their subconscious, making them cautious of everything as they navigate this literal and figurative space.  Quickly, Max leaves to go on tour and Jess is left with the kids, excited for much-needed bonding time. However, things start getting weird fast with Alice’s new teddy bear Chauncey, which she found in the dank basement. Something about Chauncey is sadly endearing, an abandoned stuffed animal that’s been loved a little too hard. But when the game he tells Alice to play gets physically violent, Jess realizes there’s something very wrong with her old house. But only with the help of her old babysitter Gloria (Betty Buckley) and the girls can she unlock her past and traverse the Never Ever.  For a Blumhouse release, Imaginary is a surprisingly matriarchal film where several generations of women work together and form a sort of micro society when it comes to battling the supernatural. This isn’t investigated that deeply, though, outside of following Jess’s own journey navigating her new role as a mother. Wise throws herself into the role and really pulls what she can from a script full of stiff dialogue that never quite conveys enough warmth to feel authentic.  Sloppy writing aside, one of the film’s biggest strengths is its dedication to practical effects. When the monsters grace the screen, it’s genuinely exciting to see their haunting forms scitter across the screen. Even Chauncey as the sweet teddy bear is perfectly designed to seem innocent yet uncanny. He’s not as obviously scary as Annabelle or Chucky, but that’s the power of Chauncey. He has the potential to be the next big cutesy horror villain. He just needs a stronger story. Always glued to Chauncey’s side is Braun in a truly impressive performance. As a new actor, she taps into an incredible emotional range that elevates her character from creepy child to empathetic kid. It’s refreshing to see a kid have such depth and be more than an object to convey fear.  Perhaps a sequel that leans more into fun and practical effects will elevate Chauncey to the next level. There’s a nugget of an interesting idea here, especially when it comes to the fantastical creature and world design. But the fun is concealed by a massive curtain of confused lore and murky trauma that misses the mark in creating a thoughtful commentary of the power of imagination. Chauncey needs to be a campy creature that speaks to the more dastardly sides of imagination, rather than a shallow commentary on healing. Justice for Chauncey!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024",It&#8217;s weighed down by murky cinematography&#44; jumbled editing&#44; and the kind of screenplay where characters constantly just say whatever&#8217;s on their mind&#44; no matter how inappropriate their timing is&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," Let’s get this out of the way up top: Imaginary is pretty bad. It’s full of nonsensical line readings, characters with inexplicable motivations, characters who over-explain their motivations, jump scares that barely count as startles, and some of the most obvious foreshadowing I’ve seen since a character looked at the wall while talking about their son who’s “still with us” at the beginning of creepy-doll movie The Boy. After the twist is revealed, though, there’s still a significant chunk of the movie left. Imaginary goes completely and gleefully off the rails, taking a hard left turn into some delightfully imaginative stupidity. What begins as boring and predictable becomes something far sillier, and there are lots of pleasures to be found in this movie’s third act… for those willing to wait for them.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," Take a bit of “Insidious,” a dash of “Annabelle Comes Home” with a heaping spoonful of “Pinocchio’s Revenge” and you get what is another dull genre installment from Blumhouse Pictures. Once the beaming genre studio, Blumhouse seems to be contractually obligated to release at least two horror movies a year, no matter what, and “Imaginary” feels like more of an obligation than anything. It’s a convoluted, and often dull movie that seems to really want to be a cerebral tale about PTSD and mental illness. But mid-way you can sense the producers intervene when the narrative suddenly veers off in to a more commercial dark pseudo-Gaiman horror fantasy involving magical beings, and a weird dimension for imaginary creatures. Jessica, along with her husband and stepchildren Taylor and Alice, relocate from their hectic New Orleans apartment to Jessica’s childhood home in the suburbs. Typical growing pains and adjusting to a new town are compounded by dark family histories. Then Alice finds a cute teddy bear named Chauncey in the basement, which will force Jessica to confront painful memories when Alice starts behaving strangely. “Imaginary” is never quite sure what it wants to be from the very opening. The film ventures deeps in to idea that this entire fiasco involving this spooky bear and protagonist Alice is more about mental illness than anything else. A movie about the horror of mental illness would have and could have worked as we’ve seen with films like “Smile,” but mid-way the writers just seem to cop out by adhering to the more obvious direction that’s more commercially appealing, instead. It’s just that the more Chauncey is explained, the less we know about him, and the script arouses so many questions that are never quite clarified. Are there other monsters out there like Chauncey? Who or what invented that nether realm? Why do the rules need to be adhered to? The script dodges so many genuine opportunities at character building in favor of cheap flat attempts at jump scares. Any and all attempts at mounting jolts fail and feel absolutely silly. The only time the movie feels genuine is when Alice is taken to a therapist and engages in an inner dialogue with Chauncey. This is where the movie really seems to indicate it’s headed for more intelligent and complex ideas about perhaps menta illness being hereditary and Alice’s whole confronting of her new domestic situation. But the movie just cops out in favor of more goofy jolts, and then dives right in to the whole dark fantasy realm that feels painfully shoe horned in to the final half. To their credit, DeWanda Wise, Taegen Burns, and Pyper Braun are the heart of the film and offer strong turns. They’re just sadly wasted in such a dull missed opportunity.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," “Imaginary” is the newest chapter of the Blumhouse lineup, directed by “Truth or Dare” producer Jeff Wadlow. Blumhouse has a hit-or-miss roster, and “Imaginary” feels like another chapter in the list of filler films. It suffers from the plague of overly convoluted plots that are executed by overly simplistic means: flat expositional dialogue, car commercial visual style, and a seemingly first draft creative concept that never irons out the wrinkles.  Jessica (DeWanda Wise) is a children’s book author and illustrator who is working to form bonds with her stepdaughters, the angry and angsty teen, Taylor (Taegen Burns), and the younger, more open, Alice (Pyper Braun). When Jessica and her husband, Max (Tom Payne), move the family into her childhood home, Alice latches on to an imaginary friend, Chauncey, that exacerbates the already fragile domestic situation and awakens dormant memories from Jessica’s past. What seems like an innocuous childhood rite of passage becomes more sinister as Alice’s bear demands increasingly alarming actions from Alice to prove their “friendship” before he takes her on “a trip.” Within the domestic drama of Jessica’s feelings of displacement in the family unit is a secondary plot line that hints at out-of-focus childhood traumas and a fractured relationship with her father. Jessica’s escape is her imagination, the creation of her children’s books. Likewise, Taylor and Alice’s mother is committed due to mental health struggles and as Alice looks to find her footing, her imagination opens the door to Chauncey’s influence. While the psychic tether between Alice and Jessica becomes more clear throughout the film, the rest of the story diverges onto a path of confoundment, introducing new laws, worldbuilding, and histories that throw the previous narrative into oblivion.  When an old neighbor and Jessica’s childhood babysitter, Gloria (Betty Buckley), comes into the picture, “Imaginary” teeters off the thin ledge of horror and into very shallow waters of mythic science fiction. Gone are the conventions of a possessed bear/spirit/demon, and in is a “Coraline”-style hidden door that leads to a labyrinthine underworld of imagination inhabited by long lost children stolen by bug-eyed imaginary friends. It’s a CG landscape somewhere between “The Haunted Mansion” and “Thirteen Ghosts” but without the fun levity of either.  While it desires itself to be a horror film, what ensues over the course of its runtime feels more like a confused study of tropes that never pay off. For its genre aspirations, “Imaginary” has a pointed lack of scares and gore, relying more on the mere idea of what its concept could be rather than what the film actually is. There’s no carnage candy or heart pounding suspense to relieve the film from its droning pace, and instead it gets caught in a cycle of disappointments as the suggestion of bloodshed or tension fizzles into yet another fake-out. The script, written by Wadlow, Jason Oremland, and Greg Erb is painfully plain, doing no favors to equally vapid performances by the cast. Every line is incredibly obvious and unnatural, uttered only to progress a theme or provide context to the next scene. “Imaginary” never seems dug into the facets of its potential. It could’ve been a campy blood-soaked version of “Ted,” or an absurd self-aware horror-comedy like “M3gan” or “Child’s Play,” but instead it floats somewhere else in the ether, detached from any feelings of intention or thoughtfulness. It doesn’t need to be a carbon copy of any of its somewhat similar predecessors, but what it neglects is the identity that the other movies possess. “Imaginary” is utterly forgettable, bland, and directionless, ironically so, as for a film that lauds the power of imagination, it shockingly neglects the very element of its own ethos.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," Imaginary is Blumhouse through-and-through. Once in a
while, Jason Blum’s template results in an honest-to-god inventive horror
experience but, more often than not, his cheaply-made, throw-way films belong
buried six feet under with the various killers, creeps, ghosts, and demons that
populate them. Imaginary has all the requisite hallmarks: a cast of unknowns,
a screenplay that feels half-finished, a familiar director, a small budget, and
a teen-friendly PG-13 rating. To be fair, Imaginary tries to be a little
different, playing with warped perceptions of reality, but the need to include
too many horror tropes results in a confused (and at times confusing)
storyline. (The trailer also sells a different movie but that’s the fault of the
marketing department, not the filmmakers.) The movie opens by introducing the main character, Jessica
(DeWanda Wise), who has decided to move back to her childhood house with her
new family: husband Max (Tom Payne), teenage step-daughter Taylor (Taegen
Burns), and 8-year old stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun). While rooting through boxes
in disused parts of the house, Alice discovers Jessica’s teddy-bear, Chauncey. An
immediate bond forms between Alice and her imaginary friend. Initially, Jessica
sees this as a positive development and focuses her attention on becoming more
of a mother-figure to Taylor, who is in a rebellious phase. But Chauncey is no
benign inanimate object and Alice’s fixation on accompanying the supernatural
entity to some “never ever” place, alarms Jessica – especially since it echoes
aspects of her own dimly-remembered childhood. The gap between what Imaginary wants to be and what
it achieves is vast. Director Jeff Wadlow may have had grand ideas for the
production, but what reaches the screen is a collage of partially realized
ideas – some good, some bad – that are undermined by plastic acting, wooden
dialogue, and an embarrassment of an ending. Allusions to A Nightmare on Elm Street (and other, better movies that play with the boundaries between
imagination/fantasy and reality) are intentional but feel almost insulting by
their inclusion.  The child-in-danger trope is commonplace in modern horror
but it needs to be approached with care. In this case, it’s more disturbing
than effective in large part because the screenplay only plays at having
empathy with Alice. A scene in which she nearly impales her hand on a rusty
nail may cause some viewers distress – just ask a parent of any young child not
to be repulsed. In terms of the more conventional horror aspects, even though
the monster is given the Jaws treatment (kept mostly in the shadows and rarely
fully shown), its cheesiness is inescapable, hearkening back to the
man-in-a-rubber-suit era.  This is Wadlow’s third outing for Blumhouse. Although a
terrible film, it’s the best of the three – the others were one-star stinkers: Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island. Wadlow’s love of PG-13 horror is part of
the problem – all his movies represented R-rated material ruthlessly neutered
to make them available to younger viewers. For Blum, this is just another in a
seemingly-endless stream of titles. It doesn’t need to do more than break even
(a low bar considering the minimal production costs) and, given the current horror
zeitgeist, it will likely achieve that level of success. Business
considerations aside, however, there’s nothing imaginary about how bad a
misfire this movie is even for the Blumhouse base.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," Dune: Part One was my favourite film of 2021. I was captivated by its visuals, its scope, its scale and the depth of its story. As someone who has not read Frank Herbert's seminal novel, I was not sure what to expect but the results blew me away. Now, three years later is the follow-up, or more succinctly, Part Two of the story. Director Denis Villeneuve has over the last few years firmly established himself as Hollywood's premier visual director delivering epic sci-fi films such as the aforementioned Dune, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival, and Dune: Part Two continues this trend with a grandeur that is nothing short of breathtaking. Somehow, Part Two manages to up the ante in every aspect, including performances, to deliver an unforgettable experience. In all honesty, I did not watch Dune: Part Two, I experienced it. From the beautiful majesty of its visuals to the awe-inspiring sound design and the fantastic production design, this film was an absolute joy to behold. The story this time around focuses on larger and deeper thematic strands, continuing the story of Part One and taking it to new and exciting (and also dark) places as we continue following our lead Paul Atreides, played with confident steel by Timothée Chalamet. The full, star-studded cast has a part to play and they play it with such enthusiasm and confidence, especially Zendaya as the warrior Chani, who is given far more to do this time around, and Austin Butler in an unrecognisable and memorable turn as the villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Though Villeneuve is absolutely a visual director, there are plenty of smaller character moments that pay off handsomely by the end of the movie. Though it could be argued that the final twenty minutes of the movie were rushed, and I can't disagree, the finale felt like a more than satisfying conclusion to this movie story and a tantalising follow-up to the next film in the saga, Dune Messiah. Without spoiling anything in this film, the messiah aspect of the third instalment will be key as Part Two deals with a messianic revolution bumping up against more grounded (see: less religious) principles and ideas, and the ramifications of every related decision which will prove significant going forward. Dune: Part Two is a thrilling, exciting, heavy, and intelligent science fiction film that should be celebrated for years to come. It will be hard for any other film this year to top the majesty, scale, and epicness of Dune: Part Two, and, yes, this could potentially become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made if Dune Messiah sticks its landing. Time will tell, but whatever the outcome, Dune: Part Two is a film that deserves to be remembered and lauded. Blumhouse's terrible recent output has included Night Swim and Five Nights at Freddy's (and many would happily include The Exorcist: Believer into the mix), and, cutting to the chase, Imaginary can be added to the list. In fact, Imaginary tops the list of Blumhouse's failures as this is simply a dreadful film. Imaginary is the type of bland, banal, uninspired and lazy horror film that is becoming common in the genre as a way of gaining a quick buck for minor output - but this could be a new low. How this received a 15 rating in the UK from the BBFC is beyond me as nothing happens. Literally. Chauncey - the bear in the marketing - does nothing, one person dies off-screen, and there are a few hokey jumpscares, but, other than that, it's a poorly acted slog about a new family wading through generic drama as Alice (Braun), the weird young kid, bonds and speaks to a teddy bear for about an hour. It then becomes a cheap-looking attempt to capture the magic of older, better horror flicks with a crazed, abysmal Betty Buckley gurning and shouting for the camera. In an attempt to...get Chauncey the bear over (?), they namecheck him so many times that it becomes a parody and they provide him with a warped version of Alice's voice which was nothing short of hilarious (a mid-movie therapy session provided a good belly laugh due to this). I felt for DeWanda Wise here as she tries, she really tries, to sell what she is asked to do and she is a likeable presence in the film as the stepmother who just wants to bond with her new family, but nothing is saving this. Not even Tom Payne's middle-class English rockstar (who plays the world's most oblivious father before he departs the entire movie to go on tour) adds anything. How this narrative ended the way it did is mind-boggling - who in their right mind would conjure this up and look proudly at it, smiling like a new parent, and declare it fit for humans to endure? Hopefully, Blumhouse can get back on track this year, though their next scheduled release is a remake of the excellent Speak No Evil so who knows what they'll do with that? Imaginary may work as a gateway horror, but even then it could traumatise people who then move on to stronger horror like Madame Web. There is nothing redeemable about this, and it's one of the worst horror films I've seen in years. I'm left imagining the utopia I lived in before seeing Imaginary, as it was an infinitely better time. Move over Valek, there’s a new nun in town. Sydney Sweeney’s Sister Cecilia is the latest ass-kicking agent of God ready to throw down with the worst that Hell can offer. Actually, no she isn’t. Michael Mohan’s Immaculate is a religious horror that is not in keeping with recent offerings, such as The Nun films and Prey for the Devil, in that our lead is not fighting demons or the possessed.  Instead, she is dealing with a miracle - an immaculate conception - following her transfer from her closed parish in the States to a secluded convent in picturesque Italy -and as the story progresses, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems in the sprawling, echo-filled convent lit mainly by candles and atmosphere. Immaculate is a solid slow-burn horror until it takes a turn in the final fifteen minutes where it leans fully into its gonzo nature, channelling the New French Extremity subgenre of years past and delivering a finale that feels bolder than most in recent years. Sydney Sweeney continues her recent dabbling in different genres and delivers a strong overall performance despite an admittedly rocky opening act, leading to an all-in virtuoso final one-take sequence. It should be said that, narratively, Immaculate isn’t necessarily providing anything original, however, its dedication to atmosphere, scares and impressive gore keeps this entertaining for the entirety of its brisk runtime. That was my main takeaway from the film, for a story dealing with heavy subjects and imagery, I found myself simply enjoying what I was watching. The filmmakers were able to move between moods deftly and I never felt an imbalance in tone - though I do believe an extra ten minutes (or so) in the final third would have eased its slightly frantic feel, or maybe the chaotic nature was just what the film needed to end on. Either way, Immaculate was an unexpected curveball given the major recent genre and subgenre outputs. Effectively crafted with an unnerving score from Will Bates, it felt bold at times, and patient at others leading to its gonzo finale. Sweeney is impressive here, and, though it may not be perfect, it was nuntheless a lot of fun - surprisingly, too. For the majority of my life, bustin’ has made me feel good. Great, in fact. I’ve been a fan of Ghostbusters since I was a kid way back when, and it has been so good to see the franchise back on the big screen again following 2016’s Answer the Call and 2021’s wonderful Afterlife. While 1984’s original classic was a snarky satire on small businesses and the supernatural horror genre, that hasn’t stopped Sony from expanding on its humble roots. Now, in 2024, we have Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Directed by Gil Kenan, this is the first film in the main continuity not directed by a Reitman - though Jason remains on board as a writer - and finds the whole gang from Afterlife, OGs included, back in New York City to bust a chilly ancient villain, Garakka, who is hellbent on claiming the city (and the world) as his frozen empire. The trailers promised something bigger than before and Frozen Empire is certainly bigger, but unfortunately, it is not better. It is absolutely an enjoyable romp, but one that is overstuffed and a world away from 1984’s original in terms of tone, vibe, and attempts at a grounded feel (yes, ghosts, walking statues and marshmallow men exist, hear me out). Where that film, and Ghostbusters II, succeeded was in keeping things focused on our crew, the schlubs who were just like us, but everyone involved worked with the tools they had - Frozen Empire takes wild detours that explicitly bring the supernatural to the human characters, and it is to the detriment of the story. The story itself is bursting at the seams from the beginning, with too many characters and too much happening. There are new villains, old characters, a focus on Phoebe's emotional arc, a new ghost-busting laboratory, and much more. As a result of trying to give every member of the cast something to work with, no character has a chance to stand out fully, and the story suffers. The characters and performances are all fine enough, Grace is again very good as Phoebe - though her main subplot (featuring a solid Lind) was horribly disappointing - and Rudd, Aykroyd, and Nanjiani provide strong supporting performances but the sheer volume of characters means no one has a chance to stand out fully. Murray, Oswalt, Hudson, Kim, Coon - all get fun moments but it becomes a mess by the time the big Marvel-esque showdown arrives complete with a fully CGI villain. Gozer and Vigo worked so well because they were played by actors on set, they felt authentic, but here the fear factor was lost despite Garakka’s great visual look. Now, there were plenty of great gags and quips throughout - Murray and Nanjiani were having a blast - alongside some fun scenes of bustin’ ghosts (including some cool new ghosts) and smaller character moments, so Frozen Empire isn’t a flop or a write-off. Far from it, it is very watchable and enjoyable but it is unfocused. The franchise seems geared firmly towards families now as its key demographic, which is fine as my daughter loved it, and this felt like the true start of passing the torch along. The supernatural horror parody is gone, and the snarky satire of politics and upstart business is gone, replaced by a direction that feels more blockbuster-focused. Kenan and co. aimed for something different, a risk which should be commended, but it didn’t entirely work leaving Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire as a fun but highly flawed effort.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024"," Imaginary tells the story of Jessica (DeWanda Wise), an acclaimed author who returns to her childhood home amidst recurring nightmares that may reflect her past and her burgeoning imagination. She moves back with her husband/singer, Max (Tom Payne), and their two step‑daughters, angsty Taylor (Taegan Burns) and the spritely Alice (Pyper Braun). Both girls are estranged to Jessica due to their mother who was taken to the mental institution. While Jessica tries bonding with her step-daughters, Alice grows increasingly attached to her childhood teddy bear, Chauncey. The stronger the attachment, the more concerned Jessica is about Alice. Jessica realises it may have something to do with Chauncey, that nilly-willy silly old bear. Imaginary is director Jeff Wadlow’s latest film. He is best known for genre pieces that specialise in the horror genre and a few diversions into action and comedy. While he may seem like a versatile filmmaker, it is unfortunate his films have not been warmly received. Within his snug home at the Blumhouse studio, he developed two other films, Truth or Dare (Date) and Fantasy Island (Date), which both inherited horrible reviews. Will Wadlow’s Imaginary prove three times lucky? Imaginary may lack imagination in its storytelling, but at least it knows its lane. It remains unpretentious even when delving into themes of trauma, grief, and loss. The film aims to deliver scares, fun, and even a dash of whimsy. Its commercial ambitions ensure it is a watchable effort. It is also nowhere near as incoherent as Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island. Its narrative remains straightforward, and it spends very little time on unnecessary diversions or subplots. The straightforward approach also applies to the acting, which fares from good to fine. Wise fares best as Jessica. She manages to be endearing and convincingly distraught as she juggles family strife, the demands of her work, and of course, saving her family from the horrors of the imagination. Braun manages to balance precociousness and emotional intelligence quite well while Burns is quite amusing with her cynicism despite her character being written as annoyingly contrived. Speaking of contrivances, Imaginary’s horror elements are cobbled from superior horror films and fantasy flicks. For example, there are elements of The Pit (1981), such as the bear telling her what to do by “speaking” with a child’s voice. Meanwhile, the imaginary settings and monsters look remarkably similar to those in Beetlejuice (1988) and Monsters Inc. (2001). Inside Out (2015) is also mentioned many times and Insidious (2010) is echoed. The latter is derivative of Poltergeist (1982), as it ventures into eerie fantasy worlds. One cannot help but feel it would be better to watch these films instead. Having a derivative storyline is not a deal-breaker. The conventional use of innocuous, wholesome imagery in horror is also amusing. For example, the bear’s progression from protector to instigator and eventually perpetrator is highly effective. However, Wadlow and his screenwriters, Greg Erb and Jason Oremland (who both specialise in family films, including The Princess and the Frog, 2009), lack ambition and resort to tired tropes and cliches. One is obvious enough it spells out the film’s title and another is so blatant the film references it through its mentions of the animated film Inside Out (and its characters) ad nauseum. Worst of all is the use of the character of Jessica’s babysitter, played by Betty Buckley. Buckley is certainly no stranger to horror thanks to her recent appearances in M. Night Shyamalan films and the horror classic Carrie (1976). Her presence is always welcome. However, her character’s presence in the narrative is a huge signpost that it makes her screentime feel laboured (and unintentionally funny in how she pops up) and the payoff feel meaningless as to her motives. While it may sound like faint praise, Imaginary is the best film Wadlow has made within in the Blumhouse studio. It displays a keener sense of filmmaking confidence, a more assured handling of tone that switches between horror and comedy, and sharper editing that negates the prevalent throwaway feel that plagued Wadlow’s early work. Regretfully after all the positives, Imaginary succumbs to blatantly derivative, woefully predictable storytelling, and, with a sense of irony, a lack of imagination. Summary: This is the best film Wadlow has made within in the Blumhouse studio. However, it still succumbs to predictable storytelling, and, with a sense of irony, a lack of imagination.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 9, 2024"," Imagine a live-action version of “Coraline” with special effects purchased at the Spirit Halloween store and dialogue so nutty that Blumhouse has outdone themselves by delivering a horror film that is worse than “The Exorcist: Believer” and “Night Swim.” Those films aren’t mentioned in the “Imaginary” trailer, instead, the studio drags “M3GAN” through the mud to promote the evil teddy bear tale that accuses its 8-year-old protagonist of being a ventriloquist. Directed by Jeff Wadlow (“Truth or Dare”) who cowrote the screenplay with Greg Erb and Jason Oremland, “Imaginary” begins on a creepy note then quickly descends into an ABC After School Special about kids adjusting to a new stepmom, in this case, Jessica played by DeWanda Wise (Netflix’s “She’s Gotta Have It”) who marries Max (Tom Payne), a musician and father to teenage daughter Taylor (Taegen Burns) and her younger sister Alice (Pyper Braun). The girls’ mother remains institutionalized after abusing Alice.  When the family moves into Jessica’s childhood home, Alice discovers an old Teddy bear in the basement she names Chauncey. Soon the stuffed toy begins telling Alice to do things like go on a scavenger hunt and stay away from Jessica, “Chauncey says you’re not allowed to play with us because you left him.” The remark goes over Jessica’s head. With Max out of the picture (he’s left to go on tour), she’s too busy working on a new children’s novel and keeping an eye on Taylor who is the typical bratty teen. Jessica is both the illustrator and writer of a series of books featuring Molly Millipede and her antagonist Simon the Spider. The artwork is cool and, in the film’s opening, we discover the books were inspired by Jessica’s night terrors involving spiders. The nightmare scene looks promising but it’s the only scary part in “Imaginary” which fails to deliver any more frights. When Alice attempts to impale herself with a rusty nail (bad Chauncey!) a therapist (Verónica Falcón) visits the house to speak with her, “Does that seem like a game a good friend would want to play?” This leads to the little girl screaming “Maybe we shouldn’t be friends!” to Chauncey while bawling her eyes out and storming away. I’ve got to hand it to Pyper Braun who’s put through the ringer by holding conversations with Chauncey by herself, speaking in a gravelly voice when she’s impersonating the stuffed bear as the film becomes unintentionally campy. The dialogue in “Imaginary” is clunky and ridiculous. When the therapist asks Jessica if her 8-year-old stepdaughter has taken up ventriloquism, it signifies the film has officially gone off the rails. Then, Tony-winning actress Betty Buckley (“Eight is Enough” and 1976’s “Carrie”) shows up as Jessica’s elderly neighbor from her childhood who has spent the last few decades becoming an expert on children being influenced by evil entities aka imaginary friends. Think of her as a wacky version of Lin Shaye’s Elise Rainier from “Insidious” as she helps Jessica rescue Alice from a realm called the “Never Ever” which resembles a funhouse version of “The Further.” I have always been a proponent of practical effects but in this case, they look so bad that I’m inclined to think that Wadlow went shopping at the Spirit Halloween store where he got a good deal on bug eyes and a bear costume. “Imaginary” tries to get imaginative in the finale as it attempts to morph into a live-action “Coraline” but fails as the story gets entangled in a web of implausibility leaving the viewer confused while wondering what just happened.

"Mar 9, 2024","  Blumhouse Productions -- the studio that has become synonymous with franchises such as Paranormal Activity, Insidious, David Gordon Green's Halloween trilogy, and one-off projects like Damien Chazelle's Whiplash and Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman -- has often padded its output with lower-budget horror fare that requires looking at IMDb to make heads or tails of what's what. For every potential franchise or awards nominee, some films beguile and baffle in equal measure, dollar-bin movies requiring a savvy spelunker to find the real treasures. For all of their interchangeable homogeneity, these smaller projects can still and often offer the stumbled-upon detail that sticks to the ribs.   Jeff Wadlow's Imaginary is the latest theatrical release to bear the Blumhouse name in partnership with Lionsgate. Its box office success will likely dictate potential offshoots, of which there is a prerequisite ass-covering in the film's finale should there be more in the ImaginaryVerse. As for the movie's rib-sticking qualities, only time will tell if it has enough traction among viewers to outlive its theatrical release. However, I believe we have a cult classic in the making, something to be embraced with cocktails and friends or, for the younger crowd, a bowl of popcorn and slumber party attire.   Imaginary takes us to a world not unlike our own. We're introduced to Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a children's book writer/artist who has a bit of a problem on her hands beyond her absolutely abysmal artwork: the older of her two stepdaughters, Taylor (Taegen Burns), doesn't respect her father's decision to remarry. Still holding out hope for her mother's rehabilitation, Taylor resents the fact that her father has moved on with his life and even moved into Jessica's childhood home. On the other hand, Jessica's younger stepdaughter, Alice (Pyper Braun), is at that malleable young age where her impressions are subject to change at a moment's notice, and it doesn't take much to distract her. The latest headlong obsession is Jessica's childhood teddy bear, Chauncey, whom Alice finds during a basement excursion, to whom she takes an immediate shine. Boy, are we in for it.   Soon enough, Alice has tea parties and absorbing conversations with Chauncey -- odd for an inanimate object to be the source of such great repartee, yet here we are. Besides the first scene detailing Jessica's last time playing with Chauncey, the audience already knows something else is at work beyond the real-world reasons why a child would have an imaginary friend. However, for Jessica, Taylor, and Jessica's husband, Max (Tom Payne), Alice is just a kid, being a kid and doing kid things, and sometimes that means playing games with a stuffed animal. Where are her friends? Before long, Alice is off on a seemingly benign scavenger hunt, collecting objects at Chauncey's behest. It's only a matter of time before the screw turns.   The movie's premise, which is simple enough, is the fecund setup of horror, of which an endless array of films have found room to invent, homage, reinvent, and appropriate wholesale. Alice, the young girl who provides the movie's unintentional menace, engages in familiar activities that horror fans, especially those of the Blumhouse strain, will appreciate. There's an ominously self-bouncing ball, a bit of ominous hide-and-seek, and a music machine with an absurdly long string attached that teases passersby to trace its source. Rote though they may be, these are some of the tried-and-true staples of horror -- the latticework that provides any director the opportunity to bring something new to the table.   Wadlow, along with the relatively fresh-faced cast, brings something more uncannily off-putting than even the most gratuitous jump-scares: awkwardness. Imaginary has the impressive ability to turn even the most mundane conversations into something that strikes aslant, placing us, the viewers, on unsteady terrain. Led by DeWanda Wise, who brings full-bodied conviction to the role, the characters walk, talk, and act like they're in a soap opera soaked in portent. Each conversation treats a casual comment like a grand reveal, and when a twist is finally revealed, it's so bafflingly telegraphed that it lands like a fart in church.   The other actors who imbue the world with odd nuances include Tom Payne, the father of the two girls, who, before the movie really takes off, puts on about eight different bracelets and a fedora and abandons the family to go on ""tour."" In the few scenes in which he does appear, he serves as the unflappably cool dad whose tattoos illustrate that he knows that kids, especially those whose mothers are ""sick,"" will eventually outgrow their imaginary friends. Then there's the older daughter, Taylor, who catches the eye of the pill-popping neighbor, Liam (Matthew Sato), a dude-bro who just wants to hang out, fool around, and raid the liquor cabinet. Somewhere, under a pile of papers, is a hand-written memo that urges filmmakers to stop giving any screen time to teenagers.   Other more interesting characters figure into the narrative. There's Jessica's father, Ben (Samuel Salary), who is spending his days in an assisted living facility, where, on his bedside table, a stack of Jessica's children's books sits unread. The reason for Ben's indefinite stay is due to the previous Chauncey encounter, in which he was both blinded and driven to the very threshold of what the human mind can handle.   And then, somewhere along the way, we're introduced to one of the best horror side characters to come along since Winnie the Pooh: Blood & Honey's Piglet -- a character who horny teen Liam describes as ""old bag Patterson."" Portrayed by Betty Buckley, Gloria Patterson is the garrulous busybody who offers unsolicited insight into the troubles befalling Jessica's family. Formerly Jessica's babysitter back in the day, Gloria is a stand-in for writerly explication and an exuberantly weird maker of small talk. Each line she utters like a prophecy foretold, and each lingering pause lasts long enough to start wondering if you've left the oven on. Suffice it to say, these interactions, along with the other conversational combinations, are the stuff of a surprisingly invigorating moviegoing experience.   When we eventually get to the sordid business of Chauncey's true purpose and all that it entails, Imaginary has taken us on a whirlwind tour through just about every genre imaginable. By just about any measure, save for the impulse that draws one inexorably toward the uncanny, Imaginary isn't great, but who really cares? If any movie were to justify a stringer that zoomed out into the universe toward a supernatural being who revealed itself as the puppetmaster, the cast its mere playthings, then Imaginary would be a prime candidate.   In the age of ""elevated"" horror dominated by studios like A24 and Neon, too many scares hinge upon gory one-upmanship and an invariably somber grand finale that almost always points to a purgatorial non-ending for the main character. Imaginary, for all that it pinches from IT, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Conjuring, and just about every other horror film that preceded it, is still something that -- arguably unintentionally -- has a fascinating texture to the scenes in-between the cheap thrills. Sure, plenty will perceive this clunky movie as a failure, and plenty more will dogpile on just by needing something to do for an hour, but Imaginary's faults are its greatest recommendation.   Nowadays, you can reserve your seat at a movie theater and be served a three-course meal abutted by copious amounts of drinks. To that, you should absolutely make an event out of seeing Imaginary. Go with a friend -- heck, even ask a stranger on the street to accompany you. For 104 minutes, you can gorge and lose yourself in a realm that isn't entirely unlike ours -- a liminal space in which Rod Serling would have a field day. If you approach Imaginary appropriately, headlong, and without reserve, you'll be treated to otherworldly pleasures.  A woman returns to her childhood home to discover that the imaginary friend she left behind is very real and unhappy that she abandoned him.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Culture Representation: Taking place in New Orleans, the horror film “Imaginary” features a predominantly white cast of characters (with a few African Americans and Latin people) representing the working-class and middle-class. Culture Clash: A children’s book author/illustrator with a traumatic past moves back into her childhood home, where one of her underage stepdaughters finds a mysterious teddy bear, makes it her imaginary friend, and unwittingly unleashes terror in the house.  “Imaginary” could’ve been a campy horror classic about a menacing toy that unleashes terror. But this idiotic junk goes downhill quickly and becomes a boring mess with tacky-looking monsters. For a movie that uses the characters’ imagination as a crucial part of its plot, “Imaginary” lacks imagination for that plot, which becomes worse as the movie stumbles along to its very weak ending. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, “Imaginary” was co-written by Wadlow, Greg Erb and Jason Oremland. The movie takes place and was filmed in New Orleans, but everything is so generic-looking about the locations in the movie, it really could’ve been filmed in many other cities, and it wouldn’t have made a difference to the story. “Imaginary” starts off as a basic horror movie, but the plot and dialogue get increasingly stupid, to the point where viewers will either laugh or get angry (or do both) at all the ridiculousness. “Imaginary” begins by showing children’s book author/illustrator Jessica (played by Wanda DeWise) bursting through a minature door in the wall of the house. She looks terrified and says, “I’m sorry we couldn’t finish our game.” She’s soon grabbed by a large, burly man who has blood on him and whose eyes are all white from damage or because he’s possessed. He mumbles something about being afraid that Jessica is never coming back. It’s later revealed that the man chasing Jessica is her father Ben Barnes (played by Samuel Salary), who is a widower. But surprise! This scene is nothing but a nightmare experienced by Jessica, who has been having several nightmares lately about her past. Jessica is newly married to a British-born musician named Max (played by Tom Payne), who has full custody of his two daughters from his previous marriage: 15-year-old sulky Taylor (played by Taegen Burns) and playful Alice (played by Pyper Braun), who’s about 7 or 8 years old. Taylor doesn’t like Jessica very much, while Alice is much more accepting and friendlier to stepmother Jessica. Jessica’s father Ben is currently at an assisted living community called Azalea Acres. Jessica’s childhood home is currently vacant. And so, Jessica and Taylor decide that they will get a fresh start by moving the family from their small apartment into this house. And you know what that means in a horror movie where someone in the house is having nightmares about her past. It doesn’t take long for Alice to find a teddy bear in the basement. She names the bear Chauncey. This toy bear becomes Alice’s constant companion and her imaginary friend. Jessica and Max often hear Alice talking to Chauncey, with the bear talking back in a voice that sounds a lot like Alice’s voice. Jessica and Max think all of this is adorable. The family has a nosy neighbor named Gloria (played by Betty Buckley), who likes to lurk outside to see what’s going on in the house. When Jessica introduces herself to Gloria, Jessca is surprised when Gloria says that she used to be Jessica’s babysitter when Jessica lived in the house as a child. Jessica doesn’t remember Gloria at all. Jessica also doesn’t remember that she had a teddy bear that looked exactly like Chauncey. “Imaginary” has several flashbacks to Jessica’s childhood, with Rhythm Hurd in the role of Jessica as a 5-year-old girl. The story of Jessica’s past is eventually revealed in bits and pieces. There are clues, such as the illustrations she used to draw on the house wall as a child. The phrase “never ever” is also repeated in the movie because it has a certain meaning. Jessica has had a turbulent relationship with her father, who had a mental breakdown shortly after Jessica’s mother died when Jessica was 5 years old. Jessica has a burn scar on her arm from an incident in her childhood where her father was accused of attacking her. Ben lost custody of Jessica, and she was raised by her grandmother. Alice also has a burn scar on her arm. It was caused by her mother Samantha Dooley (played by Alix Angelis), who is currently in a lockdown facility for mental health and addiction issues. Samantha appears in the movie for some cheap jump scares. Although Max doesn’t really talk about what happened in the marriage, its implied that the problems with Samantha are what caused their divorce. Samantha and Max got divorced long before he and Jessica got involved with each other. It should come as no surprise that there’s something very sinister about Chauncey, as people who are in the house eventually find out. One of them is a drug-using teenage neighbor named Liam (played by Matthew Sato), who has an immediate, mutual attraction to Taylor. Jessica has a rule that Taylor and Alice can’t let strangers into the house when Jessica and Max aren’t there, but Taylor breaks this rule to have Liam over for a visit when Max is away on tour and Jessica leaves the house for a few hours. Chauncey is quite the demanding companion. Alice insists that when she is served meals, Chauncey should get a serving too, because Chauncey is always “hungry.” Alice says that Chauncey also gave her a list of things that Alice must find on a scavenger hunt. Alice carries the list with her, but she tells Jessica that what’s on the list is a secret.  Alice later tells Taylor: “Don’t tell Dad or Jess, but Chauncey will take me to a special place after I finish my list.” One of the things that Jessica knows is on the list is “something happy,” which Alice requests from Jessica, who gives her a small blue rubber ball that Jessica paints with a smiley face. Later, Jessica finds the list and sees other items that need to be found include something that burns, a bowl and a paintbrush. Alice’s attachment to Chauncey becomes alarming enough for her to get a visit from a therapist named Dr. Soto (played by Veronica Falcón), who tells Jessica about a boy patient who had similar issues with a stuffed animal that was an imaginary friend. The boy ended up mutilating his thumb, and then he disappeared. Dr. Soto shows Jessica a video that she recorded of one of Dr. Soto’s sessions with the boy. Jessica has a book series about an insect named Molly the Millipede, whose nemesis is Simon the Spider. There are several references to Jessica’s book series in “Imaginary,” but the movie does a very poor job of making effective horror out of it. “Imaginary” has a laughable part of the movie where Jessica tells Max that Alice’s weirdness with Chauncey has helped Jessica with her writer’s block. “Imaginary” lead actress Wise puts in a committed performance as Jessica, while Braun brings a lot of enthusiasm to the role of Alice. Even with these admirable efforts, “Imaginary” still has mediocre-to-bad acting in too many parts of the film—especially near the end of the movie, which becomes an exposition dump where characters over-explain all the ludicrous things that are obvious. The movie becomes more convoluted when it doesn’t need to be. Puppets were used for some of the monsters—including the monster version of Chauncey called Bear Beast—but they look like something you would see in an amateur haunted house. There are scarier-looking costumes at any given Comic-Con. “Imaginary” has a combination of computer-generated and practical visual effects. There are some creepy images in the movie, but nothing in “Imaginary” is truly terrifying.  There’s also a fake-out ending, which is slightly better than the atrociously limp real ending, which hints at the possibility of a sequel or spinoff. The teddy bear in “Imaginary,” which has a different name for every person who owns the bear, is nowhere close to being as iconic as the toy dolls Chucky and M3GAN, which are the center of their respectively successful horrors franchises. The stuffing that’s inside a real teddy bear has more substance than what disappointing dreck such as “Imaginary” has to offer.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," How the mighty have fallen. Blumhouse Productions used to be the hip label in horror. Movies like Get Out, The Purge, Sinister, and Insidious let audiences shriek in terror while savouring something new. Yet as these successes spawned sequels or imitations, Blumhouse became too comfortable with a formula. All the movies coming out of Blumhouse these days are practically the same. They haven’t made a film worth seeing since the pre-COVID release The Invisible Man…itself a remake. (M3GAN is a great meme, but not a good movie.) Anything worthwhile carrying the labels lately is a post-premiere acquisition, like Sundance winner Nanny. But don’t let the low-price influencers with neither discerning taste nor dignity fool you: there’s no release to get excited about Blumhouse movies any more. And that’s the case with Blumhouse’s latest offering, Imaginary, which is so bad they only lifted the review embargo around the time that the first public screenings were ending on Thursday night. Imaginary, moreover, contains an ironic dearth of imagination. The movie simply cribs from the Blumhouse playbook. It’s yet another story of a wholesome family in peril after moving into a new house that features a demonic presence that threatens the kids, lives in the pool or creepy basement, tries to bring said kid to some half-assed spin on “the Sunken Place,” and includes a kooky old hag who ties the plot up with a bit of expository dialogue and dies shortly thereafter. It is, frankly, intolerable. This time, the family in peril features Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a children’s author and stepmother to Alice (Pyper Braun) and Taylor (Taegan Burns). They move into the house that Jessica grew up in after she experiences recurring nightmares. Her husband (Tom Payne) suggests she sleep somewhere comfortable and familiar, which is fine since her estranged father is being shipped off to the old folks’ home. Not long after moving home, though, Alice finds a teddy bear in the dark and creepy basement, names him Chauncey, and things start going bump in the night. Everyone in the theatre surely knows where this is going. Any element of surprise, meanwhile, dies with each narrative signposts that plays Blumhouse Mad Libs. Jessica and Alice share childhood traumas. They both have scars. They both have/had imaginary friends. Their separation from their mothers haunts them. Sure, Imaginary isn’t the first horror movie to take a rinse-and-repeat approach to the old haunted house thing, but anything that can’t be bothered to try something new at least needs to be entertaining. Unfortunately, Imaginary just proves boring. The scares aren’t there. The few kills aren’t any fun. And the effects are downright cheesy. It’s a bunch of tired jump scares. Chauncey the bear isn’t particularly intimidating, either, and his monstrous form is hardly a Cocaine Bear-style riot. Even compared to Elizabeth Banks’ B-movie, the laughs were intentional in that case. It doesn’t help, either, that Blumhouse’s house style is pretty drab aesthetically, so Imaginary looks as generic as it plays. Throw in some flat lighting, clunky pacing, predictable music, and one especially bad child performance, and it’s an all-around groaner. The only thing scary to come out of Blumhouse, really, is the quality of its recent output. It’s only a few weeks into 2024 and Imaginary easily joins Blumhouse’sNight Swim among the year’s worst titles. The house of Blum needs to slow down and do some serious quality control.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Every child has an imaginary friend.  Someone you trust and confide in when no one else seems to understand.  For some, it is a prized possession in the form of a doll or stuffed animal and like all children we grow up.  With that growth comes going away to college and moving away from those items that gave us comfort.  But, what do you think happens when we come back home only to discover that favorite imaginary friend is none too thrilled that we left them behind? Produced by Blumhouse Productions, Imaginary is one of the few horror/thriller films where the plot is totally driven by the women characters making it right on time with Women’s International Day and Women’s Month 2024. “I was raised by strong women. My mother, Emily Couric, was a Virginia State Senator and the head of the Democratic party. My aunt, former ‘Today’ show co-host and CBS news anchor Katie Couric, is an accomplished journalist. I love writing characters that evoke the women who helped shape me, ” stated Director Jeff Wadlow. Dewanda Wise inhabits the epitome of strong woman, as we have seen her in role after role show up and show out.  As Jessica,  we meet her experiencing a harrowing nightmare, while learning a shocking connection between her young stepdaughter’s new imaginary friend and own troubled childhood.  This film gives a whole new meaning to Daddy’s little girl and will have you looking at those stuffed teddy bears with an over the shoulder side-eye.
 Wise isn’t the only one exuding strength and tenacity.  Broadway legend Betty Buckley, who takes on the role of Gloria, started her career in horror with Carrie, a film that arguably launched the modern horror genre, as well as turn in M. Night Shylamalan’s “The Happening” and “Split.”  “Gloria felt such wonder through the eyes of that child, it set her on a quest,” says Buckley. “It gave Gloria a career. She thought, oh, there’s something more than this, and through her own desire to understand and connect with that other dimension, Gloria began to research spirituality, magic, and occult worlds. She realizes there’s this occult tradition of young people’s relationships to imaginary friends and has made herself an authority about that because of the influence of this significant time in her life as young Jessica’s babysitter. But…nobody has taken Gloria or her work seriously, so she’s eager to prove that it’s real.  For Gloria, it’s a last chance at a kind of redemption. Last and certainly not least, Taegen Burns (Taylor) give bratty teenager a whole new vibe.  Her performance is so rooted you wonder how Jessica maintains the restraint not to snatch a knot in that behind for being so fresh and disrespectful. However, it is Pyper Braun as Alice steals the show with the same range that a young Linda Blair displayed in “The Exorcist.”  Baby, between her and Chauncey, audiences will be have a grand old time with Imaginary, which is delivered with insane photographical tricks making this film unusual fun, with a few jump moments here and there.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  The haunted teddy bear flick “Imaginary,” the derivative and toothless new release from the Blumhouse fright factory, has been made on the cheap and with ideas filched from better films. The haunted teddy bear flick “Imaginary,” the derivative and toothless new release from the Blumhouse fright factory, has been made on the cheap and with ideas filched from better films. The pathetic Chauncey Bear is a tedious teddy voiced by Alice (Pyper Braun), the impressionable kid Chauncey has in his “evil” thrall, in “Imaginary,” writes Peter Howell. Voiced by Seth MacFarlane, of course, and maybe accompanied by his BFF Mark Wahlberg to share snacks and their communal bong. Anything, really, to liven up this sad excuse for a horror movie. Instead, we get the pathetic Chauncey Bear, a tedious teddy voiced by Alice (Pyper Braun), the impressionable kid Chauncey has in his “evil” thrall. This bear is so dull, the killer dolls Chucky, Annabelle and M3GAN from superior fright flicks would kick sand (or worse) in his face. As would Ted. That’s too bad, because the clever marketing for “Imaginary” suggested we were in for something good, if not all that original, from journeyman writer/director Jeff Wadlow (“Kick-Ass 2”) and fright factory Blumhouse Productions. A teaser trailer last fall, which ran in theatres before Blumhouse’s “Five Nights at Freddy’s,” used sound more than images to stimulate interest. “Close your eyes and use your imagination,” the teaser began, yet “Imaginary” abandons that cerebral approach. It goes instead for jump scares, the lowest form of horror, and for a barrage of random phantasms that’s like staring at a haunted house pinball machine. Call it the exploding crypt phenomenon. It’s a hallmark of the “Insidious” franchise, another Blumhouse property and one that “Imaginary” shamelessly steals from, working with a production budget that seems low even by Blumhouse’s thrifty standards. Most of the action in “Imaginary” takes place in a modest suburban dwelling, the childhood home of overworked and anxious Jessica, played by DeWanda Wise of Netflix’s “She’s Gotta Have It.” Newly married to rocker dude Max (Tom Payne, “The Walking Dead”), she’s trying hard to be a good stepmom to the precocious Alice and to the girl’s older sister, perpetually peeved teen Taylor (Taegen Burns). Jessica writes and illustrates insect-themed children’s books; “Molly Millipede” is her crawly classic. She has an active imagination, which figures into the film’s scattershot plot. This may account in part for Jessica’s violent night terrors, glimpsed in the prologue. She also has painful childhood memories that continue to stalk her, as does the camera. Jessica must also contend with stressful situations involving Samantha (Alix Angelis), the biological mother of Alice and Taylor, who suffers from mental illness and addiction, and who was committed to a facility for care after harming Alice. All the more reason for Max and Jessica to want to leave their current abode and move into Jessica’s “happy place” from her earlier life. Her childhood home seems very much as she left it decades ago, so much so that Alice discovers Jessica’s old teddy bear, Chauncey, left behind when the family departed. A scruffy little bruin with a red vest and gold ribbon, he was waiting in the basement all that time, supposedly seething with resentment over being abandoned. His blank eyes make it hard to tell. Alice soon bonds with him and takes him everywhere. She talks to him and also speaks for him. Everybody calls Chauncey Alice’s imaginary friend. Cue spooky music. It’s a promising setup for scares, one we’ve been primed for by the trailer and tag line: “He’s not imaginary and he’s not your friend.” Alas, the haunted teddy is neither threatening nor interesting. The budget for “Imaginary” apparently wasn’t enough to hire a proper voice actor for Chauncey, who is so innocuous he makes Yogi Bear seem like Ghostface from “Scream” in comparison. Chauncey at least doesn’t have to worry about being upstaged by the human actors, who aren’t much livelier. Wadlow marks time with distractions that include a dubious scavenger hunt and visits from a nosy neighbour, Gloria, played by horror vet Betty Buckley of “Carrie.” Gloria, a fellow author who knew Jessica’s family long ago and who wants to bond with her now, offers her theories about childhood occult possession, or whatever it is that’s happening to Alice. It all leads to a place called “the Never-Ever,” a skeletal realm that’s a lo-fi imitation of the spooky grand central station known as “the Further” in the “Insidious” series. With its cheap trap doors, gaudy flashing lights and goofy man in a bear suit — yes, there actually is one — the Never-Ever is like one of those charity haunted houses you find at fall fairs, which can’t be too scary so as not to frighten small children. When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become increasingly sinister. As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be. In theatres on March 8.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Children’s book illustrator Jessica, (DeWanda Wise) faces the daunting challenge of blending her new family into her childhood home in upcoming Blumhouse horror, Imaginary. The struggle to connect with her stepdaughters is amplified by the resistance of teenage Alex, who refuses to accept Jessica, while her real mother is suspiciously absent. Alex keeps a watchful eye on her younger sister Alice (played by a brilliant Pyper Braun), coercing her not to take to the invasion of a new matriarch. Desperate for companionship and security, Alice ventures into the basement of the new house and is called to a raggedy teddy bear she names Chauncey. Forming a bond with the bear as a new imaginary friend, Chauncey’s influence takes a dark turn, transforming innocent childhood games into something far more sinister. Acutely aware of the unnerving and perplexing behaviour of Alice, Jessica finds herself forced to confront unpleasant and repressed memories from her own childhood, realising that she has her own connection with Chauncey. The house, with its shadowy corners and obligatory bumps in the night becomes a claustrophobic backdrop for a developing psychological drama, and the pairing of Wise and Braun provides a well-earned anchor to the emotional core of the movie. While the third act might not be to everyone’s taste, with a tonal shift into something oddly reminiscent of Labyrinth, the gear change certainly injects a more playful element into the story. The malevolent teddy strikes a good balance between unnerving wrongness and childlike appeal. Its broken features appear sweet but are smartly unsettling, exuding a deeper malevolence behind them. His appearance is a potent symbol of the darkness that lurks in the recesses of childhood memory. Though it lacks some of the finesse of top-tier Blumhouse, Imaginary is a fun, slightly silly horror that holds an enjoyment in watching the story play out with more psychological twists than you would expect.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) decides to return to her childhood home, she soon uncovers that Chauncey, a bear she left behind called is really not happy with that decision. As it feeds on the mind of her daughter Alice and many others around it, the movie dives into a hellish ride through the endless possibilities of imagination. With a big lean on practical effects, writer/director Jeff Wadlow (Fantasy Island) clearly wants to ensure that Imaginary feels as realistic as possible and this show throughout. His seamless transitions from reality into a terrifying realm are quite impressive. The complicated dynamic within the family comes across as natural, and their tough backstories bring a crucial balance. Outside of the main cast and a superb leading performance from DeWanda Wise is an appearance from horror legend Betty Buckley, who really brings something quite special to the foundations of the picture. It’s most welcome when there are layers to the supporting cast. Something else that really adds to a horror movie is its soundtrack, and within Imaginary, they went all out with it thanks to the addition of composer Bear McCreary (Godzilla). You can tell that an immense amount of work has gone into it, and ultimately it brings a crucial element to a horror movie like this. Although, and unfortunately, the movie can feel somewhat very similar to what horror audiences have already seen before, Imaginary is still a worthy addition to a horror icon category that includes the likes of Chucky and M3GAN. With a focus on imagination, then a sequel is easily plausible.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," Adults are not the target audience for Imaginary. This latest Blumhouse flick is clearly meant for mall rats and slumber parties – a fact made obvious not just by its PG-13 rating, but also by a 15-year-old character who repeatedly drops the name of Bing Bong, the imaginary friend from Pixar’s Inside Out. That’s not to say there weren’t grown-ups who bawled their eyes out over the pink chimera's fate in 2015. But that scene probably made a bigger impression on the moviegoers who were kids then, and who have since graduated to the relatively scarier exploits of Freddy Fazbear and M3GAN. Imaginary is about evil imaginary friends, so it makes sense that kids are top of mind. But that doesn’t mean they’ll be the only ones who can enjoy it. The latest from Fantasy Island and Truth or Dare director Jeff Wadlow is a great teen scream, full of jump scares and adolescent antics. It’s also so earnestly absurd that it may be a future camp classic. The main character is Jessica (DeWanda Wise), who moves back into her childhood home with her husband, Max (Tom Payne), and two stepdaughters, Alice (Pyper Braun) and Taylor (Taegen Burns). We know something spooky definitely happened in this house when Jessica was a kid, thanks to lots of ominous music and imagery. She’s oblivious, just glad to be back in her “happy place.” When Alice wanders downstairs and finds a stuffed teddy bear that she names Chauncey, the creepiness begins. As Jessica slowly remembers more about her past, Chauncey takes Alice on a sinister scavenger hunt and starts terrorizing the household. You could say Imaginary jumps the shark when a weirdo neighbor (Betty Buckley) appears, or when a child psychologist (Veronica Falcón) sets up shop following one of Chauncey’s nastier fetch quests. But it’s all the little touches that makes this movie so deliciously unhinged. Jessica’s husband, a rock star in the ludicrously named band Burning Cats, looks like the love child of Harry Styles and Johnny Depp. In one scene, as he and Jessica discuss Alice’s wellbeing, she helps him remove his multiple jangly necklaces. Alice and Taylor’s mom is in a psych ward, and we never learn why. During a climactic scene, Jessica tosses off the word “impale” with hilarious nonchalance – as if it were part of her everyday vocabulary. If you want good storytelling, you won’t get it from Imaginary. What you will get is some fun, inventive scares and performances that are all over the map. Matthew Sato is definitely the weakest link as the family’s bad boy neighbor, while Braun admirably commits to Alice’s many ups and downs. Wise, who’s also credited as an executive producer, is giving it her all, like she thought she was on the hook for another Spike Lee joint and then stumbled onto this shoot instead. The production design also elevates this film in unexpected ways. Jessica’s bed has about five too many throw pillows, but the house otherwise looks like these characters actually live in it. Jessica’s childhood drawings play a huge role in the narrative, and rather than going for the usual dour etchings that plague nearly every horror movie, the film’s artists conjure up vibrant, girlish art that actually feels, well, imaginative. Plus, in a movie with multiple creepy creatures, the scariest one is made with practical effects – horror-fan water in a desert of CGI. Imaginary is ridiculous and overwritten and the ending is abrupt, blundering through the climax before falling flat on its face. But everything that’s terrible about it is also, weirdly, awesome. This isn’t M3GAN, which wore its silliness like a badge of honor. This is a movie that mostly plays it straight, even when it’s spewing absolute nonsense. Intentional camp is great, but it’s even better when it happens by accident. Imaginary nearly perfects its so-bad-it’s-good shtick. This is not a good movie, in the traditional, artistic sense – but it is a total joy to watch if you’re willing to buy into its particular blend of juvenile scares and stupid self-seriousness. Come for the practical effects, stay for the bizarro side characters. If you were stoked for M3GAN but thought it was a little too self-aware, this new Blumhouse flick is worth catching in theaters.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," There are some movies that you want to be able to watch with the kids. That’s hard to do with horror as a genre. Luckily, Imaginary is here to fill the gap and gives us a frightening look into the world of imaginary friends. Or just terrifying Chauncey. Jessica (DeWanda Wise) is moving her husband (Tom Payne) and her two step daughters (played by Taegen Burns and Pyper Braun) to her childhood home to try and reconnect with the happiness she once had there. What she actually is doing though is leading her family into Chauncey’s den. Chauncey Bear is an imaginary friend gone awry and what makes Imaginary so much fun to watch is that it has all the elements of a typical horror movie but is tame enough that it can and should be something for the entire family to enjoy. It’s not often that horror as a genre gives you a chance to enjoy it while knowing that the kids in your family will also have a fun time. And we have, for the most part, shied away from those movies in recent years so while we can all enjoy things like Scream or even Halloween, they’re still a little gory on paper. Imaginary has its scares, particularly with the looming figure that lurks in the shadows behind our family of characters, but where it works as a horror movie is within Chauncey himself and the ideas laid out for us. Alice (Pyper Braun) finds the stuffed bear when she goes to explore the basement. First of all, why were you in the basement? But secondly, the bear then brings with it a haunted figure creeping around the home. Alice is talking to herself, she sincerely thinks that Chauncey is real, and we eventually learn the lore of not only Chauncey Bear but of imaginary friends as a concept. Look, is Imaginary reinventing the genre? No, but it is a fun horror movie to watch. I came out of it knowing that my niece, who loves characters like M3GAN, would enjoy watching this, and is a tame way for her to enjoy the genre without an excess of gore. It is where Blumhouse has found its place to shine. What makes Imaginary so fun to see in theaters though is to have that bit of fear of what lurks in the darkness and to also never trust that something you thought you made up is actually make-believe. Never have I sat in a theater and heard a bunch of people exclaim “Chauncey” at different times. It was absolutely hilarious and a blast to watch everyone start to make fun of this bear and his antics all together. That’s what makes horror such a fun genre to watch in a theatre and Imaginary is definitely one you won’t want to miss. And you can bring the whole family to enjoy it!",NEUTRAL

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. The movie follows Jessica (a fairly flat turn from Jurassic World: Dominion’s DeWanda Wise) as she moves her family – Tom Payne’s faceless, cookie-cutter ‘horror husband’ and two stepdaughters – into her childhood home.  There, her new beau’s youngest Alice (Pyper Braun, the best actor of the bunch) discovers Jessica’s old ursine pal Chauncey in the basement and, as you’d expect, creepy stuff ensues. First Chauncey apparently wants Alice to fetch him some food, then a paintbrush, then something that’s happy… then something that makes her mad… then something that hurts. You get the idea. There are some decent-enough scares weaved in, including a powerful cold open and a pull-string set piece. But for a film about the power of imagination, it’s frustrating how little it trusts the audience to use its own. As such, there’s no real sense of dread or suspense.  When Alice threatens to physically harm herself, Jessica – by now, hubby has left on a music tour with his band, naturally – brings in a shrink, who drops some genuinely hilarious bombshells about the bad, bad bear. At this point, the film gets weird and is all the better for it, despite borrowing heavily from the likes of Insidious: The Red Door, which Blumhouse released only last year, and The Cabin in the Woods (2012).  Still, offering up an inventive otherworldly realm, cool practical creature design and a gonzo finale isn’t enough to stop Imaginary from being another toothless, gummy (bear) outing from Truth or Dare’s (2018) Jeff Wadlow.

"Mar 8, 2024"," The unacknowledged thing about Imaginary (as far as I know) is how much the just-released horror movie owes to the maligned Winnie the Pooh: Blood & Honey—part of a trend of public-domain characters ripped from the pages of beloved children's books.  In Winnie the Pooh: Blood & Honey, a feral Pooh and his equally savage sidekick, Piglet, go on a murderous spree after their friend Christopher Robin abandons them in the Hundred Acre Wood. The wondrous fantasy world Robin has created for his imaginary friends has deteriorated into the dark gloom of a dead forest, overgrown by weeds and rotting trees.  Without Christopher Robin's guidance, Winnie, once a thriving, sweet, bumbling, honey-loving bear, is now broken and untamed. He's not lost his taste for honey but now enjoys it with a splash of blood.  Would the producers of Imaginary welcome such comparisons? Not likely. The production level is higher, the performances are more refined, and the exploitation is less vivid. There are no famous literary characters in Imaginary, but there is an imaginary world in which an imaginary friend comes in the shape of an imaginary teddy bear.  Of course, none of it is remotely imaginative. Dream-like worlds with long, endless hallways, cotton ball clouds (intentional, I assume, given the child-vision premise), and animatronic arms reaching out from open doors to attack its victims, is as original as a carnival house of horrors. ), a young children's story author attempting to bond with her stepdaughters, defiant 15-year-old Taylor (Taegen Burns) and 10-year-old Alice (Pyper Braun). Taylor is still devoted to her mother, who’s now institutionalized after severely harming Alice. Jessica's husband, Max (Tom Payne) is a hipster, complete with tattoos and a successful band, and whose sole purpose in the film is to display congenial acceptance of his wife's efforts to bond with his children and to display a loving parental watch over his daughters. Payne might be fine, but Max is useless. The incredibly understanding Max convinces Jessica to return to her family home, where she still harbours fond memories. Her father (Samuel Salary) is now in assisted living and, because of some unknown terror, is half the man he used to be.  The situation concerns the house and Jessica's unfriendly, invisible friend who she abandoned. Now the invisible friend wants revenge. Who knew imaginary friends could be so sensitive and needy. With imaginary friends like these, who needs an imagination?  Imaginary friends have been terrifying parents and caregivers since Reagan met Captain Howdy in The Exorcist (1974) and again in The Shining (1980) when little Danny Torrance meets Tony. And possessed children's toys, M3GAN (2022), Child's Play (1988) and Annabelle (2014). Chauncy is no match for any of them. During a game of hide and seek, Alice goes alone into a dark, barely lit basement despite being terrified. Inexplicably, she moves several boxes and discovers a hidden door. There, she finds Chauncy, a brown teddy bear who adopts Alice as his new friend.  Director Jeff Wadlow puts up a single card announcing Imaginary as ""a film by Jeff Wadlow."" ""A film by"" is an annoying prestige conceit rarely earned by filmmakers who are more interested in cinema as consumerism than art. Granted, Wadlow, aside from directing, is also a producer and co-writer. So, there might be some rationale for giving himself auteur recognition, if only Imaginary were a better movie. Imaginary is far too long, at one hour, 44 minutes. The build-up has a few exciting moments. But the climax, intended as the film's centerpiece, is a dull repetition of hallways, locked doors, and unimpressive jump scares. ",NEGATIVE

"Mar 8, 2024"," Is Imaginary any degree of scary? No. Is Imaginary brimming with whimsical yet demented visuals? Also, no. Is Imaginary at least a family-friendly gateway horror treat that will keep audiences of all ages entertained? For a third time, that's a big ol' nope. After the mediocre efforts of Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island, director and co-writer Jeff Wadlow reteams with Blumhouse to defy the redemptive adage that “third time's the charm.” Imaginary, Wadlow’s new horror film, is blandly presented, muted in tone, and lacking any bite as a warped tale about sinister made-up companions. Despite its creepy “killer teddy bear” premise, it’s hardly as terrifying as a hard stare from Paddington. Imaginary follows Jessica (played by DeWanda Wise), a children's author and illustrator plagued by nightmares borne from childhood trauma. She and her musician husband Max (Tom Payne), along with Max's daughters Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), move into Jessica's childhood home in hopes of a new start. Jessica recalls fond memories in the house before her father lost his sanity one night, but forgets about one resident who never left: a stuffed bear Alice finds and befriends who goes by the name Chauncey. The potential of Imaginary is limitless, yet Wadlow's vision for Chauncey's wicked exploitation of childlike wonder is disappointingly flat. Jacob Chase's Come Play or Brandon Christensen's Z are two recent examples of how filmmakers can turn imaginary pals into primetime horror villains, from which Wadlow absorbs no lessons. Aside from a remix of Mario Bava's legendary jumpscare in 1977's Shock that transforms Chauncey from plush toy to snarling beast, Wadlow reuses the same lame ""shadowy figure in the background"" trick to diminishing returns. Horror thrives in unexpected deliveries, which Imaginary lacks despite how the screenplay's premise introduces an environment where Chauncey can bend reality at his whim. Wadlow, alongside co-scribes Greg Erb and Jason Oremland, is onto something neat from a storytelling perspective: showing the vengeful side of imaginary friends once they're outgrown. Jessica's relation to Chauncey and her tether to her family's residence is a compelling plot device, yet it’s frustratingly underexplored. Imaginary gets too preoccupied with repainting ""The Further"" from James Wan's Insidious as an imagination realm where kiddos go missing, decorated like production designers raided the bargain shelf at a Michael's craft store. Lightbox carousels and wind-up playthings try to contrast juvenile innocence against demonic manipulation, but it's weirdly disingenuous theming restricted to spurts. So much of Imaginary is visually drab, with camera frames tainted by empty space and an underwhelming suburban appeal. All the film's best looks are a flirty tease, like the icy-blue filtered M. C. Escher-style entrance to Chauncey's domain that quickly leads into a repetitive hallway of doors. Imaginary underwhelms with the best of 'em. Its horror is ineffective since Chauncey's take on live-action Coraline eyes never should have passed the test phase. Wise's performance shoulders a production otherwise devoid of personality, left buckling under the overwhelming weight of a supporting cast that compares like made-for-TV cutouts. Chauncey's scariest appearance is glimpsed early, as a scurrying spider-person creepshow, but it's instantly evident why Wadlow frequently hides this figure either blurred out of focus or in darkness. (Chauncey's supersized teddy evolution play by Prey’s Dane DiLiegro is marginally better, if a clunkily immobile suit.) There's so much detail missing from Jessica, Taylor, and Alice’s world — Max goes on tour at the worst possible time and immediately becomes an afterthought  — that everything might as well be greyscale. Betty Buckley's sassy senior Gloria attempts to inject a little wacky neighbor energy to liven the mood, and earns the best line delivery of the entire show as the trope-saddled elder with all the information, yet even her efforts evaporate into thin air (better suited for another hammier movie altogether). It's a shame because gateway horror movies are vital passageways. They're a necessary entry point for someday-horror lovers who may not be ready for the big leagues. Imaginary could have been that padded adolescent horror tale à la last year's Five Nights at Freddy's (a film I enjoyed more than others), but it's not. The problem isn't a PG-13 rating or bum script. Imaginary oversells, under-delivers, and is never anywhere as frightening as the deepest recesses of your own all-time-terrible nightmares.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024","  Throughout Imaginary, the latest film from Blumhouse and directed by Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island’s Jeff Wadlow, we’re told about the power of imagination. It’s imagination that made Imaginary’s Jessica (DeWanda Wise) become a children’s book writer and author, and it’s seemingly imagination that made Jessica’s step-daughter Alice (Pyper Braun) start talking to a teddy bear named Chauncey she found in her basement. Yet Imaginary is packed with generic, clichéd characters, odd narrative choices, and zero actual reasons to be scared, to the point that oddly, Imaginary lacks any imagination. That is, unless you’re imagining that you want to see one of the worst films to come out this year.   We also meet Liam (Matthew Sato), a neighbor whom Taylor takes a liking to, who is irritating from the moment we meet him, and gets invited over to Taylor’s house to…give her something to do other than being annoyed at her stepmom? Which, to be fair, considering how many things are going wrong in this house, Jessica is strangely content with allowing Taylor to play by herself without any supervision, or just flat-out leave these kids on their own at the drop of a hat.   Without giving anything away, Imaginary also pretends that major moments in the third act are huge shocks. However, anyone who has managed to stay awake this long in the film should easily be able to figure out any of the film's “twists” and “turns.” One connection between Jessica and Alice should be immediately obvious to those barely paying attention, and one villain reveal is so clear from the beginning that this revelation is laughable—and is then followed by an even more ludicrous scene of surprise violence.   There are also large chunks of this story that go absolutely nowhere. In one scene, the troubled mother of Taylor and Alice breaks into the house, and after she’s been taken away by the police, her presence is never spoken of again. After a scene that should be traumatizing, Max decides it’s okay to leave his new wife and his daughters to go on tour with his band—a job we don’t know he has until he’s literally abandoning his family with guitar in hand. There are even mentions of physical abuse that Jessica and Alice have shared that doesn’t serve any real purpose, other than to make the point that people live with the scars that they’ve received over their lives—which doesn’t even really make sense to the story that’s being told. Imaginary feels like one pass was done of the script, or that these scenes were written on the day, without any consideration of how anything tied together or worrying about things like narrative cohesion and character consistency.   Speaking of characters, Imaginary is a cast packed with clichés, with the exasperated teen, the creepy child who everyone ignores for far too long, and the mother who is several steps behind the audience. These performances are over-the-top, frequently ludicrous, and often downright silly. Again, that likely has more to do with the poor writing and directing choices than these actors. Having a child actor attempt to be a maniacal and vengeful spirit is completely unfair to said actor, and most of the film’s “scares” come from ludicrous makeup choices, like giant bug eyes for no damned reason. It’s not these actor’s fault that they’re an amalgamation of tropes you’ve seen in countless other crappy PG-13 horror movies.   But Imagination’s lack of vision or any semblance of good ideas certainly makes itself clear in the third act. We’re shown a place that is supposedly made of pure imagination, and yet, it’s so derivative of M.C. Escher paintings and any hall of mirrors you might’ve walked into at a dumpy carnival. Given all the possibilities that imagination can provide, this is the best thing that Wadlow and co. can come up with? At the very least, Wadlow does do some clever tricks with the camera in this section, but these are little more than a few seconds of pleasant surprise in a film that, by this point, will leave you ready to sacrifice yourself to Chauncey instead of having it go on any longer.   Yet maybe Imaginary’s most egregious sin is that it’s not scary in the least, and it’s not even really trying that hard. Again, considering that this is literally a movie that is about imagination, it's painful how there is none to be found here. It’s a similar problem with many of Wadlow’s films, which seem more like one-line elevator pitches (What is Fantasy Island was actually about murder? What if truth or dare led to death?) come to life than actual films. Wadlow will often have a spider monster lurking in the shadows of the film, yet considering that he begins the movie by giving us our best look at what this creature is, any suspense later on is immediately taken out of the film. From then on, Imaginary is only unsettling if you don’t like teddy bears slightly moving or heads turned askew in a family portrait.   Imaginary is a concept with potential, but none of that is seen in Wadlow’s film.Imaginary is top-to-bottom a mess, a frustrating mishmash of bad choices that never goes anywhere interesting. A few times throughout Imaginary, someone compares Chauncey to Bing Bong from Inside Out, and it’s honestly more enjoyable thinking about that far superior Pixar film for a few fleeting moments than watching this film.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Most of us grew up with imaginary friends (it was expected in my case since I was an only child), but what happens when those friends don’t have the best intentions for us? Worse yet, what happens when they want to take us into their world? “Imaginary” explores these questions with an inventive approach. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, the film stars DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, Taegen Burns, and Pyper Braun with Veronica Falcon and Betty Buckley. The film opens with Jessica (Wise) having a continuous nightmare that pushes her to move into her childhood home with her husband and two stepdaughters sooner than expected. This childhood home has witnessed many unimaginable scenarios. One day, Alice (Braun) is playing hide-and-seek when she hears a noise in the basement. There she finds a teddy bear named Chauncey and quickly develops an affinity towards it. Alice converses with Chauncey and they start a scavenger hunt. But things take an interesting turn when the game gradually becomes sinister.  First, I don’t actively seek horror films because I’ve developed a fear of them (Thank you, “The Exorcist”(1973)), but I decided to give “Imaginary” a chance. It was a film that succeeded in entertaining me while scaring me several times.  Using an imaginary friend as part of the plot makes this story relatable. The first two acts are great. The buildup and introduction to this world and its mysteries are greatly executed, but the third act left me a little unsatisfied. It felt slightly comical and unserious. There is a specific character that suddenly gets more screen time at this time and it feels overexposed.  Overall, “Imaginary” is a good film that left me contemplating the possible consequences of imaginary friends. Its unpredictable twists, turns, and jump scares deliver a fun movie. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Audiences going into Imaginary will have more fun than they expected. The Blumhouse flick manages to be scary, piling on frights, laughs, and even a twist. The trailer does not do the movie justice, feeling like the movie will join tragic bombs like the first Annabelle. Instead, it pulls audiences in with tense scenes and carefully crafted jump scares. While a different ending and showing less of the monster would cement the film, Imaginary still turns up the entertainment in a fun, engaging way. Directed by Jeff Wadlow and written by Wadlow, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland, the movie centers around a step-family. The new mother, Jessica (DeWanda Wise), is at the center. She’s the latest addition to the home. Although her husband, Max (Tom Payne), is happy about the new situation as they move into Jessica’s brief childhood home, his teenage daughter, Taylor (Taegen Burns), is anything but joyous. The younger daughter, Alice (Pyper Braun), is more open but listens to her sister. Still, there’s a shared pain, as both daughters and Jessica experienced childhood trauma. Enter the childhood friend from hell to shake things up.  As they move into Jessica’s childhood home, the situation quickly turns strange. Alice chats with her newfound imaginary friend. In any other situation, Jessica and Max sharing a smile as they hear Alice’s soft voice chatter away would engender smiles from the audience. But this is a horror movie and the first of many “uh-ohs.” The movie lets viewers infer an abusive past, but it’s also unclear what happened. Jessica has a scar from childhood, and Alice also has a scar, implying a connection from similar abusive childhoods.  This part of the film is disappointing as they also depict the mother as someone with mental health issues. Depictions in films equating mental health to violence or abuse need to cease. It’s unnecessary in Imaginary. Jessica’s murky childhood memories about her brief life in the home do not require it. Just focus on her, the kids—as naturally, the dad, Max, goes on a work trip—and the oddball neighbor.  A gradual fear builds as Alice plays with the teddy bear, Chauncy. Something about the eyes of stuffed toys looks soulless, all-knowing, and lurky. But the toy is not the only thing to fear. Imaginary makes terrific use of the terrifying presence looming in the background. Fortunately, it’s not all jump scares. Shadows and “what was that” moments pop up, making for an entertaining viewing experience with friends. It has those blink-and-miss-it moments that horror films need more of.  Imaginary is not a perfect film, but it is fun to watch with friends. As the movie presses on, it’s clear that it does not take itself seriously. When the neighbor, Gloria (Betty Buckley), arrives, laughs ratchet up even more. The cast does a great job. DeWanda Wise brings some emotional depth to her character and the film. Betty Buckley is pure entertainment. There’s even a twist near the end that might surprise some moviegoers.  Horror movies leaning into laughs work, but it’s a tightrope to achieve. Imaginary pulls it off despite its pitfalls. However, more practical effects, or even leaving the frights in the dark, would have heightened the scares. Also, the ending is pat and expected. It’s okay and gives some Poltergeist vibes. But an open-ending, done right, filled with uncertainty would provide that extra chill. Not as epic as M3gan or disjointed as Five Nights at Freddy’s, Imaginary is an engagement film wedged between the two. Viewers will point, scream, and laugh as scenes unfold, moving from creepy to ludicrous. It’s a fun time. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Imaginary
revolves around such a silly idea that one would think co-writer/director Jeff
Wadlow might try to have some fun with it. Instead, this horror story about a
child's imaginary friend playing some demented games with the kid is a
self-serious bore, latching on to formula and only somewhat enjoyable for a few
unintentional laughs. The first thing of note, perhaps, is that here
is yet another generic horror movie that takes a metaphor about trauma and
simply makes it part of the story. There's Jessica (DeWanda Wise), for example,
whose mother died of cancer, whose father lost his mind shortly after, and who
now has a recurring nightmare about being chased by a spider-like creature
through an otherworldly hallway. In case we don't catch that central theme from
all of this, Jessica is also a children's book writer, whose main character is a
millipede being chased by a spider. The screenplay, written by the director
along with Greg Erb and Jason Oremland, wears the wearing of the thematic
intentions on its sleeve on its sleeve. There's also Jessica's new family by way of her
marriage to Max (Tom Payne). He has two daughters, the younger Alice (Pyper
Braun) and the teenaged Taylor (Taegen Burns), and they're all dealing with the
fallout of Max's ex-wife and the girls' mother suffering some mental breakdown.
Alice has a severe burn scar on her forearm, and Jessica has her own scars in
the same place. At this point, it should come as no surprise that the movie's
idea of subtlety is only pointing out this connection maybe three times over the
course of the story. The plot proper starts when the family moves
into Jessica's childhood home, after her father (played by Samuel Salary) has
been sent to an assisted care facility. The gimmick is that Alice, left alone by
Jessica to take a work call, hears a voice, follows it into the basement, finds
a hidden door down there, and discovers a teddy bear. In her head, the bear
calls itself Chauncey, but obviously, the bear is a lot moreand a lot less,
apparently, after a twist that's fairly inconsequential, although the way Wadlow
bludgeons us with the revelation with a lengthy montage certainly shows how
clever and important he thinks it is. The teddy bear wants to play with the
girlinnocently at first, with games of hide-and-seek and tea parties and a
scavenger hunt, but much less so when Jessica realizes there's more to
Chauncey's list of things to collect on the back. The bear has promised to take
Alice to a secret place if she does everything on the list, including hurting
herself. There's a cheapness to the child-in-peril element hereas Alice
perceives a rusty nail as a flower, for examplethat doesn't make it feel
exploitative but certainly doesn't make it suspenseful, either. As for the rest of the plot, it should be
pretty apparent. Chauncey starts asking more and more dangerous things of Alice.
Jessica realizes that the bear might have a connection to her own childhood. The
teen stepdaughter has a guy over who gets a couple blatant jump-scares thrown
his way (One of the funniest moments is imagining the stuffed bear quickly
folding up a towel to cover its tracks), and the father proves himself a
completely useless character by going away on a music gig just before the
third-act shenanigans. If there's any confusion, worry not, because we
have Gloria (Betty Buckley), a walking, talking, and
suddenly-and-conveniently-appearing provider of more exposition and explanation
than this material demands. Seriously, this woman comes out of nowhere for her
two big scenes and just starts laying it on thick with the back story and the
supernatural hokum. Buckley's performance might be the one overtly self-aware
element of the movie, because the actor really does come across as someone whose
only purpose in life is to tell people everything they could want to know and
more about secret pasts, the long and culturally diverse history of imaginary
friends, and some otherworldly realm. It's all so predictable, repetitive, and, well,
unimaginative. That's particularly true of the extended climax of Imaginary,
which has a group of characters travel to that other world, where anything is
supposedly possible by way of the power of imagination. The best the filmmakers
here can come up with, though, is a set that looks like an abandoned funhouse, a
dog, a bear monster, and an attempt to pull off, not one, but two fake-out
endings. If a horror movie like this can't think smarter, it could at least have
the good sense to dream even a bit bigger.

"Mar 8, 2024"," PLOT A woman with a troubled past moves back into her childhood home.CAST DeWanda Wise, Pyper Braun, Taegen BurnsRATED PG-13 (scary imagery and some bloodshed)LENGTH 1:44WHERE Area theatersBOTTOM LINE A semi-effective horror flick with a couple of tingly twists. In Hollywood, the hive mind is on overdrive! Coming later this month is “Immaculate,” about an American nun who travels to Italy and enters an evil convent. Coming in April is “The First Omen,” about an American woman who travels to Italy and discovers an evil conspiracy. On a different note, May will see the release of “IF,” a comedy about a little girl who can see another person’s imaginary friend — but this week we’ve already got “Imaginary,” a horror movie about a little girl who can see another person’s imaginary friend. It's almost as uncanny as that spring in 1990 when “Lambada,” a teen film about a forbidden dance, came out the same day as “The Forbidden Dance Is Lambada.” Give some credit to “Imaginary” for exercising a little creativity within its narrow scope. The story strikes some familiar notes: After moving back to her childhood home, children’s author Jessica (DeWanda Wise), is charmed to see that her young stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) has unearthed her old stuffed bear, Chauncey. But as Alice’s behavior turns dark — sudden aggression, speaking in weird voices, attempts at self-harm — Jessica wonders if Chauncey is the culprit. Could this bear be the reason Jessica has almost no memories of her own troubled childhood? Despite that case of highly convenient amnesia, “Imaginary” holds together fairly well as a mystery-driven horror chiller. A visit from Dr. Soto (Veronica Falcón), a child therapist, lays the groundwork for a couple of plot twists that you probably won’t see coming, and director Jeff Wadlow (who wrote the screenplay with two others) manages to squeeze fresh shivers out of some very old tropes.  What works less well is Jessica’s adventure through a spirit realm called The Never-Ever, where little Alice has been lured. This realm is another cliché, one that dates back to the “Insidious” movies (where it was called The Further) and, before that, to 1982’s “Poltergeist.” In the Never-Ever, where hallway doors and cotton ball clouds combine in a sort of slapdash Surrealism, the budgetary limitations of “Imaginary” reveal themselves. Still, “Imaginary” has an appealing cast of characters, including Jessica’s indie-musician husband, Max (Tom Payne, in a Walkmen T-shirt); her sullen older stepdaughter, Taylor (Taegen Burns); and the neighborhood kook, Gloria (veteran actress Betty Buckley). If you can withstand some of the goofier moments — such as Dr. Soto asking, with a straight face, whether little Alice has taken up ventriloquism — “Imaginary” might serve as a reasonably effective fright flick during a slow week. Stay for the closing credits to hear “Chauncey’s Theme,” a cutesy-creepy ditty from composer Bear McCreary and his daughter Sonatine.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," It’s hard to know where to start in describing how bad Imaginary is. The new horror movie from Blumhouse and director Jeff Wadlow (Kick-Ass 2) starts with the simple but promising premise of a haunted stuffed animal and a malicious imaginary friend, but its bland characters, muddy storytelling, and lack of scares leave behind a movie more lifeless than a teddy bear with no stuffing. Imaginary’s mess of a story begins with a woman named Jessica (She’s Gotta Have It and Jurassic World Dominion’s DeWanda Wise) and her new husband, Max (Tom Payne), waking up after one of Jessica’s recurring nightmares. She’s being chased through a long hallway by a giant spider, who also happens to be the main villain in the children’s books she writes. The couple quickly decide that it’s time for them and Max’s two kids from a previous marriage, teenage Taylor (Taegen Burns) and much younger Alice (Pyper Braun), to move into Jessica’s childhood home, in hopes that the familiar setting will cure her of her nightmares. Max’s kids aren’t too happy about the move, though it isn’t quite clear how far they’re going or what their specific objection is. It isn’t really clear whether we’re supposed to believe Jessica wants to get along with her new stepdaughters, or if her rudeness to them is an accidental problem of the script and the performance. Either way, after a few days in the house, Jessica ignores Alice by sneaking out of the house during a game of hide-and-seek in order to take a work call, leaving Alice to explore the basement and find Chauncey the creepy teddy bear. Chauncey quickly becomes Alice’s new imaginary friend, who she talks to constantly and takes with her everywhere. This part of the plot strongly evokes M3GAN, without ever getting near that movie’s knowing sense of fun. All this setup happens by about 10 minutes into the movie, and it’s also where the coherent details of the plot end. [Ed. note: The rest of this story contains significant spoilers for Imaginary. The good news is, reading about them is much more fun than sitting through all 104 minutes of the movie.] Chauncey’s arrival should also usher creepiness into Imaginary, but the movie gets so diverted by trying to piece together a story out of its myriad meaningless plot threads that it doesn’t have much time to dedicate to actual horror. In one scene, for instance, the children’s biological mother shows up at Jessica’s house without warning, attacks Jessica, reveals that she seems to psychically know there’s something evil in the house, gets arrested, then disappears for the entire rest of the movie. This scene is never brought up again. Shortly after that, Max just leaves his children with their new, clearly not up-to-the-task stepmom so he can go on a seemingly indefinite tour with his band. There’s also a creepy neighbor who just happens to have a fully illustrated academic textbook on imaginary friends that seems tailor-made for a lazy exposition scene. The movie even throws in two separate child-abuse plotlines that it eventually just shrugs off when they aren’t useful anymore.  It’s tempting to try to read into this labyrinth of digressions to try to find some kind of meaning or intention, but Imaginary never makes that feel worthwhile. There isn’t a single character in the movie who feels worth rooting for, and the performances are entirely devoid of charisma. The script, written by Wadlow, Jason Oremland, and Greg Erb, is full of wooden dialogue that’s stiff and often feels almost completely nonsensical. Characters sometimes introduce new information like it’s a fact the audience has known forever. At other times, they treat seemingly obvious plot points like major, unguessable reveals — like when we find out that Chauncey once belonged to Jessica. None of these plot threads ever amount to much, and most of them are just left dangling by the end of the movie. If the filmmakers don’t care about them, why should we?  But as with any horror movie, most of this disaster could be overlooked if only the story was scary. Instead, that’s where its failures become most apparent. Imaginary doesn’t bring a single original idea to the horror genre. It’s entirely paint-by-numbers filmmaking that never even manages to create tension, let alone fear. Characters look under beds while the cloying score brings in a swell of strings to beg us to feel something. Chauncey moves on his own a time or two, and even transforms into a monstrous bear, but the scenes are lit so badly that the effect just looks cheap and underbaked rather than remotely terrifying. Watching sequences this rote is soul-crushing for a horror fan, and they make the moments where the movie slows down for its next attempt at a scare feel like they drag on for ages.  The one briefly interesting sequence comes in the final third of the movie, when Alice has been tricked into visiting the world of the imaginary friends, and Jessica and Taylor have to rescue her. This world floats in darkness, and its only solid ground is a checkerboard floor in an endless hallway of doors. Sections of the world form staircases to nowhere, dead ends that drop into an abyss, and doors that seem to float upside down. None of these visuals are wholly original — they take aim at the middle ground between Twin Peaks’ Red Room and a Scooby-Doo chase scene, without any of the fun that combination implies. But even without originality, it’s far and away the best visual of the movie. Sadly, for most of their time in this world, the characters just charge blindly into doors and end up in the same boring rooms we’ve seen in the rest of the movie, each one shot essentially the same as it was in the real world, just a little bit darker.  Imaginary didn’t have a high bar to clear. In a year that’s been lacking interesting horror movies so far, with the other Blumhouse entry Night Swim as the only real bright spot, all this movie ever really needed to be was some silly fun with a few good scares. Instead, it gets lost in a maze of awful storytelling and frustrating characters, all without offering anything more than the stock-standard horror tropes that have been done better in a million other movies.

The problem starts with the core cast of characters, which resembles countless other fraught family dynamics in hundreds of horror films. DeWanda Wise is our hero Jessica, a children’s book writer and artist whose chief creation is Simon the Spider, a cartoon monster inspired by recurring nightmares in which she’s chased in her childhood home by a vicious arachnid demon. Despite those bad omens and other assorted trauma revolving around the suburban dream home — she moved there to live with her grandmother after her mother died, and quickly moved out when she was five after her father seemingly snapped mentally — she’s rather eager to move back in with her husband Max (Tom Payne, sharing an almost comical lack of chemistry with Wise), describing the house as her “happy place.” Tonally, “Imaginary” feels like an attempt to chase the campy, self-aware, more funny than scary spirit of Blumhouse’s 2023 robot doll phenomenon “M3GAN.” For much of the running time, it struggles to find the balance and clarity in writing needed to make the style work, and the film instead mostly meanders through a solid hour of bloodless buildup spent investing in its largely braindead characters. The dynamics between Jessica and her stepdaughters are tired and exhausting clichés, and some backstory involving the girls’ mentally ill biological mother aside, there’s no attempt to flesh it out beyond the barest of bones.  After wasting most of its running time on tedium, “Imaginary” does get a lot better in its back half, thanks to an enjoyably dumb twist and a third act that more confidently reaches for campy fun instead of horror.

"Mar 8, 2024"," 
	Here the film’s title comes into play, as the evil encountered is not so plainly in sight. The key character, Chauncey, is seemingly innocent looking but subtly able to change expressions or mysteriously just show up unnanounced while still appearing inanimate. He is abandoned in a corner of a new home where young Alice (Pyper Braun) finds him and immediately turns him into her friend, however “imaginary” this relationship seems at first. She and older teen sister Taylor (Taegen Burns) are the stepdaughters of Jessica (DeWanda Wise), who has moved from a New Orleans apartment with her new husband and father of the two girls, Max (Tom Payne). Still haunted by nightmares from her own past and with an institutionalized father Ben (Sam Salary), Max believes a change of pace is needed and arranges for the family to actually move into Jessica’s childhood home. Uh, not a good idea.  
	There are a few twists, a couple of turns, and even some nice old fashioned excuses to scream if you are so inclined. Wadlow is smart enough to know that in the oversaturated horror genre the best path forward might be not what we actually see (vis a vis gut-wrenching hard-R visuals) but rather what we actually think we see. It’s effective in its own way, especially since Imaginary seems set up initially to be just an extension of this sub-horror genre given vivid life by the likes of Annabelle and Chucky among others outside of the Blumhouse house. 
	It helps to have a game cast and there is one on board here, starting with Wise, also an executive producer, who makes Jessica’s own past come alive believably as the new experience in her old house comes back to haunt her. Braun is terrific, hardly cloying at all, in a role that seems clichéd in this kind of film these days. Burns makes a strong impression, as does Salany, the latter seen in flashbacks and current day as the institutionalized father who holds dark secrets. Buckley, in essentially the Lin Shaye role, makes the older, somewhat creepy neighbor an absolute hoot. This Tony-winning star adds a lot of gravitas and knocks it out of the park, particularly when the action turns to the place beyond the walls known as the “Never Ever.” Every one of these films builds to an overwrought manic climax and this one is no different in that regard with the emerging Entity and bloated Bear Beast on hand, but Wadlow keeps it all in check enough as to not also destroy the heart of his tale. 
	An eerie and lilting musical theme is exceptionally well used here, almost feeling like the childhood soundtrack provided by Elmer Bernstein in his classic To Kill a Mockingbird score. It is enormously effective, and the music for the film is credited to Sparks and Shadows, with an acknowledgement at the end credits to composer Bear McCreary for additional work.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Yes, the latest film from producer Jason Blum’s horror factory arrives in theatres this weekend with a killer marketing campaign designed to convince audiences that this film’s evil teddy bear is the second coming of last year’s homicidal-doll (homici-doll?) sensation M3GAN. But while both films feature children’s toys whose switches have been firmly flipped to “evil,” Imaginary is as dour a slog as M3GAN was a bloody bit of self-aware camp. At least Imaginary director Jeff Wadlow does well on the prop front, securing a stuffed animal that is creepy in its simplicity. With two little black eyes, a tightly pursed mouth and ever-so-slightly pilled fabric, the cute little Chauncey Bear carries a sinister kind of charm. I mean, what kid wouldn’t bat an eye when the stuffie mysteriously appears out of nowhere in the creepy basement of a clearly haunted suburban home? Perhaps a smarter child than the young Alice (Pyper Braun) would’ve left the bear be, but then again, the youngster is dealing with bigger problems than teddies materializing out of thin air. Problems like the tense dynamic between her bratty older sister Taylor (Taegan Burns) and their new stepmom Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a well-meaning children’s artist who has relocated her stepdaughters into her old childhood home. This was perhaps a smart decision given that the family, which includes Alice and Taylor’s musician father Max (Tom Payne), were feeling cramped in their downtown apartment. But then again, it is clear that something horrible went down in Jessica’s youth – why oh why has her father has spent most of his life in a mental-health institution?? – and now her stepdaughters will be forced to relive it, one jump scare at a time. The main culprit? That would be Chauncey Bear, whom Alice once day starts lugging everywhere, engaging in “imaginary” conversations with her new best friend. Naturally, things go supernaturally sideways almost immediately, throwing Jessica and her stepdaughters into an odyssey that’s pitched as nightmarish but is mostly just tedious. Wadlow gets a slightly surreal spring in his step once he shifts the film’s action to Chauncey’s otherworldly “realm,” a kind of checker-patterned hell that looks like the hotel Beetlejuice might run were he a Property-Brother poltergeist. But by that point, audiences will have already ghosted the proceedings. Whether it’s the watered-down scares or the terrible performances – no one likes making fun of children, but Braun needs to leave acting to the stage-parented professionals – Imaginary’s myriad faults are all too real. The only brief amusement comes from dreaming of the enterprising podcaster who will surely one day talk their way through a surreal double bill of Wadlow’s film and this year’s other big imaginary-friend film, John Krasinski’s forthcoming IF (a decidedly more family-friendly affair). Until that podcast arrives, though – or until M3GAN inevitably teams up with the prototypical serial-killer doll Chucky – it is best to put childish things away.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Your mental to-do list should be a packed schedule of action items by the time “Imaginary,” a cheap-looking exercise in childhood horror, concludes. After all, you’ll need something to concentrate on,  with so little in this PG-13 programmer to draw focus, especially the floppy, crooked-eyed teddy bear named Chauncey being oversold as the movies’ devil toy du jour. When kids invent friends to play with, they’re showing how fertile they are with their idle hours, and how resilient and efficient the brain can be. In fact, I’d bet if you tasked any child with a rewrite on this script (credited to director Jeff Wadlow, Greg Erb and Jason Oremland), you’d likely come up with something way more colorful, fun and freaky than the zipless cafeteria food ladled onto our laps. “Imaginary” arrives in the shadow of the new date-night classic “M3GAN” (also from Blumhouse), itself a benchmark in the weaponizing of a troubled kid’s playtime, revealing in its craftiness a surprisingly rich engagement with tech-age loves and fears. “Imaginary”  is marked by a similar starter kit of broken-home emotions: Earnest stepmom and storybook illustrator Jessica (DeWanda Wise) thinks the way to deepen her relationships with the glum daughters of her new husband (a negligible Tom Payne) is to move everyone into her old childhood home.  Teenage Taylor (Taegen Burns) mopes and sasses, but nervous moppet Alice (Pyper Braun) finds joy in an understuffed, red-vested bear discovered (where else?) behind a hidden door in a spooky basement. Chauncey soon exerts a remarkable, eventually menacing control over Alice, who  voices what he tells her, triggering Jessica’s own repressed trauma. But where “M3GAN” felt alive to the culty potential of a malevolent plaything, “Imaginary” skips the directive to entertain, coming off as stiff, pedestrian and dreary as a March space-filler can get. When Betty Buckley’s grandmotherly scholar shows up to give us a crash course in the cultural history of kids with spirit besties, an already weak film suddenly exhibits the tedium of a book report. (Since when did horror screenwriters feel the need to start explaining everything? Oh, “The Innocents,” take me away.) Wadlow is, frankly, terrible with actors. Wise, his lead, has plenty of presence, but she never seems to be truly grappling with nightmares, tormented stepkids, a creative block, a father in an assisted living facility and the fallout of a truly horrendous family relo. The awkwardness is evenly applied: Anytime two people in the same scene are supposed to know each other, they look as if they’ve just met. Wadlow can even make a motionless plush animal seem poorly directed. Chauncey is the least of his problems, though, when what’s been structured around those moments feels like a paint-by-numbers exercise and not a true wade into terrifying waters. When the final act shifts to a world behind a portal — remember, there’s a kid here named Alice — you feel “Imaginary” giving up any interest in shaking our senses, hoping a late injection of CGI twists will do the trick. If kids can grow out of their pretend pals, so too can horror audiences of cynical snoozes like this.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," 
	There’s a lot to unpack in the new horror film from Blumhouse, which seems designed to provide fodder for family therapy sessions throughout the country.  
	The new house is where Alice finds the bear, who at first seems harmless enough. Everyone keeps referring to it as Alice’s “imaginary friend,” much like the one that Jessica herself had in the same house many years earlier. Alice seems happily content with Chauncey, sitting down for a tea party with him and playing hide and seek. But their close relationship grows increasingly disturbing, especially when he makes her engage in a scavenger hunt that turns dangerous. 
	But wait, it gets better, although for the sake of avoiding spoilers too many more plot details won’t be revealed. Suffice it to say that Alice soon goes missing, that her imaginary friend is not so imaginary, and that everyone winds up in an alternate dimension resembling an M.C. Escher drawing and featuring various monsters including a very large guy in a bear suit. 
	And then there’s the supporting character of Gloria, a creepy old woman who wanders around the neighborhood at all hours and seems desperate for conversation. It turns out that she’s Jessica’s former babysitter and has inside knowledge of her past nightmarish experiences. She’s also an author who specializes in the subject of imaginary friends, which comes in very handy when the group decides to offer a benediction to summon a spirit from another realm. Nostalgia buffs will enjoy the fact that Gloria is played by Betty Buckley, who established her horror bona fides so many years ago in the original Carrie (and more recently in M. Night Shyamalan’s Split). The veteran actress plays the role to the hilt, clearly relishing the opportunity to enjoy the sort of late-career renaissance in horror films as such Hollywood legends as Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," 
	It used to be that if a horror movie wasn’t very good, it was probably too simplistic in its fear mechanics: stalker on the loose, ghost in the attic, don’t go in the basement. Today, though, it’s often the case that megaplex horror schlock isn’t too simple — it’s too busy, too fraught with convolutions. Instead of jump scares, we get world-building hoops to jump through. 
	In its skittery, overlayered trickiness, what “Imaginary” lacks is a grounded feeling for the psychology that binds children to the friends they make up. “M3GAN,” which was also a Blumhouse production (a far superior one), had that kind of catchy and scannable horror-film psychology in the relationship that developed between Violet McGraw’s Cady and her lethal robot-doll BFF. But psychology, in too many films these days, is the dramatic ingredient that gets left on the shelf (that’s true even in a certain current acclaimed big hit — a movie with more sand than psychology). “Imaginary,” despite a few creepy moments, is starved for scenes that make the fear it’s showing you relatable. 
	There’s a moment, of the purest camp, where a therapist is interviewing Alice, with Chauncey the Teddy bear sitting there, and Alice is speaking in both their voices. Suddenly, the bear talks without her. The therapist, scared and disturbed, asks Jessica if Alice has been studying ventriloquism. I guess that’s a rational question, but it’s also a preposterous one. The other element “Imaginary” lacks is any supple sense of family dynamics. The director, Jeff Wadlow, establishes to the point of overkill that Taylor resents the existence of her stepmother, but the film still makes Jessica into too much of an interloper. The girls’ real mother, it turns out, was a violent head case, which just tosses one more layer of undigested material into the stew. 
	That said, you know you’re in the hands of a horror-movie pro whenever Betty Buckley shows up, in oversize glasses and clipped Middle American suburban dowager hair, and with an intrusive smirk, as Gloria, the busybody of a neighbor who used to babysit for Jessica when she was a little girl. Gloria, who discovered the sinister metaphysics of the imaginary-friend world back then, has written a historical tome about the subject. She’s officially obsessed, and might even be one of the villains. Yet Buckley, with the teasing clarity of her delivery, makes Gloria that rare thing, a Karen you don’t want to stop listening to. ",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Past and present trauma fuse in Jeff Wadlow’s “Imaginary,” the latest in the Blumhouse catalog of reliably creepy horror movies whose fans typically expect well-executed jump scares, fun plot twists and the occasional rubbery monster. What they probably don’t expect is the sophisticated allegory that “Imaginary” appears to be flirting with — and comes close to pulling off — before losing its nerve. Or maybe it’s my imagination gone supernova alongside that of little Alice (a delightful Pyper Braun) and her stepmother, Jessica (DeWanda Wise), a writer and illustrator of children’s books. After Jessica’s father is settled in a care facility, she and her family — including a rebellious teen (Taegen Burns) and a guitar-playing husband (Tom Payne) who smartly buzzes off on tour when things get hairy — move into her childhood home. Almost immediately, Alice is conversing with a stuffed teddy bear she finds in the basement, an imaginary friend whose increasingly sinister games stir memories Jessica has long suppressed. On one level, then, we have a mildly embellished haunted-house picture, entertainingly realized mainly with puppets and other practical effects. There’s also the familiar eerie neighbor (here played by the wonderful Betty Buckley) whose job is to help us make sense of the story’s woo-woo logic. What’s also playing out, though, are the lonely struggles of a stressed-out second wife, who is Black, to connect with the distant, sometimes resentful white stepdaughters whose mentally ill birth mother is not entirely out of the picture. In that sense, the movie’s devolution into, by my count, at least three attempted endings suggests some dithering over whether to deliver the logical conclusion to Jessica’s sacrificial trajectory, or ease the transition to a possible sequel. As to which prevails, you’ll have to use your imagination.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," It’s yet another sub-par day at the Blumhouse factory, production line operating at full, breakneck speed, yet machinery on the perilous verge of total collapse. The house of horror, behind hit franchises like Insidious, Paranormal Activity and The Purge, has become something of a franchise in itself, a branded string of low-budget films making a high profit, yet quality control has forever been an issue and in the last year or so, it’s barely existed. On the first cursed weekend of January 2023, usually home to the most unintentionally horrifying horror films, M3gan upended critical expectations and scored reviews as impressive as its box office total. But normality soon resumed with a limp Insidious sequel, a junky time travel slasher, a loathed Exorcist reboot, an astonishingly dull video game adaptation and, most recently, a soggy haunted pool horror. Yet somehow, the very worst was yet to come and now here it is, crash-landing into cinemas with an embargo so late some preview audiences will have already started watching it. Imaginary, teased by an audio-first, cinema-only trailer far smarter than the movie itself, is a shameless grab bag of stolen parts clumsily stitched together with such carelessness, it’s a miracle it’s even getting a theatrical release. The bar might have fallen to its lowest ever point for studio horror but it’s still a surprise to see just how bad things can really get. I was kinder than most about writer-director Jeff Wadlow’s first Blumhouse offering, the gimmicky yet fun franchise non-starter Truth or Dare, which worked just about enough in a low stakes kinda way, a Final Destination rip-off for the sleepover crowd. His follow-up Fantasy Island was a disordered mess, trying and failing to do far too much and there’s a similar level of unearned confidence on display in his latest, world-building done with an unsteady hand and an unfocused mind. Things start off in familiar genre territory as a woman named Jessica (played by DeWanda Wise) returns to her childhood home with new family in tow, husband Max (British actor Tom Payne) and his two children from a former marriage. Both Jessica and Max have some sort of trauma in their past – her absent father, his mentally unwell ex-wife – and both are hoping that a new start will help them heal. But when youngest daughter Alice (Pyper Braun) finds an old teddy bear and claims it as her new imaginary friend Chauncey, their dream home becomes a nightmare. While red flags start to fly pretty early on – some bad acting, some even worse dialogue – the build-up is at the very least competent, if entirely derivative, recalling the 2005 Robert De Niro thriller Hide and Seek as well as Poltergeist and M3gan, a child falling into dangerous fantasy dragged deeper by a nefarious presence. But like so many horror films these days, it’s a logline scrawled on a napkin rather than a fully-formed and fully thought-out script and so when the plot inevitably thickens, the cracks turn into chasms and a two-star time-waster descends into a one-star catastrophe. Along with the year’s other Blumhouse misstep Night Swim, Imaginary feels like the sort of bottom-shelf shocker that would have littered video stores decades ago, modernised only by its almost parodic obsession with trauma, the word that has ruined many a horror film of late. The last act, as drip-drip creepiness turns into flash flood chaos, is a laughably incoherent string of question marks – how did they, how could she, what was that – which plays out as if it were being made up on the spot, sloppy enough for a refund, Wadlow and his co-writers Greg Erb and Jason Oremland in need of a stern sense-checker. There’s such lumbering gracelessness to how rules are introduced – characters stumbling over nonsensical realisations and reveals – and such shamelessness to how other, better films and shows are copied. There are too many to list but you can feel elements of It, Beetlejuice, Housebound, Come Play, Stranger Things and most obviously Coraline with a visual trick so brazenly similar, legal action should follow. Wise can be a charming presence elsewhere but there’s only so much that can be done with the suffocatingly soapy dialogue she’s lumped with and she quickly gets lost in the murk surrounding her. Even the promise of Betty Buckley playing a mysterious neighbour frantically ranting about demonic mythology isn’t as much fun as it should have been. Wadlow has spoken of his desire to make a four-quadrant horror intended for a broader audience, the likes of which audiences saw more of in the 1980s, operating like a rollercoaster that’s exciting in the moment but unlikely to leave a mark. It’s an admirable mission statement and given how self-serious so many horror films can now be, aiming for more fun is no bad thing but Imaginary is far too dumb and ungainly to move at the pace required and bring the thrills it should, a theme park ride that should be closed for repairs.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Blumhouse seems to be trying to cobble together an eventual superteam of anthropomorphic, robotic, or stuffed serial killer toys. The latest member to join M3GAN and the Five Nights at Freddy’s gang in this unofficial Murderer’s Row is Chauncey, the creepy stuffed bear at the heart of Imaginary. But working against Chauncey is that the movie he’s stuck in is unimaginative, lacking in scares, and stuffed not with cotton but with bland horror cliches that even genre fans will be bored by. A movie about a terrifying killer bear friend should be a lot scarier than this. The most imaginary thing about Imaginary are any frights you’ll have sitting through it. DeWanda Wise, such a presence in the most recent Jurassic World movie, stars as Jessica. The tropes begin right away as Jessica and her husband Max (Tom Payne) move into her childhood hom with his his two daughters from a prior marriage. Psychological trauma is all over the place here. Jessica clearly had something horrible happen to her as a child, memories she seems to be repressing but are coming out in the children’s stories she pens as an author. Max’s ex-wife also suffers from mental illness and has been a threat to his daughters, Taylor (Taegen Burns), and the youngest, Alice (Pyper Braun). It’s Alice who is struggling the most, but she finds some comfort when she discovers an old teddy bear, promisingly hidden away in a secret basement compartment. She names him Chauncey, and her new imaginary friend becomes the catalyst for some disturbing, increasingly dangerous behavior. Director and co-writer Jeff Wadlow has become a Blumhouse favorite for making easy-to-digest horror movies with a minimum of blood and violence. It’s a crucial component to the Blumhouse formula of maxing out audience appeal for their small-budget line of horrors that they drop on us every couple of months with conveyor belt consistency. Wadlow impressed me with his breakout film, a personal favorite, Cry_Wolf, a slasher with very little on-screen bloodshed to speak of but had loads of personality. Following his dreadful Kick-Ass 2 misstep, which wasn’t totally his fault, he’s found modest success for Blumhouse on the Final Destination-esque Truth or Dare, and again with the bloated Fantasy Island remake. Imaginary is less of a movie than it is a single idea stretched thin for 100-minutes. Wadlow fills the gaps with generically ominous music, hoping that’s enough to keep reaction shots of Chauncey’s murderous teddy bear face from becoming a punchline. It doesn’t work. You’ll also laugh yourself silly at everything this movie liberally “borrows” from better horror movies from the past. Cliches such as creepy kids’ drawings, rebellious teens, ineffective psychiatrists, menacing toys playing more menacing tunes, and a clueless husband who seems unaware of the threat to his family. They should’ve had Patrick Wilson play him, that stereotypical role has become so worn out over the years. While the cast mostly struggles with a terrible script, horror veteran Betty Buckley makes the most of her scenes as a nosey neighbor linked to Jessica’s past. Buckley plays the role with all of the histrionic excess that a film this ridiculous deserves. It’s a shame that Imaginary is so devoid of frights because there are some solid aspects here, including relative intense build where Jessica’s natural instincts clash with her repressed memories. Wise is such a talented actress she can convey Jessica’s desire to be a good stepmother to the girls, but also her frustration at the mounting issues preventing that from happening. Wadlow mixes an array of dynamic colors with shadow to capture images both surreal and frightening, much like a child’s vivid imagination. Imaginary takes from everything from Coraline to Child’s Play, but surprisingly also from Toy Story. While the toys in that Pixar classic were saddened when ignored by their child owners and used it to inspire adventure, Chauncey refuses to be left behind and will destroy everyone to make sure it doesn’t happen. In a way, it’s a twist on the well-worn idea that what evil spirits want most is life. It’s actually quite a cool idea that might’ve worked with more commitment to making Chauncey a fearsome paranormal threat, but Imaginary plays it far too safe to offer any memorable thrills.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," THE GREAT ESCAPER ***1/2 (96 minutes)  M
In his final film before announcing his retirement, Michael Caine is effortlessly fabulous in The Great Escaper, playing real-life figure Bernie Jordan who, in 2014, went AWOL from his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversary commemoration on the D-Day landings. In her final film before passing away, Glenda Jackson puts in an equally wonderful turn as Irene, Bernie’s loving wife who remains at the home trying to provide cover before the truth of Bernie’s disappearance inevitably surfaces. Delicately directed by Oliver Parker from a screenplay by William Ivory (Made in Dagenham), the film’s sweet tone thankfully never veers into sentimentality; the story remains grounded in the tragedy of war, building to a memorable scene decrying the human cost of battle. A beautifully etched performance by John Standing as RAF veteran Arthur, who befriends Bernie with a touching gesture of camaraderie, further underscores the life-long mental scars war can inflict. There are some nicely judged moments of humour as Bernie becomes an unintentional celebrity but these never overwhelm the film’s themes of sorrow, loss and closure. To wit: one near-silent vignette shows figures standing on the near-empty beach at Normandy, a stirring reminder of how war can imbue an otherwise picturesque location with the chill of memory.
Bear vs Kid in ‘Imaginary’. IMAGINARY ***1/2 (104 minutes) M 
The style is strong and the ambience creepy as the long tradition of scary movie kids continues apace in Imaginary, a high-quality horror jaunt that’ll make you see cute stuffed toys a whole new light. When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) and husband Tom (Tom Payne) move in to her childhood home she notes with nostalgic delight how her step-daughter Alice (Pyper Braun) – a movie name that has long been an omen of impending nastiness; Alice, Sweet Alice anyone? – has taken to her old teddy bear, Chauncey. Well directed by Jeff Wadlow, who does a fine job generating just the right mood of supernatural paranoia – thanks in large part to a terrific turn by veteran Betty Buckley as a creepy-ass neighbour – the film carries the formidable stamp of Blumhouse Productions. Dedicated to horror films that boast some originality, the studio has largely been good to its word, knocking out consistently good horror fodder such as: Insidious; The Purge; Unfriended; The Black Phone; M3GAN and, most recently, Five Nights at Freddy’s. HOW TO HAVE SEX ***1/2 (91 minutes) MA
Blessed with a caustically ironic title this finely directed, zeitgeist-tapping sex drama dives into the downside of raunch culture as three post-high school British girls join the hormonally pre-occupied throngs at a hot holiday spot. Looking for fun and hopefully a few casual hook-ups with similarly minded guys with laddish swagger and zero body fat, the girls find prospects in the adjacent apartment with Tara (Mia McKenna-Bruce) becoming entwined with bad boy Paddy (Samuel Bottomley) whose seduction strategy takes them to the beach. Rather than deploy off-the-shelf clichés about toxic masculinity, writer/director Molly Manning Walker (in a very strong debut) instead opts for a more nuanced engagement with the issues of consent and the presumption of sexual entitlement. Nobody gets off lightly as the truth behind events unfold. Full of challenging questions and confronting conversation triggers, the film offers unforced observations about excessive drinking, female bonding, blithe degradation – that pool party scene is hard to stomach – and recreational sex through an impressive raft of naturalistic performances, especially from McKenna-Bruce and Shaun Thomas, who plays Paddy’s mate Badger. CABRINI **1/2 (145 minutes; part subtitled) M
Dedicated to the adoration of feisty proto-feminist nun Francesca Cabrini, Cabrini is a loving and long biopic detailing her dogged fight against anti-Italian prejudice as she and her sisters work to help the poor and starving immigrant souls of late-1800s New York. Lovingly directed on a noticeably big budget, Alejandro Monteverde (Sound of Freedom) mounts Cabrini as an historical melodrama about bigotry, dignity, morality and political corruption – often all in the one scene. Propelled by a strong central performance from Cristiana Dell’Anna, who projects a subdued-yet-unmistakable “don’t fool with me” attitude to all the people who give her stick – and there are a lot of them – the film is a punchy, if prolonged, paean to Cabrini in particular and, more generally, to the under-acknowledged truth the people of faith have the capacity to be huge troublemakers.  This, of course, follows the lead of Jesus Christ, whose example instructed his followers to defy authority, especially when it was in the service of his dictates. By this measure, Cabrini proved herself a heck of a kick-ass Catholic, confronting everyone from the Pope, her archbishop (David Morse) and the Apple’s mayor (a heavily bearded John Lithgow). The production is handsome – kudos for the film’s recreation of old New York streetscapes – and there’s no doubting the tenacity Cabrini possessed in kick-starting a global network of hospitals designed to help the poor. That said, the film is a bit of a tub-thumper, with loud declarations about the power of women and the rights of the poor to decent health care.",POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024"," With the worrying proliferation of artificial intelligence now frequently implemented (or encouraged to be used) towards creative endeavors, we jest when we come across something ostensibly human-made that nevertheless feels born of AI. It’s a bleak, if facetious, admittance of our own potential incapability to distinguish what’s man-made trash and what’s robot-made. Case in point: While watching the new Blumhouse horror film Imaginary—directed by Truth or Dare and Kick-Ass 2 auteur Jeff Wadlow—the question around the extent to which AI was or was not utilized was constantly present in my mind, to the point where I felt I was legitimately going insane. The screenplay of Imaginary is credited to humans. Three to be exact: Wadlow himself, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland. And yet there is nothing in the film which doesn’t appear to be pulled from an algorithmic ether and designed to hit all the right buttons of what an audience would presumably want to see in a horror film…because they’ve already loved it in the past. Our story follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise), an artist and author of a popular children’s book series, who moves back into the childhood home after her deteriorating father has been placed in an assisted care facility. She’s accompanied by her tattooed hipster musician husband Max (Tom Payne) and Max’s two daughters from a previous marriage, mouthy teenager Taylor (Taegen Burns) and the much younger Alice (Pyper Braun). Unsurprisingly, this previous marriage was to a mentally unwell woman who went insane for undisclosed reasons and got herself locked up in an asylum. Also, unsurprisingly, she later escapes from said institution to warn her daughters of the impending horrors that await them, because neurodivergent people typically have the psychic ability to sense foreboding supernatural doom (we’ve seen this all play out before, of course).  While exploring her new home’s creepy basement, a basement that looks like every other creepy basement in a million other horror movies, Alice, a precocious girl who speaks like an adult in a child’s body trying to mimic how children speak, finds a hidden door which leads to a worn, abandoned teddy bear named Chauncey. Alice attaches herself to the toy and begins to manifest Chauncey as her imaginary friend. And it’s not too long before her behavior starts rapidly altering as she appears to be doing her new friend’s bidding—like embarking on an innocent scavenger hunt that requires Alice to slam her little palm into a rusty nail.  Jessica manages to stop this heinous act at the last moment, which is probably a more stressful time bonding with her stepdaughters while Max is away touring with his band (???) than she probably anticipated. Eventually, Jessica unlocks more of her traumatic past, and the strange puzzle pieces of the situation begin falling into place. When she was just five, she was sent to live with her grandparents after her father went insane following the death of Jessica’s mom. But Jessica realizes that this past involves the same Chauncey who Alice now totes around having full conversations with, who tells Alice that she’s going somewhere called the “never ever.” Meanwhile, Taylor, incensed at the idea of having to kowtow to a fake mother, acts out by bringing a neighborhood boy over who promptly insults her younger sister and tries plying Taylor with molly that later turns out to be allergy medicine. While trying to manage the stresses of new motherhood and an encroaching and unknowable evil, it’s up to Jessica to unlock the repressed secrets of her past to keep Alice from being transported to the world of a malignant spirit that wants to play with her forever. That aforementioned scenario with the neighbor boy and the fake drugs is just one of a seemingly endless supply of absurd, narratively jarring situations, conversations and plot points. Sometimes these scenes are downright laugh out loud, like the baffling introduction of an elderly woman referred to as “Old Bag Patterson” by the delinquent young neighbor, the teen drug bust, or when Alice’s therapist is so alarmed by a “conversation” she observes the child having with Chauncey that she gravely asks Jessica if Alice has taken up ventriloquism as a new hobby. I was so totally baffled by the extent to which Imaginary feels cobbled together by tried-and-true tropes, and how unabashedly banal it is in nearly every aspect, that there was no other conclusion I could come to than to start my own little conspiracy that Imaginary is the first totally AI-generated screenplay. I know that’s not the case, but nevertheless, everything about the film feels off in a way that I’ve never experienced before—as if the entire film exists in the same uncanny valley as those demented Polar Express children. Every aspect feels tailored to meet certain horror movie quota. A creepy child talking to someone no one else can see? Check. A creepy toy possessed by something unknown and evil and can move on its own sometimes? Check. A female lead with a traumatic past? Check. A creepy old woman harboring secrets? Check. A creepy basement? Check. And about 50 shots of an entity lingering out-of-focus just behind our characters, after which the camera pulls away until it returns to the same spot with the entity now missing? Yes, even the camerawork appears to have been tested by a focus group. Characters even speak in a way that’s less like a robot approximating conversation by attempting to mimic human speech, and more like a robot approximating how humans speak to one another in a movie. Nearly every line of dialogue reads like a slightly off-kilter cliché that was both said a million times in other films before and also said much better, by better actors. There are few redeeming factors in Imaginary, except maybe the final boss Chauncey Bear demon, which looks so tangible I’d be shocked to find out it wasn’t a puppet. The design of the creature is genuinely frightening, and it moves in that slow, stilted way physical creations tend to in films, which filmmakers have since gone on to dismiss in favor of the uncanny, awful smoothness of CGI. If it is indeed a puppet, it’s a nice touch in a film which otherwise coasts on complete unremarkability. If it’s not, well, then I suppose credit where credit’s due to the VFX artists who managed such an affecting spectacle. Yet I still can’t help but view even this positive aspect with just a hint of suspicious cynicism due to all the other off-putting parts of the movie. If Chauncey’s presence is indeed tactile, maybe the choice to erect him as a real object was another cog in the algorithm machine; a choice made less out of reverence for tangible FX than one decided by the all-knowing AI gods deemed as more likely to appeal to audiences.  Regardless of whether or not Imaginary was created with the power of AI behind it, it’s still a clear reflection of the film industry’s emphasis on copying its own work. And to what end? So that we can have a horror movie so derivative that it becomes uniquely terrible? The desire to make AI cracks about slop like this comes, perhaps, from me having too much respect for screenwriters—how could years of cinema history lead to Imaginary without something dark, sinister and inhuman behind it? Human incompetence is more terrifying to me than artificial intelligence; we talk about our pressing existential fears around AI, yet we’re quite clearly capable of perverting our own art forms into garbage all on our own.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Well, since last weekend’s column, I took the plunge – in other words, I quit Above the Line in quite a loud and glorious way. I mean, I had already given them my notice weeks ago, but there were no signs of me or any of the writers being paid, and I finally reached my limit of how much bullshit I could take. If you want to read more about it, you can do so here, but honestly, I just want to try to move on. My three and half years there have been extremely stressful and traumatic, even though I kept trying my best to make this work out. The simple fact is that I can’t keep working for free… except when writing this column. But at least my boss here treats me well, feeds me, gives me regular naps, etc. etc. Hopefully something else will come along, but I’ll be doing this and of course, continuing at Gold Derby, as long as I possibly can.

I’ve reviewed four very different movies, though one of the reviews is embargoed until Thursday night.  The big release for the weekend is the fourth movie in DreamWorks Animation’s long-running animated franchise, featuring Jack Black as the voice of Po, the martial arts eschewing panda bear, who needs to find his successor as Dragon Warrior, to become a Spiritual Advisor to the Valley of Peace. Soon, Po learns that an evil sorceress known as the Chameleon (voiced by Viola Davis) threatens the Valley of Peace, so he turns to a thieving fox named Zhen, voiced by Awkwafina, as they go on a journey to stop the Chameleon. As you can guess from the number in the title, this is the fourth installment of a franchise that seemed to peter out with the third installment in 2016 but actually has been kept alive through streaming on both Netflix and Peacock, where the original theatrical releases and a few specials and series have thrived, most recently on Netflix, but with a series leading up to the third movie that’s kept avid young fans entertained. Kung Fu Panda 4 also benefits from there not really being many other animated movies in theaters, other than Universal’s Migration, which has done quite well.  Mini-Review: It feels necessary, nae mandatory, to question whether a fourth movie in any animated franchise is something that’s really warranted or necessary. As far as Jack Black’s title character in this franchise, he’s been keeping kids entertained for 15 years, not only in the three theatrical movies but also in a number of streaming series and specials, so he might have already reached a Shrek level of popularity even without having a Broadway musical. The premise for the fourth movie is about as simple as you can get, the biggest new addition being a character voiced by the ubiquitous (and frequently annoying) Awkwafina, who showed so much range in The Farewell, but just can’t come close to then when just providing her voice.  Directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls, The Lego Movie 2), this installment is written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, who wrote the previous three Kung Fu Panda movies, so it’s a little surprising how unfunny this one. It’s as if they ran out of joke ideas after writing the other movies, and that really hurts the movie, since it was always a mix of humor and frenetic action. In fact, the action is so frenetic it’s dizzyingly hard to follow at times, and it isn’t nearly as impressive as previous movies that took its cues from classic Shaw Brothers and other HK martial arts classics. Not having Po’s colleagues in the Furious Five also hurts the movie greatly, so instead, the movie turns to a slew of lesser-developed characters, both old and new, with some used better than others. There’s a whole side-journey involving Po’s father Ping and Li (James Hong, Bryan Cranston) as they search for their son, which often provides a welcome change from the Po/Zhen bits, but again, all the characters are just following the most standard storytelling formula. Other characters voiced by Ke Huy Quan and Ronny Chieng show up, say a few lines, and then are gone, neither of their characters offering much in terms of charm, personality, or anything particularly memorable. Viola Davis does a fine job voicing what turns out to be a sub-standard villain, as we’re reminded of some of the better villains as her Chameleon captures them to their steal their martial arts skills using Po’s Staff of Wisdom. Things basically go along as expected until a big battle finale, and the relationship between Po and Zhen goes exactly where it’s expected to go, so it doesn’t feel like anything in the movie really does much to add to the mythos set up by earlier films. From Blumhouse comes another high-concept horror film, this one the latest PG-13 film from Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare, Fantasy Island), starring DeWanda Wise (Jurassic World: Dominion) as Jessica, a woman who returns to her childhood home with her husband and two stepdaughters, as the younger one starts communicating with an imaginary friend that might be connected to Jessica’s own imaginary friend from childhood. But this friend, Chauncy Bear, may have malevolent intentions for Jessica’s entire family. After the disappointing showing for Night Swim in January, a movie that quite liked that was distributed/marketed by Universal, one wonders if these Blumhouse high concept horror films may be running their course, and how Imaginary does will certainly control that narrative.  Lionsgate has embargoed reviews until Thursday night at 8pm, so you’ll have to wait until then to find out how much I absolutely fucking loathed this movie. This was absolute garbage. Mini-Review: While Imaginary is about as high-concept horror as you can possibly get, essentially about an imaginary friend that was deserted by a young girl and who turns out to be quite evil when the now-woman returns to the house with her new family. Maybe you’ve seen the trailer or commercial in front of far-better horror movies (or before Five Nights at Freddy’s, which sucked), but for the most part, this is exactly what’s being touted… except that it’s not scary… Nor is it very good. And yet, this is still not the worst horror movie I’ve seen this year. (That would still be Founder’s Day.) I mentioned Night Swim above, and I believe that I reviewed it over on that site that is now gone and quite liked it, but when you watch Imaginary and realize that it uses a very similar story about a family moving into a house and weird and bad things happening to them, then you may start thinking that Blumhouse may want to take a step away from this particular horror sub-genre for a bit. DeWanda Wise (who is also one of the film’s producers) is perfectly fine, but so much of the focus is put on her younger stepdaughter Alice, played by Pyper Braun, possibly one of the most obnoxious and annoying child actors in recent memory. l know that it’s kind of mean to pick on a child actor, but you know what? There are plenty of young actors that could have pulled this role off better, but this was a combination of bad casting and just plain old bad direction. My biggest issue with Imaginary is that it literally rips off Insidious, another Blumhouse production – I mean, it’s fairly blatant – so besides the typical cheap jump scares Wadlow is best known for, we get so much that just isn’t particularly original either. There’s even a pesky neighbor woman, kind of taking on the Lin Shaye role, someone who knows so much about what is going on and proceeds to tell the other characters ad nauseum via ridiculous exposition about what she knows… and the whole thing just gets more ridiculous the more words that come out of her mouth. By now, Blumhouse should realize that these sorts of movies have to be at least partially fun to keep viewers on board, and Imaginary is just grim, going down this rabbit hole that seems to point to some past abuse suffered by Jessica as a girl but never really outright stating it. There’s also her aging father who is in a home and seemingly suffering from dementia, though it ends up being something related to the house and what happened decades earlier. He’s another character that could have easily been omitted, and the movie would have been just fine. Instead, it’s a disaster that is already teetering on the edge of going over a cliff by the third act.  Imaginary isn’t scary, it’s barely entertaining, and it’s a flagrant rip-off of much better movies, including quite a few from Blumhouse. It’s likely to leave even the most casual of horror fans disappointed. This may be one of Blumhouse’s worse movies since… well… Five Nights at Freddy’s, but this one combines bad writing with absolute incompetence, making it quite a bit worse.  This is quite a different movie from faith-based film specialists Angel Studios, which is actually the new film from Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Monteverde, who had such an enormous hit in 2023 with Sound of Freedom. It stars Cristiana Dell'Anna as Mother Frances Cabrini, an Italian nun who is sent to New York City in the late 19th Century by the Vatican to run an orphanage for the impoverished kids of Five Points. Once she gets to New York with a group of sisters, Mother Cabrini realizes that she needs help, so she turns to the Archbishop (David Morse) and eventually, the city’s mayor (John Lithgow), only to be rebuffed, as she realizes that the anti-immigrant sentiment goes right to the top. Still, she fights to get the money and help she needs, eventually helping the city’s Italian community achieve the respect that they’ve build upon for over a century.  Mini-Review: I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this film, which is mostly a straight-ahead biopic, but being about a nun and being from faith-based film specialists, Angel Studios, I was expecting there to be a lot more praying and God-stuff. That really isn’t the case at all, even with the primary character being a nun, and it also involving the Vatican and a New York archbishop.  Even though I live not far from the former Five Points (just a few blocks away actually), I didn’t really know much about the country and city at the time, outside of what I saw in Scorsese’s Gangs of New York. Right off the bat, I was impressed by how Monteverde and his team recreated the impoverished, crime-ridden area and then contrasted the have-notes with the much wealthier New York City inhabitants of the time, presumably with a much smaller budget than Scorsese.  Being that much of the film criticism community are liberal atheists (presumably), it’s easy to understand why there’s such a pushback against the “genre,” and why many filmmakers behind these movies don’t feel the urge to screen them for critics outside the bible belt, but Cabrini could just as easily been watched as a biopic about someone famous ala Bob Marley, Maestro, except that it has the added benefit of being somewhat educational about the history of someone who was honestly trying to do something first for the city’s immigrants and impoverished, and then for the rest of the country and world.  Honestly, Cabrini is a terrific biopic about a benevolent personality that (similar to the recent Ordinary Angel) does not feel the need to hit its audience over the head with the spirituality behind the storytelling. It’s just trying to tell semi-true-ish stories about good people trying to do good things in hopes of inspiring others to do the same, and there’s nothing really wrong with that. At times, Cabrini may be a fairly traditional biopic, but Mother Cabrini is just a fascinating and inspirational woman from history who few will know about, and for that alone, Monteverde’s ability to tell her story in such a cinematic way makes Cabrini a worthwhile endeavor with a strong moral compass. Saint Maud filmmaker Rose Glass returns with this thriller, starring Kristen Stewart as Lou, a manager at a gym in a small Western town where she meets drifter and bodybuilder Jackie (Katy M. O’Brian from The Mandalorian), and the two fall in love. When Lou’s sister (Jena Malone) ends up in the hospital at the hands of her husband (Dave Franco), Lou threatens to do something about it, but it’s Jackie who does something about it, putting them both at odds with Lou’s criminal father, played by Ed Harris. This will open in New York and L.A. this Friday and then expand nationwide on March 15. Mini-Review: I don’t remember being nearly as big a fan of Saint Maud as others were, but it’s also a movie that got delayed for over a year due to the pandemic after debuting at the September festivals in 2019. I honestly can’t remember when, how or where I saw it, as I got it mixed up with The Lodge quite a bit. But at least Glass’ second movie is being released shortly after its Sundance premiere, where it received mostly rave reviews. This is set in such a different setting for Glass, rural America, essentially a Red State where guns and homophobia are prevalent, which just makes the romance and relationship between Lou and Jackie so much more precious. We first meet Lou as she’s being pursued by a bubbly but annoying co-worker, played by Anna Baryshnikov, so we know right up front about her queerness, whereas Jackie is actually being F’ed in a car by Franco’s character when we meet her, in hope of getting a job, which she does as she is introduced to his father-in-law Lou Sr, who runs a shooting range. This is a film filled with great dark humor that often counters other parts that are just chillingly dark. In other words, this is just a perfect film for A24 to get out there to the audiences who thrive on this sort of edgy material, even if one wonders whether actual Red States would be open to the love story at the center of what is essentially a rural noir story. While Love Lies Bleeding does veer away from the horror and supernatural elements of Saint Maud, Glass delivers a gory crime-thriller on par with Nicolas Refn’s Drive in the way the story plays out with so many unexpected twists and turns. It’s a rare case where a sophomore effort far exceeds a filmmaker’s debut, since it shows far more range and makes you wonder what Ms. Glass might be able to do with an even larger budget. Peter Dinklage, Shirley MacLaine, and Matt Dillon star in this dramedy written by Theodore Melfi, which I saw at Tribeca way back in 2022, and it’s finally getting a limited release this weekend. It’s been so long since I’ve seen the movie, and I don’t think I liked it very much, so I decided not to rewatch again to write an actual review. In the film, Dinklage plays Phil Loder, a divorced economics professor hoping someday to own his own home, leading to him striking a dal with MacLaine’s Astrid Finnelli, a lonely widow who is near death who offers her estate for pennies, but under specific circumstances. This is actually based on a true story that was told on Chicago Public Radio’s “The American Life,” and I remember when I saw it thinking that there were so many ridiculous subplots that it made it hard to believe any of it was true. It’s a little amusing that this is being released the week after Problemista, which has a similar awkward relationship between a dreamer and an awful older woman. Mark Bristols’ dramedy, based on the novel “Chocolate Lizards” by Cole Thompson, stars Rudy Pankow as Erwin, a Harvard student whose first professional acting job in New Orleans goes so poorly that he runs away, only to have his car break down in the middle of Texas oil country with no phone service. He turns to diner waitress Faye (Carrie-Anne Moss) who offers to help him find a mechanic to fix his car but with no money, he turns to local oil driller Merle (Thomas Haden Church), who is also nearly bankrupt. This sounds like it could be fun, especially with Church, who is such an underrated comedic actor we haven’t seen that much of in recent years. Just didn’t find the time to watch for review.  This haunted hotel movie comes from the China Brothers, making their directorial debut, with Phoebe Tonkin as Gwen Taylor, a young woman working her first night shift at a hotel when she begins to think she’s being followed by a dangerous person from her past, but then realizes the hotel might actually be haunted. Hitting Prime Video this Thursday is the new comedy from Peter Farrelly, who seems to be returning to his high-concept comedies after a brief foray into Oscar territory with his Best Picture winning, Green Book. It stars Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler (The Blackness) as childhood friend who pull a prank by creating an imaginary guy named Ricky Stanicky out of trouble, and decades later, they still use him as an alibi until their partners get suspicious. They hire a washed-up actor named “Rock Hard” Rod, played by John Cena, to pretend to be Stanicky, but his raunchy behavior makes him wonder if that was the best move. This sounds like it could go either way, and I’m a little bummed I wasn’t able to watch this to review, because I do enjoy some of Farrelly’s sillier comedies, but this will be readily available to stream this weekend, so there’s no rush on seeing it. The single new series this weekend is “A Touch of Wang Hongwei,” focusing on the Chinese actor, screening Jia Zhanke’s A Touch of Sin (2013) and Chao Yang’s Crosscurrent (2016). “Bad Actress” has one more screening of Robert Aldrich’s classic thriller, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, as well as two screenings of Fassbinder’s Veronika Voss (1982).  “Forever Young” will once again screen La Haine and Ghost World, as well as Tsia Ming-Liang’s Rebels of the Neon God (1992) and Roger Kumble’s thriller Cruel Intentions (1999). “Also Starring… John Cazale” will follow the sad tale of Fredo Corleone in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, which will both screen again on Thursday, as will Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 thriller, The Conversation.  I’m quite bummed that I was out of town last weekend and haven’t been able to get to this excellent “Japanese Horror” series, which apparently, has been selling out most of its screenings, but there are more screenings this weekend, including some repeat showings. House, Godzilla, Dark Water, and Cure will screen on Friday, as well as much more over the weekend.  It’s strange to see MOMA doing a series on “Fleischer Cartoons,” just a week or so after I went out to Bushwick to see Tommy Stathes’ latest Cartoon Carnival, which focused on Fleischer cartoons, but that’s running from this coming Thursday through March 14. Again, it’s nice to see MOMA getting involved with celebrating these great vintage cartoons, but anyone who has seen Stathes’ programs, knows that he’s the real deal. “Snubbed 2: The Performances” continues through Oscar weekend with screenings of Andrew Bujalski’s Support the Girls (2018), The Heartbreak Kid (1972), and the Carl Reiner-directed All of Me (1984). There will also be a 10th Anniversary screening of Muppets Most Wanted (2014) on Saturday and Sunday. My #1 movie OF ALL TIME, Terry Gilliam’s Brazil will play three times on Monday, March 11. Sadly, I’m not sure I can get over there since I have other things to see that day. That’s it for this week. Next week, there’s Mark Wahlberg in Arthur the King and Sir Anthony Hopkins in One Life, The American Society of Magical Negroes, plus other things expanding wider, mostly.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024",A half-baked study of anguish from the guy who thought turning &#8220;Fantasy Island&#8221; into a horror movie was a good idea&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Maybe the first sign that “Imaginary” wasn’t going to pack the chills and frights you want is the fact that the teddy bear/imaginary friend is named…Chauncey. Onto the trash pile of middling killer-children’s-toy horrorshows one must now toss Imaginary, a lifeless hodgepodge of the hoariest cliches the genre has to offer. Lifting liberally from countless scary movies (with Henry Selick’s Coraline near the top of that list), this throwaway features creepy basements, harrowing nightmares, unsettling old ladies, fuzzy memories, bratty teens, helpful therapists, mentally unstable adults who can sense the supernatural, eerily bouncing balls, spooky shadow lanterns that play unnerving lullabies, foreboding kids’ drawings, uncanny family photographs, witchy magic rituals, secret doorways, inhuman specters, alternate universes, giant monsters, and M.C. Escher dreamscapes. Creakiest of all its hackneyed devices, though, is its villain: a teddy bear whose malevolent designs are about as routine as its appearance is mundane. Directed by Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare), who co-wrote its script with Greg Erb and Jason Oremland, Imaginary, which hit theaters Mar. 8, revolves around Jessica (DeWanda Wise), an author of a series of children’s novels about a cheery millipede and her evil arachnid nemesis. Jessica is married to musician Max (Tom Payne) and is stepmother to his daughters Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), the former a petulant 15-year-old who can’t stand Jessica and the latter a young girl reeling from the figurative loss of her mother, who suffers from some undefined psychological problems and is the apparent cause of arm burns that have left Alice fearful of fire. At the story’s outset, all of them move into the home where Jessica lived until she was five with her mom (who died of cancer) and dad (who’s now blind and in a nursing home). Still, she admits she can barely remember her time in the abode, for reasons that are quite obviously related to the forthcoming mayhem. No sooner has this foursome established themselves in the house than Alice is venturing into the poorly lit, junk-filled basement to discover a tiny door, behind which sits a stuffed bear that tells her—in dialogue that only she can hear—his name is Chauncey. While this plaything hasn’t previously made an on-screen appearance, Imaginary has already depicted an identical door in an intro dream sequence in which Jessica flees an enormous spider and navigates a smeary blue hallway. Alice endlessly talks to Chauncey, who always claims to be very, very hungry, and Jessica and Max initially find this to be both cute and a heartening sign that the girl is getting over whatever (undescribed) trauma she suffered with her biological mom. However, it’s not long before Alice’s fun and games with Chauncey—highlighted by a scavenger hunt around their property—turns weird, what with the bear demanding that Alice hurt herself by slamming her hand into a rusty nail. As Jessica continues working on her latest novel (which she also illustrates) and Alice chats away with her new imaginary BFF, Max departs the premises (and film) for a music tour and Taylor sneers at Jessica and flirts with next door neighbor Liam (Matthew Sato), who comes over when no one else is around and tries to ply her with drugs and booze. Alice doesn’t like Liam and neither, it turns out, does Chauncey. Yet despite having the bear play frightening tricks on the boy, Imaginary is too weak-kneed to depict anyone actually suffering—until, that is, its finale, during which one unfortunate character is slaughtered, albeit behind closed doors in order to let the film maintain its PG-13 rating. Of course, gruesomeness and ultra-violence need not be employed to generate scares, but modesty doesn’t get Wadlow anywhere, his material devoid of a single moment that registers as surprising or startling, much less terrifying. The stranger things get, the more Jessica begins suspecting that Chauncey is the culprit, thereby instigating a visit from a psychologist (Veronica Falcón) whose input further makes the heroine’s head spin. Fortunately for Jessica, her former babysitter Gloria (Betty Buckley) remains nearby and can provide all sorts of answers about Jessica’s past and, in particular, her own obsession with an imaginary friend. That fact, coupled with her unstable father’s comment about her disappearance as a kid, suggests that Jessica knows Chauncey or, at least, the spectral fiend that lurks in the house, potentially pulling the teddy bear’s strings. Gloria is one of those oh-so-convenient peripheral figures who’s an expert in the very chaos taking place, and courtesy of Buckley’s awkward and wooden performance, she comes across as a caricature of a typical horror type, all exposition and no personality. Whether encased in comforting sunshine or drenched in malignant darkness, Imaginary’s visuals are flat and derivative, and its dialogue is even more functional, full of repeated statements (“You should never have to leave the things you love”) that don’t mean anything on their own or in any larger narrative context. Stuck playing a cipher, Wise proves a serviceable if unremarkable lead, and everyone else similarly goes through the motions with forgettable competence. Chauncey, on the other hand, is as non-descript as they come, a ratty brown teddy with blank black eyes who doesn’t move, speak, or do anything calculating or menacing. In terms of sheer clumsiness, however, nothing tops the larger-than-life beasts that eventually stalk Jessica and company, given that they look like actors wearing shoddy homemade costumes. There’s something to be said for a 2024 film refusing to resort to the usual blurry and indistinct CGI that has become mainstream horror directors’ favorite tool, yet the cruddiness of these creatures nonetheless renders the big set pieces a joke. In its race toward a lame fake-out finale and, afterwards, an even more lackluster real one, the film cribs shamelessly from Coraline while evoking everything from Magic and Child’s Play to Dolls, A Nightmare on Elm Street and M3GAN. The central conceit of Wadlow’s tale is that imaginary friendships are two-way streets, and humans must treat them as such lest their make-believe buddies get bitter and covetous. Though that idea has some paranormal potential, the director executes it with all the invention and excitement of a paper bag. Striving to be hip by frequently invoking the name of Inside Out’s beloved Bing Bong, Imaginary proves a dreary ding dong of a thriller.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Netflix’s Damsel is a powerful twist on the classic fairytale trope that a Prince must swoop in to save the damsel in distress. Millie Bobby Brown oozes girl power as she is faced with what seems like an impossible task — defeat a fire breathing dragon who is extremely disgruntled. When Elodie (Brown) is tricked in to what seems like a fairytale wedding, she quickly realizes her mistake as she is thrust into a dragon’s layer as some sort of sacrifice. Refusing to just lay down and die, Damsel follows Elodie as she does everything in her power to survive, and to set things straight. This Netflix movie is packed with suspenseful moments and a whole lot of action. Millie Bobby Brown was the perfect choice as she looks the part of a princess, while having the badass moves to go toe-to-toe with a dragon. Something that really works with Damsel is that Elodie does not immediately have the guts to take on the dragon, and she certainly doesn’t know what she is doing. All too often movies like this will all of a sudden thrust the lead into situations they would never escape in real life, and has them do it without a scratch on them. While Elodie does have great survival instincts that kick in, she takes her hits too. These are intense situations with high stakes, and it isn’t easy for her.  Damsel doesn’t take too long to put Elodie into these situations, which is a good thing because just reading the synopsis will set viewers up for what is to come. If the movie took its time before putting Elodie in peril, it would have have dragged. Luckily they waste almost no time, only giving us the first act so that we can understand the situation and know some things that will come in handy in the future.  Brooke Carter, who plays Elodie’s sister Floria, has wonderful on screen chemistry with Millie Bobby Brown. The two truly feel like sisters. She isn’t in the movie a lot, but when she is, she earns her spot on the screen.  The same can be said for Angela Bassett, who quite frankly feels underused. She portrays Elodie and Floria’s stepsister and while she certainly shines in the movie, we could have used more time with her. It almost feels as if her character is done dirty, however we also understand needing to stick to a breezy runtime and remain under two hours for a film like this. Ray Winstone is fantastic as well, and a wonderful choice to play the girls’ father.  One of the biggest issues that this movie has is the dialogue. This is not the strong suit here, no matter which actor is doing the best they can with the script they are given. There are only a handful of times it doesn’t come off as forceful and being there only to drive the story forward, rather than allow us to connect with the characters. The choice that Damsel makes to have the dragon breath fire as well as what appears to be molten lava at the same time is a strange one. It brings something unique to the movie that we don’t often see, but it doesn’t exactly look good. In fact, the CG overall isn’t the best. Now, we did see it on the big screen in a theater, so it is sure to look better on a small screen while streaming at home.  At the same time, the dragon mostly looks really good, however there are few moments where it misses the mark. The overall design is unique and very, very, cool, but we can’t help but think they gave us too much of her. When something that is supposed to be scary is shown less often, and only alluded to in the shadows, it tends to be more effective. Still, her part of the story is incredible and brings a lot of heart to Damsel. Damsel turns the average fairytale on its head as we see Elodie face her fears and put everything she has into her survival. At the same time, she is strong willed where it matters, plotting to expose those who have done her wrong and enact revenge on them. During the third act, there is a major reveal that elevates the film to a whole new level. Should they have shied away from this, the movie would not work nearly as well as it does. This movie is inspiring and is sure to be a treat for young women, who have a lot to learn from it. Millie Bobby Brown commands attention and is able to carry the film while she is alone on screen, which is most of the time. Her supporting cast does exactly that, supports her in ways that help this movie to become something special. A dutiful damsel agrees to marry a handsome prince, only to find the royal family has recruited her as a sacrifice to repay an ancient debt. Thrown into a cave with a fire-breathing dragon, she must rely on her wits and will to survive. Tessa Smith is a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer-approved Film and TV Critic.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Imagine, if you will, a movie whose first half rehashes every convention of the modern suburban horror film, and whose final act plays like an unholy marriage of HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II and Pixar’s INSIDE OUT (which gets numerous shout-outs in the dialogue). Well, you don’t have to imagine it, because it’s not an imaginary film, it’s a film called IMAGINARY. If that was a little convoluted, well, it’s an appropriate way to introduce a review of IMAGINARY, which isn’t quite as overcomplicated as director Jeff Wadlow’s previous FANTASY ISLAND, though it comes close. This is another one of those horror films in which the characters spend so much time discussing and explaining what’s going on, it’s surprising they have time to be scared by it. Early on, we’re introduced to a character who is disparagingly referred to as “Old Bag Patterson,” whose name is actually Gloria (Betty Buckley–Betty Buckley?), but who should perhaps instead be called “Old Lady Exposition,” because her only real function is to spend many minutes explicating both the domestic and supernatural background of what’s plaguing IMAGINARY’s central family. In a setup rather similar to that of Blumhouse’s previous (and, says I, underappreciated) NIGHT SWIM, a brood consisting of Mom, Dad, sullen and resentful teenage daughter and a younger child arrive at their new house where Bad Stuff awaits below ground. In this case, it’s children’s book author/illustrator Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moving into her childhood home with new husband Max (Tom Payne) and his kids Taylor (Taegen Burns) and little Alice (Pyper Braun). His former wife apparently did something bad to Alice that has left her with burn scars on one arm, though that’s one of the only things the movie neglects to explain in great detail. And speaking of burn scars, that house is on Elm Street in Springwood, a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET reference eliciting comparisons that do IMAGINARY no favors. Instead of a razored glove in the furnace, Alice discovers in the basement a teddy bear that calls itself Chauncey, though only to her, in a voice only she can hear. Anyone sitting down to watch this movie will know that the “imaginary friend” conversing with Alice through Chauncey is a malevolent spirit, and a prologue nightmare scene establishes that Jessica has a history with it as well. Indeed, even though Jessica claims her memories of growing up are happy ones, the fact that her mother died when she was very young and her father is blind, severely troubled and confined to a nursing home make it obvious she’s carrying some heavy psychological baggage, which will come to the fore as Chauncey’s influence on Alice becomes increasingly pernicious. Pretty much everything about IMAGINARY, in fact, is obvious; there’s very little here that can’t be predicted once the basics are established, and the details are familiar from the dozens of haunted house/object movies that have come out over the last couple of decades. Wadlow stages a number of low-impact jump scares, and some of the dialogue is unintentionally risible. In particular, a psychiatrist’s query, “Has Alice taken up any hobbies lately? Ventriloquism?” bids to become this month’s “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.” This line comes up after an encounter that proves to be not quite what it seems, in a twist that only serves to confuse matters and is one of several moments where IMAGINARY tries to be too tricky for its own good. The idea of a child’s beloved plaything going bad was done with much more panache and awareness in Blumhouse’s previous M3GAN, and the characters are either walking collections of neuroses or functional pawns in the overly busy plot. Max in particular, who could have been a catalyst for some dramatic story turns, is particularly uninteresting, and it’s no surprise when the movie abandons and forgets about him in the second half. Eventually, IMAGINARY gets to that protracted climax in a netherworld that’s both elaborate and underimagined, and based on what has come before, it won’t surprise any viewer that Wadlow and co. drop a couple of false endings on the way to the closing credits. Those credits include one for a “Cultural Awareness Producer,” who might have done well to make IMAGINARY’s creators aware that too much of their film has been seen many times before.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," The Curse of Bridge Hollow and Fantasy Island director Jeff Wadlow’s Imaginary adheres to the time-honored tradition of transforming make-believe childhood pals into sinister manifestations that torment their abandoners. Here, a cuddly teddy bear named Chauncey harbors dangerous resentment for being forgotten, igniting a wave of terror for an unsuspecting family. If only that terror extended to the audience experience. A cold open teases the monstrous imaginary friend via nightmare sequence before introducing the central family unit. Jessica (DeWanda Wise), along with her husband (Tom Payne) and stepchildren Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), relocate from their hectic New Orleans apartment to Jessica’s childhood home in the suburbs. Typical growing pains and adjusting to a new town are compounded by dark family histories. Then Alice finds a cute teddy bear named Chauncey in the basement, which will force Jessica to confront painful memories when Alice starts behaving strangely. Wadlow, who co-wrote the script with Jason Oremland and Greg Erb, adheres to the well-trodden path of a young child falling under the sway of their mysterious new friend, complete with familiar scare tactics. Save for one fake-out moment executed by Braun, the scares fall flat here. The musical stingers are largely absent, and without any tightening of tension, the punchlines induce incredulity instead of goosebumps. And that extends to the plot, too. DeWanda Wise earns easy rooting interest for infusing Jessica with unwavering empathy, no matter the trials and tribulations that Imaginary throws at her. Or rather forces upon her; the friction between Taylor and Jessica is a manufactured focal point. But most characters aren’t fleshed out enough to earn the same interest. Taegen Burns is relegated to archetypical rebellious teen, the contrivances to get Jessica’s husband out of the equation are absurd, and Pyper Braun maintains a precocious spirit even when Alice is nothing more than a plot prop. The worst is that Imaginary delegates the unenviable task of wacky exposition delivery to Betty Buckley as the crazed neighbor who knows far more about Jessica’s family than she should. Not even Buckley’s talents can make her character arc work. The plot only grows more preposterous as the runtime wears on, which can feel sluggish with the scares so scarce. Where Imaginary does shine, though, is in its commitment to doing as much as possible practically. Chauncey the bear displays many emotions through articulated animatronics brought to life by the award-winning SFX house Spectral Motion. Even Chauncey’s more monstrous iterations, like the Chauncey Beast (Prey’s Dane DiLiegro), give the central cast plenty to work with in the third act’s venture into the “Never Ever.” More than just a familiar entry in horror, Imaginary is the type of silly that doesn’t even work on a gateway horror level. The protagonist’s adult worries and themes of mental illness are in stark contrast to the adorable Chauncey and his childlike nature. The stakes feel low, the scares are too toothless, and the plotting feels more algorithm-based than organic. Worst of all, though, is the way Imaginary squanders the creative potential in its approach to the limitless concept of imagination. Despite the dialogue constantly reinforcing the boundless creativity of its heroine, Imaginary is rather low on imagination of its own, instead opting to chart a safe course filled with familiar tropes and scare trappings.

While you wait for Alien: Romulus, the folks over at Devilworks have cooked up their own slice of “mockbuster” fun with Alien Hunt, and we’re debuting the trailer here on BD this morning. This brand-new sci-fi horror from director Aaron Mirtes (The Bigfoot Trap, Painted in Blood) is set for its US premiere on May 14, and you can find it on digital thanks to Devilworks. You can exclusively watch the official trailer for Alien Hunt below, which looks to combine elements of Alien and Predator. This particular “mockbuster” has very little interest in hiding its inspirations, with the alien designs plucked straight out of H.R. Giger’s beautiful brain. Hey, if you’re going to pull from other movies, might as well take from the all-time greats! In Alien Hunt, “On a hunting trip in the wilderness, a group of siblings discovers an abandoned military outpost on their land, but is it what it seems? “Their trip takes a sinister turn when they find themselves facing off against a relentless army of extra-terrestrial beings. Suddenly, the hunters become the hunted. “The formidable squad of alien soldiers will stop at nothing to wipe out the enemy and in an all-out, brutal battle for survival, it’s kill or be killed in Alien Hunt.” Barron Boedecker (Escape Pod, The Bigfoot Trap), Brent Bentley (The Perfect In-Laws, Haunt Season), Deiondre Teagle (The Visitor, Painted in Blood, Death Ranch), Chelsey Fuller (The Bigfoot Trap, The Silent Natural), Jesse Santoyo (A Nashville Country Christmas, Potter’s Ground), and Adam Pietripaoli (The Bigfoot Trap, The OctoGames) star.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," A broken family struggling to accept a new, also broken member. A vaguely creepy old toy. An old house that creaks regularly. A forgotten past. A soundtrack filled with whispers. A mysterious older lady with insight into the supernatural. Nearly every element of Imaginary, the latest PG-13 hopeful horror hit from Blumhouse, has been handed down from other films. This is, of course, by design. While the film was directed by Jeff Wadlow and co-written by Wadlow, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland, the real auteur here is production company honcho Jason Blum. Blum has been one of the most successful producers in recent years, churning out low-to-mid-budget horror films with clockwork regularity. The studio made its name off critically acclaimed box office successes like Paranormal Activity, Whiplash, and Get Out, but its failures are perhaps more numerous: Truth Or Dare, Fantasy Island, Firestarter, The Lazarus Effect, and on and on. While the studio has made its fair share of sequels – franchises The Purge and Paranormal Activity were birthed and nurtured here – Imaginary feels like an attempt to recreate the start of a franchise that didn’t start in the house of Blum: James Wan’s Insidious. Imaginary follows the Insidious template to a tee. A family moves into a new house – in this case, father Max (Tom Payne) is moving his two girls, Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun), to the childhood home of his new wife Jessica (DeWanda Wise). The girl’s mother (Alix Angelis) had some sort of mental break, leaving Alice with terrible scarring on her arm. Jessica only wants to be a good stepmother to the girls, as her father suffered a similar break when she was a child. When Alice finds an old stuffed bear in the basement of her new home, she starts talking to it like an imaginary friend and goes on a scavenger hunt for items it suggests. Things start innocently enough, with Alice asking for a piece of paper or something happy, but she says Chauncey (the bear’s name) doesn’t want anyone else to see the list, and the more items Alice collects, the more dangerous the tasks become. When Jessica catches Alice trying to hurt herself with a rusty nail, she calls the girl’s psychologist, who discovers that Alice’s imaginary friend might not be so imaginary after all and may even have a connection to Jessica herself. Now, Jessica has to face her deepest fears and repressed memories if she wants to save Alice from Chauncey.  The idea of a malevolent spirit posing as a child’s imaginary friend in the body of an old stuffed bear is just ridiculous enough for audiences to expect something slightly campy. Imaginary is in on the joke, at least a bit, but unlike films like Child’s Play or M3GAN, it never leads with humor, nor does it ever try to make Chauncey the lead character. But the film’s PG-13 rating renders it toothless on the horror front, with Wadlow aping the tension-filled pan-and-scare technique Wan perfected in The Conjuring for nearly every single one of the film’s attempts at jump scares. Instead of making the film scary, this technique makes it fun, signaling to the audience that something scary is going to happen at the exact second you think it will. Being fun is certainly a noble goal for a PG-13 film to shoot for, but even children’s horror films have more genuine frights in store for their intended audience than this. Insidious may have had that rating as well, but that film had an almost oppressively spooky atmosphere that aided its numerous shocking, successful scares. Imaginary, on the other hand, contents itself with sticking to tried-and-true formulas wherever it can, to its detriment as a piece of horror cinema. The one place where the film does latch onto some actual horror is in the fantastically creepy-crawly creature design. A faceless figure creepily blends in with the background of several scenes, and Chauncey’s full form is a terrifically tactile, monstrously deformed, bear-like thing that genuinely feels like the monster you imagined under your bed as a kid. We finally see this in the film’s last act, which significantly raises the stakes in several ways. When described, the premise of the finale sounds bonkers, but it doesn’t actually play that way. Given the influences Wadlow and crew have shamelessly exploited throughout, it’s not difficult to figure out where the film will go and once it gets there, it leaves a lot to be desired. The screenplay has some wild ideas, and Wadlow and the production design team come up with some fun visuals, but no one involved had the guts to follow through on the wildness of the concept. Instead of leaning in and giving the audience something that would be genuinely trippy and new, the screenplay barely scratches the surface of its own idea, settling for a straightforward horror-fantasy final boss battle that works on the level of character and theme but feels like a let-down for how utterly standard it is. Such is the ultimate failure of Imaginary: For a film about imagination, it doesn’t have nearly enough of its own. Thankfully, it does have other things that make it worth watching. Wise builds a believable rapport with Burns and Braun, the latter of whom gives an outstanding performance that never tips too far into child actor cliché. Jessica is also one of the more intelligent, resourceful horror heroines in recent memory, with Wise giving her a strong core of decency even as she’s pushed to the end of her rope. The dialogue she’s saddled with can’t be helped, although not many actors could put over this film’s most ridiculous lines. While laid on a bit thick, the film’s ultimate message about love and family does shine through because of the performances. The aforementioned jump scare moments may not be scary, but they do have a sense of fun to them. When combined with the occasional glimpses of campiness, it’s almost enough to trick you into thinking the film is better than it actually is. Don’t fall for it. Imaginary may be enjoyable, but that doesn’t mean it’s great.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024"," Growing up, many kids find solace in having an imaginary friend. Traditionally, this is seen as a positive aspect of childhood development, fostering social skills, creativity, and more. However, for those with a penchant for horror, like myself, the notion of an imaginary friend often invokes unease and fear. Films such as Poltergeist, Z, and The Exorcist exemplify this, portraying imaginary friends as harbingers of dread rather than companionship. In Imaginary (2024), the newest film from director Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare, Fantasy Island), the familiar concept of an imaginary friend embodied in the form of a teddy bear receives a fresh twist in an attempt to distinguish itself from its contemporaries. Does Wadlow and his team manage to deliver a memorable horror flick? Unfortunately, even with the addition of an adorable teddy bear, this film fails to leave a lasting impression. To keep spoilers to a minimum, here is the official movie synopsis: When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playfully and become increasingly sinister. As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica tries to intervene. Only she realizes Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be. Who isn’t a sucker for a horror film featuring childhood toys and cuddly plushies? Certainly not me. Just take a look at what happened with Five Nights at Freddy’s. Though it benefited from being an established IP, the premise of murderous stuffed animatronics propelled it to become the highest-grossing horror film of 2023. There’s something to say about horror films that exploit the innocence of children’s toys/experiences by turning them into the most unexpected source of danger. Imaginary (2024) presents a solid premise by initially exploring how an imaginary friend can serve as a coping mechanism for trauma. The potential to delve into the complexities of trauma and its terrifying manifestations is evident, particularly with Jessica navigating the role of stepmother to two girls in her old, memory-laden home. However, rather than refining this narrative and allowing it to unfold organically before introducing horror elements, the writing team, comprised of Wadlow, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland, chose to divert attention towards numerous inconsequential plot points, detracting from the film’s overall coherence. This caused the film to feel disjointed, with too many weak threads of narrative and little substance to support them. For example, writing in characters that don’t offer much to the story. Alix Angelis, who plays Samantha, the biological mother to Alice and Taylor, is reduced to a mere caricature of a woman confined to a psychiatric ward that she escapes for unspecified actions against her children. There’s an absence of further exploration or context provided, leaving her portrayal as nothing more than a stereotype of mental illness. Furthermore, the husband, portrayed by Tom Payne (The Walking Dead), appeared somewhat pointless. Payne’s character primarily serves as a passive presence. He offers little more than positive affirmation to Jessica before conveniently departing to go on tour. While he and Samantha may only be background characters, they still provide insight into the family dynamics. Their lack of substantial involvement felt like a missed opportunity. Despite its writing and character development shortcomings, Imaginary (2024) showcases several notable strengths. Pyper Braun, in particular, delivers a standout performance as Alice, demonstrating remarkable acting prowess that is bound to set her up for success. Alongside Pyper, Taegan Burns impresses as the older sister, skillfully balancing teenage angst with emotional depth. DeWanda Wise as Jessica stands out as one of the film’s more solid performances, offering an open heart while standing strong in her convictions. Lastly, Betty Buckley, who plays Gloria, Jessica’s nosy neighbor, adds a compelling layer of intrigue. The film also boasts impressive practical effects, particularly in portraying the teddy bear, seamlessly transitioning it from a benign toy to a menacing and lethal entity. Moreover, the tension is expertly built up through the use of the entity outside of Chauncey. Furthermore, Wadlow’s evident passion for the horror genre shines through in the film’s nods, intentionally or not, such as The Exorcist and Insidious. Imaginary (2024) presents a fun concept with a unique twist but ultimately falls short due to an overcrowded narrative. With too many competing storylines trying to cuddle up to the spotlight, the film lacks focus. Had the writers streamlined their approach and concentrated on one or two central plotlines, the result would have been a much stronger and cohesive film. This missed opportunity prevents Imaginary (2024) from finding its place in the toy chest of the best horror toy films and instead leaves it scattered among the clutter of competing narratives.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Unseen entities befriending and manipulating children are a tried-and-true pairing within the horror genre. With this pairing comes a certain expectation of tropes, but there is always room for exploration and experimentation. Today, experimentation is more often rewarded than lauded regarding the familiar. This is part of why IMAGINARY (2024) proves more disappointing than not. Lacking the imagination its premise should thrive on, the latest from writer/director Jeff Wadlow does little to step outside the safe confines of the metaphorical sandbox. Starring DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, Taegen Burns, Pyper Braun, Veronica Falcon, and Betty Buckley, IMAGINARY (2024) starts with a horrifying opener that highlights the horrific potential buried deep within the heart of the film. This nightmare reveals Jessica's (DeWanda Wise) anxieties about returning to her childhood home with her new family. There's unresolved trauma there, but with little memory of what happened, there's not much she can do but move forward. Moving forward is also at the forefront of her stepdaughter Alice's (Pyper Braun) mind. Lonely and riddled with burn scars, this imaginative young girl wants a friend. Conveniently, mysterious voices lure her to the home's basement, where she meets her new imaginary friend, Chauncey. At first, things start innocently enough. But Chauncey's hold on the girl takes a progressively sinister turn, with one scene highlighting a taste of what this imaginary friend can wreak if left off its leash. On paper, IMAGINARY (2024) has potential. The plot is familiar enough for casual and hardcore horror fans alike to at least think you know what you're getting into. This is where you'd be wrong. Wadlow and screenwriters Greg Erb and Jason Oremland throw everything but the kitchen sink into the script. From a brief glimpse of a mentally ill mother to an it's-all-in-her-mind subplot to a barely touched upon exploration of the Never Ever, the plot features so many different distractions that you'd think Alice herself concocted the tale. Childlike distractability and all.  These multiple story points remove any definitive identity to IMAGINARY (2024), even with its memorable Chauncey plush. It is as if the writers threw darts at a board, hoping one thing would stick before moving to the next. It's a shame because there are elements of the screenplay that showed potential for further explanation. Chauncey's possessiveness over Alice manifests itself in one of the film's most memorable game of cat-and-mouse. There's also the Never Ever, which offered the film's most exciting forays into the unknown far too late in the story. For what it is worth, the cast tries their best with the material provided. DeWanda Wise is sympathetic as the stepmother trying to reconcile with her fuzzy past and parent her increasingly troublesome stepdaughters. Pyper Braun checks the box of creepy little girl well here, giving the willies as Chauncey's hold over her Alice grows tighter. The material and direction falter a bit further with Betty Buckley's friendly neighbor, who has the devil's task of delivering the bulk of the film's expositional bits. More theatrical in delivery than likely required, Buckley renders more awkward laughs than not with her performance.  What lifts IMAGINARY (2024) is its embrace of the practical, particularly in the Never Ever. The puppeteering of Chauncey does so much with so little. A simple turn of the head, a change of facial expression, or even when Chauncey levels up in a giant rawr-worthy suit (still worthy of boops) immerses the audience in the world.  The same can be said for the Never Ever. While the design is reminiscent of films like Insidious and Jim Henson's Labyrinth, a whimsy hints at the children likely trapped within. The clouds on the ceiling flash with lightning, the multiple different doors, a randomly appearing puppy from nowhere; it all comes together to flesh out this strange world Chauncey calls home. Unfortunately, neither the audience nor the characters spend enough time there to learn Never Ever's secrets.  It is hard to say whether Wadlow and Co were afraid to lean into the more campy elements of Chauncey's murderous being. The potential was there to go further, with little pockets of horror to give us a taste of what could have been. Unfortunately, by doing too much and accomplishing too little all at once, IMAGINARY (2024) will make others want to imagine a whole other adventure once the credits roll.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024"," With a similar elevator pitch and budget as M3GAN, Jeff Wadlow’s Imaginary is clearly striving to become 2024’s PG-13 horror darling about an evil children’s doll wreaking havoc on a family already in a state of metamorphosis. Regrettably, the filmmakers here have completely abandoned the archness of tone and shades of camp that made M3GAN such an entertaining, if ultimately inconsequential, experience. In place of that film’s knowing playfulness is an overwrought family drama that’s as undercooked as it is painfully familiar. The blended family at the center of Imaginary consists of comic book artist Jessica (DeWanda Wise), her new husband, Max (Tom Payne), and his two kids from a previous marriage, Taylor (Taegen Burns) and Alice (Pyper Braun). While moody, edgy teenager Taylor constantly gives Jessica the cold shoulder, Alice—much to her big sister’s chagrin—has started to warm up to her stepmom. The stress caused by this dynamic continues to percolate as the family moves into Jessica’s childhood home, which Jessica thinks of as her “happy place” despite repeatedly saying that she has no memories of the first five years of her life she spent there. When the film isn’t busy serving up one solemn, shoddily scripted scene after another revolving around Jessica struggling to make headway with Taylor, it follows Alice as she befriends an old stuffed bear named Chauncey, which she found—where else?—tucked away in the deepest corners of her new home’s basement. Soon Chauncey starts talking to Alice, convincing her to play increasingly ridiculous and dangerous games that threaten the lives of others, including the hunky neighbor (Matthew Sato) that Taylor has set her sights on, and it’s right around here that Imaginary starts begging for a more, well, imaginative approach to the material. Somehow, this film about an imaginary friend in the form of a teddy bear never thinks to lean into the blatant silliness that its premise invites. It instead remains a frustratingly dour and humorless affair, expecting the audience to find Chauncey, and the scenario, frightening without bothering to deliver a single scare or even set a discernibly creepy mood.  This misjudgment in tone leads to several unintentionally funny scenes, such as when, after hearing Chauncey speak without Alice’s lips moving, the young girl’s therapist (Veronica Falcón) asks Alice if her stepdaughter has taken up any new hobbies like ventriloquism. It’s a moment obviously ripe for humor, but the film plays it completely straight, even doubling down on its self-seriousness right after with a twist that’s as inane as it is telegraphed. As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more erratic, and Jessica begins to slowly recall her childhood trauma, including her own former attachment to the doll, Imaginary shifts gears, taking the audience into a more fantastical realm. The opportunities for mind-warping visuals, or at least something remotely offbeat, are aplenty during this stretch. Yet this imaginary world is as dull and colorless as the one its characters are whisked away from, drowned in monochromatic blues and flat, monotonous CGI. Every step of the way, this is a film that desperately wants to capture both the potentially vitalizing and perilous powers of imagination, which makes it all the more surprising just how sterile and uninspired it is.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024"," La trayectoria de Jason Blum ha estado marcada por éxitos rotundos en el género de terror, con sagas reconocidas como Actividad paranormal (Paranormal Activity, 2007), La noche del demonio (Insidious, 2010) y La noche de la expiación (The purge, 2013), así como incursiones exitosas en el cine más sofisticado con obras como Whiplash (2014) de Demian Chazelle y Huye (Get out, 2017) de Jordan Peele. Sin embargo, también ha acumulado algunas producciones por debajo del estándar, tanto en términos de recaudación como de crítica especializada. Es probable que Imaginario (Imaginary, 2024), su última creación, se sume a esta lista, ya que previo a su estreno ha generado escaso interés debido a las directrices restrictivas de la productora, pero se anticipa que recibirá críticas desfavorables por parte del público. La trama sigue a Jessica, quien, al mudarse con su familia a la casa de su infancia, observa cómo su hijastra Alice desarrolla una relación extraña con Chauncey, un oso de peluche encontrado en el sótano. A medida que Jessica descubre que Chauncey es más que un simple juguete, la trama se sumerge en terrenos siniestros. Protagonizada por DeWanda Wise, la película presenta personajes distantes y estereotipados, conformando la típica familia disfuncional que atrae a demonios y fantasmas. El planteamiento resulta débil, repetitivo y predecible, sin aportar nada novedoso. El guión carece de solidez, con diálogos vacíos. Aunque el director Jeff Wadlow logra ciertos momentos destacados en el primer acto, se ve limitado por la trama cliché, recurriendo a convenciones narrativas ya exploradas en numerosas producciones similares. En el segundo acto, la película pierde sentido, volviéndose aburrida y tediosa a pesar de su corta duración.

"Mar 7, 2024"," Maybe if your tweens are having a sleepover this could keep them quiet, but everyone else will likely want to close their eyes and imagine they’re watching a better movie. Kids, it has to be said, are bloody weird. As soon as they gain the ability to walk and talk, they start making up all manner of bullshit, using their overcharged imaginations and blurting out the sort of nonsense that would have adults put in a quiet room with padded walls. The thing is, to the kid in question, those imaginary people and scenarios are completely real, which is both fascinating and unsettling. Imaginary friends are nothing new in cinema, The Shining, Drop Dead Fred and JoJo Rabbit (plus many others) have all used them for various purposes, but Imaginary – the latest from Blumhouse and director Jeff Wadlow – puts the faux pal in the villain seat to middling levels of success. The thing about Imaginary is that its premise is actually solid. There’s an endless supply of potential creepiness mining the fevered imaginations of children and skewing the film to a younger audience is a savvy business move. The problem, however, is that the film – given to us from the deadset dreamweaver who also helmed Truth or Dare and Fantasy Island – is almost completely devoid of inspiration. Oh, there are a couple of neat twists and some of the practical creature effects in the third act are fun, but it’s such a slog of a movie that would have benefited greatly from losing 15-20 minutes of unnecessary footage, such as a bizarre sequence involving Taylor and a spunky neighbour boy that goes literally nowhere and never comes up again. Performances are also pretty ordinary, with the adult cast struggling with the leaden, on-the-nose dialogue. Pyper Braun does buck the trend, however, and manages to be a charming screen presence, which is good because a lot of the light horror revolves around her. Sadly, despite some bright moments, Imaginary just doesn’t do enough with its promising premise to make it worth the effort.

"Mar 6, 2024"," Given that the promotional material for Imaginary has highlighted a certain stuffed teddy bear, one would be right in assuming that the film – boasting its from the studio that brought us Five Nights at Freddy’s and M3GAN – would be taking inspiration from those two successful properties.  Unfortunately, despite such promise, a committed turn from the deserves-better DeWanda Wise, and the occasional inviting visual, Jeff Wadlow‘s supernaturally-inclined horror outing is light on both scares and, ironically, imagination. At the centre of the supposed terror is Jessica (Wise), a children’s illustrator who’s continually plagued by nightmares.  Hoping that surrounding herself in her “happy place” – her childhood home – will fix these night terrors, Jessica’s integration as a stepmother to her husband’s two children (Taegen Burns as moody teen Taylor and Pyper Braun as the young Alice) is all the stress she can handle, and, initially, bringing her new family into the environment where she grew up seems to mend a few issues; at least on the surface. But when young Alice finds a stuffed bear at the premises, Wadlow’s narrative – written in partnership with Greg Erb (The Princess and the Frog) and Jason Oremland (Playmobil: The Movie) – moves in predictable circles as the bear, named Chauncey, manifests itself as an imaginary friend for young Alice, and soon things are going bump in the night and Jessica’s own nightmares come to light, as she has to face the darkness in order to save her family.  Ultimately, it’s nothing the Insidious series hasn’t already attempted. As a horror film Imaginary, sadly, barely registers, but its penchant for physical effects, its story touching on dementia, loss and guilt, and the continual commitment of Wise allow the film, which thankfully never overstays its welcome at 104 minutes, to not entirely be put to bed.  The genre deserves better, and the trope of the exposition-heavy neighbour can entirely be laid to rest, but small wins are ultimately what Imaginary has to cling to, as it’s an all-too-familiar effort that can’t escape its clear Poltergeist inspiration. The film’s final third is quite the bonkers turn of events, and though its climactic moments are its most liveliest, to some it may be too little too late, and, to others, perhaps too silly to be deemed an appropriate scare; this seeming need to cater the genre to younger audiences sadly undoes any horrific potential this story has, and there’s definitely some nuggets of unsettling promise there. A story that deserves a better execution, Imaginary is more the afterthought of a power nap than anything deeply rooted in a nightmarish slumber.  The tweens may find themselves enjoying the telegraphed scares, but genre appreciators will wait for an after-dark viewing.
