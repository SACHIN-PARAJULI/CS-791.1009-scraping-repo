"Apr 12, 2024"," Period action adventure starring Harrison Ford, Ray Winstone, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf. Nevada in the late 1950s: intrepid archaeologist Indiana Jones finds himself up to his neck in trouble again when he encounters Irina Spalko and a gang of Soviet agents at a military base in the desert. However, this is only the start of a series of adventures that will take Indy deep into the Amazon jungle in search of a mysterious crystal skull. Almost 19 years after the release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas exhume their globe-trotting archaeologist for another crack of the whip. It's now 1957, and Professor Jones (Harrison Ford) is bundled out of a car boot with his cockney sidekick ""Mac"" (Ray Winstone). After an explosive and chilling opening at a nuclear test site in the Nevada desert, Indy's latest quest begins via an exhilarating motorbike chase through a university campus. The sought-after prize is the fabled Crystal Skull of Akator and, this being the Cold War era, the baddies are the Soviets, led by Cate Blanchett. Then it's all aboard for more of the same Saturday matinée thrills that helped make the franchise so successful: a multi-vehicle pursuit through the Amazon jungle; giant ants; umpteen secret passageways; and even alien visitors. Though exhausting and relentless, it's hard to dislike, thanks to Ford's weary charm, his leather-jacketed new wingman Shia LaBeouf, and an emphasis on pleasingly ""old school"" stuntwork.",POSITIVE
"Jul 7, 2023"," BODY SLAM (1986). Body Slam is occasionally labeled the final theatrical release of stuntman-turned-director Hal Needham (Smokey and the Bandit, Stroker Ace), but that’s not quite accurate. While it was meant to play theaters, bad blood between Needham and the film’s writer-producers, Shel Lytton and Steve Burkow, resulted in the film missing multiplexes altogether and emerging as a straight-to-video title. It’s hard to imagine it would have mustered much box office business, as it’s a mediocre comedy that will appeal to wrestling fans far more than anyone else. The A-Team regular Dirk Benedict plays Harry Smilac, a struggling agent whose career is revitalized once he decides to mix professional wrestling with rock ‘n’ roll by featuring both on the same tour (the film was inspired by the rock ‘n’ wrestling boom in the 1980s). Benedict and Charlie’s Angels one-and-done Tanya Roberts are drab leads, with wrestler Roddy Piper stealing the show in his film debut. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES (1991). Among all the John Hughes joints, this is one of the worst. Written by Hughes but directed by Bryan Gordon, this is yet another Hughes male-fantasy-wish-fulfillment film in which a beautiful girl falls in love with the biggest dork around. Riiiiight. Frank Whaley is absolutely insufferable as Jim Dodge, a loser-of-all-trades who’s hired to work as the cleanup boy at the local Target. It’s during his first night on the job that he bonds with unhappy rich girl Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), who happens to be camped out in the store, and fights off two bumbling criminals (real-life brothers Dermot and Kieran Mulroney). The fact that Hughes tried (and failed) to have his name removed from this movie tells you pretty much everything you need to know. Only a funny, uncredited turn by John Candy and Connelly’s ethereal beauty save this from a one-star rating. THE COURIER (2021). The best Cold War thrillers are the ones that were made during the actual conflict, with such pictures as The Manchurian Candidate and The Spy Who Came In from the Cold possessing a grittiness and urgency that are, perhaps naturally, missing from the vast majority of post-1991 yarns of this nature. Like 2015’s Bridge of Spies, The Courier often feels like the celluloid equivalent of a history book, with the true-life tale unfolding in measured, respectful beats. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Greville Wynne, a British businessman who’s tapped by MI6 and the CIA to develop an association with Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), a Soviet officer passing along state secrets in an effort to cool the East-West tensions that culminated with the Cuban Missile Crisis. By focusing so intently on Wynne and his relationship not only with Penkovsky but also his own wife (Jessie Buckley), the movie works on a small scale but never quite conveys the enormity or sheer terror of the global situation (for that, watch 2000’s Thirteen Days). GODZILLA VS. KONG (2021). The four films released thus far in the so-called MonsterVerse ably demonstrate that King Kong still reigns supreme. The 2017 Kong: Skull Island (reviewed here) is superior to all three Godzilla films, and that includes this latest one, which finds both behemoths sharing marquee billing. Decidedly more complicated (if not necessarily more engaging) than 1962’s Toho-produced King Kong vs. Godzilla (see King Kong: Ranking the Giant Ape Films here), this finds the big fellas squaring off against each other before ultimately teaming up to battle Mechagodzilla. As with the two previous Godzilla flicks (2014’s Godzilla and 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters), the creature-on-creature action is often invigorating and always executed with excellent CGI, but the human characters (particularly the one played by Millie Bobby Brown) couldn’t be drippier. Extras on the 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital Code set consist of audio commentary by director Adam Wingard and 10 making-of pieces covering the titans’ histories, the visual effects, and more. GUNS FOR SAN SEBASTIAN (1968). One doesn’t need to read the credits for Guns for San Sebastian to instantly peg the music as a Morricone. Contributing to a Western that is not of the Spaghetti strain, Ennio provides a lesser if still engaging score that works for this yarn focusing on Leon Alastray (Anthony Quinn), a Mexican outlaw who’s befriended by an elderly priest (Sam Jaffe). They journey together to the remote village of San Sebastian, but after the priest is fatally shot, Alastray is himself mistaken for a clergyman by the locals. Keeping up the ruse, he eventually becomes attached to the community and helps protect it from attacking Yaqui Indians. Charles Bronson co-stars as the thorn in Alastray’s side; although he generally excelled in his pre-stardom supporting roles, he’s underwhelming here, a condition shared by many of the characters and plot developments. The climax is rousing, but it’s Quinn who makes this worth a peek. INDIANA JONES 4-MOVIE COLLECTION (1981-2008). The Indiana Jones adventures have finally been released in a 4K Ultra HD edition (digital codes also included), and the results — in both the video and audio departments — are absolutely mesmerizing. As for the movies themselves, they hardly need any introduction. A dream project between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is simply one of the all-time greats, a delightful thrill-a-minute flick in the grand swashbuckling and movie serial traditions. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond) in its 2003 “100 Heroes & Villains” list. Every character is richly brought to life, particularly Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, Paul Freeman’s Belloq (a frequently underrated villain), and, oh, yeah, that treacherous capuchin monkey. Nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg), it nabbed four statues for its film editing, visual effects, sets, and sound, as well as a Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) is easily the most underrated film in the franchise, with its dark tone working perfectly in the context of its often macabre tale. Still, the comparatively bleak material and gross-out bits of this PG endeavor worked in tandem with the icky elements of that same summer’s Gremlins to lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating (reportedly at the suggestion of Spielberg himself). Kate Capshaw’s Willie Scott is a weak character when compared to the previous film’s Marion Ravenwood, but Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) is an engaging sidekick, and the action and atmospherics are tops. This earned an Oscar for its visual effects (beating 2010 and, perhaps surprisingly, Ghostbusters). Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) closed the decade in style, with Sean Connery an inspired choice to play Indy’s dad and River Phoenix (who died four years later) an equally sensible selection to play the teenage Indiana Jones. Alison Doody’s Elsa Schneider is a better bet than Willie Scott (due largely to her duplicitous nature), and it’s wonderful to see Indy’s friends from Raiders, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), returning to again help out our hero. This nabbed an Oscar for its sound effects editing. The belated installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the runt of the litter, although there’s still plenty to enjoy. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, and, even at 65, Ford still excels as the intrepid archaeologist-professor-adventurer. Despite more hiccups than usual (dry villains, a protracted third act), Spielberg keeps the film loose and limber. P.S. I will never understand the hatred for the refrigerator scene — it’s a marvelous set-piece and very much in the spirit of the whole franchise. You want a low point? How about Shia LaBeouf’s brash greaser Mutt Williams swinging through the trees alongside a bunch of CGI monkeys? (Honestly, LaBeoufing the Monkeys would have been a more accurate diss than Nuking the Fridge.) The bonus features are all carried over from the previous 2012 Blu-ray box set, with a total running time of over seven hours. Extras include making-of featurettes and theatrical trailers for all four films; on-set footage from Raiders of the Lost Ark; a joint discussion with leading ladies Allen, Capshaw, and Doody; and various pieces on the series’ stunts, music, visual effects, sound effects, and more. LAST TRAIN FROM GUN HILL (1959). Reuniting many of the key players from 1957’s Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (including director and star) but more similar in tale and tone to 1957’s 3:10 to Yuma, John Sturges’ Last Train from Gun Hill casts Kirk Douglas as Matt Morgan, a marshal seeking the two men who raped and murdered his Native American wife (Ziva Rodann). He discovers that one of them is Rick Belden (Earl Holliman), the son of his friend and former partner Craig Belden (Anthony Quinn). Morgan is determined to bring the killers to justice, while Belden, now a powerful cattle baron, is equally hellbent on protecting his son. The unique situation provides the scenes between Douglas and Quinn with additional subtext that in turn expands the actors’ performances, with Carolyn Jones offering fine support as the woman caught between the pair. Blu-ray extras in this latest installment in the Paramount Presents line consist of a discussion of the film with film critic Leonard Maltin and theatrical trailers. THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN… (1970). The penultimate film of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve) is a tart-tongued Western written by the same gents (David Newman and Robert Benton) who had penned Bonnie and Clyde three years earlier. Kirk Douglas is excellent in the complex role of Paris Pitman Jr., a bank robber who’s captured and sent to an Arizona prison that’s soon run by reform-minded warden Woodward Lopeman (yet another nicely understated turn by Henry Fonda). Lopeman hopes that Pitman will be a model prisoner; for his part, the outlaw is plotting a great escape with the help of his cellmates. The heavy pre-release cutting hurts (blink and you might miss Lee Grant’s entire performance), but the marvelous cast helps — among Pitman’s cohorts in crime are Burgess Meredith as the once fearsome, now decrepit Missouri Kid, Warren Oates as a dim-witted cowboy, and Hume Cronyn (particularly wonderful) and John Randolph as a bickering homosexual couple. VOYAGERS (2021). The pitch meeting for Voyagers must have been the shortest in history. “It’s Lord of the Flies in space! Now where should we go for lunch?” Yet it’s the faithfulness to the plot put forth by William Golding that prevents the film from exploring various other themes that perpetually remain on the margins. The early going is the best part, with Colin Farrell as a scientist who accompanies a group of children heading to a habitable planet 86 years away, knowing that it will actually be these kids’ grandchildren who will set foot on the brave new world in the future. Medicated to remain docile, the now-teenagers on the craft rebel by discontinuing their treatments; newly awakened, these formerly well-behaved kids grow horny and violent. Complex issues are tossed aside in favor of obvious action beats, and the breakdown of wicked and complacent kids vs. good kids is absurdly one-sided in favor of the former (approximately 80%-20%; even in the last election, the evil Trump only garnered 47% of the vote) and then summarily dismissed for the wrap-up. ZIEGFELD FOLLIES (1946). Ziegfeld Follies opens with showman Flo Ziegfeld (William Powell, reprising his role from 1936’s The Great Ziegfeld) in Heaven, looking down and wishing that he could put together one final production packed with songs and stars. This setup leads to a compendium of musical numbers and comedy skits featuring approximately two dozen celebrities, including two future I Love Lucy actors in Lucille Ball and William Frawley. The quality between sketches is inconsistent — respectively taking the gold, silver and bronze are Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly (in their historic first teaming) performing “The Babbitt and the Bromide,” a smokin’ Lena Horne crooning “Love,” and Judy Garland getting into the spirit of “The Interview.” Blu-ray extras consist of a retrospective featurette; audio-only outtakes; the Oscar-nominated 1947 short The Luckiest Guy in the World; the 1946 Tom & Jerry cartoon Solid Serenade; the 1946 cartoon The Hick Chick; and the theatrical trailer. Love the Indiana Jones franchise, the first three were big inspirations for my life long love of cinema, and I like the 4th entry just as much as the others.",POSITIVE
"Jul 1, 2023"," Y llegamos a la infame cuarta entrega. Spielberg, Lucas y compañía se demoraron, pero finalmente lograron estrenar “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” en mayo del 2008, y los resultados fueron… mixtos. Sí, la película recaudó un dineral —más de 700 millones de dólares en todo el mundo—, pero la recepción por parte de la crítica Y de los fans no fue la mejor. Muchos agradecieron el trabajo de Harrison Ford como Indy —impecable, como siempre—, pero varios se quejaron de la abundancia de efectos visuales digitales de calidad cuestionable, escenas poco creíbles, y por supuesto, los Aliens. Los benditos Aliens. El punto es que, con el beneficio de la compresión retrospectiva, y habiendo visto las primeras cuatro películas de Indiana Jones seguidas en poco más de una semana, resulta interesante comentar “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal”. Se trata, pues, de la menor de las cuatro cintas; de un filme que no es tan horrendo como a muchos fanáticos les gustaría hacernos creer, y que contiene varios momentos brillantes, mezclados con otros… bastante flojos. Ciertamente se nota un cambio entre esta entrega y “La Última Cruzada”, como si algo hubiese cambiado en Spielberg, y en la forma en que ve a Indy y sus aventuras. Es una película de “Indiana Jones” a medias, pues, que igual resulta entretenida, pero que ciertamente pudo —y debió— ser mucho mejor. “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” comienza en los años 50, y luego de ser testigos de una suerte de “drag race” entre unos adolescentes y unos soldados —al más puro estilo de la genial “American Graffiti”, de George Lucas—, acompañamos a Indy (Ford) y su compañero, Mac (Ray Winstone) mientras son obligados por un grupo de comunistas rusos, liderados por la coronel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a buscar un misterioso objeto en el mismo hangar repleto de cajas que vimos al final de “Los Cazadores del Arca Perdida”. El cual, dicho sea de paso, está ubicado en el Área 51, porque obviamente —son los años 50, y como las cintas anteriores, “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” hace referencia a la cultura popular del momento. La eventual presencia de los Aliens no debió sorprender a nadie. Nuestros protagonistas y su captores terminan encontrando dicho objeto, pues, pero Indy logra escapar, viéndose obligado a buscar refugio en un pueblo falso utilizado para pruebas de bombas nucleares. Esto resulta en uno de los momentos más controversiales y parodiados de la película: Indy sobreviviendo a una explosión nuclear en el interior de una refrigeradora alineada con plomo —una idea de Spielberg y no de Lucas, contrario a lo que muchos pensaban. Luego de ser rescatado por las autoridades, Indy se encuentra con Mutt Williams —Shia LaBeouf—, y juntos viajan a Perú (¡!) en busca de su viejo amigo Oxley (John Hurt). Resulta que el experimentado colega de Indy está en busca de una Calavera de Cristal, la cual supuestamente cuenta con místicos poderes, en los cuales Spalko y el gobierno ruso están interesados. Lógicamente, Indy se ve obligado a detenerlos. Ahora, muchos se quejaron de la utilización de los rusos como los antagonistas principales de la película. Sin embargo, considerando la época en la que se desarrolla la historia, y el hecho de que Spielberg ya no podía ver los Nazis como “villanos de caricatura” luego de haber dirigido “La lista de Schindler”, es algo que tiene sentido. Lo mismo con los Aliens. Su inclusión tiene sentido considerando que los años 50 estuvieron repletos de historias sobre OVNIs, rumores sobre el Área 51, y películas sobre marcianos y extraterrestres gigantes. Como los filmes anteriores, “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” emula las modas de la época en la que la trama se lleva a cabo, honrando los orígenes “pulp” del personaje principal. Nada de eso es un problema. Lo que causa problemas en la cinta, más bien, es una palpable falta de energía, y una extraña obsesión por explicarlo todo. En relación a lo primero, “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” desgraciadamente carece de la sensación visceral de tensión tan presente en las tres películas anteriores —especialmente la primera. Consideren, por ejemplo, la persecución en el Amazonas, una secuencia de acción potencialmente emocionante, que sin embargo carece de tensión, adrenalina, o momentos de verdadero peligro. Todo se siente demasiado “seguro”, demasiado LIMPIO. De hecho, la pelea que mejor funciona en la película es el encuentro entre Indy y un Secuaz Ruso (Igor Zhizhikin), precisamente porque se siente más visceral y violenta. La muerte de dicho antagonista, por ejemplo —que involucra a un mar de hormigas gigantes— es de lo más memorable que tiene la película para ofrecer. Y sobre lo segundo… digamos que una de las características más interesantes de las películas anteriores de Indy radicaba en el misterio. Nunca se nos explicó exactamente qué hizo el Arca de la Alianza con Belloq y sus secuaces, y eso estuvo bien. Tampoco cuál era la lógica exacta detrás de los poderes de las Piedras Sankara, o el Santo Grial. ¡Excelente! Por su parte, los personajes en “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” tratan de dar mil explicaciones sobre los eventos de la cinta. Hablan sobre los poderes magnéticos de la Calavera, mencionan que le puede leer la mente a las personas, luego dicen que le pertenece a Aliens que le enseñaron a civilizaciones antiguas a irrigar y cosechar, y finalmente, explican que no son Aliens tradicionales, si no más bien seres interdimensionales. Es demasiado, y hace que la trama se sienta enredada, quitándole mucho del misticismo y misterio que tanto necesitaba. No obstante, como ya se ha dado a entender, “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” cuenta con algunos momentos brillantes que ponen en evidencia un poco de la clásica Magia (™) de Spielberg. Me encanta el inicio, por ejemplo, desde la carrera con los adolescentes cincuenteros, hasta las interacciones entre Indy y los rusos dentro del Área 51. La escena del refrigerador es absurda, pero al menos concluye con una imagen verdaderamente potente: Indy, en silueta, frente a una gigante explosión nuclear. Una persecución con motos y carros dentro y fuera de la universidad donde trabaja Indy funciona gracias a su limitado uso de efectos visuales digitales. Y la película cuenta con algunos momentos de honestidad emocional, como cuando Indy y el Dean Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) hablan sobre el paso del tiempo, y sobre como ahora están en una época en la que la vida “les quita cosas en vez de dárselas”. Es potente, y la película se hubiese beneficiado de más momentos igual de introspectivos. Imposible escribir sobre “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal”, por otro lado, sin mencionar a los personajes secundarios. Sé que Shia LaBeouf estaba “de moda” en la década pasada, pero “castearlo” como el Hijo de Indy (lo sé, lo sé, “spoilers”, ¡pero la película tiene más de quince años!) es una decisión francamente inexplicable. No es que LaBeouf sea un mal actor, pero ponerlo al costado de Harrison Ford es injusto, y especialmente porque Mutt es caracterizado como un “falso rudo”; como un chico inseguro que se quiere hacer el agresivo para esconder sus debilidades. Por otra parte, siempre defenderé a la Irina Spalko de Cate Blanchett. Se me hace una villana igual de memorable que cualquiera de los anteriores, por más de que las escenas en donde trata de usar sus “poderes” psíquicos no funcionen del todo. Y aunque me parece que Ray Winstone es un buen actor, acá está completamente desperdiciado —de hecho, tanto él como el legendario John Hurt cuentan con papeles bastante ingratos. El primero no tiene mayor efecto en la trama, y el segundo se pasa la mayor parte de la película actuando como un loco. Ahora bien, al ser la primera película de “Indiana Jones” del siglo veintiuno, “El Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” mezcla sets reales y actores de carne y hueso con efectos visuales digitales… con resultado mixtos. Desgraciadamente, la película se termina sintiendo muy “de interiores”, usando demasiados sets con fondos de pantalla verde, en vez de locaciones reales. Las otras tres entregas fueron grabadas en varios lugares del mundo —la producción de esta se quedó en los Estados Unidos, lo cual se hace particularmente evidente en las escenas situadas en Perú y el Amazonas (pista: nunca vinieron a grabar por estos lares). Y aunque el uso de efectos visuales por computadora no es algo que esté mal “por default”, el trabajo de ILM en “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” es, al igual que todo en la película, mixto. El filme cuenta con imágenes impactantes —la bomba atómica, la nave yéndose de la jungla—, pero también con varios momentos de videojuego de PlayStation 3 —la selva digital, Mutt columpiándose con monos, y planos con fondos Chroma poco creíbles. Nada de esto se ve beneficiado por la dirección de fotografía del usualmente excelente Janusz Kaminski. Las tres primeras películas fueron fotografiadas por el legendario Douglas Slocombe, y cuentan con una estética sucia, llena de texturas, que les brindan un “look” creíble y cercano. Lo que Kaminski y Spielberg parecen haber querido hacer con “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal”, más bien, es homenajear al cine y la estética de los cincuentas, con una imagen más bien brillosa, llena de “lens flares” y por momentos demasiado sintética. Esto funciona al inicio, en las secuencias que se llevan a cabo en el desierto o en la ciudad, pero una vez que nos vamos a la selva… no hace más que combinar con los efectos digitales para otorgarle una apariencia demasiado plástica al filme. Es una pena. Sé que he sido bastante negativo, pero resulta imposible no serlo cuando se compara a “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” con cualquiera de las entregas anteriores de la saga. No, no es una película aburrida, y ciertamente cuenta con momentos memorables, entretenidos y hasta graciosos. Pero también se trata de una experiencia algo desinflada, que carece de la tensión visceral y energía de los otros tres filmes, y que por momentos abusa de efectos visuales de mediana calidad. Es una producción que se siente MUY del año 2008, pero no siempre en el mejor de los sentidos —pensar que Spielberg consideró que Shia LaBeouf podría convertirse en el sucesor de Ford es simplemente ridículo. Y bueno, súmenle a todo lo anterior una cuestionable representación de la cultura peruana (por alguna razón, el gran John Williams decidió componer música mexicana para la escena que se lleva a cabo en Nazca, quizás el único gran error de su carrera musical), y de las culturas preincaicas en general (el filme parece concordar con el “History Channel” al decir que los Aliens fueron responsables de mucho de lo que hicieron las culturas antiguas americanas), e “Indiana Jones y el Reino de la Calavera de Cristal” termina siendo, efectivamente, la entrega más flojita de la saga. Un filme, pues, que por momentos pone en evidencia la Magia (™) de Spielberg, y que definitivamente no es HORRIBLE, solo… decepcionante. Felizmente “El Dial del Destino” terminó siendo una mejor despedida para el famoso arqueólogo interpretado por Harrison Ford. Con esta no podíamos terminar. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

My kids are interested; and besides, the film’s perpetrators cling to a respectable image, which they acquired with The Matrix. The writing-directing Wachowski brothers supposedly are innovators, iconoclasts, post-whatever-the-hell philosophers working in a medium of pop thrills. But who, other than the Platonic 9-year-old boy, is meant to go gai with the savoir of Speed Racer? 




 Which figure in this retooled version of a clunky old TV cartoon might represent the audience? I’d say the Wachowskis see us as the pet chimpanzee. What oppositional, anticorporate message is conveyed to us chittering apes? Win! Win all you can! And how does it feel to be the chimp, watching this nightmare of saturated primary colors? Save your money and find out at home. Have someone squirt ketchup and mustard into your eyes for two hours. 
 I detain you with this abuse of Speed Racer only because the picture so dismally exemplifies the tradition of filmmaking-by-condiment that long ago became standard in America whenever we head toward barbecue season. Steven Spielberg’s Jaws first laid the hot dogs on the grill, according to all the conventional histories–and if you think of summer blockbusters primarily as marketing schemes, then the conventional histories are surely right. But if you also think of summer blockbusters as bearing a definable attitude toward their content and their audience, then the true precursor of Speed Racer did not appear until Star Wars.
 It was George Lucas, two years after Jaws, who introduced the characteristic strain: a half-nostalgic, half-mocking glorification of bygone amusements, reproduced with swaggering expense where the models had been cheap, and stamped with an author’s name where the originals had been anonymous. With the subsequent success of Raiders of the Lost Ark–devised and produced by Lucas, with Spielberg hired to direct–a very fancy set of quotation marks was permanently fixed around summer “movies.”
 They have a lot to answer for, those two; and though Spielberg has gone on to a more than honorable career when apart from Lucas, I can’t entirely separate the director of Munich, Minority Report and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence from the man who has just collaborated in making Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Nineteen years had passed since the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg could have walked away free, and let us do the same. Instead, he’s forced on us the question of whether he and Lucas, conjoined, have anything better to offer than their Wachowskian spawn.
 On an intellectual level: no. If you are a moviegoer of a certain age–and age, as we’ll see, is the key determinant here–I need say no more than “Nazca lines” for you to know that Crystal Skull revives a techno-Aryan-occult fantasy of the 1970s: the notion that pointy-headed visitors from Beyond must have built the ancient civilizations of South America, since the natives there are too stupid to use toilet paper. I suppose I should have written “spoiler alert” before that last sentence; but what’s to spoil when the premise is rotten to begin with, and the filmmakers give it away in the opening scene? Featuring un-Earthly creatures with strange powers and a series of spooky old tombs and temples, Crystal Skull unites two of the great Lucas-Spielberg enthusiasms, stargazing and spelunking–and never mind that the pop mythology used for the merger is unconscionable. The main point is it’s convenient.

 And so, too, is the Lucas-Spielberg family romance. A nervy young blood, played by Shia LaBeouf, has attached himself to our hero in Crystal Skull. Meanwhile, Karen Allen has returned to the franchise in the role of Indiana’s long-lost love. I suppose only Jones himself needs to wait for the fourth reel to find out what kind of cozy embrace is being prepared for him, amid the careening vehicles and poison darts. Indie, phone home!
 As transparent as its title artifact, and just as obviously made from plastic, Crystal Skull conforms to type by offering a new version of old trash pleasures, only without the novelty. Almost without, I should say. In the role of a KGB parapsychologist, the ever-astounding Cate Blanchett glides forward as if on wheels, her pale eyes unblinking beneath a Louise Brooks wig, and coos a string of Anglo-Slavic vowels that make no better sense than anything else in the picture but are a lot more fun. The role she plays is a tired joke, but Blanchett herself is contemporary–the one up-to-date element in the movie, and the one entertainment.
 The rest is weariness, of a desperate, middle-aged kind. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen do look marvelous, for people of their middle years; but their pretended reunion has all the erotic charge of a good toothbrushing. I suppose they have to go through the motions for the sake of the kid–but he, in his way, is older than both of them. To put forth an image of flaming youth, Lucas and Spielberg have reverted to their own, making Shia LaBeouf into the leather-jacketed, motorcycle-riding rebel they admired fifty years ago when they saw The Wild One. For the aging auteurs, he’s cinematic Viagra.
 The good news about Lucas-Spielberg, then, is that they don’t look down on their public in Crystal Skull. That’s because, in effect, they are their own audience. The bad news is, this is all they’ve got to say to themselves. Thirty years ago, they set out to turn old trash into shiny new myths. Today, thanks to their efforts, even new movie trash comes out feeling old–and their own myth now plays like Twilight of the Boomers.
 Having straddled a hyphen for all his thirty-four years, the Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin has a right to tell crossover stories. He has dramatized Euro-Asian crazy love in Head-On; recorded musical expressions on either side of the Bosporus in the documentary Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul; and now, in his latest movie, he weaves an almost obsessive pattern of shuttlings: East-West, male-female, old-young, gay-straight. I hope American audiences won’t judge this picture by the soap opera label that’s been slapped onto it, The Edge of Heaven, because Akin’s original title gives a far better idea of where the movie ultimately deposits its characters, no matter where they begin: Auf der anderen Seite—On the Other Side.
 To isolate just two of the lines of movement: Nejat (Baki Davrak)–pinch-faced, celibate, approaching 40–starts out in the story as a college professor, delivering lectures about Goethe in his native Hamburg. He couldn’t be better acculturated to Germany–but then the path of catastrophe leads him to Istanbul, where he decides to remain as an expatriate in his own homeland. Meanwhile, Ayten (Nurgül Yesilçay)–fierce, lush-lipped, still in her twenties–travels in the opposite direction, trailing calamity all the way. A member of a revolutionary group, she leaves Istanbul as a fugitive and by chance finds temporary refuge in the home and arms of Lotte (Patrycia Ziolkowska), a student at Nejat’s university.
 As often happens in contemporary art-house fare such as Babel–and in older, more popular movies about intersecting lives, going back as far as Grand Hotel–coincidence comfily substitutes for social process. You will notice how Ayten’s mother (played in and out of a blond wig by Nursel Köse) risks her skin working in Bremen’s red-light district, whereas Lotte’s mother (a plump, gray and unpainted Hanna Schygulla) dwells in contrasting and sullen suburban propriety, the point being–what? That the world includes high and low? At its weakest, The Edge of Heaven gives you Tinkertoy symmetries: matching shots in which caskets glide in and out of airplanes’ bellies, or characters walk in and out of jail cells, or a particular landscape circles past the camera both early and late in the film.
 At its strongest, though, The Edge of Heaven has a thrashing, furious, dirty-minded life that would disrupt anybody’s pattern. In almost every scene, the vitality of the unexpected breaks out in passing details: the way bystanders applaud the cops when they haul away Ayten’s comrades, or the way a detective sits inside an open window frame while conducting an interview, so he can smoke in the office. More important, there is something unpredictable in the thick, messy interactions among all the main characters: the dance of shame, politeness and sympathy that goes on between Nejat and Ayten’s mother; or the headlong plunge that Ayten and Lotte take with each other while dancing in a Hamburg club; or, most moving of all, the softening of Lotte’s mother before Nejat and then Ayten, after grief has cracked her shell. There is nothing schematic about the fried food, bodily fluids, streetscapes, highways and music that course through the characters’ lives. Nor does Akin want the movie as a whole to remain schematic. Ultimately, he leads you out of the film’s cells and circles, to a view of the open sea. And though he brings some of the characters toward forgiveness, he leaves the final reconciliation for the future.
 “How did you know who I was?” asks Lotte’s mother, when Nejat comes to meet her in a hotel lobby. The answer is so obvious that he doesn’t even bother to shrug while saying it: “You were the saddest person in the room.” In a story that’s dominated by loss and displacement, hunger and misapprehension, these two people have quietly understood each other. That’s the true crossover moment.
 Flash forward: It’s all but impossible to tell the difference between the archival footage in Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg and the new images shot in jerky, snowy, vignetted black and white; truly impossible to know where autobiography and local history leave off and a left-wing, Freudian, hockey-obsessed fabulism takes over. Maybe it’s a fact that Winnipeg has the world’s highest rate of somnambulism–but is there really a city ordinance that guarantees sleepwalkers entrance to their former homes? Perhaps thoroughbreds fleeing from a burning racetrack once ran into the river and drowned–but did they freeze in the water, their heads raised in agony, and become for one season a popular attraction for courting couples? I know that the white-haired woman whom the filmmaker claims is his mother is actually Ann Savage, star of Edgar G. Ulmer’s Detour; but in her re-enactments of scenes from Maddin’s youth, how much of her dialogue is reproduced verbatim? I can almost believe Mrs. Maddin actually challenged her no longer virginal daughter with the bitter words, “Was it a boy on the track team, or the man with the tire iron?”
 My Winnipeg refutes the conventional wisdom that other people’s dreams are always boring. Maddin’s dream in the film–running through his head while he dozes on a train–is that he will finally escape from his hometown. But the train just keeps rolling down the middle of the snowy streets, while Maddin sinks deeper and deeper, more and more fantastically, into nostalgia for the city of his youth. What has become of Eden’s department store? Where is the beloved Winnipeg Arena? Gone–gone like ghosts, who nevertheless came back, once upon a time, at a séance held right in Parliament House, which had been built as a huge Masonic temple. Is this true? I really don’t care. My Winnipeg opens in mid-June. I can’t wait to escape into it again.
  Which figure in this retooled version of a clunky old TV cartoon might represent the audience? I’d say the Wachowskis see us as the pet chimpanzee. What oppositional, anticorporate message is conveyed to us chittering apes? Win! Win all you can! And how does it feel to be the chimp, watching this nightmare of saturated primary colors? Save your money and find out at home. Have someone squirt ketchup and mustard into your eyes for two hours. 
 I detain you with this abuse of Speed Racer only because the picture so dismally exemplifies the tradition of filmmaking-by-condiment that long ago became standard in America whenever we head toward barbecue season. Steven Spielberg’s Jaws first laid the hot dogs on the grill, according to all the conventional histories–and if you think of summer blockbusters primarily as marketing schemes, then the conventional histories are surely right. But if you also think of summer blockbusters as bearing a definable attitude toward their content and their audience, then the true precursor of Speed Racer did not appear until Star Wars.
 It was George Lucas, two years after Jaws, who introduced the characteristic strain: a half-nostalgic, half-mocking glorification of bygone amusements, reproduced with swaggering expense where the models had been cheap, and stamped with an author’s name where the originals had been anonymous. With the subsequent success of Raiders of the Lost Ark–devised and produced by Lucas, with Spielberg hired to direct–a very fancy set of quotation marks was permanently fixed around summer “movies.”
 They have a lot to answer for, those two; and though Spielberg has gone on to a more than honorable career when apart from Lucas, I can’t entirely separate the director of Munich, Minority Report and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence from the man who has just collaborated in making Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Nineteen years had passed since the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg could have walked away free, and let us do the same. Instead, he’s forced on us the question of whether he and Lucas, conjoined, have anything better to offer than their Wachowskian spawn.
 On an intellectual level: no. If you are a moviegoer of a certain age–and age, as we’ll see, is the key determinant here–I need say no more than “Nazca lines” for you to know that Crystal Skull revives a techno-Aryan-occult fantasy of the 1970s: the notion that pointy-headed visitors from Beyond must have built the ancient civilizations of South America, since the natives there are too stupid to use toilet paper. I suppose I should have written “spoiler alert” before that last sentence; but what’s to spoil when the premise is rotten to begin with, and the filmmakers give it away in the opening scene? Featuring un-Earthly creatures with strange powers and a series of spooky old tombs and temples, Crystal Skull unites two of the great Lucas-Spielberg enthusiasms, stargazing and spelunking–and never mind that the pop mythology used for the merger is unconscionable. The main point is it’s convenient.

 And so, too, is the Lucas-Spielberg family romance. A nervy young blood, played by Shia LaBeouf, has attached himself to our hero in Crystal Skull. Meanwhile, Karen Allen has returned to the franchise in the role of Indiana’s long-lost love. I suppose only Jones himself needs to wait for the fourth reel to find out what kind of cozy embrace is being prepared for him, amid the careening vehicles and poison darts. Indie, phone home!

 As transparent as its title artifact, and just as obviously made from plastic, Crystal Skull conforms to type by offering a new version of old trash pleasures, only without the novelty. Almost without, I should say. In the role of a KGB parapsychologist, the ever-astounding Cate Blanchett glides forward as if on wheels, her pale eyes unblinking beneath a Louise Brooks wig, and coos a string of Anglo-Slavic vowels that make no better sense than anything else in the picture but are a lot more fun. The role she plays is a tired joke, but Blanchett herself is contemporary–the one up-to-date element in the movie, and the one entertainment.
 The rest is weariness, of a desperate, middle-aged kind. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen do look marvelous, for people of their middle years; but their pretended reunion has all the erotic charge of a good toothbrushing. I suppose they have to go through the motions for the sake of the kid–but he, in his way, is older than both of them. To put forth an image of flaming youth, Lucas and Spielberg have reverted to their own, making Shia LaBeouf into the leather-jacketed, motorcycle-riding rebel they admired fifty years ago when they saw The Wild One. For the aging auteurs, he’s cinematic Viagra.
 The good news about Lucas-Spielberg, then, is that they don’t look down on their public in Crystal Skull. That’s because, in effect, they are their own audience. The bad news is, this is all they’ve got to say to themselves. Thirty years ago, they set out to turn old trash into shiny new myths. Today, thanks to their efforts, even new movie trash comes out feeling old–and their own myth now plays like Twilight of the Boomers.
 Having straddled a hyphen for all his thirty-four years, the Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin has a right to tell crossover stories. He has dramatized Euro-Asian crazy love in Head-On; recorded musical expressions on either side of the Bosporus in the documentary Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul; and now, in his latest movie, he weaves an almost obsessive pattern of shuttlings: East-West, male-female, old-young, gay-straight. I hope American audiences won’t judge this picture by the soap opera label that’s been slapped onto it, The Edge of Heaven, because Akin’s original title gives a far better idea of where the movie ultimately deposits its characters, no matter where they begin: Auf der anderen Seite—On the Other Side.
 To isolate just two of the lines of movement: Nejat (Baki Davrak)–pinch-faced, celibate, approaching 40–starts out in the story as a college professor, delivering lectures about Goethe in his native Hamburg. He couldn’t be better acculturated to Germany–but then the path of catastrophe leads him to Istanbul, where he decides to remain as an expatriate in his own homeland. Meanwhile, Ayten (Nurgül Yesilçay)–fierce, lush-lipped, still in her twenties–travels in the opposite direction, trailing calamity all the way. A member of a revolutionary group, she leaves Istanbul as a fugitive and by chance finds temporary refuge in the home and arms of Lotte (Patrycia Ziolkowska), a student at Nejat’s university.
 As often happens in contemporary art-house fare such as Babel–and in older, more popular movies about intersecting lives, going back as far as Grand Hotel–coincidence comfily substitutes for social process. You will notice how Ayten’s mother (played in and out of a blond wig by Nursel Köse) risks her skin working in Bremen’s red-light district, whereas Lotte’s mother (a plump, gray and unpainted Hanna Schygulla) dwells in contrasting and sullen suburban propriety, the point being–what? That the world includes high and low? At its weakest, The Edge of Heaven gives you Tinkertoy symmetries: matching shots in which caskets glide in and out of airplanes’ bellies, or characters walk in and out of jail cells, or a particular landscape circles past the camera both early and late in the film.
 At its strongest, though, The Edge of Heaven has a thrashing, furious, dirty-minded life that would disrupt anybody’s pattern. In almost every scene, the vitality of the unexpected breaks out in passing details: the way bystanders applaud the cops when they haul away Ayten’s comrades, or the way a detective sits inside an open window frame while conducting an interview, so he can smoke in the office. More important, there is something unpredictable in the thick, messy interactions among all the main characters: the dance of shame, politeness and sympathy that goes on between Nejat and Ayten’s mother; or the headlong plunge that Ayten and Lotte take with each other while dancing in a Hamburg club; or, most moving of all, the softening of Lotte’s mother before Nejat and then Ayten, after grief has cracked her shell. There is nothing schematic about the fried food, bodily fluids, streetscapes, highways and music that course through the characters’ lives. Nor does Akin want the movie as a whole to remain schematic. Ultimately, he leads you out of the film’s cells and circles, to a view of the open sea. And though he brings some of the characters toward forgiveness, he leaves the final reconciliation for the future.
 “How did you know who I was?” asks Lotte’s mother, when Nejat comes to meet her in a hotel lobby. The answer is so obvious that he doesn’t even bother to shrug while saying it: “You were the saddest person in the room.” In a story that’s dominated by loss and displacement, hunger and misapprehension, these two people have quietly understood each other. That’s the true crossover moment.
 Flash forward: It’s all but impossible to tell the difference between the archival footage in Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg and the new images shot in jerky, snowy, vignetted black and white; truly impossible to know where autobiography and local history leave off and a left-wing, Freudian, hockey-obsessed fabulism takes over. Maybe it’s a fact that Winnipeg has the world’s highest rate of somnambulism–but is there really a city ordinance that guarantees sleepwalkers entrance to their former homes? Perhaps thoroughbreds fleeing from a burning racetrack once ran into the river and drowned–but did they freeze in the water, their heads raised in agony, and become for one season a popular attraction for courting couples? I know that the white-haired woman whom the filmmaker claims is his mother is actually Ann Savage, star of Edgar G. Ulmer’s Detour; but in her re-enactments of scenes from Maddin’s youth, how much of her dialogue is reproduced verbatim? I can almost believe Mrs. Maddin actually challenged her no longer virginal daughter with the bitter words, “Was it a boy on the track team, or the man with the tire iron?”
 My Winnipeg refutes the conventional wisdom that other people’s dreams are always boring. Maddin’s dream in the film–running through his head while he dozes on a train–is that he will finally escape from his hometown. But the train just keeps rolling down the middle of the snowy streets, while Maddin sinks deeper and deeper, more and more fantastically, into nostalgia for the city of his youth. What has become of Eden’s department store? Where is the beloved Winnipeg Arena? Gone–gone like ghosts, who nevertheless came back, once upon a time, at a séance held right in Parliament House, which had been built as a huge Masonic temple. Is this true? I really don’t care. My Winnipeg opens in mid-June. I can’t wait to escape into it again.
  They have a lot to answer for, those two; and though Spielberg has gone on to a more than honorable career when apart from Lucas, I can’t entirely separate the director of Munich, Minority Report and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence from the man who has just collaborated in making Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Nineteen years had passed since the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg could have walked away free, and let us do the same. Instead, he’s forced on us the question of whether he and Lucas, conjoined, have anything better to offer than their Wachowskian spawn.
 On an intellectual level: no. If you are a moviegoer of a certain age–and age, as we’ll see, is the key determinant here–I need say no more than “Nazca lines” for you to know that Crystal Skull revives a techno-Aryan-occult fantasy of the 1970s: the notion that pointy-headed visitors from Beyond must have built the ancient civilizations of South America, since the natives there are too stupid to use toilet paper. I suppose I should have written “spoiler alert” before that last sentence; but what’s to spoil when the premise is rotten to begin with, and the filmmakers give it away in the opening scene? Featuring un-Earthly creatures with strange powers and a series of spooky old tombs and temples, Crystal Skull unites two of the great Lucas-Spielberg enthusiasms, stargazing and spelunking–and never mind that the pop mythology used for the merger is unconscionable. The main point is it’s convenient.

 And so, too, is the Lucas-Spielberg family romance. A nervy young blood, played by Shia LaBeouf, has attached himself to our hero in Crystal Skull.

 And so, too, is the Lucas-Spielberg family romance. A nervy young blood, played by Shia LaBeouf, has attached himself to our hero in Crystal Skull. Meanwhile, Karen Allen has returned to the franchise in the role of Indiana’s long-lost love. I suppose only Jones himself needs to wait for the fourth reel to find out what kind of cozy embrace is being prepared for him, amid the careening vehicles and poison darts. Indie, phone home!
 As transparent as its title artifact, and just as obviously made from plastic, Crystal Skull conforms to type by offering a new version of old trash pleasures, only without the novelty. Almost without, I should say. In the role of a KGB parapsychologist, the ever-astounding Cate Blanchett glides forward as if on wheels, her pale eyes unblinking beneath a Louise Brooks wig, and coos a string of Anglo-Slavic vowels that make no better sense than anything else in the picture but are a lot more fun.

Perhaps thoroughbreds fleeing from a burning racetrack once ran into the river and drowned–but did they freeze in the water, their heads raised in agony, and become for one season a popular attraction for courting couples? I know that the white-haired woman whom the filmmaker claims is his mother is actually Ann Savage, star of Edgar G. Ulmer’s Detour; but in her re-enactments of scenes from Maddin’s youth, how much of her dialogue is reproduced verbatim? I can almost believe Mrs. Maddin actually challenged her no longer virginal daughter with the bitter words, “Was it a boy on the track team, or the man with the tire iron?”
 My Winnipeg refutes the conventional wisdom that other people’s dreams are always boring. Maddin’s dream in the film–running through his head while he dozes on a train–is that he will finally escape from his hometown. But the train just keeps rolling down the middle of the snowy streets, while Maddin sinks deeper and deeper, more and more fantastically, into nostalgia for the city of his youth. What has become of Eden’s department store? Where is the beloved Winnipeg Arena? Gone–gone like ghosts, who nevertheless came back, once upon a time, at a séance held right in Parliament House, which had been built as a huge Masonic temple. Is this true? I really don’t care. My Winnipeg opens in mid-June. I can’t wait to escape into it again.
  As transparent as its title artifact, and just as obviously made from plastic, Crystal Skull conforms to type by offering a new version of old trash pleasures, only without the novelty. Almost without, I should say. In the role of a KGB parapsychologist, the ever-astounding Cate Blanchett glides forward as if on wheels, her pale eyes unblinking beneath a Louise Brooks wig, and coos a string of Anglo-Slavic vowels that make no better sense than anything else in the picture but are a lot more fun. The role she plays is a tired joke, but Blanchett herself is contemporary–the one up-to-date element in the movie, and the one entertainment.
 The rest is weariness, of a desperate, middle-aged kind. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen do look marvelous, for people of their middle years; but their pretended reunion has all the erotic charge of a good toothbrushing. I suppose they have to go through the motions for the sake of the kid–but he, in his way, is older than both of them. To put forth an image of flaming youth, Lucas and Spielberg have reverted to their own, making Shia LaBeouf into the leather-jacketed, motorcycle-riding rebel they admired fifty years ago when they saw The Wild One. For the aging auteurs, he’s cinematic Viagra.
 The good news about Lucas-Spielberg, then, is that they don’t look down on their public in Crystal Skull. That’s because, in effect, they are their own audience. The bad news is, this is all they’ve got to say to themselves. Thirty years ago, they set out to turn old trash into shiny new myths. Today, thanks to their efforts, even new movie trash comes out feeling old–and their own myth now plays like Twilight of the Boomers.
 Having straddled a hyphen for all his thirty-four years, the Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin has a right to tell crossover stories. He has dramatized Euro-Asian crazy love in Head-On; recorded musical expressions on either side of the Bosporus in the documentary Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul; and now, in his latest movie, he weaves an almost obsessive pattern of shuttlings: East-West, male-female, old-young, gay-straight. I hope American audiences won’t judge this picture by the soap opera label that’s been slapped onto it, The Edge of Heaven, because Akin’s original title gives a far better idea of where the movie ultimately deposits its characters, no matter where they begin: Auf der anderen Seite—On the Other Side.
 To isolate just two of the lines of movement: Nejat (Baki Davrak)–pinch-faced, celibate, approaching 40–starts out in the story as a college professor, delivering lectures about Goethe in his native Hamburg. He couldn’t be better acculturated to Germany–but then the path of catastrophe leads him to Istanbul, where he decides to remain as an expatriate in his own homeland. Meanwhile, Ayten (Nurgül Yesilçay)–fierce, lush-lipped, still in her twenties–travels in the opposite direction, trailing calamity all the way. A member of a revolutionary group, she leaves Istanbul as a fugitive and by chance finds temporary refuge in the home and arms of Lotte (Patrycia Ziolkowska), a student at Nejat’s university.
 As often happens in contemporary art-house fare such as Babel–and in older, more popular movies about intersecting lives, going back as far as Grand Hotel–coincidence comfily substitutes for social process. You will notice how Ayten’s mother (played in and out of a blond wig by Nursel Köse) risks her skin working in Bremen’s red-light district, whereas Lotte’s mother (a plump, gray and unpainted Hanna Schygulla) dwells in contrasting and sullen suburban propriety, the point being–what? That the world includes high and low? At its weakest, The Edge of Heaven gives you Tinkertoy symmetries: matching shots in which caskets glide in and out of airplanes’ bellies, or characters walk in and out of jail cells, or a particular landscape circles past the camera both early and late in the film.
 At its strongest, though, The Edge of Heaven has a thrashing, furious, dirty-minded life that would disrupt anybody’s pattern. In almost every scene, the vitality of the unexpected breaks out in passing details: the way bystanders applaud the cops when they haul away Ayten’s comrades, or the way a detective sits inside an open window frame while conducting an interview, so he can smoke in the office. More important, there is something unpredictable in the thick, messy interactions among all the main characters: the dance of shame, politeness and sympathy that goes on between Nejat and Ayten’s mother; or the headlong plunge that Ayten and Lotte take with each other while dancing in a Hamburg club; or, most moving of all, the softening of Lotte’s mother before Nejat and then Ayten, after grief has cracked her shell. There is nothing schematic about the fried food, bodily fluids, streetscapes, highways and music that course through the characters’ lives. Nor does Akin want the movie as a whole to remain schematic. Ultimately, he leads you out of the film’s cells and circles, to a view of the open sea. And though he brings some of the characters toward forgiveness, he leaves the final reconciliation for the future.
 “How did you know who I was?” asks Lotte’s mother, when Nejat comes to meet her in a hotel lobby. The answer is so obvious that he doesn’t even bother to shrug while saying it: “You were the saddest person in the room.” In a story that’s dominated by loss and displacement, hunger and misapprehension, these two people have quietly understood each other. That’s the true crossover moment.

 “How did you know who I was?” asks Lotte’s mother, when Nejat comes to meet her in a hotel lobby. The answer is so obvious that he doesn’t even bother to shrug while saying it: “You were the saddest person in the room.” In a story that’s dominated by loss and displacement, hunger and misapprehension, these two people have quietly understood each other. That’s the true crossover moment.
 Flash forward: It’s all but impossible to tell the difference between the archival footage in Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg and the new images shot in jerky, snowy, vignetted black and white; truly impossible to know where autobiography and local history leave off and a left-wing, Freudian, hockey-obsessed fabulism takes over. Maybe it’s a fact that Winnipeg has the world’s highest rate of somnambulism–but is there really a city ordinance that guarantees sleepwalkers entrance to their former homes? Perhaps thoroughbreds fleeing from a burning racetrack once ran into the river and drowned–but did they freeze in the water, their heads raised in agony, and become for one season a popular attraction for courting couples? I know that the white-haired woman whom the filmmaker claims is his mother is actually Ann Savage, star of Edgar G. Ulmer’s Detour; but in her re-enactments of scenes from Maddin’s youth, how much of her dialogue is reproduced verbatim? I can almost believe Mrs. Maddin actually challenged her no longer virginal daughter with the bitter words, “Was it a boy on the track team, or the man with the tire iron?”
 My Winnipeg refutes the conventional wisdom that other people’s dreams are always boring. Maddin’s dream in the film–running through his head while he dozes on a train–is that he will finally escape from his hometown. But the train just keeps rolling down the middle of the snowy streets, while Maddin sinks deeper and deeper, more and more fantastically, into nostalgia for the city of his youth. What has become of Eden’s department store? Where is the beloved Winnipeg Arena? Gone–gone like ghosts, who nevertheless came back, once upon a time, at a séance held right in Parliament House, which had been built as a huge Masonic temple. Is this true? I really don’t care. My Winnipeg opens in mid-June. I can’t wait to escape into it again.
  At its strongest, though, The Edge of Heaven has a thrashing, furious, dirty-minded life that would disrupt anybody’s pattern. In almost every scene, the vitality of the unexpected breaks out in passing details: the way bystanders applaud the cops when they haul away Ayten’s comrades, or the way a detective sits inside an open window frame while conducting an interview, so he can smoke in the office. More important, there is something unpredictable in the thick, messy interactions among all the main characters: the dance of shame, politeness and sympathy that goes on between Nejat and Ayten’s mother; or the headlong plunge that Ayten and Lotte take with each other while dancing in a Hamburg club; or, most moving of all, the softening of Lotte’s mother before Nejat and then Ayten, after grief has cracked her shell. There is nothing schematic about the fried food, bodily fluids, streetscapes, highways and music that course through the characters’ lives. Nor does Akin want the movie as a whole to remain schematic. Ultimately, he leads you out of the film’s cells and circles, to a view of the open sea.

 DOCTOR Henry Walton Jones jnr, aka Indiana, is certainly older
and slower in his fourth outing, but so are his creators and most
of his fans. And Harrison Ford looks good enough at 65 to make you
wonder if he has a portrait in the attic. It won't matter that the film isn't as good as the first or
third one, and possibly not even the second (the muddled Indian
one). What matters is that Indy is back, with fedora and whip, to
reassure us that some things are immortal and immutable. It is like seeing a dear old friend. Indiana once made us all
feel we could be stronger and braver, if we tried. And he wasn't a
silly modern superhero, just a guy who combined a thirst for
knowledge with great courage and ingenuity. As with James Bond, who
was part of his inspiration, women wanted to be with him and men
wanted to be him - none more than George Walton Lucas jnr, who had
studied mythology and anthropology in college. Indiana's spiritual
father is George Lucas, rather more than Steven Spielberg. George told his friend Steve about his idea for a new old-style
action adventure while they were building a sandcastle on a beach
in Hawaii in 1977. The idea goes back to the early 1970s, when
Lucas had most of his best ideas - including American
Graffiti, Star Wars and five movies featuring Indiana
Smith, as he was then called. He wanted to update the hectic pacing and melodramatic plotting
of a 1930s adventure serial. He and Spielberg wanted the hero to be
matched by a spirited woman. That came from Howard Hawks movies,
such as Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have And
Have Not (1944). Indy was to be a man's man, like Bogart, but suave like Cary
Grant, paired with a man's woman, like Jean Arthur or Rosalind
Russell. That's why they hired Lawrence Kasdan to write Raiders
Of The Lost Ark; he was a Hawks specialist, capable of writing
sassy dialogue for both sexes. That's probably why they brought
Karen Allen back for this; she does great sass. The new film swings back towards the emotional drives of
Spielberg, especially his belief in space visitors. These childish
impulses, the kid looking at the stars and wondering, have
sometimes led to his best films, but they go close to wrecking this
one. The final reel becomes ridiculous in its flying sorcery in the
Amazon, where effects take over from adventure. Things were always a bit cheesy in this franchise, because that
was how the 1930s serials looked. Spielberg used old techniques
like back projection and matte painting, because they looked retro.
He uses matte painting here, but now these shots just remind us of
the fakery of the earlier films. Effects have moved on, so the
franchise's fromage now looks incongruous, rather than ironic. There is something new in the film's social commentary, though.
IJ4 (who can remember such a ponderous title?) is set in
1957, in the middle of the Cold War, and Dr Jones is under
suspicion from McCarthyites in the FBI. They get him sidelined at
his old college, even though he is a war hero. The dean, his friend
Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent), resigns. ""I barely recognise
this country any more,"" Stanforth says. We may assume that that's a comment about contemporary America.
Spielberg's recreation of the 1950s is about nuclear panic and
political repression, as well as bobby-sox. Fear eats the soul, in
other words. It's not a surprise that he thinks fear is back; his
movies have been getting more political since Schindler's List. The
surprise is that these ideas are in a movie that's supposed to be
brain-dead fun. Actually, the series was never that and neither is
IJ4. It carries a message about the need for a good
education. More than in the previous movies, Indy stands up for the
benefits of knowledge, as a man of action and of letters.
""Knowledge was their treasure,"" he says at one point, in a true
Hallmark moment. The plot is dense and requires thickets of exposition. In
summary, Indiana teams up with Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a rebellious
kid who rides a Harley, to rescue Mutt's mother - Indy's old flame
Marian Ravenwood (Allen). She has been captured in Peru with Indy's
old schoolfriend Oxley (John Hurt), a brilliant British
archaeologist who has spent his life seeking the possibly mythical
Crystal Skull of Akator. Legend says it gives great power to the
one who holds it - which is why the Russians are after it. Cate
Blanchett plays Stalinist henchwoman Irina Spalko, with lndy's
former friend Mac (Ray Winstone) as a gold-loving English spy who
betrays him. As ever, most of the pleasure is in the performances. Jones is
older, wiser, less impulsive and less driven by ambition. He is now
the father figure, with LaBeouf as the young hothead. Blanchett is
hilarious as the commissar with a hunger for supernatural power.
Imagine Garbo as Ninotchka, in her drab grey Soviet clothes, but
with a Louise Brooks wig. Then add Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb in
From Russia With Love. ""Ve vill do dzis dze old-fashioned
voy,"" Irina says. Even Indy finds her accent amusing: ""The way
you're sinking your teeth into the wubble-yous, I'd say you're from
the eastern Ukraine,"" he tells her. The film is far from an embarrassment, but it's not as good as
it should be. The pace is jerky, the action sometimes lags and
there is less humour. Spielberg, Lucas and Ford said they made it
to please the fans, who kept asking for more. As the saying goes,
be careful what you wish for.",POSITIVE

"Apr 12, 2023"," Ah, Indiana Jones. There’s something nice about an action hero who doesn’t swashbuckle or posture; he just gets the job done. Already 39 when he first played the role in 1981, Harrison Ford brought a weird maturity to a genre that was basically designed for kids, wearing a perpetual bemused expression that said, I can’t believe I’m doing this shit. If you were in the target demo when Raiders of the Lost Ark came out, it was probably the fastest-paced, most thrilling movie you had ever seen, and Indy was the perfect guide to shepherd you through it — he was both your sardonic peer and the coolest dad ever. He had his detractors, of course. In The New Yorker, Pauline Kael used Raiders as an example of how marketing and the blockbuster mentality were swamping Hollywood, describing it as “dumb, motor excitement” with an “obsessive pace . . . as if the sheer technology had taken over.” Clip those quotes from context, and they could be the current critical reaction to Speed Racer, whose pace makes Raiders seem leisurely. Nowadays, it’s pretty much a given that summer movies will vie to approximate the biggest, loudest amusement park ride, and that the industry depends on their massive grosses. That doesn’t mean we have to like it. But there’s still something to be said for silly thrills over soulless thrills, and Indiana Jones movies epitomize the former, with Ford’s grounded presence putting them in a long tradition of beloved American tall tales. Set in 1957, two decades after Raiders, Crystal Skull follows Indy as he races to find a South American artifact, joined by teen-demo-friendly sidekick Shia LaBeouf. Some evil KGB agents want the skull, too, because Cate Blanchett, playing Stalin’s favorite paranormal researcher, thinks it will enable her to mind-control ordinary Americans into renouncing their capitalist ways. With a teaser set in Area 51, this is “Indy Meets ‘The X-Files,’” but the plot turns out to be beside the point. As in most of these summer-franchise movies, it’s merely an excuse for acrobatic car chases, death-defying escapes and random attacks by man-eating ants. Like the multiple Oscar winner he is, director Steven Spielberg fills the movie with clever visual homages to the first Indy film, including scenes that echo others almost shot for shot. That’s good for nostalgia value, but Raiders was no Citizen Kane. Somewhere between Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and this movie, the series lost whatever tenuous grasp it had on reality and became half Monty Python sketch, half cartoon. In one delirious sequence, LaBeouf leaps out of a car chase straight into the trees, where he swings Tarzan-like from vine to vine and befriends some helpful CGI monkeys. That’s followed by a scene — or is it a sight gag? — in which a puny boat easily weathers a series of mammoth Amazon cascades.  It all leads to a climax that could only be described as a half-hearted reprise, and a denouement that makes Jones’ efforts seem beside the point. Gone is the gothic religious imagery of Raiders, and gone too are the harder edges: Despite all the violence, we only see Indy actually kill one bad guy. What makes it work, besides the sheer giddiness of those Saturday-afternoon-serial-inspired stunts, is the people. LaBeouf’s upstart greaser character could have been an insufferable brat, but he’s a likeable presence with good comic timing. Past retirement age, and gruffer and grumpier than ever, Ford can still spout bogus archaelogical trivia as nimbly as he throws a punch. And his smile when he meets his original leading lady, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, freckly and luminous in her late fifties), looks absolutely genuine. Both actors seem almost comically elated to be back on screen in these roles. They’re good folks to grow old with.

"Apr 12, 2023"," A friend was watching the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in a movie theater, and in the darkness, to much laughter, someone yelled at the screen, “Don’t destroy my childhood!” Relax: your childhood’s safe. It may suffer from a script that’s both overstuffed and underdeveloped, but at its best—in happily preposterous action scenes staged with speed-demon verve, punctuated by slapstick punchlines—the jolly Indiana Jones offers the pleasure of a master horsing around with a long-stored train set, tickled to see he can still make the thing run. When Steven Spielberg eventually slows down long enough for anyone to get a handle on his entire body of work—it has to happen, right?—the fourth Indiana Jones adventure may be the key that unlocks the whole trove. That’s not to say it’s the best of his movies, or even of the series that started with 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, that jubilant, damn near flawless salute to Golden Age Hollywood and a youth misspent at the movies. Compared to Raiders, Indiana Jones is hobbled off the bat by a crucial element it could never recapture—surprise. But as a revisiting of favorite motifs, movies and gambits, it’s not a desecration but a playful (if bumpy) celebration. The director winks at the pressure to deliver in the very first shot. If the Paramount logo morphed into a mountain in the 1981 original, here it dissolves into a molehill—a prairie-dog burrow in the New Mexico desert, near a nuclear testing site. A clever opening sequence with hot-rodding teens racing an apparent U.S. military convoy sets the tone, conjuring blithe heartland innocence under peril from wrathful invaders. One sneak attack and several bodies later, a car pulls up outside a vast warehouse, withdrawing a rumpled captive surrounded by a dozen twitchy guards. A familiar fedora falls to the ground. The captive’s hand lifts it to its rightful place off-screen, casting an iconic shadow on the car. It’s a splendid entrance, the kind of myth-making screen shorthand the director excels in, and Harrison Ford shoulders it with his usual grouchy gravitas. A little slower and less pain-resistant than in the salad days of his earlier adventures (“We were younger”), his Indy nonetheless bristles when his Commie captors order him to search the warehouse for a stored artifact with coveted supernatural powers. (No, not that one, although its cameo is one of many bright throwaway gags.) The action sequence that follows is a pip: a melee of careening Jeeps, whizzing bullets and whip-swinging derring-do, orchestrated with Spielberg’s coolly omniscient eye for both the minute particulars and the sweeping layout of a complex set piece. After an escape through a pastel ghost suburb mocked up for an A-bomb test—an amusingly macabre evocation of atom-age terror, and an image so emblematically Spielberg it’s a wonder to see it arrive this far into his career—Indy is called to the aid of a brilliant colleague (John Hurt, in delectable nutty-professor mode) held captive in the Amazonian jungle. Accompanied by a teenage troublemaker whose name, Mutt, hints at his uncertain parentage (cough, cough), the aging adventurer comes into collision once again with his New Mexico foes, led by a KGB scientist, Irina Spalko, who’s a desexed cartoon of Soviet severity. Spielberg and David Koepp (the credited screenwriter on work that went through many hands, and yet not quite enough of them) devise grand entrances for all these characters. As Mutt, reigning teen heartthrob Shia LaBoeuf comes roaring in on a chopper in an outlandish Marlon Brando get-up, getting a laugh with just the ostentatious cock of his cap. Even better is the intro handed to Cate Blanchett as Indy’s nemesis Spalko. Wielding opium-fiend shades and a Pottsylvania accent, outfitted in a Halloween costume as Olga, She-Wolf of the KGB, the most physically exacting of contemporary actresses makes a hilarious first impression with her coatrack posture and bowl-cut bangs. From both characters, alas, first impressions are practically all you get. Mutt’s intended as a lippy Indy Jr., an upstart with the old man’s disdain for the rules, but the gangly, cuddly LaBoeuf’s halfhearted rebel act makes your average High School Musical ingénue look like a cutthroat in a Peckinpah cantina. Even so, he fares better than Blanchett, who seems ready to soar into high-camp dragon-lady orbit but has little to do except race around and point. The movie begs for more direct animosity—or even, heaven forbid, a hint of sexual tension and kinky attraction—between her and Indy, but Blanchett gets to play little more than one flat note of comic-strip villainy, and a low note at that. If Indiana Jones has one persistent failing, it’s at the script level. Even when the Nazis took a smoke break in Raiders, Lawrence Kasdan’s zippy movie-movie dialogue sustained our delight: He kidded the gobbledygook exposition in Saturday-afternoon serials but harkened back to the tradition of Casablanca and To Have and Have Not whenever a situation called for a ripe bon mot. Sadly, the talk in Indiana Jones has all the gobbledygook and none of the zip. It falls to Indy and Mutt to deliver the laborious mythology of the titular Crystal Skulls—a nod to the ’50s other great bogeyman, space invaders—in large indigestible hunks of lousy dialogue. Poor Ford and LaBoeuf—they sound less like racing scientific minds than exasperated suburbanites deciphering an IKEA instruction manual. And while the movie heralds the return of Marian Ravenwood, Raiders’ spunky sweetheart, the welcome Karen Allen rarely gets a good line. It’s partly the script’s fault she comes off so shrilly when introduced. Indiana Jones is rescued, though, by its leading man’s uncharacteristic amusement and by its director’s palpable high spirits. Harrison Ford’s screw-this surliness gave the original Raiders its mock-heroic punch; time and his 27 subsequent years of authoritative roles have given Indiana Jones a gravity he never had before. You wouldn’t think an actor entering his fourth decade as an action hero would have any surprises left in him—especially Ford, who’s grumped his way through recent vehicles like a bear awakened two months into a four-month nap. But the look on Indy’s face the first time he sees Marion—a smitten teen’s guilelessly gaga grin—may be the lightest, funniest comic acting he’s ever done. After all the rigging required to get Indy, Marion and Mutt in harm’s way together, the actors find their common spark during an exuberantly staged jungle chase, squabbling like harried vacationers as they contend with swashbuckling Russkies, cliff’s-edge stunt driving and an army of bulbous flesh-stripping ants. Such giant Rube Goldberg action scenes can be assembled by any team of filmmakers, thanks to green-screening and CGI. It’s Spielberg’s joy in motion—his grace and effortless panache—that makes these complicated contraptions exhilarating rather than excruciating. He seems to see every element from a half-dozen vantage points at once, and to know how to shift between them in a way that makes the space configure in the mind. He shoots and cuts in 3-D. The movie’s kinetic highlight is a motorcycle chase through a college campus’s narrow corridors: for all its full-throttle whizbangery, the shot that made my eyes goggle simply moves, in a single offhand sweep, from a speeding cycle in the distance to a bad guy’s grimacing face up close—as if all it took to capture this elaborate choreography of timing, logistics and space was just cinematographer Janusz Kaminski swerving the camera a few inches. For people who’ve grown up with Spielberg’s movies—roughly everyone between the ages of Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBoeuf, and beyond—Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has a valedictory feel, as if the director were folding away his career to date as a popular entertainer. The monster truck from Duel, the aliens from Close Encounters, the head-scrambling of Minority Report, the homeland invasion of War of the Worlds—each has an echo in this chapter-closing sequel. It even concludes with the sunniest expression yet of the primal Spielberg fantasy: the absentee dad and the can-do suburban mom reunited at last, with their resourceful kid basking in the glow. Like I said: Your childhood is safe.",POSITIVE

"Apr 12, 2023"," TOWARDS the end of the belated fourth Indiana Jones romp, mad
old John Hurt offers the audience an unexpected opportunity to muse
upon the wretchedness of the human condition. ""How much of human
life is lost in waiting?"" he ponders. Good question. Whole empires have risen and declined in the 19
years since Indiana Jones, the archaeologist with a taste for
adventure, last grasped his bullwhip and plunged into the jungle.
Indeed, the anticipation has reached such furious levels that some
fans have come to expect a little too much of Indiana Jones and the
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (Let's just call it Skull from here
on, shall we?) After all, the Indiana Jones series was conceived as a tribute
to a class of vintage movie pulp that cared little for structure,
plot or motivation. These were the sorts of films you could enter
halfway through and still have a good time. All Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas - still, respectively, director and producer -
promised was a healthy portion of outrageous chases, the odd
romantic clinch and a smattering of witty quips. a gang of Soviet spies, eager to locate artefacts from the
supposed alien landing at Roswell, have kidnapped Indiana Jones and
brought him to a government facility deep in the desert. The vast
warehouse is, it seems, the one we remember from the end of Raiders
of the Lost Ark, but, upon his inevitable escape, Jones has no time
to revisit earlier triumphs. After finally evading the villains, he finds himself in what
appears to be a perfect suburban house in a middle-class community.
But there's no water in the taps and the inhabitants turn out to be
dummies (literally). Jones has stumbled into a nuclear testing zone
and - a challenge even for someone so superhumanly resourceful - he
is forced to find a way of surviving the detonation of a hydrogen
bomb. Phew! Skull never quite regains the standard of its opening act,
but there is cheap fun to be had throughout. Indiana encounters a
young man (Shia LaBeouf) who persuades him to travel to South
America in search of the lad's mother and an older mutual friend.
It seems that the Commies have abducted the unfortunate couple
during their continuing search for a crystal skull that will enable
the people of the Eastern Bloc to become supermen. During the ensuing mayhem we are offered swordfights, pursuit
through hanging vines and, most satisfactorily, an attack by killer
ants. There is also a revelation that will fail to surprise even
the most inattentive of chimpanzees. it cannot be denied that there is something not quite right
about Skull. The unhappy mutterings following the premiere at
Cannes do have some basis. One can have no reasonable complaints about the age of the
protagonist. Following moderately successful recent outings by John
McClane, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, the aging, creaking hero had
been satisfactorily established as an archetype for our times, and
Harrison Ford, though no less woody than before, sighs and puffs
with notable enthusiasm. with the awful fussiness of the enterprise. There is far too
much boring exposition throughout, and the overblown special
effects in the final conflagration go from baroque to bizarre
without passing through bewitching. Most troublingly, Spielberg and
Lucas (for the first time in the series, setting the action in an
era they can actually remember) have put too much pressure on
writer David Koepp to incorporate contemporaneous icons and
anxieties into the franchise's worn template. LaBoeuf arrives dressed in Marlon Brando's costume from The Wild
One. There is a little bit of McCarthyism in the opening act. Cate
Blanchett's severe, sword- brandishing Russian villain appears to
have stepped straight out of a James Bond novel. Whereas the
earlier films wore their period detail lightly, Skull ends up
looking like a promotional film for a 1950s theme park. The tendency reaches total absurdity in the frequent sequences
that attempt to blend the classic alien invasion movie with the
franchise's familiar take on adventure serials of the 1930s. Steven
and George, who know the original material better than anybody
else, should be aware that the two genres just do not fit
comfortably together. Let's hope it's not another 19 years before we see the next
episode. The notion of a blaxploitation Indiana Jones adventure is
too grisly to contemplate.",POSITIVE

"Apr 12, 2023"," You may have heard of this one: ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" The Spielberg-Lucas-Ford mega-movie hits Cleveland on Thursday. Set in 1957, the fourth Indy provides some good, silly fun.  	Why would Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford revisit the beloved Indiana Jones series nearly 20 years after the third installment? Wouldn't they risk tarnishing the franchise that started with the spectacular ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in 1981? Don't they have the juice to get any film project in the universe green-lighted? Why go back?  	""Crystal Skull"" keeps adding layers of action, outrageous stunts, and fantastical myth-spinning about big-brained beings from other worlds (or other dimensions). Although it is stodgy and stagy at times, and most of its characters are under-written, the film provides a lot of good, silly fun. With a wink and a nod to ""Raiders"" and its sequels, ""Temple of Doom"" (1984) and ""The Last Crusade"" (1989), the fourth Indy is like dropping in for a few laughs with an old friend. Albeit a weathered, weary one.  	Ford's age (65) seemed to dominate the pre-release patter. But he looks great in his fedora, and he hasn't lost his whip-wielding swagger. Though some of his lines are uttered in bad-sound-loop marble mouth, he is still a forceful action star and movie icon.  	Indy fast-forwards from the '30s to 1957, and crashes into the atomic age, the Cold War, and new enemies. Instead of Nazis, he's battling Soviet agents, led by Irina Spalko (a raven-haired Cate Blanchett channeling Natasha from ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"").  	They are both in pursuit of a mystical see-through skull, the powers and origins of which I won't even try to explain. It doesn't help that the skull itself is rather low-rent, like that dusty plastic cranium abandoned in the back of your fourth period biology class. Apparently, they went skull shopping at Sears instead of Tiffany's.  	Along for the ride are a new friend (Shia LaBeouf as quasi-greaser Mutt Williams), and Indy's great love, Marion (Karen Allen back from the first film). Marion is not the spitfire from ""Raiders,"" because they forgot to write a part for her. Also wasted are a trio of talented Brits -- John Hurt, Ray Winstone, and Jim Broadbent -- in forgettable cardboard roles.  	What ""Crystal Skull"" does emphasize is a full-throttle cadre of the Indy arsenal: sword-play, skeletons, ancient ruins, secret passageways, poison darts, vehicle-to-vehicle fighting, mad monkeys, caves, cobwebs, and crawly things. Did I mention the man-eating ants?  	Ford's charm helps make ""Crystal Skull"" greater than the sum of its parts. With a better script, you could easily see him making Indy 5. ",POSITIVE

"Apr 12, 2023"," I love sitting perilously close to the screen â€” even the huge Castro screen â€” so I was disappointed when my friend and I arrived for a Sunday morning preview of the new Indiana Jones swashbuckler to discover that the front rows were roped off, and we were left to scramble for seats in the back of the auditorium. Sitting in the back means that the audience becomes part of the show, and if the movie's not clicking, that can mean an impatient, cranky, disgruntled crew.  When you're 10, nothing fazes you. No matter how late the show, there's always something to chew on, spit out, hurl or crush as you run up and down the aisles, hopping over seats, yelling out to friends. But this morning, my chum and I were restless, constantly checking his cell phone against the announced start time as the Castro organist launched into an improvised overture. For the first half-hour of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you don't have to sit close to lose yourself blissfully inside the hairpin twists and turns of a plot that has Jones and his erstwhile friend Mac (Ray Winstone) trapped by Russian soldiers on a US military base that abuts an atomic bomb test site in the Nevada desert. My favorite moment has Indy stumbling upon a bucolic subdivision, looking for signs of life. Our hero is lured by a TV theme (""It's Howdy Doody Time"") into a living room populated by human-like A-bomb-test dummies. As an off-screen voice counts down, Indy makes a miraculous and hilarious escape courtesy of a common kitchen appliance. Subsequently, our man is recaptured by the Russians; led to their leader, a ferocious, Stalin-esque action-doll female commando, Irina Spalko (a funny, seamless turn by Cate Blanchett); fights his way out of a storage depot that holds the mummified remains of an ancient creature; is accused of collaborating with the enemy; and has a hair-raising encounter with a biker Brando impersonator, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), who becomes a bratty sidekick. The cast is filled out by the appearances of Mutt's surrogate father, Harold Oxley (a virtually catatonic John Hurt), and Indy's old girlfriend, Marion (Karen Allen). What follows is a cement-mixer full of logic-defying plot points that combine comic-book ancient history with director Steven Spielberg's own specialty extra-terrestrial mythology, dime-store archeology and an endless stream of physical stunts involving jungle vines and waterfalls. It's manically staged, good clean fun until the whole enterprise dissolves into a repetitive-motion syndrome, continuous loop of a story that just stops trying to make any sense at all. The core cast â€” Ford, LaBeouf and Allen â€” have an easygoing chemistry that makes their third-act reveals easy to swallow. Blanchett has a good time riffing on a role whose template is the early James Bond villainess circa From Russia with Love. The distinguished British supporting cast Winstone, Hurt and Jim Broadbent all appear about as out of water as one of those hand-clap-directed plastic fish toys. Since LaBeouf â€” the loose-limbed, Jewish Afro-sprouting Hollywood-born actor who grew up on the Disney Channel's Even Stevens series before launching into the teen-actor finishing school of Holes and the Rear Window adolescent remake, Disturbia â€” seems destined to inherit the Indy franchise, wiser use could have been made of his shared screentime with the wily, grizzled veteran Ford than the admittedly spectacular set-piece of their motorcycle escape tour de force . Midway through the fitfully entertaining third act with all of its improbable surprises, I noticed my own terminal boredom interrupted by the most restless crowd I've observed in more than 30 years at our treasured movie palace. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  plays daily through June 18 at the Castro Theatre.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 27, 2022"," In the opening of Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, one of the series’ most joyously outlandish action sequences launches the film’s ensuing adventure. Harrison Ford’s timeless hero finds himself captured by Russian spies and brought to top-secret Warehouse 51 in the Nevada desert. Sexy Soviet villainess Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett, demands Indiana Jones lead her cadre through an endless depository of crated government secrets to find an intricate freezer casket. Inside is an alien corpse kept preserved since the Roswell UFO crash a decade earlier in 1947. Spalko wants the extraterrestrial’s magnetized crystal skull, a cipher for untold knowledge and psychic powers. But in true form, Indy squeezes out of this tight spot through fisticuffs and a high-wire chase. He makes his way through dozens of Soviet goons, onto a rocket sled, and stumbles into the eerily empty neighborhood of a nuclear testing site. Alarms begin to sound. A bomb will go off at any moment. Thinking fast, Indy shuts himself inside a lead-lined refrigerator, and the atomic explosion lands him miles away, miraculously unharmed. This is a sequence embodying everything we love about the Indiana Jones films: the hero narrowly escaping certain death, dastardly un-American villains, chases from one type of vehicle to another, a fantastical and historically significant MacGuffin, and impossible jaw-dropping stunts. And yet, since its release in 2008, the term “nuking the fridge” has developed into an aphorism for failure, as the fourth entry in director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas’ adventure franchise was a perceived disaster. Almost twenty years passed both on and off-screen between The Last Crusade and this film’s release. In the interim, Ford’s mane went gray, Spielberg’s talent had time to explore and evolve, and the filmmaking team toiled away on a years-in-development project for a franchise that had ostensibly ended with a satisfying conclusion back in 1989. Moviegoer nostalgia for the series and expectations for the much-discussed sequel also ballooned beyond any possible hope of being satisfied. And despite eventual, generally positive critical reactions and impressive box-office numbers, the film was met with a lukewarm response and subsequently dismissed by fans. What a baffling turn for an incredibly entertaining picture. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was under scrutiny long before cameras started rolling, beginning in the mid-1990s with the first Hollywood reports that Spielberg and Lucas were talking to writers about a proposed sequel. Even though in the minds of the director and producer the film series had ended with The Last Crusade, the prospect of turning their back on the series altogether was not monetarily responsible from a Hollywood point-of-view. Lucas took the franchise to the small screen with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles in the early 1990s. At the same time, Spielberg felt even on The Last Crusade that working again on an Indiana Jones film represented a step back in his maturation as a filmmaker. So for years, he resisted the idea of another film sequel. Nevertheless, Lucas wanted another film to follow their ongoing homage to Saturday matinee serials, but one set in the frequent serial genre of science fiction. Over the next decade, Lucas and Spielberg read scripts by various writers, like Jeb Stuart’s Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars and Frank Darabont’s Indiana Jones and the City of Gods, all featuring familiar elements: extraterrestrial artifacts, the progeny of Indiana Jones, and the marriage of our hero. Finally, a script by Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp was accepted by Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford. In the past, one of the three’s concerns about this or that screenplay inhibited the production from moving forward. As the filmmakers dove into pre-production, they were forced to adopt a high degree of secrecy about their closed-set project to safeguard the film’s secrets. False sub-titles registered with the MPAA were meant to confuse media insiders, ranging from The Destroyer of Worlds to The Lost City of Gold to The Quest for the Covenant. In 2007, when the under-title Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was declared, internet news outlets began analyzing every aspect of the production and its history. Spielberg announced his intention to shoot in a style closer to the original films and would resist today’s computer-generated imagery where possible. His longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, who collaborated with Spielberg since 1993’s Schindler’s List, looked to the original films to follow Douglas Slocombe’s style. The production shot mostly in the U.S. so that Spielberg could be close to his family; whereas previous entries featured exotic locales, this film shot many of its most complex scenes on the studio backlot. Meanwhile, every comment by the actors and crew involved was dissected and picked apart by the media and fans, promotional Lego toy sets were scrutinized by fans to determine elements from the hush-hush plot, and one thief broke into Spielberg’s office and stole a computer to retrieve details about the film. As they often do, expectations ran rampant and out of control both about the production’s secrecy and because of it. By the time Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull arrived in theaters, anticipations were already curbed by the degree of skepticism toward the project. Some critics, like Leonard Maltin, called it the franchise’s best entry since Raiders of the Lost Ark; others said it was the worst. Still, after the initial wave of favorable reviews, the picture earned $317 million in domestic receipts alone and became the third-highest earner of 2008, after The Dark Knight and Iron Man. Numbers aside, fan disapproval spread. Everyone seemed to turn on the film. Moviegoers voiced their disappointment in being only mildly entertained. The creators of South Park made an episode claiming Spielberg and Lucas “raped” the franchise. Costar Shia LaBeouf apologized to fans, saying he “dropped the ball” by agreeing to make the film, which he did without accepting the script. Ford later called LaBeouf an “ass” for making such a comment. Spielberg and Lucas defended the film. Suddenly this sure-thing sequel became a topic of much debate and dissent. Among the most common arguments against Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the feeling that Spielberg went too far in modernizing his technical approach to make this sequel. People seemed to expect that Spielberg and company would jump in a time machine back to the 1980s, make the film there, and return home with a result that would align with our fond memories of the franchise. But Steven Spielberg is not a time traveler, and 19 years passed between The Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Of course, Harrison Ford would look older, new technologies would be used, and the production overall would appear slicker than what came before. This is part of making movies; as time goes by, new technical elements are introduced to make filmmaking easier and cheaper and safer. The produced used 450 CGI shots to remove safety wires and render Amazonian jungle backdrops. After all, Spielberg’s cast and crew may have been able to survive dysentery from the exotic locales used twenty years ago when they filmed Raiders of the Lost Ark, but they’ve all since aged. It is crucial we understand this, just as we must accept that Harrison Ford is no longer a young man. But for an actor in his sixties, he still has all the magnetism, virility, and humanized flaws we expect from both the actor and character. What is it they say in Raiders of the Lost Ark? “It’s not the years, honey, it’s the mileage.” The other principal argument against Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the science-fiction plotline and its inclusion of extraterrestrials, given that no outward sci-fi elements appear in the first three films. But first, consider the period in which Spielberg and Lucas have set their film. The 1950s marked the Atomic Age, where Cold War and nuclear paranoia reigned supreme: politicians conducted Red Scare-fuelled witch hunts, families built and stocked bomb shelters, schools practiced daily drills in case the bombs began to fall, and moviehouses were packed with tales of giant insects and lizards spawned from irresponsible nuclear testing. Science fiction was slowly becoming a reality, and ‘50s cinema the world over responded with B-movie entertainments that tapped into our worst fears, everything from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Them! (1954) and Japan’s Godzilla (1954). In the same way that Temple of Doom evoked the horror genre to expand on the adventure-lined schematic of the Indiana Jones blueprint, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull employed components of Atomic Age escapism into a distinctive Indiana Jones setup. If the film was to take place in the 1950s—and logically, it must if it’s to explain the passage of time since the originals—then an Atomic Age plot was not only appropriate but requisite. Now consider the historical “ancient aliens” theories, which are more popular than ever some forty years after Erich von Däniken’s seminal study, Chariots of the Gods, which has become a passionate hypothesis for many archeologists. From this perspective, the film creates an adventure scenario around an existing archeological theory and runs with it, as opposed to combining the “Indiana Jones adventure genre” with another unrelated genre altogether. With this, audiences failed to identify with the film because the sci-fi elements remain as baffling as those 1984 audiences who could not connect with Temple of Doom because it was too scary. If this is the case, they are simply not “getting” the picture. But I will never understand the hatred for this film. As I wrote in my original review, “Much of your enjoyment of this latest entry resides in your ability to accept that the Indiana Jones series has always been about escapism, never realism.” And so, when detractors begin to complain that Indiana Jones would never survive a nuclear blast from inside a lead-lined fridge, one must laugh at the absurdity of the remark, because if this is the first time you’re questioning the reality of an Indiana Jones film, your concept of reality is out there. Those who went along with the series as Indy explored the catacombs of Venice (it’s a floating city!), ate chilled monkey brains with Indian royalty, and watched as Nazis instantly melted in the presence of holy spirits should have no trouble believing the wilder sci-fi eccentricities in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Those who cannot accept these traits, all tropes of not only sci-fi but the basis of adventure stories, have no reason to enjoy the earlier films. What I appreciate most about the film is the way it enhances our view of Indy, and in doing so, connects to The Last Crusade through the inclusion of Mutt Williams (LaBeouf), who we eventually learn is Indiana Jones’ son, conceived with his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Mutt, a ‘50s-style greaser straight out of American Graffiti or Rebel without a Cause, is to Indy as Indy was to his father, Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery, appearing only in photo form). During a motorcycle escape from pursuing Russian spies on a college campus, Mutt drives as Indy hangs on, feeling old and disapproving of this impetuous hothead. Mirroring that classic scene from The Last Crusade where Indy flips a Nazi cycle, and his father frowns, Indy’s role has been deepened by his age but not entirely reversed. In contrast to his father and now his son, we see our hero as both a bookish scholar and adventurer, the best of both worlds. Although Mutt has left school, he remains bright and a quick study, and under Indy’s tutelage, we can imagine that he too will become like his father, an academic treasure-seeker. For all the character’s comic throwback traits, Mutt reminds us that Indiana Jones is forever a man rebelling against the distant, purely studious example set by his father. To be reasonable, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not a perfect film. What film is? There’s always a detail or two that, if changed, would make the best films even better. But these are commonly superficial concerns. Perfection is a state of mind. What remains unfortunate about the production are minor details and passable moments quickly forgotten. The climax relies too much on CGI when an interdimensional alien seems to look into the camera, his craft spinning around in a flux of colors and imagery far removed from anything this franchise has seen before. When LaBeouf’s Mutt Williams swings from vines, no doubt the filmmakers’ nod to Tarzan serials, he’s accompanied in this iffy effect by CGI monkeys—it’s a silly moment, but in a fun way that those familiar with the Saturday serials should appreciate. Peruvian jungle scenes feature CG-thickened forests that resemble a cheaper production’s green screen work. But then there’s the “nuke the fridge” scene, which is so wonderfully over-the-top that I can’t help but love it. After all, moments like these would be right at home in the B-movie genres the filmmakers sought to emulate, and Indiana Jones has never been based in realism. In reality, Indiana Jones should be dead a hundred times over, having survived booby-traps galore, escaped impossible multi-vehicle chases, and transcended history (and fact) to preposterous degrees. But Indiana Jones isn’t reality. What I love about the film are its simpler details. Take the bright comic-book characters straight out of an adventure magazine: the double-crossing “triple agent” Mac played by Ray Winstone, complete with devilish Errol Flynn mustache; Blanchett’s flawless portrayal as a rigid, domineering villainess whose hands emasculate even Indy when placed on his knee during his interrogation; Allen’s delightful reprisal as Marion, her head cocked with a grin and fists charmingly at her hips; John Hurt’s off-his-rocker archeologist. And then, there are the action sequences. The most thrilling of them occurs mid-film, where Marion crashes a vehicle into a hill of flesh-eating ants. Everyone runs as these critters chitter along, swarming over poor Russian saps with bad enough luck to trip and fall. As Indy engages a goon in fisticuffs, Spalko climbs off the ground away from the ants, but the hungry things stack onto one another to almost reach her. All the while, we’re squirming and shouting eeek for the villain of all people! But Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is never better than that first scene, when the Russians pull Indy out of a trunk and push him to the ground. Spielberg shoots his silhouette against a car. We see that iconic image appear as Indy collects himself and secures his fedora. Yes, this is great filmmaking. So many moments in this film make me want to holler out, “You still got it!” to everyone involved, especially Harrison Ford, who, 19 years later, still encapsulates what it means to be an adventure hero. Conversely, only two or three significant moments feel out of place in the entire film, and they’re fleeting incongruities of dodgy CGI, all amounting to about a minute of screentime in an over-two-hour spectacle of blissful Atomic Age nostalgia, humor, and adventure. From Elvis on the soundtrack to Spielberg’s wonderful staging of action sequences, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull holds a deserving place amid its predecessors in the franchise, which, categorically speaking, could be ordered from best to worst in the order they were made. Then again, there is no “worst” here, not really. Each picture is great, while this fourth entry is simply the least great. This does not make it a bad film. Its greatness is lessened only when compared to three films that epitomize the adventure genre, and moreover, stacked against the inconsolable expectations of fans wanting a film shot in 1981 instead of 2008.",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2021"," George Lucas is a personal hero of mine, the man comes under a lot of fire from movie fans, but I have stood firmly beside the quiffed, plaid shirted wonder for years, and I can even defend the Star Wars prequels. If it’s possible I’ve been looking forward to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than the last three Star Wars movies – mainly because I didn’t feel that they’d have the same magic as the originals because Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher wouldn’t be on the cast list. I had no such worries with Indiana Jones – Ford would be back, and to me, that made me want to see this new movie. When the film was first announced, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Frank Marshall stated that they’d be doing this “the old fashioned way” with minimal CGI, and that Janusz Kaminski would be kept on a tight leash, and he wouldn’t be using his “white-out” style of cinematography. Recently I’ve become more and more irked by Kaminski’s work, and I was glad that he wouldn’t be blasting white light towards the camera. I was even happy with the signing of Shia LaBeouf as Indy Jr.: he bears a passing resemblance to Ford, and I knew that they’d be going for a younger audience, so I could make peace with his signing (if only Sean Connery could have come on-board for a cameo). Crystal skulls, science fiction and the 1950s didn’t worry me; it was good that Ford was playing his age, and I’ve always been happy with the Indy stories, so it didn’t worry me that it wouldn’t involve religious artifacts. I was just ready for Indy. I couldn’t see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull on it’s opening few days, but I was happy enough to see it opening weekend. I sat in the cinema waiting, and then the Lucasfilm logo came on screen. I have to say, I enjoyed the film. It wasn’t mind-blowing, but it was a highly enjoyable action film – Ford was on fire, the wit, the movements, the actions – it’s the best he’s been in years. He even seems to have been working on his comedy. The opening sequence brought Indy back to us after 19 years and he’s still got it. During the whip-driven action sequence Harrison quips: “I thought that was closer.” I was grinning from ear to ear. With the scene in the nuclear town where Indy realizes that the bomb is going to go off is just brilliant – the look of panic and tearful desperation is outstanding – some of the best 5 minutes of cinema I think I’ve seen. Even when the bomb goes off – the refrigerator gag – far fetched I know, but it was still cool. Also the fact that the mushroom cloud mirrored the crystal skull – great. I was impressed that the debriefing by the F.B.I. echoed Dr.No, a nice nod to Connery. The chase through Marshall College cool, not as good as other reviews will have you believe, but still a good opening romp. The graveyard scene with the strange tree dwellers was great, a fantastic sequence that added a nice horror dimension and when Indy and Marion meet for the first time in years – outstanding! I also really enjoyed the quicksand sequence. I’ve always wanted to see Indy encounter quicksand, and I finally did. It was fun and thrilling. The jungle chase alone – while the weakest part of the film, was hindered even further by his light blasting through the trees.The CGI alone was bad enough, don’t tell me you’re going to use minimal CGI and then stick in something that looks like a deleted scene from Star Wars Episode 1. The LaBeouf fight scene was just too much, if you can do it practical – do it. If you can’t, leave it alone. Then there were the crotch hits. George – I know that was you. Humour is good, but not in a scene like that. Tarzan LaBeouf: This sequence is the single worst part of the movie. I thought Lucas got his Tarzan fixation out of his system with the Wookies in Episode III. The worst 30 seconds in the movie. There was just too much CGI, and to me computer effects equal no emotion. The ending of the film, while enjoyable, was just too much like National Treasure. Don’t get me wrong, I like National Treasure, but this is Indiana Jones! The Mayan tribes were under-used, and killed off way too easy by the Russians. Another general issue that I had was there was a bit too much stage work trying to be passed off as exteriors. This was most notable in the opening Area 51. I mean how hard is it to shoot in the desert? Not very – especially when you have got $150 million to spend. Overall, despite my nit-picks I really enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It sounds like I didn’t as I re-read this, but I am just being honest. As a hardcore Indy and Lucas fan, I could just gloss over these, but then I wouldn’t be doing my job. Was it was good as the originals? No way, but I didn’t expect it to be. I was disappointed in the large amount of (poor) CGI, and Kaminski’s camera work, but everyone did what was expected of them, and as things go, it was a four star summer film.",POSITIVE

"Nov 28, 2020"," here’s no easy way to say it; “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is quite a disappointment. It’s unfulfilling to a level of embarrassment for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who have taken a character of extreme popularity and a trilogy of great admiration and added an additional chapter of unnecessary absurdity. During an early scene, our capable hero survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, which is catapulted from the blast zone with deadly force. This momentarily excessive lack of realism is forgivable because he’s Indiana Jones. But the rest of the film becomes even more ridiculously farfetched – and increasingly impossible to so easily brush aside. Indiana Jones is no longer a man of reason, a slightly larger-than-life archeologist who could be traversing the world right now hunting for lost treasures. He is complete fiction. It is 1957, and Professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is once again in the midst of peril, this time at the hands of Russian radicals, led by Stalin’s Austrian psychic scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). After being forced to lead them to magnetized remains of some obscure creature in a government warehouse, Indy manages to escape to the safe-haven of an atomic blast testing zone. Shortly thereafter, he is returned to the comfort of his classroom, to teach the seemingly boring topic of archeology. Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) catches up with the legendary adventurer to inform him that a colleague, professor Oxley (John Hurt), has been captured by Spalko, and is being pressured to lead the Soviets to the location of El Dorado – the city of gold, where a crystal skull has been stolen. Ancient lore places the city in the Amazon, and claims to grant the retriever of the artifact unimaginable powers. Soon enough, Jones travels across the globe to South America to play a vital role in fulfilling the legend – and makes sure to encounter every danger and every misadventure imaginable along the way. The fittingly titled “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” makes countless references and pays nonstop homage to the original trilogy, even going so far as to bring back recognizable characters – such as “Raiders of the Lost Ark” femme fatale Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Indiana can still take a beating (actually, more so than in any of the previous films); creepy-crawling bugs frequently inhabit his locales; tons of comedy relief pepper the nonstop action sequences; and riddles, puzzles, and buried treasure abound. Yet for all of its attempts to make this fourth outing a faithful addition to the already resolute Indy saga, too much of it is incompatible. Though Indy is older and noticeably more weathered, it’s his ability to continually conduct more and more outrageous feats that feels most inconsistent. While most of the action scenes are standard, high-speed pursuits, his endeavors to brave raging waterfalls, nuclear explosions, and armies of ants (plus an even more unbelievable conclusion), just don’t feel like the flesh and blood trials of the Indy formerly defined in the classic ‘80s series. Everyone’s favorite archeological daredevil has tackled everything from the Nazis and their steel beasts to booby-trap-filled temples of doom and lost arks of unimaginable power. So what’s left for him to do? Unfortunately, the creative minds behind Dr. Jones’ cinematic escapades seem to have run out of ideas, reverting unimaginatively (or too wildly) back to concepts extremely alien to Indy’s regiment of religious history (resembling the weaker chapter of “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” which followed occult ideologies more than biblical happenings). The Russians have replaced the Nazis, the outlandish have replaced the reasonable, and the extraterrestrials have replaced Jesus.

"Nov 15, 2020"," “Not as easy as it used to be,” groans Harrison Ford’s swashbuckling archaeologist after a punishing burst of derring-do in the opening scene of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A wry acknowledgement of the time that’s passed since Indy’s last big-screen adventure, the words could just as easily come from the sexagenarian star himself or, indeed, from director Steven Spielberg or executive producer George Lucas. It’s been 19 years since we last saw Indy in the cinema, battling wartime Nazis in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and in the meantime a stream of younger and fitter stars, including Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne and Daniel Craig’s James Bond, have set bruising new standards for muscular screen action. Ford, who turned 65 during filming, actually looks in pretty good shape in the movie, but neither his surprising vigour nor the presence of Shia LaBoeuf as the young greaser (modeled on Marlon Brando’s biker in The Wild One) who becomes Indy’s sidekick can prevent the franchise from showing its age. Of course, the Indiana Jones movies – Lucas and Spielberg’s nostalgic homage to the Saturday-morning adventure serials of their youth – always did have a wilfully old-fashioned feel to them. Set in 1957, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’s story, which sees Indy trying to stop Cate Blanchett’s rapier-wielding Russian parapsychologist and her team of Soviet agents from seizing a legendary crystal skull with psychic powers and taking over the world, is a conscious throwback to the era’s sci-fi B movies. But the kind of action that was funny and exciting in Raiders of the Lost Ark now looks incredibly dated. When Indy dukes it out with a hulking Russian soldier, the old-school two-fisted slugfest rapidly becomes boring. Even more unforgivably, during the film’s interminable stretches of exposition, Ford’s Indy comes across as a dull pedant. Now and then the movie sparks into life. There’s a chilling sequence early in the film in which Indy stumbles into a suburban neighbourhood, discovers that it’s populated entirely with mannequins and realises he’s in the middle of a nuclear test site with only seconds to save himself. The audacious way he escapes death, however, has already given rise to a phrase (akin to Happy Days’ “jumping the shark”) that denotes the moment when a film franchise exceeds its sell-by date – “nuking the fridge“. By the time Kingdom of the Crystal Skull reaches its prolonged, overly CGI-assisted finale, it looks as though it’s definitely time for Indy to hang up his fedora and whip. The same can’t be said of the indefatigable Mick Jagger, as is shown by Shine a Light, Martin Scorsese’s lavish concert documentary filmed over two nights at New York’s Beacon Theatre in 2006. Sixty-three at the time of the shows, Jagger struts, jumps and jogs his way through the band’s greatest hits, from ‘Under My Thumb’ and ‘Paint It Black’ to ‘Jumpin’ Jack Flash’ and ‘Satisfaction’, while Scorsese orchestrates an all-star team of 10 Oscar-worthy cinematographers to capture the action. Over 40 years younger, and similarly tireless, JeeJa Yanin, star of the Thai martial arts movie Chocolate, is being touted as the female answer to Tony Jaa, the Asian action star whose whose trick-free Muay Thai fighting in Ong-Bak and Warrior King created a stir a few years ago with the boast: “No stunt doubles. No wire work. No CGI.” Yanin (full name Yanin Vismitananda) certainly has astonishing martial arts prowess. A taekwondo champion in her teens, she spent two years training for the movie, which was specially written for her, and a further two years shooting it. The outtakes that play over the film’s credits, showing Yanin and her fellow performers getting patched up by medics over and over again, reveal just how painful and dangerous it all was. Yanin’s grace and agility are genuinely impressive. But the same can’t be said of Chocolate’s plot, which sees her play a young autistic woman named Zen – the daughter of a Thai gangster’s tattooed moll and a Japanese gangster – who develops incredible fighting skills simply by watching her heroes (Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jaa) on TV and then imitating their moves. Zen puts these to use when she and a childhood friend attempt to track down her mother’s old criminal associates and retrieve the money they owe her. This entails a succession of sequences in which Zen takes on and demolishes a stream of opponents (one scene pays homage to the legendary icehouse fight from Bruce Lee’s The Big Boss, while another recalls the House of Blue Leaves battle in Kill Bill Vol. 1).  I have to confess, however, that the astonishment factor quickly wears thin and that down-and-dirty, no frills Thai action movies can become just as boring to watch as their bloated Hollywood counterparts.",NEGATIVE

"May 25, 2020"," The film moves forward almost in real time after an 18-year layoff.  It’s 1957 and given the Cold War at hand, the KGB also replaces Nazis as the villains.  Leading this particular group of villains is Soviet agent Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett).  Spalko kidnaps Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and George “Mac”” Micale (Ray Winstone) from their Mexican excavation.  The spy immediately has Jones find a corpse from the Roswell incident some ten years earlier.  What follows is a chase scene and some spectacular visual effects during an atomic bomb test. Sadly, Indy is forced to leave his post at Marshall College.  A thing to note here: Dean Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) is really a stand-in for Marcus Brody.  Denholm Elliott passed away in 1992.  However, the filmmaking team pays tribute to both him and Sean Connery.  The latter was enjoying retirement too much and only appears by way of a picture on Indy’s desk.  There is one former friend who makes an appearance: Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).  This time around, Marion also has a son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).  She sends him to Indy in order to let him know Harold Oxley (John Hurt) was kidnapped. At Hangar 51, some props make cameo appearances.  Some are blink and you miss it.  Moses’ staff is one of them–a replica based off of Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments (1956).  Another is the Ark of the Covenant–straight out of the Lucasfilm Archives from Raiders.  What this film does is establish the hangar scene at the end of Raiders as Hangar 51.  Or what we commonly know as Area 51. What John Williams manages to do with the score this time is give it more of a sci-fi film.  He pays homage to those 1950s sci-fi films given the plot this time around.  Oh, he brings back all the familiar themes, too, including the love theme between Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood. While Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is intended to pass the torch to a new generation, it remains to be seen what will happen.  No one and I mean NO ONE can replace Harrison Ford in the iconic role!

"Nov 8, 2019"," It has long been said that all good things come to those who wait. Well, we’ve waited 19 years for Harrison Ford to don his fedora and crack his whip and let me tell you, Ford and company more than prove that INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was well worth any wait!! Not skipping a beat, Harrison Ford is still the same dazzling, cocky, witty, sexy, athletic, archeologic adventurer that we all came to love some 27 years ago. And although now fighting Russians instead of Nazis, Ford proves time and time again, that like a fine wine, things do improve with age and he is no exception. As wardrobers for the film will attest, Ford is truly ageless, still fitting into Indy’s digs from his last adventure 19 years ago with nary a need for needle and thread for tailoring. The story, kept under wraps until the films’ release, thanks to better security than the Pentagon or Homeland Security can provide, is as fanciful and fun as its predecessors. The time is 1957. Hitler is dead. The Cold War is in full swing. But the hottest topic of conversation is the USA’s own, Area 51 (which means don’t be surprised if we see E.T. phoning home.) After an “explosive” encounter between himself, his partner Mac McHale, and Russian scientist Irina Spalko in Area 51 in Roswell, New Mexico (hmmm, how did the Russians get into Area 51?), in his usual everyman-style, Dr. Jones easily settles back into his part-time vocation in academia teaching archeology at Marshall College. What were they doing in Area 51, you ask? Seems the Soviets are interested in obtaining Dr. Jones’ help in locating a mysterious object allegedly housed in Area 51. And despite their best efforts to rein him in and aid them, our boy Indy is anything but obliging to “the enemy.” But, never one for the quiet life, when approached by Marlon Brando/James Dean “Wild One” biker wannabe Mutt Williams, Jones jumps at the chance to become involved in yet another quest. Actually, a couple. One, the search for the crystal skull allegedly stolen from the Mayan “City of Gold”, El Dorado, in Peru and which legend holds that whomever retrieves and returns to skull to the City will himself have untold power and riches. Which explains why Irina Spalko is also searching for the skull; and wanted Indy’s help, but now will do whatever necessary to grab the skull before Indy. But, as if having to ward off Spalko in this race against time isn’t enough, Indiana and Mutt also have to rescue the kidnaped Marion Ravenwood, who you may recall was Indiana’s old flame (and for who it seems the flame still burns hot) and who happens to be Mutt’s mother. Also needing their rescue is Indy’s colleague, Professor Oxley. As to be expected, in typical Indy fashion, there are chases, explosions and action-packed adventures galore all neatly tied together with a familial undertone and epilogue (which I will not divulge) that I will only say will be a delight to all. (In other words, stay through the credits.) There is no one on the planet who could ever play Indiana Jones but for Harrison Ford. Although 19 years older, he is still irresistible, rakishly handsome, as agile and athletic as ever and still doing the majority of his own stunts. For any of you that think Ford just looks this good for this film, think again. I can personally vouch for the fact that he always looks this good. And for those of you that think he’s too old for the role, puh-lease! The man doesn’t have a creaky bone in his body (or at least none that I have heard even when standing or sitting next to him at a local restaurant) and moves with the same gait and speed as a young Indy or Han Solo. Indicative of Ford’s physique and ability, on watching the earlier Indy films and comparing them to CRYSTAL SKULL, even Steven Spielberg had to comment that he couldn’t tell the difference in Ford’s form and style from that of 26 years ago to the present! Ford slips into that fedora with the ease of an old friend and cracks that whip as handily as ever. His comedic timing is impeccable, wit as dry as ever; his chemistry with Karen Allen undeniable and rapport with Shia LaBeouf is snappy, entertaining, comfortable and believable. Which gives rise to what many already suspect about LaBeouf – if there was ever a film to hand over the reins of action adventure superstar to the next generation, this is the one. And while I don’t think Ford is ready to hang up his hat just yet (there is still the possibility of the originally conceived 5th installment), it’s nice to know there is an heir apparent to Ford’s throne. You may recall how impressed I was with LaBeouf in “Transformers” and how he has matured not only as a person but in his performance over the years. His work there is nothing compared to his turn as Mutt Williams. Accepting the role without ever reading the part, LaBeouf clearly has his career plan well mapped as he transitions from Disney kid fame to adult action hero. Embodying the character thanks to encouragement from Steven Spielberg in the form of well-placed notes in his script and 3 “must see films” for character imagery (including “The Wild One”), LaBeouf not only bulked up for the part, but displays a maturity and impertinent cockiness that more than holds its own against Harrison Ford. Equally as strong as his physical appearance and performance (he also did the majority of his own stunts) is his delivery and timing, not to mention camaraderie with Ford. Likeable to a fault, LaBeouf more than lives up to the Indiana Jones legacy. A welcome returning character is Indy’s first love, Marion Ravenwood, and joyfully, Karen Allen reprises the role. Not missing a beat, she and Ford still have spice and sizzle and the same fiery repartee we enjoyed some 26 years ago. Another newcomer to the franchise is Cate Blanchett who adds some comic book camp as the sultry yet cold-as-ice Russian scientist, Irina Spalko. I had a chance to talk to Blanchett earlier this year at the Spirit Awards and while she was mum on the film’s particulars, she did divulge that this film “was the most fun I have had on a film.” She is devilishly delicious. Well known around town for years is the difficulty of finding the right script in order to make this film happen. I was privy to some details of some of the earlier works in progress by several writers, some of which, as an Indy fan, would have been a great disappoint to me had Spielberg and Lucas gone that route. Luckily for us, fate smiled on the talented David Koepp. Mixing the elements of a Cold War setting with the adventuress nature of the Peruvian jungle, aliens, Area 51 and the mythical crystal skulls, with snappy, often self-deprecating dialogue (listen for homages to another famous Ford character for real enjoyment) laced with a loving familial undertone, Koepp keeps the energy and anticipation high. But that high energy turns into exhilaration when director Steven Spielberg steps behind the camera. Intent on retaining the original look and feel of the original films, Spielberg is high on actual stunts and physical performance rather than CGI. However, thanks to the technological advancements of the past 19 years, the production values are exceedingly high. Using the patented Indy technique of making each sequence progressively more thrilling than the last, Spielberg doesn’t disappoint and provides one jaw-dropping, heart pounding thrill after another. With a broad canvas of mid and tight shots, smartly edited by Michael Kahn, Spielberg brings a riveting – and fun – intensity to the screen. Celebrating the franchise, look for nostalgic references of Henry Jones, Marcus Brody, Willie, the Ark of the Covenant and, of course, snakes. As much as I admire the work of cinematographer Douglas Slocombe who worked on the three prior Indy films, I am overjoyed that longtime Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski was brought on board in light of Slocombe’s retirement. Compromising his own look and style in order to keep with the photography and comic book stylings of the previous films, Kaminski not only had to watch the three earlier films, but he and Spielberg, who have worked together on every Spielberg film since “Schindler’s List”, had to go back to Spielberg’s roots to capture and convey the true essence of Indiana Jones. I doubt if the end result would have been as glorious were it in the hands of anyone other than Kaminski. With an unfettered, throw caution to the wind, giddy joy and death defying exhilaration and even alien mysticism, Spielberg and partner George Lucas, bring the magic of the 30’s and 40’3 popcorn serial larger than life E-ticket ride, back to the movies with INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. And as if that’s not enough, I had a chance several weeks ago to ask Harrison Ford if there was one reason to go see CRYSTAL SKULL, what would it be. Without missing a beat, in true Indy fashion, with that devilish grin and raised eyebrows and slight chuckle, he had a very simple answer, “Me, of course!” Of course, indeed!",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019"," Fans of the “Indiana Jones” series rejoice: After a 19-year
absence, Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg are back for a fourth
installment with “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull,” an entertaining throwback that feels as comfortable as an
old varsity letter jacket. Sure, the material is familiar, but this
is a case where that familiarity is part of the charm. “Crystal Skull” picks up in 1957, 19 years after the last
“Indiana Jones” film, with famed archeologist Dr. Henry “Indiana”
Jones barely escaping a close scrape with Soviet agents led by Dr.
Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) on a remote Nevada airfield. On his way out of town, Jones meets a James Dean-type named Mutt
(Shia LaBeouf), who seeks the archeologist’s help in finding his
mother and a family friend. Jones agrees and quickly finds himself entangled in a quest to
uncover the secrets behind mysterious artifacts known as crystal
skulls, with Spalko and her cohorts from the Soviet Union in hot
pursuit trying to get the skulls for themselves. Anyone who has ever seen an “Indiana Jones” film will most
likely be able to tell exactly where “Crystal Skull” is going, but
it doesn’t really matter with a film like this. The familiarity the
audience has with the material is part of the nostalgic charm that
makes this work. It’s great to see Ford, who turns 66 in December, back in his
element for one last run and just as exciting to see Karen Allen
reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood from the original “Raiders of
the Lost Ark.” Blanchett is a great addition as Indy’s nemesis, while LaBeouf’s
performance was a little grating at first, but grew on me as the
film progressed. The second sequence, a chase through the Amazon jungle, is a lot
of fun, too - reminiscent of the water wheel sequence in the second
“Pirates of the Caribbean” film. The final sequence has a payoff that is out there even more than
“Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” but still has a coolness
factor that makes it easy to overlook its rather bizarre
conclusion. I didn’t come away with the same “Wow” reaction that I did to
the recent smash “Iron Man,” but “Crystal Skull” still left me with
a nostalgic and satisfied feeling. This “Indiana Jones” film may
not be quite up to the bar of the previous three, but it is still
one trip down memory lane worth taking. This follow-up to “National Treasure” follows treasure hunter
Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) on his quest to save his family’s
name after a missing page from diary of John Wilkes Booth surfaces
and Ben’s great-grandfather is suddenly implicated as a conspirator
in Abraham Lincoln’s death. The quest leads him and his crew across the world, trying to
stay one step ahead of a group determined to stain the Gates family
name forever. I wasn’t a fan of the original “National Treasure,” mainly
because I felt like it was trying to be another “Indiana
Jones”-type action film with a touch of “The DiVinci Code.” But for
some reason, this film won me over. Maybe I was just in the right
frame of mind when I watched it or maybe it was helped by the fact
it was far better than “Alien vs. Predator,” “P.S. I Love You” and
“Alvin and the Chipmunks” (other films that opened around the same
time as “National Treasure.”). The cast helps the cause, with Cage having a lot of fun. Throw
in Jon Voight and Helen Mirren (as Ben’s mom and dad), Ed Harris
and Harvey Keitel and it is easy to forgive a film that tries to be
a little too complex for its own good. “Book of Secrets” isn’t going to be remembered as an all-time
great film, but it serves its purpose by entertaining its intended
audience. What more can you ask of a film?",POSITIVE
"Jun 6, 2019"," Having seen ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" twice now, once before its release at a press screening and once after with a paying audience, I think I have gotten a pretty good handle on exactly how I feel about it.The first audience I saw it with loved it, the second - not so much. There was a buzzing air of excitement in the first screening, but the commercial audience seemed to be too ""hip"" for something as old school as Indiana Jones.That's the real issue at stake when it comes to the first Indiana Jones adventure in 19 years. It is a film that is unabashedly old-fashioned in its sensibilities, even if the special effects have grown up a bit and the actors have gotten older.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is nearly 20 years older than when we last saw him as he rode off into the sunset after finding the Holy Grail. This time he is tracked down by Mutt (Shia LeBeouf), a defiant young greaser whose mother has been kidnapped by Soviets, led by the nefarious Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who are looking for a legendary crystal skull in their quest for experimental psychological warfare against the West. Together, the two of them head off on an adventure to South Africa to find the skull before the Russians do and to rescue Mutt's mother, who happens to be none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) from the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""The film is never for a moment as good as any of the original trilogy (and that includes the unfairly maligned ""Temple of Doom""), but it's still a blast. Instead of the adventure serials that the original trilogy paid homage to, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is more in the vein of the sci-fi B movies that were popular during the time the film is set. It is a much more outlandish film than its predecessors, even if its central premise isn't ultimately any more ridiculous than the supernatural mythologies of the originals. However, there are several moments where the film seems to jump the tracks (Mutt's Tarzan moment during the jungle chase is a bit much), and Ray Winstone's character is horribly underdeveloped, as is often the case with the plot, which becomes increasingly muddled as the film goes on.I also missed the old-school special effects of the originals. Director Steven Spielberg tends to fall back on computer-generated imagery effects here that were not around at the time of the original trilogy but are much more readily available (and cheaper to use) now. One wonders how much of that was Spielberg and how much was the meddling of CGI-obsessed producer George Lucas.But despite its shortcomings, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is an absolute blast. Spielberg is still a genius when it comes to action set pieces, and ""Skull"" has some doozies. The chase through the jungle is a whirlwind of stunning action, proving that Spielberg hasn't lost his touch.It all may have a nostalgic ""trip down memory lane"" vibe to it, but everyone is clearly having a good time (especially Blanchett as the deliciously campy villain), and Indy's age (as well as Ford's) is handled very well. The references to the original films are also a welcome addition, and it's great to see Indiana Jones back in action.The film may be silly and over the top, but when it comes right down to it, that is the point. Going in with lowered expectations helps, but this is one of those films where it's hard not to have fun if you're in the right frame of mind.Matthew Lucas, a student at Appalachian State University in Boone, is a correspondent for The Dispatch.

"Oct 18, 2018"," For the next two weeks, Stephen Garrett will be reviewing notable movies from the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. To read more of his exclusive reviews, please click here. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the heavily hyped, deeply unnecessary fourth installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy, made its world premiere today at the Cannes Film Festival, unspooling at the 2300-seat Lumière theatre to a rabid international audience that spontaneously burst into applause twice when the lights began to dim -- and even started singing John Williams's ""dum-da-dum-dum"" fanfare before the projector was turned on. The Sunday afternoon auditorium was brimming with a goodwill uncharacteristic of the folks who gleefully eviscerated The Da Vinci Code when it premiered two years ago. Honestly, who among us has been clamoring for the resurrection of a franchise that ended nineteen years ago? Then again, the idea of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas breathing life back into Harrison Ford's whip-cracking archaeological adventurer is so wrong, it actually starts to feel kind of right. Crystal Skull conjures an oddly fleet-footed charm amidst the cacophonous CGI Sturm und Drang, dream-logic plotting, and nonsensical getaways because it is precisely not a studio-mandated, factory-processed tent pole. If anything, it's a cinematic folly, an action-packed cri de coeur from two master popcorn-picture mavens who jam it full of all their lifelong passions. Auteurists will have a field day with all the in-jokes and references. Lucas naturally revels in hot rods, mythical iconography, and even bad dialogue (""I got a bad feeling about this,"" says Ford at one point, stealing one of the all-time classic cheese lines from the Star Wars sextet.) Spielberg drops in a dark nod to cookie-cutter suburbia, a broken-family subplot, and his paramount obsession: aliens (or, as Dr. Jones, puts it, ""saucer men from Mars""). Set in 1957, the film begins with wonderfully disorienting set pieces involving Communists, A-bomb tests, the FBI, and rock n' roll, all of which work overtime to make Indiana Jones even more of an anachronism (especially when he's still sporting his iconic '30s-era fedora, leather jacket, and khakis). Once the movie settles into a quest for a lost Mayan city of gold and its mystical treasures, though, the script is classic Indy: too-clever riddles and cryptograms revealing yet another clue tied to the ancient past, all set against set pieces with stone facades and secret passageways. Conquistadors, dead Peruvian languages, and references to Macedonian, Sumerian, and Egyptian culture fly by as our heroes punch their way out of tight corners. And then the big plot twist comes: an extraterrestrial revelation lifted straight out of Erich von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods?: Unsolved Mysteries of the Past (catnip for '70s ufologists like Spielberg). Despite her best efforts, a wickedly mean Cate Blanchett never truly commits any evil deed as the Commie menace. Shia LaBeouf, as the default heir apparent to the franchise, doesn't do much as a character, nor does he add much as an actor. Worse still, British thug Ray Winstone, as a two-timing double agent, is completely wasted by a script that won't decide which side he should choose. All of which simply serves as a reminder that the only character who matters is Jones, and Ford happily carried the mantle while always acting his age. Crystal Skull carries its legacy with a sort of ""I still got it"" bravado that makes you smile at its AARP filmmakers rather than pity them. Spielberg turns 62 in December, Lucas celebrated his 64th birthday last week, and Ford turns 66 in July. The mileage shows. Crystal Skull doesn't have half the buoyant, crackling energy of Raiders of the Lost Ark (or its diminishing-returns successors, which at times feel mechanical but never less than breathless), but neither does it feel elegiac. Hell, at their age, let the guys take a victory lap -- even if it does leave them out of breath.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018"," 
  It's been 19 years since Indiana Jones last donned his weather-beaten fedora. That's quite a long time for a character to lie dormant, and the worst thing Steven Spielberg and George Lucas could have done was pick up the dashing archaeologist right where they left him, giving him yet another girl to seduce and the same life to live.
 
  Thankfully, they do the opposite in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Rather than ask 60-something Harrison Ford to continue playing Indy as the dusty playboy he always was, they use the actor's aging visage to their advantage. By the time we catch up with him in 1957, Indy has grown more contemplative and become less of a committed bachelor.
 
  Unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ford and Allen in this adventure share no love scenes, no passionate embraces, and no innuendo-laced word play. Yet their chaste reuniting gives us the most romantic Indiana yet. This time he not only gets the girl, he keeps the girl. And she, along with a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) he hooks up with along the way, give Indy the one treasure he's never had: a family.
 
  Perhaps as a nod to the family man that Indy is becoming, this sequel is considerably less bloody than its predecessors. It still deserves a PG-13 rating for language, and the most frightening image-a swarm of oversized, man-eating ants-is still too much for younger kids. But it's not nearly as disturbing as the melting faces or beating hearts ripped from chests we saw in the franchise's first two entries.
 
  As if to fill the void for his hallmark gross-out scenes, Spielberg increases the cuteness factor. His lighthearted films have always displayed a bit of fondness for cliché, with characters tossing off lines that would cause groans under the direction of anyone else. But when Indy replies to Marion's accusation that ""there must have been other women"" with, ""There were. But they all had the same problem, honey. They weren't you,"" we giggle delightedly rather than roll our eyes. Same goes with Shia LaBeouf's rebel-without-a-cause persona. Spielberg displays so much unabashed affection for '50s stereotypes (and LaBeouf plays the part so well), you can't help but embrace it.
 
  And yet, for all the jokes that land, the effects that dazzle, and the nostalgia that we feel for the characters, Crystal Skull still lacks the energy of the original. Without giving too much away, it's fair to say the fault for this lies mostly with the item Indy is pursuing. Within the first few scenes we understand that this adventure is going to have something to do with aliens. What that something is grows into a confusing mish-mash of myths as the plot progresses.
 
  The legends that generate the most excitement are those that feel the most probable. Eighty-five percent of Americans believe in the Bible as the Word of God. So the idea that a whip-cracking archaeologist might be able to locate an ark that plays a prominent role in that Word is going to fire our imagination. Something that few of us believe in-that extraterrestrials have visited Earth-doesn't have the same impact. Even worse is the visual effect the item has once Indy finds it (as we know he must). Its futuristic appearance feels wrong-the joy of Indiana Jones is that he unearths the power of old civilizations, not new ones.
 
  So while there's no denying that Crystal Skull succeeds as a summer popcorn flick, it won't follow in Raiders' footsteps by becoming a classic audiences will want to watch again and again for years to come.

"Aug 26, 2018"," To fully understand my comments on this film, you should know that I’m an archaeologist. I worked for several years in the hot soil of California excavations and sorted thousands of sherds of smelly pottery and old nails. Most archaeology is excruciatingly dull work, under really awful working conditions. The most interesting aspect of archaeology is the archaeologists. They’re highly educated in history, art, and science and being familiar with the ruins of civilizations, they don’t have too many illusions about modern life. Here’s the truth about archaeologists. They’re all sexy, brilliant, brave, charming, quick-witted, adventurous and wildly curious–and they do wear those Indiana Jones hats. But they do not go around looting cultural remains. Archaeology is the study of human beings–any trace of human history is valuable and valuable only when seen in its context. Real archaeologists handle artifacts gently, as if they were fragile flower petals, they use brushes not pick-axes. They would no more chop something shiny out of an ancient temple than cut off their arms. Indiana Jones is not a real archaeologist. He’s an adventurer in a movie. He’s entertaining and he looks great in that hat, so we love him. But we’re also ready to pound him out for giving the impression that archeologists are nothing more than treasure hunters. (Same problem we have with Nicolas Cage in National Treasure.) With that caveat out of the way, how’d you like the movie, Professor Miller? Except for one grossly offensive aspect — done twice –Crystal Skull is everything Indy fans want. It’s a big, noisy, entertaining escape from reality. It makes no sense whatsoever and who cares? When you leave the theatre, you won’t complain about the cost of the ticket. The story takes place in the 1950s, when atomic annihilation is a real threat, Ruskies are the politically correct bad guys, and the Roswell incident in 1947 has many Americans seeing extraterrestrial activity everywhere, especially in mysterious archeological sites. Professor Henry “Indiana” Jones leaves the university at the behest of a young messenger, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) sent on behalf of a demented colleague, Professor Oxly (John Hurt) who’s been kidnapped along with the boy’s mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). The object Oxly tried to steal is an ancient skull sculpted out of one solid piece of crystal. Whoever returns the skull to its place of origin, the legends say, will have the power to rule the world. Enter the Soviets, lead by psychic Col. Dr. Irina Spalgo (Cate Blanchett), who is determined to capture the skull for her pal, Joey Stalin. Typical of all the Indiana Jones films, there’s never a dull moment in Crystal Skull, no matter how much you might long for a moment to catch your breath. Chases everywhere on any structure man-made or natural– cliff jumping, vine flying, dueling Jeeps, three waterfalls–and lots of sword fighting and whip snapping. Indy faces threats of ever-escalating danger, including the requisite quicksand and creepy snakes. There’s even the quintessentially preposterous scary event–an atomic blast, which he survives thanks to a nearby lead-lined refrigerator. All the actors are terrific. Senior citizen Harrison Ford looks and acts positively amazing. Sean Connery doesn’t reprise as Indiana Jones’ beguiling father, but we do meet Shia LaBeouf, whose cheeky young punk character is an admirable chip off the old block and a cool hybrid of Edd “Kookie” Byrnes from TV’s 77 Sunset Strip and Marlon Brando in The Wild One. Cate Blanchett, with her jet-black bangs and skin-tight tyrant pants, does a hilarious rendition of Bullwinkle’s Natasha. Most enjoyable is Karen Allen as Indy’s old girlfriend, who’s been sorely missed since Raiders of the Lost Ark. As worthy as Crystal Skull’s good parts were, I deducted a whole point off my rating for a seriously offensive element. On two separate occasions our hero stumbles into ruins that, surprisingly, are occupied by native people–supposedly living, breathing remnants of ancient civilizations. Any archaeologist in her right mind who encountered such people would have heart attacks of joy. Alas, Indiana Jones and crew not only don’t treat these amazing people with respect or curiosity, but they try to kill them off immediately. Director Steven Spielberg (Munich) doesn’t even give them any lines of dialogue–they’re just nameless faceless freaks wearing wild make-up, whose only worth in life is to get whacked by Indy. Even for a silly B-movie, these scenes, and the unconscious attitude behind them, are repulsive.",POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2018"," After a 19-year break, Indiana Jones, the world’s greatest adventurer and probably the world’s worst ever archaeologist — listen, even I know you can’t go around ripping open ancient mummies whenever you so fancy — is back. He is back because he has to find an ancient crystal skull before the Russians do, because the Russians want to use its knowledge to open a chain of aromatherapy salons or, failing that, to rule the world. Yes, it is our old friend global domination. So off he goes on the hunt, narrowly escaping — phew!; he really had me scared there for a minute! — from various dangers. These include gunfire, missiles, oncoming trucks, arrows, poisoned blow darts, bad Russians, perpendicular waterfalls, crumbling buildings, more bad Russians, retracting steps, cliff-edge car chases, screeching ghouls, a tornado of boulders, scorpions, quicksand, yet more bad Russians, being fired half-way across the Nevada desert in a fridge, quickmud, crispy giant red ants, mad monkeys that go ‘chee chee chee’, swords, rapiers, and a nuclear attack. I bet that, at some point, he wished he’d just gone to Brent Cross Shopping Centre for the afternoon. Actually, I once whipped in quick to steal someone else’s parking space at Brent Cross and got a punch in the face for it. So I am only saying that Brent Cross is comparatively safer.  Written and produced by George Lucas, directed by Steven Spielberg, it is the fourth film in the franchise, and it is set, this time, in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Here, our baddest baddie is Cate Blanchett as KGB agent Irina Spalko, a woman of such sharp lines she looks like she’s been created using a geometry set. She also has a hammer and sickle and ‘cccp’ stitched on to the back of her outfit, just in case you are in any doubt. Indy is joined, too, by Shia LaBeouf as rebellious teenager Mutt, who rides into the movie on a motorbike and is meant, I think, to evoke Brando but doesn’t. (‘Even I look more like Brando,’ says my goldfish, Bubbles.) Indy is also reunited with his long-lost love Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who last appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark), while John Hurt, who probably has the best voice in the whole of actordom, plays a deranged archaeologist who is also largely mute.  Happily for fans, I guess, Crystal Skull does exactly what it says on the reel can. There are maps, biplanes, those vehicles with the little red line showing how you are hopscotching over the globe, and one of those letters written as a riddle in an ancient code. I do wish the people who write these would just tell it straight every now and then, as in: the treasure you seek is behind the sofa. It would save a lot of time and trouble. But while the film is distracting, while there is nothing to mind, it is never properly absorbing. The quips are lame, any suspense is cancelled by the fact you know no one is ever going to get hurt — or grazed, or wet even after a tumble down that perpendicular waterfall, or even dirty after having been sucked up to the neck in quickmud — and as for the characters, well. They aren’t awarded any internal happenings at all. Even Bubbles is less shallow. (‘All in all, I have quite a lot going for me,’ says Bubbles.) I know, I know, this sort of film is never about psychological insights, but neither was Bond until Daniel Craig took over and showed you could take an adventure, bish-bash-bosh, stunt-spilling franchise and transform it into something substantial. This does not mean that I wish to see Harrison Ford in his Speedos. I do not. Plus, as he is now 312, or maybe 420, I think it would be unfair to expect it of him.  So, a film to like for anyone who likes this sort of film. And that’s it? Yes. What more do you want from me? I’ll ask Bubbles. Bubbles, what more do they want from me? ‘I don’t know. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go tune up my motorbike.’",POSITIVE

"Nov 6, 2017"," Only a few days have passed since Sunday’s Indy IV premiere in Cannes, but it already feels like eons.

Only a few days have passed since Sunday’s Indy IV premiere in Cannes, but it already feels like eons. And I’ve already spilled a fair amount of web ink on this mega blockbuster in previous blogs— Indy vs the indies: Indiana Jones in the Kingdom of Cannes and The Second Coming of Steven Spielberg: Indy Encounters of the Fourth Kind — so forgive me if I betray signs of Indy fatigue. In a nutshell, the movie, like a lot of things in life, is great fun at first, turns into be a bit of grind in the sagging mid-section, then picks up at the end with a graceful flourish. If you plan to see this movie, and don’t want anything spoiled stop reading right now. I won’t give away any major plot twists, but with this sort of entertainment, it’s probably best to have it hit you as fresh as possible, right from the opening shot, especially when there’s so much hype out there in the first place. You still with me? Okay. I loved the first half hour. It opens with a scene of joyriding in the Nevada desert in 1957, with Elvis Presley singing Hound Dog on the soundtrack. As the filmmakers have now explained countless times, setting this Indy installment in the Cold War was not a contrivance but a necessity, given that the character has aged by two decades since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But staging the first action scene at a nuclear test site in the desert—with our hero trapped in replica town populated by Norman Rockwell-like mannequins that are about to be annihilated—is inspired. We’ve all seen that macabre military footage what happens to buildings and dummies in a nuclear blast. Here we get to see it enacted on the big screen, in a vision ‘of ’50s America being vaporized that’s the most powerful scene of the movie. And the film’s most glorious image occurs at the end of that sequence, as Indiana Jones stands silhouetted against a mushroom cloud. In retrospect, I would have been quite happy if the picture had ended right there. A half-hour Indy short. Also, the action in that first act is the best.. It’s pure physical stunt work, directed with an energy and humour that recall the silent era. Cate Blanchett makes a spectacular entrance as a cold-eyed dominatrix of a Russian spy, and maintains her steely poise throughout. She to have stepped right out of a James Bond film—007 should be so lucky. She makes a worthy foil for Harrison Ford,who turns his age to his advantage, compounding the irony of the archeologist as grimacing action hero. Ford has fun with the age issue, in bouts of repartee with Mutt Williams (Shia La Boeuf), the callow young man who appears poised to inherit the Indy mantle. LaBoeuf makes his entrance on a motorcyle, wearing leathers and shades, in a picture-perfect homage to Marlon Brando in The Wild One. It’s one of countless movie references, and they’re all spelled out so clearly that after a while you feel like you’re on the tram ride at the Universal Studios theme park. Many of the allusions are, in fact, to Spielberg’s own movies, notably E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Aliens have invaded the franchise. In Cannes, Spielberg boasted to the press that, in a world of digital effects, this Indiana Jones honours old-fashioned stunt work. “There’s no inspiration when a cast and a director walk onto a blue screen stage,” he said. “I wanted to walk out onto a soundstage and be in a temple. . . I was a real advocate for making as much of this movie as possible practical magic as opposed to digital magic.” That’s a bit disingenuous. Sure, there’s lots of real stuntwork. In fact, the best action sequences appear to be “analog.” But there’s also a wealth of computer effects–army ants, waterfall plunges, extra-terrestrials–especially in the latter part of the movie. Accusing Steven Spielberg of overkill at this point in his career, however, seems redundant. Indy IV is an entertaining big screen ride for the whole family, excluding small children and fussy cinephiles. And for those who like this sort of thing, it does make sense to see it on the big screen rather than wait for the DVD.",POSITIVE
"Nov 6, 2017"," It falls short of total awesomeness, but it’s not bad. It’s a B-plus movie if I’ve ever seen one, and I’ve seen many. This is the fourth adventure film – 19 years after the third – directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling archeologist, and it doesn’t carry the series in any shocking new directions. It’s not that much of an upgrade over the National Treasure films (shameless knockoffs of the Indiana Jones movies), and in fact, I might well have greeted it with a yawn had this movie come out in, say, 1991. In the last 15 years, though, Spielberg morphed from a talented purveyor of mindless popcorn movies into one of the world’s premier cinematic artists, without losing his taste for the popcorn. With all that, I’m much more inclined to indulge his wish to revisit this series. I probably won’t be alone in taking the movie this way, either. For those of you who care about the plot: The action picks up in 1957, when Prof. Henry “Indiana” Jones is placed on administrative leave from his university after he’s forced to commit treason at a Nevada military warehouse by gun-toting Soviet soldiers under the command of KGB Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who doesn’t add as much as you’d think to this stock villain role). Indy is about to head off to points unknown when he receives an appeal for help from “Mutt” Williams (Shia LaBeouf, who rolls up dressed like Marlon Brando in The Wild One), the adopted son of one of Indy’s old school chums and fellow archeologists (John Hurt). Said colleague has now lost his mind in Peru while searching for a fabled crystal skull with supposed mystical powers. That only encourages Col. Spalko to kidnap both him and Mutt’s mom, who just happens to be the same Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who long ago helped Indy find that lost ark. With his new young sidekick in tow, Indy’s off to South America to rescue the hostages and beat the Commies in a race to the skull. Much of the publicity has been about this movie acknowledging that Indiana Jones is now an older man. Indeed, Ford’s hair is all the way gray here, and the screenplay (by David Koepp, with assists from other frequent Spielberg collaborators George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson) refers on several occasions to Indy’s age, including a nod to his now-deceased father – Sean Connery fans will be sad to know that he shows up here only in a still photo. The DELETE doesn’t use this in any inventive or resonant way, just as an attitude to wear. Admittedly, it’s much better than pretending that Indy is still in his 30s. A more serious problem is the storyline that leads into aliens, Roswell, pre-Columbian civilizations, super-powered weapons, and the mythical city of El Dorado. This plot is – how should I say this? – really stupid. M. Night Shyamalan would be hooted out of the building if he tried this stuff. Without giving away too much, the climactic sequence involves a flying saucer and a piece of a continent breaking off. None of that keeps it from feeling like a retread of the meltdown ending from Raiders of the Lost Ark. That’s why this movie doesn’t leave you with that pleasantly exhausted feeling you get from a truly great blockbuster film. Still, what this movie lacks in exhilaration it makes up for in small pleasures. The youngster LaBeouf holds the screen easily and confidently, and if there’s a fifth Indy film with him in the lead and Ford in a supporting role (the rumors are already out there), the series will be in secure hands. As for Ford, the character of Indiana Jones brings out a raffish sense of humor in him that’s often missing in his performances elsewhere, which is always good to see. Spielberg is in a merry mood, too, as evidenced by the witty chase sequence early on with Mutt driving Indy on a motorcycle through a college campus pursued by Soviet agents in cars. (It bears repeating: Spielberg can film a chase scene as well as any director in the world.) Playful moments like those are when this movie is at its best, and there’s no shortage of them. The opening has Indy somehow surviving a nuclear blast, and a car chase features Mutt and Spalko dueling with swords atop two speeding military vehicles. When that breaks out, there’s not much you can do except hail the director’s audacity and light touch, qualities that we too often take for granted. I prefer my Spielberg movies dark, but this bit of Spielberg Lite goes well with my popcorn.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullStarring Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf.

"Sep 8, 2017"," It’s been 19 years since Henry Jones Jr last cracked the bullwhip in the misleadingly titled Last Crusade, and his return to he big screen has been fraught with setbacks. Writers have come and gone and there have been script tinkerings aplenty before Lucas, Spielberg and Ford could all agree. But now, with Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, everyone’s favourite archaeologist is back. Only he isn’t really. From the opening salvo where we’re introduced to the now pensionable Dr Jones, the stage is set. Outside a warehouse at an American military base in Nevada, Indy and best bud Mac (Ray Winstone) are hauled from the boot of a car by a bunch of Commies, (it’s the Fifties now and the US Cold War enemies replace the Nazis as the evildoers of the piece). He picks up his fedora, dusts himself off, and, under duress, complies with the Ruskies who want him to point the way to a rather important item in the warehouse they’re after. One haphazardly orchestrated set piece later, and he’s escaped their clutches, only for him to wander into a nuclear testing site, the detonation of a rather large nuclear bomb decidedly imminent. With the countdown nearing zero what does our hero do? He jumps into a lead-lined fridge in one of the empty dummy-populated houses. The bomb drops, everything’s incinerated, and Indy plus fridge are rocketed off across the sky like a shooting star, crash landing moments – and miles away – later uninjured save for a couple of bumps and bruises. As the story kicks in, the levels of credibility are stretched to breaking point. New sidekick, Shia LaBeouf’s be-quiffed Mutt, rocks up to deliver a letter to Indy from an old archaeologist pal, kicking into motion this instalment’s escapades: racing the red menace to return an ancient crystal skull to its Peruvian jungle home, whereupon the Mayan relic will impart some form of divine knowledge or another (if the commies get it, their ‘armies of darkness’ will march all over the world, you see?). Tombs get raided, with Indy and Mutt encountering all manner of cobweb-drenched caves and passages and obligatory boobytraps, but with Lucas and Spielberg aiming to trump what’s gone before, both in the series and in the earlier scenes of the movie, the stunts and action Indy is known and loved for is ditched in favour of an escalating succession of ‘jumping the shark’ moments. Spielberg’s proclamations, too, that he would be keeping things old school – CGI free and stunt heavy – prove somewhat misleading, as Lucas’s ILM infiltrates every pore of the film, right from the opening shot’s bemused little desert ferret to Mutt’s swinging through the Peruvian jungle Tarzan-like with a group of screeching monkeys. Previously, Indiana Jones movies were action adventure fare, driven towards a supernatural McGuffin. This time round, though, the emphasis has shifted with the sci-fi nature of the eponymous crystal skull tipping the balance in its favour. The shift in tone for the dusty archaeologist is in itself no bad thing, but it is the lack of flair with which it is carried off that breaks our hearts. The recreation of the Fifties is nicely handled, but the characters that populate the movie are one-dimensional pastiches masquerading as real people and this goes some way to explaining the toothless performances on show by the usually reliable thesps who turn out here. Cate Blanchett as psychic soldier Irina Spalko, John Hurt as the crystal skull-crazed Professor Oxley and Jim Broadbent as Indy’s dean at Harvard are all underused, Spielberg missing opportunities left, right and centre with the talent at his disposal. David Koepp’s screenplay (from a story by Lucas, of course, and Jeff Nathanson) misfires too, with too many jokes falling flat, and it lacks focus and direction; it charges out the blocks but loses momentum quickly, ambling when it should sprint, and the McGuffin-encounter finale is an anticlimax for Indy and his slapstick band of cohorts who’re along for the ride this time, which is an achievement in itself given the star-struck nature of its unveiling. When the focus is back with the film’s two stars though, Ford and LaBeouf, there are shades of former glories with the interplay between the two recalling the best buddy-pairings of the previous films. Shia too holds his own, despite his Harley Davidson-riding greaser’s identity being one of the worst kept secrets in recent memory and the rather heavy-handed suggestion to Mutt-shaped adventures to come. Ford, though, about whom there have been grumblings aplenty regarding his ability to pull off the action hero role in his Sixties, settles the debate once and for all. Trim and in shape, he looks the part but, more importantly, he delivers the Indy we know and love; his hair may have greyed, but he’s still the rugged hero we remember and really he’s the film’s raison d’etre. The tone may be off, but when Indy plonks the fedora on his head and dons that leather jacket, it’s as if he’d never been away. Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford had pronounced long before the film’s Cannes debut that Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull was a movie for the fans, and not for the critics. If truth be told, though, it is anything but; rather this latest Indy outing is a film for Mssrs Lucas, Spielberg and Ford. If only they had refrained from indulging themselves quite so much, perhaps they could have delivered a film that was more in keeping with the standards that previous Indy outings had set.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 25, 2015"," Five years ago this week, I was so excited about seeing Harrison Ford return to the role of Indiana Jones — and even more excited about seeing Karen Allen return to the role of Marion Ravenwood — that I had a great time watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Sure, it was disappointing in some ways. But I was so glad to be in the company of Indy and Marion that I gave the film a very positive rating and hastily turned in my review to Christianity Today. I gave Crystal Skull three stars originally, but now I’d barely give it two. I gave Wardrobe three-and-a-half stars and I would give it only two today. I’ve seen both films three times now, and I really hope I never have to sit through either of them again. The things they do poorly, and the ways in which they disrespect their source material (in Narnia’s case, the book; in Skull‘s case, the original Indiana Jones trilogy), make the experience more torture than pleasure. What was your experience? How many times have you watched Crystal Skull, and where would you rate it on the list of Indiana Jones movies? What follows is the original review. Or, rather, this is the unabridged version I published on my blog, after the original was published on May 21, 2008, at Christianity Today. I had already begun to realize how badly I’d misjudged the film, and I was turning down my initial tone of euphoric celebration. If I were to write this review again, I would make many of the same points, but I would sound much more like someone who has been betrayed by childhood heroes. The greatest gift that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull gives to audiences is Indy himself. Fans can stop fretting. He’s back. Dispelling all fears about age and ability, Harrison Ford puts on that legendary fedora and becomes Henry Jones Jr. exactly as we remember him. That smoldering glower. The snappy wisecracks. Those gutsy stunts. The capacity to survive punches that would knock out a prizefighter. That familiar enthusiasm for riddles, buried treasure, and dead languages. It’s all here. There’s never been a better actor/character match than Ford as Jones, and he seems giddy as a schoolboy to be cracking that bullwhip again. In fact, all through this, the fourth Jones film, there’s a sense that the whole Indiana Jones team is bursting with enthusiasm at the chance to ride with Jones again. That probably accounts for the film’s strengths and, alas, its considerable problems. Their enthusiasm gets the better of them. Back in 1981, the storytellers of Raiders of the Lost Ark took Indy’s world somewhat seriously, making outlandish adventures seem almost convincing. But these days, while the James Bond series is leaving behind campy cartoon action for a dustier, grittier “realism,” Indy is speeding in the opposite direction, headlong into Looney Toons absurdity. Crystal Skull makes all previous Jones adventures seem modest—even plausible—by comparison. After we watch a man walk away from an atomic blast with barely a scratch in the opening act, what could possibly inspire a sense of suspense or dread? And we still have to suspend our disbelief while a motorcycle speeds through a crowded university library; a hero swings on jungle vines fast enough to chase down speeding trucks; an army of angry monkeys attacks the Communists; an ocean of deadly insects discerns good guys from bad guys; and Indy takes a waterfall plunge that makes Ford’s famous Fugitive stunt look easy. Viewers will either mock the excess, or surrender like a wide-eyed eight-year-old to these tidal waves of cliffhanger nostalgia. Story credit for this episode goes to series originator George Lucas and co-writer Jeff Nathanson, but there were five different scripts written for this movie, and screenwriter David Koepp (Jurassic Park) clearly stitched together ideas from many disparate sources. It’s a bumpy ride. The first half of the film—the better half—sets the stage. We join Jones in mid-adventure. This is the 1950s, and some things have changed: Indy’s become fond of the phrase “I like Ike!” But some things have stayed the same: He’ll fight the Cold War the old fashioned way—with his whip and his pistol in hand. Indy’s been kidnapped by a troop of Russian spies, led by an ice-cold officer from the Ukraine. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) looks like a female Terminator, and she has an unnerving habit of flexing her gloved hands like a surgeon about to do some invasive work. Spalko’s a decorated Soviet agent, she explains, “Because I know things. I know them before anyone else. And what I do not know, I find out.” Blanchett relishes this, the most cartoonish role of her career. Driven by that thirst for knowledge, Spalko’s using Indy’s know-how to find some buried treasure in a warehouse full of government secrets. She wants the “mummified remains” from the wreckage of those famous UFO crash sites in Roswell, New Mexico. She believes those bones will give her access to tremendous psychic power that will help the Reds win the Cold War. In an acrobatic escape from a very big bang, Indy proves he’s still got the moves. But when he gets back to the comforts of his classroom at Marshall University, we learn that the years have cost him plenty after all. “We’ve reached the age when life stops giving us things and starts taking them away,” says Indy’s friend Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent). Stanforth, the new dean of students, is referring to his predecessor, the late Marcus Brody, and other kindred spirits that he and Jones have lost. And there’s plenty more to lose: McCarthyism is at its peak, and our hero has been targeted as a suspect “of great interest” for allegedly aiding KGB agents on American soil. Stanforth instructs Jones to take a leave of absence. Hat in hand, Indy walks away to measure his options. Before he can go looking for a new job in Leipzig, he’s interrupted by a young punk who looks like Marlon Brando in The Wild One. Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is a Harley-riding, tough-talking kid with a Jones-like jones for adventure. His action figure accessories? A comb and a switchblade. Fans complained when LaBeouf appeared in this film’s previews, but they should drop their protests. He lives up to the challenge, and would be an asset to any future episode. After the film’s best chase scene—a high-speed pursuit around (and through!) the university campus—Mutt informs Indy that a colleague, Harold Oxley (John Hurt), has been kidnapped while seeking the legendary Crystal Skull of Akator in Peru. And we’re off on an airplane that trails a bright red line across the map, straight to South America, where Indy hopes to bring Oxley some help. He gets more than he bargained for, and we get exactly what we paid ten bucks to see: ancient tombs, obstacle courses rigged with booby traps, and savage, blowgun wielding natives. (It’s enough to make one miss Satipo and Belloq.) As they dig deep, they explore questions surrounding the mysteries of the crystal skulls. Do the skulls exist? Do they belong to the gods of ancient cultures, or to “saucer men from Mars”? Are they powerful? What would happen if they were all brought back to their place of origin? Mutt gets spooked by Indy’s stories about the Mayans who distorted the shape of their childrens’ skulls to resemble the elongated craniums of their gods. “No,” Mutt objects. “God’s head is not like that.” Indy smiles. “Depends on who your god is.” And yet, Indy never bothers to ask for help from the God who has saved him so many times before—especially in Raiders and The Last Crusade. He seems to have cast aside all lessons learned from the Almighty. Perhaps that’s why he and Mutt end up captured by the Communists, hostages in good company. Very good company, in fact: A standing ovation, please, for Marion Ravenwood, the greatest leading lady an action hero ever kissed. Karen Allen’s return as Marion is a short-lived delight, and her sharp exchanges with Ford are the stuff that moviegoer dreams are made of. But there’s precious little time for dialogue or character development. We still have to make room for an encounter with a snake, a barrel of monkeys, the most outrageous truck chase of the series, and—of course—grisly comeuppances. (Be warned: If you don’t like bugs, you’re going to have nightmares.) In the last act, the world goes to pieces in scenes of unprecedented devastation. Indy’s just a bystander while loose plot threads and nagging questions are buried in the rubble. (What happened to the FBI’s suspicion that Jones was a Communist? How could Indy have survived “twenty or thirty” top-secret missions with Mac, the sidekick played by Ray Winstone, who seems like a fickle buffoon? Why would the government keep a warehouse full of secrets next to a nuclear testing site?) In Raiders and Last Crusade, climaxes carried some measure of mystery. The skulls, unlike the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, don’t enrich the story with meaning. Sure, we learn where they come from, and who they belong to. But their various powers are baffling—not only do they have hypnotic, telepathic power, but they also serve as a great deterrent against jungle predators. And in the end, they teach the same lesson that Raiders taught: when knowledge is pursued at all costs, it leads to destruction. And that destruction stirs up so much sound and fury that one of Indy’s most powerful collaborators—composer John Williams—is prevented from enjoying any time in the spotlight. Remember the scene in the Map Room in Raiders? Indy spoke not a word while Williams’ music soared, evoking a sense of wonder that this film desperately needs. Still, for all of the cacophonous spectacle and nonsense, Crystal Skull is a blast of old-fashioned matinee fun. While it doesn’t hold a candle to that first and greatest chapter, thank goodness it resembles Last Crusade more than the gruesome, wearying Temple of Doom. And there’s comfort to be found in the film’s conclusions. Spielberg is not the action-adventure director he once was, but he has matured in his convictions. He once celebrated individualistic dreamers, men and boys who abandoned their families for adventure. More recently, he’s been guiding his adventurers home, teaching them to shoulder their responsibility and discover the rewards of relationship. After so many years of recklessness, perhaps that aging archaeologist will find some room for family and fidelity under that old fedora. His treasure “belongs in a museum.” But his heart deserves more. I know that people will struggle at first to see anyone but Ford with the fedora and whip but eventually the films will mature to the point where the Bond films are now.  Even if they have to go through a “Moonraker” phase. I would not count myself a particularly keen Indiana Jones enthusiast, but I rode the wave of acclaim for Crystal Skull into a theatre seat. I wasn’t exactly disappointed — not having had any hopes to disappoint — but I was unimpressed. I found it rather joyless and I was rolling my eyes at the big CGI climax. I agree that Crystal skull is not to the same standard as Raiders, but then again, none of the sequals match up to raiders, but they are all enjoyable in there own way. There were things in Crystal skull that should have been done differently, especially the relationship between Indi and Marion, it was too light hearted and unrealistic. The film also lost its pace when Indi and Mutt first went looking for the skull, to much narrative and not enough action, i almost fell asleep while they were in that asylum. But overall for me what held the movie together was Indi, Ford held together a partially weak storyline,  i still enjoyed it, but it could have been alot better. As for a 5th one, i dont think thats going to happen now with Lucas selling his company to Disney, but sometime in the future i can see Disney bringing Indi back, but based around his younger self, late teens, early 20s.",POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2013"," So I keep coming back to that same question over and over: Was “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” really all that bad, or were more Lucas retractors just exaggerating because they grew up and Spielberg’s story didn’t? And I keep coming back to that same answer: No. “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” really isn’t a bad movie; in fact it’s one of the better Indiana Jones entries I’ve seen that’s been grossly skewered by fans as the “Phantom Menace” of the Indiana Jones franchise, when really, it’s not bad. It’s actually quite good. What we get with “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is great forward progression, we get an Indiana Jones whose fought the war, came back a hero, and is still fighting the good fight against pillagers in spite of his age. The Indy we see here is an older man who really can’t quite keep up with the cronies as he used to, but he is smart and quick on his feet, and still the fedora donning hero we grew to love in the eighties. Harrison Ford is fantastic reprising his role as Jones yet again and writer David Koepp dares to go in to the period with great zeal tackling everything from the growing fear of communism and paranoia that inevitably goes back to Indiana, to the crash of Roswell New Mexico that spawns the search for the Crystal Skulls. Koepp takes the period on with gritted teeth and he does it well. The addition of new characters is near seamless as Salah has moved on and we’re given a slew of fifties era heroes who bring Indiana up to snuff and in to the quasi-modern age. Speaking as someone who had every inch of this film ruined for him by angry movie geeks, “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” was still quite a surprise to sit through, and just as fun as “The Temple or Doom.” Look, rag on me all you want but I had fun with “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” and no amount of bitching from melodramatic fans about “aliens” and “animated gophers” could sway me from the spell of Indiana Jones and his further adventures.So what if Indiana Jones has aged, he’s still the man with the whip, and I had a blast watching he and his new sidekick Mutt punching cronies and slipping out of close calls for two hours. Some of the finer additions to the adventure is that we get to see Indy do what he’s perfect at, and it’s solving puzzles to which he and Mutt come across temples, and soldiers and KGB all of which make for some of the most exciting fare of the film; Shia Lebeouf manages to also hold his own against Ford as his impromptu apprentice who gets a crash course in tomb raiding, and the welcome addition of Marion Ravenwood also adds the needed punch for all doubting Indiana fans who want to know what some of the old characters have been up to since last we left them. I love Ray Winstone, but one of the main downfalls of “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is that he’s simply no Sallah. In spite of Koepp’s insistence in making him a thief of many trades who switches sides constantly, his character falls flat of ever having enough depth to live up to the likes of Marcus Brody or even Short Round and as quickly as he’s introduced and then gone, he’s a barely known aspect of the story. His character could have very well been taken out with the audience barely realizing he was ever supposed to be integral in the first place. Winstone is simply underused and misused to a sad extent. The twist in the second half isn’t surprising, but you know what? The movie is and I think this Indiana Jones is just as great as the one we last saw looking for the lost ark or temple of doom. I don’t see what all the ballyhoo is about; Indiana Jones still has it. As for the DVD, the 2 Disc Special Edition packs a real library of extras and bells and whistles for the fans. Aside from the four language tracks on disc one, we get “The Return of a Legend” a seventeen minute montage/tribute to the glory of Indiana Jones and the adventure he brings in to the big screen. Here Spielberg also explains why he felt the need to continue the saga, and what eventually led them to use the theme of extra terrestrials and integrate it in to the story and it makes sense to this Spielberg apologist. I just wish Lawrence Kasdan could have been paid some lip service with his rejected original script. There’s also the wonderful eleven minute featurette “Pre-Production” where we see the cast learning how to fence, Spielberg constructing his CGI Area 51, and the CGI visualizations in their polygonal form before coming to life on film. There’s also a look at the different versions of Indy’s costume and the choreography for Mutt’s boss fencing battle in the second half. On Disc Two we get over two hours of extras including a playable Xbox 360 Demo for the Lego Indiana Jones Game. We also get an eighty minute Production Diary, as well as a five minute look at the intricate designs of the make up on the Temple warriors from Felicity Bowring. There’s also the ten minute look at the history of the “Crystal Skulls” and how writer Koepp’s ideas stemmed from the artifacts; “Iconic Props” is a ten minute puff piece about the variety of props and how they’re characters in and of themselves including the whip, hat, and crystal skulls. “The Effects of Indy” talks to Paul Huston the veteran effects artist to prior “Indiana Jones” films and how he engineered the battles and set pieces in this film, and “Adventures in Post-Production,” Spielberg’s process of shooting the entire film on traditional film in spite of Lucas’s insistence on using Digital film, the work behind the wonderful sound track and sound editing, and how the poster was important to the film’s enigmatic marketing. “Closing: Team Indy” is a three minute montage of the end of the shooting behind “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” and Spielberg’s feelings on the project; as well there are three Pre-visualization sequences one of which being Jones’s escape from Area 51, and to round out the bunch there are an assortment of stills from post and pre-production, and all three trailers to the movie. In spite of the misusage and underusage of the ever talented Ray Winstone, “The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a perfectly great bout of escapism with Indiana Jones at his best and all the serial movie treats Spielberg and co. brought us back in the eighties. Ignore the fan boy whining and decide for yourself.",POSITIVE

Dr Indiana Jones: a hokey, old-fashioned movie action-hero from the childhood of many film-goers who was based, back in the burgeoning summer blockbuster days of the early 1980s, on a hokey, old-fashioned movie action-hero from the childhood of director Steven Spielberg.  Yes, in case you haven’t realised, Harrison Ford is back as the university professor with a sideline in battling bad guys in a strictly archaeological context and a skill for dodging bullets and boulders in comic book fashion – without suffering a graze. Other pop-iconic inventions, like Batman, have since enjoyed the post-modern treatment at the hands of younger filmmakers like Christopher Nolan, but Spielberg avoids any nod-and-a-wink approach. There’s the odd self-referential moment that points to Indy’s age and to past plots but mostly this is played as straight as the fringe on Cate Blanchett as the villain of the piece. It’s 1957, Jones has a good war record behind him, the Cold War is in full thrust, and fetish fans can rest easy in the knowledge that Indy has kept that hat, whip and leather jacket from his younger days. He digs them out when Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a young lad who rides into the movie in a nod to Brando in ‘The Wild One’ – all leathers and attitude – offers Indy the challenge of hunting down the Crystal Skull of Akator. Of course, Indy’s not alone in the search. There are Soviet agents on his trail, led by Blanchett. These are the same agents, all with that glassy stare that American movies often attribute to commies, who we’ve already seen Indy battle with on an American air field in the film’s first action set-piece. For this episode, he narrowly escapes from a nuclear test-bomb that’s detonated on a mock-up of the typical ’50s town. This is surprisingly chilling in tone and slightly recalls the creepy suburban set-up of the early scenes of Spielberg’s ‘AI’. But only Spielberg would puncture this nod at nuclear horror with a quick cut to an anodyne shot of fluffy desert animals. The rest is familiar. There are car chases, quick sand, river pursuits, poison darts, and exotic locations from the Nevada desert to the jungles of Peru and the Amazon. The only real additions to the mix are some new characters, including Shia LaBoeuf as Indy’s younger sidekick and Ray Winstone as a companion closer to his own age, and a recourse to computer imagery that becomes less and less hidden as the film unfolds. There’s a nod to alien involvement towards the end of the film that feels out of place, and the more the film relies on spectacle, both from special effects and from production design, the more it segues from what audiences really want: human stunts and up-close combat. It’s all perfectly acceptable as a minor thrill ride – nothing more. The film doesn’t feel as punchy, amusing or as fast-paced as the best of the other three films, but it’s passable both as nostalgia and old-fashioned action-adventure that favours impossible leaps from waterfalls over psychological insights and anything in the realm of plot that you could possibly need to believe. It’s John Hurt as an old academic buddy of Mr Jones who utters a significant line as this fourth adventure, 21 years since the last, comes to a close in a scene that’s so sentimental – even by Spielberg’s standards – that you might be shoving your fist down your throat at the very sight of it. He ponders ‘How much of human life is lost in waiting.’ Is that Mr Spielberg suggesting we shouldn’t get our hopes up over these silly things? If so, he’s definitely right. Expect little, remember that the first three films were all basic affairs, and you might just – just – avoid disappointment.

"Nov 17, 2011"," First, a belated apology—to my parents. That kneed-in bedroom wall? Almost certainly the result of heroic vine-swinging en route to ancient Peruvian treasures. I’m also sure I rolled under our descending garage door one too many times for comfort. Raiders of the Lost Ark had that kind of effect on boys in the summer of 1981. The movie’s two chief magicians, director Steven Spielberg and cowriter-producer George Lucas, were quick to give credit to the 1930s cliff-hangers that inspired them. But taking hold was something far more insidious: the power of the new, Rube Goldbergian blockbuster and the idea, Spielberg’s most significant, that simple pleasures are enough. Sometimes they are, provided you’re still a kid: There’s much to dig (archaeologically speaking) in this massively anticipated sequel, especially during its first hour. Best of all is the spectacle of Harrison Ford’s craggy, iconic hero, returning to the fold nearly 20 years after galloping into the sunset in 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. (Some would call this turn “tomb raiding”; they’ll be missing out on Ford’s loosest work in years.) Wisely if unavoidably, this new chapter is set after a similar time span has elapsed, in nuke-panicked 1957, allowing Ford to make effective use of his premature Gary Cooper scowl. “I like Ike!” the professor-adventurer spits in the face of nefarious Soviet babe Irina Spalko (Blanchett, sporting a cartoonishly fun Natasha accent), who’s busy busting into a top-secret New Mexico hangar in search of one of those creepy unmarked alien crates. In the first 15 minutes alone, Indiana survives her tongue-lashings and gunfire, and even a disturbingly realistic mushroom cloud, painting the retro anxieties of the movie in strokes broader than even John Williams’s thundering score does. The plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (credited to Lucas and Jeff Nathanson) has been under wraps for years. But it will come as no surprise that there actually is a kingdom in which there are crystal skulls. Blame Lucas, greenlighter of Jar Jar Binks, for these vaguely Donnie Darko–like craniums, linking the series’s quasimysticism to Roswell and X-Files paranoia. Since the prospect of Comrade Spalko in possession of hypnotic skulls is too much to bear, Dr. Jones heads to South America to find them before she does, after being picked up by a Brando-esque greaser called “Mutt” (LaBeouf), who steals him away from his New England university via a snazzy motorcycle chase. The problems of the movie begin here, subtly but assuredly, in ways that Spielberg has never encountered before. How is it, for instance, that a director so reliably attuned to banter can suddenly become so deaf to sass? LaBeouf is quickly stranded in an interzone between his natural doofusy charm (visible even in Disturbia) and Mutt’s gearhead surliness, which never clicks or is even employed plotwise. Blanchett, too, is given little opportunity to flash the intelligence that would make her a proper antagonist, while the much-hyped return of Raiders’ sparky Karen Allen (promoted to Spielbergian supermom status) only adds up to a lot of hand-wringing. Doesn’t she deserve at least one scene in which to hold her own? And why cast velvet-voiced John Hurt as a dotty academic only to have him be largely catatonic and mute? These drawbacks would be bad enough, but for the first time in his career, Spielberg also seems to be lacking in heart, and governed by contrivance. (And I don’t mean “heart” like Temple of Doom, which certainly had plenty of them to go around.) You begin to notice cinematographer Janusz Kaminski’s lacquered, soundstagey compositions, and wish that the characters were better illuminated from within—with cunning, wit, even a bad Hawksian joke or two. That’s not to say all is lost. If you ever desired swarms of computer-generated red ants, now’s your time. But the movie is all too often free of physical heft or gravity (an ironic indictment of the digital industry Lucas is responsible for), especially during a passive, Close Encounters–style climax that triggers an “Um, wow?” in lieu of actual catharsis. Indy & Co. do less puzzle solving, less escaping. You feel it—or rather, you don’t. Jeopardy is somehow absent. The worst that can be said of Crystal Skull is that it won’t be inspiring any youthful vine-swinging. A shame, really.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 27, 2011","  This fourth Indiana Jones film, let’s call it Indy IV, opens with a flat-out exhilarating drag-race scene in the harsh American desert between a carload of 1950s teenagers and the lead vehicle in a long, formidable US Army caravan. So beautifully and unerringly shot, lit, cast, and edited, that it looks like a collective American fever dream of our insane post-World War II past, this bizarre race makes your heart thump with uncertainty. Is it going to end in comedy or tragedy, or split the difference? Will the soldiers and teenagers have one of those populist joyrides together and then amicably go their separate ways, or will the speeding teens wind up dead in a ditch, or will the soldiers open fire for sinister reasons yet to be revealed, or…? Spielberg plays so many complicated chords you can’t be sure. David Lynch himself wouldn’t be ashamed to claim a few of those chords.   What happens instead is that Indiana Jones gets embroiled in the whipsawing global forces of the Cold War 1950s and winds up having a typical Indiana Jones adventure as a result. He leaves his teaching job (booted out by anti-Communist witch-hunters), and goes questing for a treasure (the ancient crystal skull, one of thirteen that supposedly have supernatural powers), while chased by bad guys (humorless Boris-and-Natasha type Russian Reds led by Cate Blanchett, who’s very fetching in her blue uniform and evil-woman black bob).  Along the way he interacts with cronies who may or not be on his side, all played by the best actors money can buy (Jim Broadbent, John Hurt, Ray Winstone). The young sidekick, considered a necessity now that Ford is an old actor, is motorcycle-riding ‘50s greaser Mutt Williams, played by Shia LeBeoef. LeBeoef is in loads of movies lately (Disturbia, Transformers) and is some sort of star, I’m told. You’d never know it to look at him. Every mall in America could disgorge a hundred guys just as unexciting as he is. But then, the boring star—an oxymoron, but a flourishing species nevertheless—is something of a Hollywood specialty these days.   The nostalgic capper of Indy IV is the return of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. Not seen in the franchise since the first and best Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Allen still has the knack of looking like a real human being. It’s a testimony to her refreshing qualities that Indy’s replacement love interest in the sequel, Indy II: The Temple of Doom (1984), was bound to be regarded as a hated interloper, even if she’d been a lot better than the highly untalented Kate Capshaw (now Mrs. Spielberg). Dumping Karen Allen amounted to an early warning sign that Spielberg was losing it. Because Allen, idiosyncratically lovely and oddly tough for such a slender, big-eyed girl, was proof of Spielberg’s sure hand in those early years when it came to casting. Back then he could really pick ‘em. Unknown or obscure actors were given their first important film roles (Karen Allen, Roy Scheider, Drew Barrymore); well-known actors were given some of their greatest roles (Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Dennis Weaver); and small or bit-part actors, or even extras, did the most consistently memorable work since Frank Capra used to direct crowd scenes like a maestro.

"Feb 1, 2009"," Content by Tony Macklin. Originally published on May 22, 2008 @ Fayetteville Free Weekly.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull-- the fourth movie about Henry Jones, Jr. -- is as comfortable as an old shoe. Or an old hat.
Actually it is old hat. It's comfortable, but it's also worn and slack.
The latest Indy Jones movie is like a fourth marriage --  a not-too-optimistic ride over familiar territory.
The Indiana Jones franchise, which started as special ham, is now spam.
The new Indiana adventure begins in 1957, as a military convoy is going to a base in Nevada. We see Russians, and the skullduggery is set in motion. Indy has been kidnapped by the Russkies to help them find a fateful case that contains an important secret. Indy escapes -- one of the 712 escapes in the movie-- and later we see him in class at a university teaching archaeology. But Indy is victimized by the rampant red-baiting scare of the late 1950s, and he is removed from his position at the university.
On his way out of town, he meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBoeuf), a young man who has a letter from an old, former colleague of Indy. The colleague may have found a telltale crystal skull that could lead to an archaeologist's dream. Mutt also tells Indy that his own mother has been kidnapped. So Indy and Mutt team up in their pursuit to a foreign land. Caves, waterfalls, monkeys, ants, skulls, natives, Russians, mountain roads, and extra-terrestrials provide them obstacles.
Yes, extra-terrestrials. I think I saw the kitchen sink flying through the air.
I know Indiana Jones pays homage to serials, but the waterfall sequence is silly. Serials should not be silly. Director/honcho Steven Spielberg may have left a lot of his imagination back in some theatre at a Saturday matinee.
Harrison Ford, as Indy, smirks more than usual and keeps saying lines such as, “I don't think this is good.” He may be evaluating the movie.
Karen Allen reprises her role as Marion Ravenwood, but she just seems giddy to be back. Fine young actor Shia LaBoeuf goes through awkward paces as a young “greaser.” Combing his hair is shtick that doesn't work. He's no Edd “Kookie” Byrnes. Shia's initial appearance on a motorcycle looking like Brando in The Wild Ones (1954) is clever, but it's downhill from there.
Generally Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has perhaps the best cast of any of the Indy films, but it fails to give them any memorable dialogue.
Cate Blanchett is one-dimensional as the Russian Villainess Irina Spalko, Stalin's favorite “scientist.” John Hurt as Indy's colleague Oxley, can only say. “Henry Jones, Jr” so many ways. Jim Broadbent is the only actor who prevails as he humanizes Indy's university dean.
The one totally negligible actor is Ray Winstone, who makes Indy's friend Mac dull. He's a very weak link. The best performances are given by the monkeys and the ants.
One bit of trivia is that Spielberg's daughter Sasha -- one of five children he has with Kate Capshaw -- has a brief bit as a girl in a brawl. Her right hook should make her dad proud. She just turned 18 about a week ago.
Veteran screenwriter David Koepp -- War of the Worlds (2005), Jurrasic Park (1993), Mission Impossible (1996) -- is a retread specialist. He's competent but undistinguished. Too many scenes in Crystal Skull are talky and listless.
Characters talk the Mayan language so we can't understand all the nonsense. Some of the dialogue is priceless, since nobody would buy it. Indy asks about the ETs, “Where did they go?”
Oxley answers, “Not into space. Into the space between spaces.”
I guess I needed a Mayan translator.

I know Indiana Jones pays homage to serials, but the waterfall sequence is silly. Serials should not be silly. Director/honcho Steven Spielberg may have left a lot of his imagination back in some theatre at a Saturday matinee.
Harrison Ford, as Indy, smirks more than usual and keeps saying lines such as, “I don't think this is good.” He may be evaluating the movie.
Karen Allen reprises her role as Marion Ravenwood, but she just seems giddy to be back. Fine young actor Shia LaBoeuf goes through awkward paces as a young “greaser.” Combing his hair is shtick that doesn't work. He's no Edd “Kookie” Byrnes. Shia's initial appearance on a motorcycle looking like Brando in The Wild Ones (1954) is clever, but it's downhill from there.
Generally Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has perhaps the best cast of any of the Indy films, but it fails to give them any memorable dialogue.
Cate Blanchett is one-dimensional as the Russian Villainess Irina Spalko, Stalin's favorite “scientist.” John Hurt as Indy's colleague Oxley, can only say. “Henry Jones, Jr” so many ways. Jim Broadbent is the only actor who prevails as he humanizes Indy's university dean.
The one totally negligible actor is Ray Winstone, who makes Indy's friend Mac dull. He's a very weak link. The best performances are given by the monkeys and the ants.
One bit of trivia is that Spielberg's daughter Sasha -- one of five children he has with Kate Capshaw -- has a brief bit as a girl in a brawl. Her right hook should make her dad proud. She just turned 18 about a week ago.
Veteran screenwriter David Koepp -- War of the Worlds (2005), Jurrasic Park (1993), Mission Impossible (1996) -- is a retread specialist. He's competent but undistinguished. Too many scenes in Crystal Skull are talky and listless.
Characters talk the Mayan language so we can't understand all the nonsense. Some of the dialogue is priceless, since nobody would buy it. Indy asks about the ETs, “Where did they go?”
Oxley answers, “Not into space. Into the space between spaces.”
I guess I needed a Mayan translator.
 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull-- the fourth movie about Henry Jones, Jr. -- is as comfortable as an old shoe. Or an old hat. 
The new Indiana adventure begins in 1957, as a military convoy is going to a base in Nevada. We see Russians, and the skullduggery is set in motion. Indy has been kidnapped by the Russkies to help them find a fateful case that contains an important secret. Indy escapes -- one of the 712 escapes in the movie-- and later we see him in class at a university teaching archaeology. But Indy is victimized by the rampant red-baiting scare of the late 1950s, and he is removed from his position at the university. 
On his way out of town, he meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBoeuf), a young man who has a letter from an old, former colleague of Indy. The colleague may have found a telltale crystal skull that could lead to an archaeologist's dream. Mutt also tells Indy that his own mother has been kidnapped. So Indy and Mutt team up in their pursuit to a foreign land. Caves, waterfalls, monkeys, ants, skulls, natives, Russians, mountain roads, and extra-terrestrials provide them obstacles.

"Nov 3, 2008"," Indiana Jones has always been something of a farce. A good action farce, to be sure, but something not to be taken too seriously. As a tribute to the old matinee serials, the franchise has been built on a blend of action and comedy, not to mention a whip and a fedora. After numerous delays and a nearly two decades break, the franchise is back with the star-studded fourth installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Although it carries a certain level of slickness to it, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shows that although the times have changed – both in the film and for the viewing audience – Indiana Jones hasn’t. And that’s a problem. Thankfully, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn’t try to hide behind the gap in time between films. Rather, it picks up in the middle of the Cold War where the Americans and Russians are vying for nuclear and world supremacy. The film revolves around a cat and mouse chase over a mysterious skull made of – you guessed it – crystal that is suspected of having some strong and rather unique qualities. This time out Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) is joined by a young Wild One dropout Matt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) and reunited with old love Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) as they look to keep the crystal skull out of the hands of the Russian muscle led by Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). Like the three previous Indiana Jones film, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull aims primarily to be a happy jaunt through comedy and adventure. Plausibility has never been an issue and it never will be in this series. Some of the most memorable moments have been some of the most preposterous and groan inducing. the films are about blending high adventure and thrills with just enough snark and comedy to make it all fun. However, I couldn’t help feel something was missing this time around. As the film waxes over days past, revels in its iconic images to the point where it draws attention to itself and old friends return – even if only in mention – Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an exercise in nostalgia. And like most nostalgia, things get tiresome rather quickly. It probably doesn’t help matters that the first 30 minutes is the best part of the film. Indy is still the same old Indy and those around him haven’t changed much either. This despite the fact that audiences have evolved over the years and so have our expectations. I don’t know if there’s an answer to the problem. Some new things were changed, such as venturing into science fiction, but there’s simply too much of a reliance on things familiar. Character development doesn’t happen when Indy makes a couple of comments and mistakes over his age. More has to happen for a change to happen as it’s more than something physical. It’s a mental change and as it’s portrayed here, the development is rather boring and surface so as only to fill the lulls in moments of peril. Spielberg manages to keep Kingdom of the Crystal Skull moving with slick but not over-the-top camera work that opts for action over gimmicks. It’s a joy to watch him play, particularly in vehicular chase scenes. I’m at the point now where when I see he’s headed in that direction with the action, my excitement borders of geek levels of glee. He doesn’t again very early on in such a way that it’s not flashy, nor does it draw much attention to itself. Spielberg simply has a way of dodging in and out of lanes without cutting and creating a beautiful sense of motion. It’s unfortunate the scene is of such little consequence and does little more than get characters to a location. The rest of the film maintains much of Spielberg’s fluidity, keeping the camera moving but not in a way that it’s jolting or distracting. Instead it heightens the action and gives old tricks new senses of movement. It’s just too bad the rest of the film wasn’t so exciting. Nostalgia was enough just to have Indiana Jones back. To lament on it and draw it out for little character gain made it that much easier to say a final good-bye if this is indeed it. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull‘s two-disc special edition is a solid mix of quality presentation and bonus features – something one might expect from such a marquee title. The film is shown in an excellent enhanced widescreen format with vivid colors and crisp image. The trademark notes of the soundtrack trumpet out with the 5.1 Dolby Surround audio tracks in English and dubbed in French and Spanish. Subtitles are also available in the same three languages. “The Return of a Legend” is an 18-minute look at not only the making of the film but also something of a retrospective on the series’ traditions. “Pre-Production” is just that – a behind-the-scenes peek at the film’s production before filming actually began. The film’s second disc is headlined by the 12-part “Production Diary.” This series of featurettes goes into a lot of depth on the filming of the movie and covers most every angle of the filming. Additional mini featurettes on the disc look at such subjects as make-up, the crystal skulls, props, post-production and special effects. The disc also includes photo galleries, trailers and a playable demo for the LEGO Indiana Jones video game on XBOX 360.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 27, 2008","...playful and entertaining, even if it looks, deliberately, as though we've seen it all before. (Blu-ray edition)",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2008",The thing I loved most about this movie is just how ludicrous the whole thing is.,POSITIVE
"Aug 17, 2008"," 1. 
                      It has been nearly 20 years since the last installment into 
                      the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg franchise that solidified 
                      Harrison Ford as a Hollywood action star. For those that 
                      express concern and/or confusion over the prospect of a 
                      movie hero being dusted off and revived so long after the 
                      fact, we should remind you that the resurgence of the aged 
                      action star is but a new hot commodity in Hollywood. Otherwise, 
                      how does one explain the rousing success of recent return 
                      ventures into film franchises like ""Rocky,"" ""Rambo"" 
                      and ""Die Hard?"" 2. 
                      Contrary to what many avid fans of this franchise might 
                      say, it is not the skill of the screenplay that drives this 
                      series, but rather the ability on part of the director and 
                      stars to fully embrace the absurdity of their premise and 
                      go full-force with cheese and kitsch. The Indiana Jones 
                      movie are above all else enjoyable because they are ridiculous, 
                      and completely joyful in being so. Once you keep that thought 
                      in mind, the idea of a fourth movie begins to work. 3. 
                      All ageist jokes aside, Harrison Ford really is in a different 
                      class than most of his contemporaries when it comes to retaining 
                      a youthful presence on screen. Other than his hair color 
                      and the deeper frown, no one watching the movie consciously 
                      thinks of him as being in his mid-60s, a virtue to a series 
                      in which the hero, even after time, is required to be physically 
                      able to withstand any obstacle that is thrown at him. 4. 
                      Shia LeBouf may be ordinary by young actor's standards, 
                      but boy does this kid have presence! Every time we see him 
                      in a movie, we are consciously aware of him and what he 
                      is doing. Did Spielberg recognize this as a virtue to his 
                      casting in ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" because 
                      Ford's career is essentially structured with the same reasoning? 
                      Possibly. Either way, I'd gladly watch any number of Indy 
                      flicks beyond this point if LeBouf were guaranteed the spot 
                      of witty sidekick in all of them. It's an ideal match. 5. 
                      Cate Blanchett has effectively mastered the last remaining 
                      major accent of any serious actress' career, playing a Russian 
                      espionage agent here that is so savage in her pronunciation 
                      of the formulaic blockbuster catchphrases that we marvel 
                      at her ability to so easily disappear into her character 
                      both verbally and physically. Here is an Australian woman 
                      who has mastered accents ranging from New England, Brooklyn, 
                      Ireland, England, Poland and Germany, just to name a few. 
                      Is there anything left she hasn't tackled? Once upon a time 
                      I might have said something absurd like ""I dare her 
                      to try and speak just like Bob Dylan,"" but oh wait, 
                      she's done that too. 6. 
                      George Lucas may be a good writer, but ultimately Spielberg 
                      is a better director, and watching this latest film, I couldn't 
                      help but wonder what the last three ""Star Wars"" 
                      pictures might have been like had its creator relinquised 
                      directing credits to someone more versed in the mechanics 
                      and style of the moving camera. Because this pairing seems 
                      so apt for the Indy franchise, perhaps Lucas ought to rethink 
                      his idea of finishing his epic series off with episodes 
                      7 - 9, if only to see what kind of magic that a director 
                      like Spielberg could bring to it. 7. 
                      What a great day it is to see Karen Allen so effortlessly 
                      step back into the role of MaryAnn here, a character that 
                      has not been on the radar of one Dr. Jones since ""Raiders 
                      of the Lost Ark."" Indy has had amusing romances in 
                      between -- most notably, a fling with the ravishing Kate 
                      Capshaw from ""Temple of Doom"" -- but nothing has 
                      quite matched the magnetism of Allen and Ford, who bring 
                      a certain charisma to the notion of an unlikely romance 
                      that has routinely attempted to be replicated in similarly-themed 
                      action adventures like ""The Mummy"" and ""National 
                      Treasure."" As Marvin Gaye put it, ain't nothing like 
                      the real thing, baby! 8. 
                      So let's get this out in the open without beating around 
                      the bush. No, Sean Connery is not missed. In fact, one should 
                      be celebrating the notion that Dr. Jones' dear old dad is 
                      reduced to a mere photographic mention in this latest installment, 
                      as his presence in ""The Last Crusade"" was not 
                      the act of great genius. Both a distraction and a dizzying 
                      supplement to the comic relief of the prior Indy chapter, 
                      the idea of him is both annoying and unsettling in a series 
                      that sees no desire in probing the hero's family origins. 9. 
                      In attempting to write my full review of the picture, I 
                      realize that I have no idea of how to describe the plot. 
                      Is there one at all to begin with? If so, does George Lucas 
                      even know what it consists of? There are elements of espionage, 
                      cat-and-mouse caper, treasure hunting, creature feature 
                      and sci-fi epic all woven into the fabric of this story, 
                      done with such a high pitch of energy that one has to wonder 
                      if it all exists as such simply because both Lucas and Spielberg 
                      know they can get away with anything at this point. 10. 
                      The movie as a whole is absurd, preposterous, hilariously 
                      illogical and formulaic beyond belief. But it so ambitiously 
                      revels in those traits that no one is left unphased by the 
                      experience. Indy has many great adventures in the film involving 
                      cities of gold, alien beings, giant crystal artifiacts and 
                      stories of ancient civilizations, but he has nowhere near 
                      the amount of fun participating in them as we do watching 
                      them. At every interval we simply want to throw back our 
                      heads and roll our eyes, but we don't because we are at 
                      a stage where everyone is at peace with this franchise's 
                      sheer stupidity. The point here is not logic or reason, 
                      simply joy and enthusiasm. And there's more than enough 
                      still left in Dr. Jones to justify this fourth film being 
                      released. Give me an aged archaeologist with a whip any

"Jun 21, 2008"," Kyle Smith is a film critic and Sunday columnist for The New York Post, the books columnist for  Best Life magazine, a contributor of book reviews to People and The Wall Street Journal and the author of the novels Love Monkey and A Christmas Caroline. Type a title in the box above to locate a review. Find an alphabetical listing of The New York Post's recent film reviews here. I will use this site for links to my published writings, reviews of movies I don't cover for the Post, longer versions of pieces that get cut for space reasons in the Post, advance buzz on upcoming films, and analysis of books, TV, music and other ponderables. 	“Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is packed with fights and chases and comedy—but then so were the old Tom & Jerry cartoons. 	“Indy 4,” which is the worst Steven Spielberg popcorn flick since the forgotten “1941”—yes, it’s worse than “Hook”—is a series of campy comedy action scenes awkwardly linked by a dopey plot that brings together the twin fifties obsessions of Communists and flying saucers, along with a search for El Dorado, the lost city of gold. 	Like a petulant high school senior ripping down an old boy band poster that reminds her of the kid stuff she is sure she has way outgrown, Spielberg and producer George Lucas, who gets a story credit, seem to think they’re too good to revisit the original trilogy so they mock it instead.  As with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and its first two sequels, the movie begins by blending the Paramount mountain logo into a matched image that starts the film, but this time it’s a molehill, and so many furry little critters appear in reaction shots it’s as if Spielberg thinks he’s making a sequel to “Caddyshack.” The only truly scary moment is a glimpse of the Play-Doh mask of plastic surgery that has replaced what used to be Karen Allen’s face. 	The movie begins in the Nevada desert, where a sword-wielding KGB agent (a ridiculous Cate Blanchett, doing some embarrassing Boris-and-Natasha shtick) has kidnapped Indy because of what he knows about a mysterious mummy hidden in the same warehouse where the Lost Ark was stashed at the end of the first movie. Ray Winstone plays Indy’s buddy, a fellow adventurer with a secret, but we never find out much about their friendship and consequently the Winstone character never has the slightest impact. 	Soon we’re in a chase scene set inside the warehouse that sets the tone for the whole movie. The supposed tension is repeatedly deflated with har-har one-liners, the stunts look more like computer simulations than something an actual mortal could pull off, and Indy’s success depends heavily on the stupidity and ineptitude of his pursuers. 	Not long later, after some half-hearted political content about the Red Scare (seemingly this was ordered up by Lucas, who gave us that clunky line about campaign finance reform in “Attack of the Clones;” Spielberg, even when he is trying to be socially relevant, is about as political as Norman Rockwell), Indy is sought out by a young dropout named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf). Mutt wants help in finding a professor and mentor (John Hurt) who is also a friend of Indy’s and has disappeared in Peru. LaBeouf, who was well-cast as the nerd in “Transformers,” is a bizarre choice to play a switchblade-wielding greaser; when he enters the film on a motorcycle decked out like Marlon Brando in “The Wild One,” it’s as if Richie Cunningham raided Fonzie’s closet.  	For no special reason the two of them take off on a mad dash through the Yale campus on a motorcycle, and as much fun as it is to see the Old Campus and the Sterling Library pop up in a blockbuster, the sequence is too goofy to work as an action scene and not funny enough to be comedy. Where Indy spent the first three movies fighting for his life, here he easily brushes aside such baddies as, for instance, a guy holding a gun on him in the back of the truck whom he dispatches with a single kick. Often, he’s just lucky, such as when he goes over a giant waterfall as easily as if he’s riding the flume at Six Flags. His primary goal, it seems, is to work up not-quite-witty witticisms (asked if he has any last words, he says, “I like Ike;” borrowing from the “Star Wars” series, he says, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” a remark that was not actually that sparkling to begin with and which Lucas really should have retired by now.) 	Spielberg used to delight in springing surprises. The scene in “Raiders” in which Indy shoots the swordsman got perhaps the biggest laugh I’ve ever heard in a movie theater. This time, though, when Karen Allen reappears as Indy’s old lover Marion the big reveal turns out to be a piece of information that everyone in the audience will have guessed half an hour earlier. It’s hard to pay attention to anything Marion says or does anyway, so strange is the construction site of Allen’s face. 	The weak slapstick and perfunctory derring-do—Indy climbs in and out of various caves and crypts, get attacked by disposable savages—add up to so little that when the treasure hunt starts to look like a shaggy dog story it’s not so much a letdown as the fulfillment of a really boring prophecy. Weren’t we promised in the first frame of the movie that mountains would become molehills? “Spielberg used to delight in springing surprises. The scene in Raiders in which Indy shoots the swordsman got perhaps the biggest laugh I’ve ever heard in a movie theater.” Karen Allen hasn’t had a single bit of plastic surgery. This “critic” is probably thrown off  by a woman in who 50s who looks like a woman in her 50s. That is NOT a legend, Kyle. It’s a fact. They discuss it on the 2003 “Indiana Jones” box set. They spent hours choreographing a huge fight scene between the swordsman and Indy. Indy was supposed to take out his whip and battle him. Ford had been sick all day and had diarrhea, and when the moment came around to film the battle sequence, he pulled out the prop gun and pretended to shoot the guy instead. He intended it as a joke because everyone on set knew he was sick, but everybody thought it was hilarious and it ended up replacing the choreographed scene. I totally agree with your review, though. I’m glad I’m not the only one who wondered why there were so many prairie dog reaction shots - was there a point to the cutesy John Williams cue after Indy stumbles out of the fridge and stares at the rodent sitting there?  The whole film was just a mess. I haven’t felt this disappointed in a sequel since “Spider-Man 3″ — and even then, Spider-Man is just Spider-Man, and those films have only come about within the past decade so it’s not as culturally imprinted as Indy. To have a 20-year wait for a new Indy movie by the original creative team and have it be _this_ bad - it’s just a shame. This movie was an absolute dud! Please spare others who might be tempted to see this abomination. I paid $4 to watch ( a sucker is born every minute ) this poor excuse for  adventure.  Spielberg and Ford should take a cold shower and then vanish. Um, Jeremy … If you’re going to bash Indy … Please use decent grammar and don’t be so freakin lazy that you don’t hit the caps key.
That being said, I agree with Ken that it doesn’t get any worse then Hook and although there were a few parts that dragged, it was still fun ride.
And it gets bonus points in my book for actually matching Indy with my favorite Indiana Heroine- Marian- and someone his age! ps I didnt read I just typed side notes
“I do get it” should say “i dont get it” anyhoot your a funny man and would be fun to go see a movie with and tear it apart after I just wish someone would make a decent film so no one would have too. Not that I really care, but everything else I’ve read has pointed out that Karen Allen is unusual in that she has NOT had plastic surgery.  In fact she basically left film acting altogether some time ago and runs a knitting and weaving business, which might lend some believability to this claim.  In the recent photos I’ve seen of her in interviews and such, her face has certainly looked very natural–an attractive but normally wrinkly 50 something.  Maybe she just had a really bad make-up job in the film (which I haven’t seen). Just a bad movie.  I felt embarrassed to sitting there thinking why did they make this flop.  It could have been really awesome.  I thought Harrison Ford did a fine job with the script he was given but none of the other actors should have been in this movie.  The part when Mutt is swinging from the vines like Tarzan made this movie seem like a Disney kid’s flick.  I think “Raiders” had a certain darker believability about it which just wasn’t captured in this one. This film was silly and poorly written.  No connection between the scenes and the action sequences actually at times seemed too long.  What kind of movie makes you think, “this action sequence is just going on and on and is really lame?”…..a really bad, bad movie. Yeah, say what you will about the story, but Karen Allen is clearly the most natural-looking actress you’ll ever see.  Has it gotten to the point that you (the critic) are so used to seeing faces pulled back and up and eyebrows lifted and foreheads frozen that you can’t recognize what a real face looks like any more? Yeah, I was disappointed, I didn’t enjoy recognizing the video game alike CGI effects on an Indiana Jones movie and I hated the last scene where that Indi was watching the spaceship taking off which was so poorly done. I feel your pain on this one Kyle.  I was pretty let down by this one but feel that the casual movie goer will eat it up.  The whole thing feels like it was phoned in.  After 19 years you’d think they’d put some more passion behind it. I recently had a childhood dream realised when I was invited to a fancy dress party.  There was no need to think about what I wanted to be - Indian Jones.  So at 37 years of age, I place the Panama hat on my head and felt like a million dollars - proud to wear the whip and jacket.
Shame Harrison Ford couldn’t say the same thing.
Something someone else said in a previous review comes to mind - I wish I could unsee this movie.  What a total let down.  To say the acting was wooden would be a compliment.  How little chemistry was there between Ford and Allen?  I can’t remember any script from the movie at all, it was that memorable.  It reminds me of so many other disposable experiences - SW Episode 1, Highlander 2, Jaws 3 - I just wish it had never been made as it has sullied the legend that is Indy.
I’m going to have to watch Raiders 10 times now to get rid of the taste.
Oh dear.. No wonder Sean Connery decided to stay in retirement. Sensible man. Your review was right on.  Except, the comments on Karen Allen’s face brought it down.  The movie was too much like being on an all too familiar amusement park ride.  Predictable, canned, safe.  Seemed like just one long, loud chase scene designed to press our thrill buttons, and not engage us in storytelling, character development, surprise, or suspense.  Does damage to the Indiana Jones series. The audience gasped twice during Indy IV.  First when we get the initial face shot of Indiana Jones.  Folks, I’m here to tell you that the reports Ford aged gracefully are rubbish.  With his sagging jowls and gray stubble, he looks like the town wino.  Add to that sad sack appearance the fact that he’s been nabbed by the bad guys while kicking around the Mexican desert with a seedy sidekick and the answer to the question “What ever happened to Indiana Jones” is answered, depressingly.  The second gasp came when the weird-looking Karen Allen shows up.  I loved Ms. Allen in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  In some scenes in Indy IV she look her old effervescent self, and in others she seems to have aged 30 years.  Sometimes both in the same scene!  As for the movie itself, it is unspeakably bad.  Some reviews have tried to defend Indy IV by saying it’s unfair to compare it to Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Perhaps.  Raider is one of the all-time great movies, and that judgment does not need the word “adventure” as a qualifier.  OK then.  If this movie is to stand on its own, it must then take its rightful place alongside Ishtar and Waterworld.  The action sequences lack tension.  The humor is not funny.  And the plot is a nonsensical mishmash.  What people forget, perhaps, is that the plot for Raiders, while outlandish, DID make sense.  There actually was (at least there was written to be) an ark of the covenant, and Hitler actually was a nut about the occult.  You know Indy IV is in deep trouble early on when we hear that the Russians are going around the globe digging up old mystical relics (hmm, wasn’t that same line, almost verbatim, used in Raiders to describe Hitler?)  And the self-plagarism doesn’t end there.  Many of the action scenes in Indy IV are almost carbon-copy duplicates of better scenes in Raiders.  It’s time for Indy to retire.  In truth, that time was 20 years ago. Um, Dana … If you’re going to criticize someone’s grammar … you should know that “…” isn’t the same thing as a comma … so you sound pretty hypocritical. Ditto to what Ben said.  The only thing more sad than aging actresses that use surgery to look younger are smarty-pants blog authors who think they can make their movie reviews sound hip with “clever” ridicule and personal insults. Wow. I have never laughed as hard as I just did at a line in a movie review. Was it just me or did Ford come off more as a failing Steve Martin when he tried to execute “witty” dialogue? Yep, I agree that the movie left something to be desired, but you are dead wrong about Karen Allen.  As others have already stated, apparently you were put off by the fact that she has NOT had plastic surgery like many of her peers.  She looks exactly as a woman of her age should look, wrinkles and all.  Your comments were a low-blow. Haha your review was perfect, this movie sucks. I find it hard to understand how the “professional” critics of rottentomatoes have given this film over 70 percent good. My dad and I were both like are that was awful as soon as it was over, so boring, action scenes so pathetic and just stupid. After it was over I said that might have been good if you were 8, my dad said ” that might be pushing it” ha. Indy Fan, I hear you when you say “I wish I could unsee it”… That’s how I felt while leaving the theatre. The Riders was such a special move to me where I felt “butterflies” watching it when it came out in the 80’s, the perfect mix of magic, action and fun… I was so hoping that Lucas/Spielberg will come up with something extraordinary. They have the minds and the money. Instead, I felt embarassed and emptied out by the movie. What a shame. What a shame! Your review basically took the words right out of my mouth, and put it on paper - Blanchett’s Rocky and Bullwinkle homage, the stupid and predictable plot, the absurdity of the relationships and stunts.  And I completely agree about the CGI – it was so over the top to the point that it just because stupid (the same exact mistake, by the way, that Lucas made in the three new Star Wars movies). The jokes were so obvious and dumb that you already knew the punch line before they even made the joke.  The stupid B.S. with the skulls and the flying saucers was ridiculous – it honestly made the melting Nazis in Last Crusade seem plausible (and by thew way, I LOVED Last Crusade).  And as for the entire story – what, actually, was it, again?  What were the Russians doing there, other than for the “insert anonymous U.S. enemy of the moment here” in the script?  And what was the whole point of Karen Allen, honestly?  It would have just saved all of us about 10 minutes of this abomination called a “film” if she could have just walked across the screen like the pin-up girl at wrestling matches with a sign reading, “Hi Indie, this kid is yours.” I honestly thought it was a ‘fake’ beginning, as if there was a movie made about his life and it was going to cut back to the real movie. It never cut back. Horrible dialog. Not one moment of real suspense. The lighting and staging was so gawd-awful. I think it was written as a pure marketing piece for teenagers and baby boomers. The humor was WORSE than bad sit com humor. The movie did not take the viewer seriously, so I could not take the movie seriously. I would have walked out if I was not with my parents who I was visiting. Saw this film last night and right from the opening scene i thought this is going to be a dud of a film,and i was right. In a film i like some plausibility. I mean how far in the air did that fridge travel and Indy just gets out unhurt. Ray Winstones character was totally pointless, Blanchet annoying and Ford looked like he was just going through the motions throughout the film, and Spielberg had to have his close encounters alien ending. A terrible film franchise ruined again just like starwars was. Great review - can’t believe rotten tomatoe rated this 79%. Unbelievable. Everyone that walked out of the movie were in shock, they just couldn’t believe what they just saw. It was like watching ET, national treasure, indie and hogans heros combined. absolute shocker….. shame on steve and george. oh wow! Your lambasting of such a horrid work is relieving to my many frustrations and unmet expectations with this film ( it seems anything George Lucas touches turns to coal). Thanks! Hey geezers! Try overcoming being crabby and bitter.  This is a fun Saturday morning pulp action movie, not “No Country for Old Men”. It’s so easy for self-agrandisizing miscreants to criticize a movie that is just good ol’ escapist fun! Wow what can I say. Prior to seeing this film I sat down with my 6 yo son and we watched Raiders together. I was his age when I first saw Raiders way back in the day. We both loved it. Action, suspense, comedy. Truly a fine film. We then went to see Crystal Skull and I felt truly let down. Apart from the A-bomb scene there was absolutely nothing memorable about this film. The CGI was so terrifically bad I was left speechless. Bringing Marion back was a nice surprise but that is about the only thing Speilberg got right on this one.  We own the 3 disc Indy set and my son and I are going to pretend this 4th film never existed. Harrison did everything he could with this limp noodle of a film….I just can’t understand why they would bother to make this schlock after 19 years? With all the resources available today this should have been an excellent addition to the series….all I can say is WTF where they thinking? I just saw the movie and must agree with Mr. Smith. I was waiting on it to slow down and actually tell a interesting story but it never did. They claim that this movie is for Indy Fans, but it’s a slap in the face to true Indy fans. I know Lucas will believe that criticism is unfair, but come on, they didn’t even try to make this a good movie. I wasn’t expecting it to be Raiders, but I wasn’t expecting Howard the Duck either. It seemed like someone picked up cutting room floor scraps to piece a movie together. And the climax to the movie? What in blazes was that?? It’s like they just got tired of writing and wrote a bizarre climax to end it. I was highly disappointed. You would think after 19 years and all the creativity that Spielberg and Lucas have, that they would have come up with better. As disappointed as I am, I would like to see them try it again, but this time please get it right. The movie was great, you are way off-base. I’m guessing your type of flick must be “moving” films like American Beauty or The Ice Storm. Just a quick note on the pure implosibility of the script… hiding in a lead lined fridge is probably not going to save you from an a-bomb, but especially when you stumble out unscathed (despite several bumps, spins and twirls in the air — that’s one great fridge seal in that it didn’t open through all that) and then stand there and watch the mushroom cloud… um… anyone hear of fallout? The heat from the blast, as well as the fallout after only half a minute after the explosion would have melted him to “liquid Indy”… that was easily the most unbeleivable scene in a series of really bad scenes. Please pry the screenwriter’s pen out of Lucas’ hands… he hasn’t written a decent script since Star Wars (1977). For beginning sequence outside the warehouse, I honestly thought Ford was being dubbed - the reading of the bad script so horrible that it could not be really spoken. I need to get this off of my chest.  To all those who feel that George Lucas is a genius…you’re insane!  The man has the most undeserved successful career in Hollywood!  He made 3 good movies: THX1138, American Graffiti, and Star Wars.  That’s it!  His talent peaked back in 1977.  For Empire Strikes Back, he wrote the basic story premise…did not write the screenplay, did not direct.  This man cannot direct or write his way out of a paper bag.  He had beginners luck and that’s it.  Luck and the fact that he is the “Legendary George Lucas of Star Wars Fame!!”  Boy, is he riding that horse to death.  Please let the man retire so that he can start an ostrich farm or something.  And as for Mr. Spielberg…I can’t even talk about him right now.  I need a nap. I forgot to actually review the film 
First, no chemistry between Ford and Allen.  I blame the writer and director.  They did not have any quiet scenes together.  In “Raiders”, they had at least 3 that I remember where they could fall back in love and we could get to know them.  In this film, they hit the ground running and they never have the chance to get to know each other.  Second, Ray Winstone’s character (the best friend/side kick) was a complete waste of time and screen.  Why does it seem like every big director believes that, for sequels, bigger is better and then populate the screen with TOO MANY characters?  Spiderman 3 did it.  Batman 3 and 4 did.  Keep it down to just 2 or 3 main characters and tell us their story.  Ray Winstone was pointless.  Finally, this is just a personal peeve, but Indy only used his whip twice in the whole movie (throwing the handle to Ray Winston does not count…we call that a rope.)  Speaking of which, during the moronic quick sand scene, where was Indy’s whip?  Instead…a snake….really?  Everything else that is wrong with the film has already been discussed so I will leave you now. Never raising more than a smirk in places - it’s a shame to see Indy looking so tired and reluctant. Ray Winstone and John Hurt were an absolute waste and Blanchett would have been better playing a henchman rather than the main villain. The plot is silly but then so were the others but they had charm and grace. Why make this film really? Spielberg still has stuff in the pipe I’m sure - Lucas on the other hand should be barred from writing a script for the rest of his life. the problem with karen allen wasn’t cosmetic surgery, it was the fact that she grinned maniacally throughout the entire movie. for people used to the rictus of plastic surgery frozen faces, it is an easy mistake to make. You’re probably right about the heat of the blast (I haven’t seen the movie), but there would be hardly any fallout “only half a minute after the explosion”.  Fallout is the radioactive dust generated by the explosion.  It takes a while to start settling.  Perhaps you mean radiation, not fallout? Haven’t seen the movie but after reading all the comments - I really will see this movie!  You people are all idiots!  You just want to bring something down because it seems to make you feel good - give the guys a break - they are like 100 years old!  YOU make a movie after a 20 year break and try to make EVERYONE happy!  We should be happy Harrison makes it through alive!  Relax and enjoy the ride - and give us a break from the same old tired comments that every moron can leave on these sites.  I can’t wait to see it and if it’s bad - so be it - but damn!  You people need to relax! This movie is terrible, now I am adamant nay desperate to see what Frank Darabont and Speilberg had concocted while Lucas was away. He had written a near full script when Lucas returned from the shooting of episode 3. Subsequently he fired Darabont and hired David Koepp who finds new ways in which to dissapoint me. Steven has been known to make good films but he’s also made some stinkers, but for god sake he’s got to stand up for the writing. He’s got to stand up to lucas and fire koepp. He has to direct the damn thing so demand more Steven. This movie was a waste of time and money, except where there studio is concerned. Dumb from start to finish. I was truly BORED by this movie! An Indy movie should be a rollicking good time. I could even forgive the lame plot if it at least once I was on the edge of my seat, laughed out loud or gasped in amazement. I loved the original movies. However, this movie never engaged me. There was never any chemistry between the actors. Harrison Ford really looked old the first 15 minutes of the movie. As a 50-something female, maybe this made me feel old too. At the end of the movie I felt sad and slightly betrayed by Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lucas. The theater was absolutely quiet at the end — no laughter, no clapping. BTW: My 16 year old son thought the movie was OK. It was easier to watch the monster burst through John Hurt’s chest in Alien than watch 30 seconds of history’s worst ever film. Move aside Caddyshack II, we have a new low point in cinema. A better title would be “Alien Ishtar National Treasure”. I don’t know. I normally would have waited for cable (it seems obvious to me that this sequel would suck) but now I feel compelled to go see Karen Allen’s face and see if Kyle got it way wrong. wow, you were disappointed? by 20 years of expectations? no way. no freakin’ way. i mean, lucas and spielberg have obviously only been working on this new indy movie that whole time, they couldnt have been up to other things, so i dont know why they didnt deliver. it was good. i’m 26 and a filmmaker and i thought it was good. try to remember that they werent trying to just make a movie for jaded people who’ve changed their ideals (YOU are different, not indy), but one that a younger crowd could enjoy. that’s when you got into the first three, wasnt it? when you were a kid? What a pathetic excuse for a movie…Mr. Lucas is a shoe-in for the Golden Rasberry award…you all have done a good job describing the most painful scenes…my question is, would it not have been wittier and funnier if Indy’s son had the same fear of snakes as his dad, rather than using a snake (??) to get out of the sand…true that is cliched, but still better than everything else they tried….also what was up with Cate Blanchett???  Was she supposed to be psychic??  What a terrible mess…wish I could unsee it too. Well-done review. My own criticism of the movie is that it’s impossible to summarize! Everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into it…A-bomb tests, Communist witch hunts, 50’s punk kids, UFO’s, Area 51, “Close Encounters…,” “Midnight Express” (courtesy of John Hunt’s performance),superhero-style chase sequences, comic-book looks, etc. But what did you guys who critize this movie expect? “Casablanca”? OK - saw the movie last night and it was AWESOME!  True, there were some rough moments (the alien thing towards the end was weird) but overall the feelings of hearing the Williams score throughout the movie and seeing Indiana Jones in his old garb was truly inspiring!  How unamerican to say that this movie “sucked”!  It was great and anyone who reads this CRAP about it being bad should see for themselves.  If you truly liked the other Jones films, you will love this film.  It is filmed in the old style and is truly a great film.  Everyone else who hated it - shut up and let people decide for themselves!  It’s great and a lot fo fun! The movie follows the same formula as previous efforts, and for that it gets lambasted?  Do we want to see a jaded realistic Indiana on screen? In response to Eric’s post, I find it hard to believe that people gasped during the initial face shot of Indiana Jones. Is seeing a 66 year old shocking? Even if Ford does look his age, so what? People age and so should characters. Also, we all know what Ford looks like anyway. It’s not like he hasn’t been scene in 20 years. The statement would make sense if he dropped out of existence and the first shot was of toothless bald guy who is 100 pounds  heavier. Also, he always looked somewhat of a wino. I remember watching the scene in the Temple of Doom when he was in a suit eating those bugs my mother saying he looked homeless. Indy 4 IS NOT a perfect film but deserves much more then these crap reviews.This boring “writer” is just projecting his negative feelings into a work that can’t please everybody.Get a life.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 12, 2008"," Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is decent action game, but only because the Mutt sequences save it.

"Jun 12, 2008"," Recently,
I happened to catch Raiders of the
Lost Ark on the Sci Fi channel,
which, in the weeks leading up to the highly anticipated release of
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the
Crystal Skull, had been ceaselessly
playing the first three films in the Steven Spielberg-George
Lucas-Harrison Ford canon. I have to say, it's been at least two
decades since I'd watched Raiders,
maybe more, but I was instantly absorbed by the movie, partly out of
nostalgia, partly out of admiration for Spielberg's extraordinary
craftsmanship, in his ability to take a complicated, seemingly
unwieldy action sequence and cinematically render it with crystal
clarity. From the big start with the iconic rolling boulder to the
big, big finish in which the heads of the chief Nazis melt into goo
like overheated candles, Raiders of
the Lost Ark, which pays homage to
the movie serials of yore, remains a timeless, joyful experience. It
is one of Spielberg's finest moments, one of producer Lucas' finest
moments, one of Ford's finest moments. It is a fine, fine moment
indeed.  Not
so much Indiana Jones and the Kingdom
of the Crystal Skull. Though this
fourth installment -- arriving some 20 years after the last outing,
Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade
-- is marginally better in spots than the first two sequels to
Raiders,
it is ultimately a letdown of a homecoming for the archeology
professor who, outfitted with an iconic whip and fedora, moonlights
as an adventurer.  It's
hard to precisely pinpoint the root of the problem. It's certainly
not star Harrison Ford, who, despite his advanced years -- and all
the tiresome jokes in the film pointing to said advanced age -- slips
effortlessly back into the character and gives the best performance
he's delivered in a decade. It's the kind of performance that reminds
us why he's a movie star.  And
it's certainly not Karen Allen, who reprises her role as Marion
Ravenwood from Raiders
and brings a much needed snap, crackle and pop to the film at just
the moment things seem to have deflated past the point of ennui. She
is an enlivening force -- and she looks great, to boot (if she's had
''work'' done, it doesn't show) -- and her kinetic chemistry with
Ford is perfect. Allen, whose career has gone the way of the
tumbleweeds since the early '80s, looks positively gleeful to be
involved with the project, and her glee is infectious. For a time,
she alone convinces us that this Indy
is a worthwhile endeavor.  The
script by David Koepp is cluttered and indecisive. Koepp tries to
capture the fear-of-communism paranoia that beset our country in the
late '50s, the period when this Indy
is set, but he keeps getting sidetracked by other ideas. The result
is an unfocused, bouncy mess. Koepp must adhere to the Indy
formula, and by the time the wan climax rolls before us, the movie
has dissolved into a froth of uninteresting CGI nonsense, capped by a
final, revelatory line uttered by Indy that is laughable and foolish.  Spielberg
is also to blame for the film's shortcomings. His direction feels
mechanized; he seems marginally interested in the material, but you
can tell he's outgrown it as a director. He's still a master at
constructing clear, concise action sequences, but where you could
sense the director's zest behind Raiders,
here it seems like more of a ''Well, I'll do one for the fans and
then go back to my more serious projects.'' Spielberg has spent the
latter half of his career trying to escape the blockbusters that made
him Hollywood's heaviest hitter. His recent efforts, like War
of the Worlds and Minority
Report, have at least had an adult
bent to them. He's no longer a young director, and nowhere is that
more apparent than in his approach to this Indy.  The
opening sequence alone, set in a government warehouse emblazoned with
''Area 51'' on the door, tells you that. It barely makes it out of
the starting gate. There's only one sequence in which Spielberg
conjures every single iota of his action mastery -- a thrilling,
brilliantly executed jungle chase capped by an encounter with
voracious killer ants and double capped by an encounter with not one,
not two, not three, but four
waterfalls. Woo hoo!  Then
it's back to the doldrums as the movie lurches toward its predictable
big finish, a finish that suspiciouly feels like it was lifted from
Stargate.
Oops.  Another
disastrous touch is the decision to make Shia LeBeouf, who plays
Indy's young sidekick, Mutt, into a pint-sized homage to Marlon
Brando in The Wild One.
To be honest, the movie feels like a mash-up of Raiders
with Lucas' American Graffiti
and Spielberg's own E.T.  Cate
Blanchett, sporting a severe black bob and toting a rapier and an
accent that continuously slipstreams from Russian to British and back
again, is a letdown as the evil Russian scientist, Irina Spalko.
She's a less-than-memorable villain. But at least she seems to be
having fun.Which, when all is said and done with this Indy,
is more than I can say for the rest of us in the audience. ",NEUTRAL

"Jun 7, 2008"," There are codes to be deciphered, caves to be explored and Commies to be conquered in the new but defiantly old-fashioned Indiana Jones film. Maybe it's because I've never cared for codes, I'm sick to death of caves and I prefer more peaceful methods of negotiation than the ones shown here, but I couldn't find much to be excited about in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, notwithstanding all the hype. Still, it's certainly never dull as our hero rushes from one scene to the next, and there are a couple of imaginatively conceived action sequences. All that will matter to the box office, though, is that, after 19 years, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is back and still the Indie of old: wearing his treasured jacket and fedora, wielding his whip, oozing the same I'm-taking-care-of-business-what-are-you-doing grumpiness, firing off the customary self-deprecating quips. But, along with Ford, Indie is a lot older, the new film moving him from the late 1930s, where it left him at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), to the mid-'50s. Director Steven Spielberg, writer David Koepp and the actor strictly adhere to the line that if their Indie can't hide his age, he should flaunt it. At the same time, they carefully stress the point that this archaeology professor who knows how to kick butt has lost none of his buzz. ""For an old man, you ain't bad in a fight,"" exclaims his new sidekick (Shia LaBeouf's youthful Mutt Williams replacing Sean Connery's Professor Jones snr from the previous film). ""What are you? About 80?"" As far as both the film and our two-fisted elder-citizen hero are concerned, it's all business as usual, even if the passage of time has uncovered some differently accented enemies. Here, it's not only the regular foreign devils making nuisances of themselves - Russians replacing the Nazis of earlier films - but also some home-grown ones. Fearful of the Red Menace, paranoid US authorities have grown suspicious of Indie's maverick ways and had him suspended from his academic post. They're obviously wrong about that, but they're very right about the pesky Russian-born Reds, led by warrior queen Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). Not only have they infiltrated the US in their ruthless pursuit of the crystal skull that is the film's MacGuffin, but they plan to use its mysterious powers to conquer the world. Described as ""Stalin's fair-haired girl, his favourite scientist"", Irina is played by Blanchett in Lois Brooks bob, S&M gear and unembarrassed hamming mode. More like the Virgin Queen vith a German accent than a multiplex super-vixen, she poses no real threat to Indie, but it is fun watching Blanchett enjoy herself for once. Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas cite 1950s science-fiction movies as their reference points for the new film, and they flourish the foibles and the fashions of the era: fear of the A-bomb (mixed with a charming naivety about its consequences), fear of alien invasion, Elvis on the soundtrack, Mutt's Fabian-like perm. Our new sidekick's Marlon Brando-like entrance on his Harley-Davidson, clad in cap, leather jacket and sunglasses comes from 1953's The Wild One; the giant army of Peruvian ants that momentarily turn enemies into allies were swiped from the scenario for 1954's The Concrete Jungle, and so on. That said, though, the breakneck style of storytelling - an escalating spiral of captures and escapes - again harks back to the 1930s and to the cliff-hanger serials that inspired the earlier films. The energy on display is impressive, even if Spielberg's suggestion that a fifth Indie adventure is a distinct possibility is more a cause for concern than celebration. George Lucas came up with the character of Indiana Jones (originally Indiana Smith) in 1973 when he and John Milius were working on a screenplay for Apocalypse Now, which he'd been planning to direct. As executive producer of the four films to feature the archaeologist hero, he's had an ongoing input into the stories, also writing 19 episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles series for TV. However, he's left the writing of the films to others. The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) was penned by Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill) whose unavailability for the sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) led Lucas back to Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (who'd written American Graffiti for him). The official writing credit for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) went to the late Jeffrey Boam, with some unofficial help from Chris Columbus (the Home Alone films) and playwright Tom Stoppard, who was paid a cool million for rewrites. Budgeted at about $US185 million, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is credited to David Koepp (the Jurassic Park films), although the fingerprints of at least three others can be found on the screenplay: Jeb Stuart ( Die Hard), Frank Darabont ( The Shawshank Redemption, five episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles) and Jeff Nathanson ( Catch Me If You Can). M. Night Shyamalan ( The Sixth Sense) also worked on a script, but never completed it to his satisfaction, and Stephen Gaghan ( Traffic, Syriana) and Stoppard, again, were also consulted.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 3, 2008"," The key question going into Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was whether 65-year-old Harrison Ford could go from this to this. (It turns out that Ford is fine; as an action star, there may be a lot of years on his tires, but the mileage is still good.) 

No, the old fogeys embarrassing themselves are George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. When you're sitting through the damn near three hours of hyperkinetic boredom of, say, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, you think, man, they don't make 'em like Raiders of the Lost Ark anymore, but unfortunately in the 18 years since The Last Crusade, producer Lucas and director Spielberg forgot how they made them too. Crystal Skull combines the worst traits of both moviemakers, in the process undermining the foundation of the Indiana Jones character. 

Lucas himself pinpoints exactly what's wrong with Crystal Skull in this joint interview with Spielberg for Entertainment Weekly. Indiana Jones always has to track down some magical object, the MacGuffin. By definition, it doesn't really matter what the MacGuffin is, just as long as it propels the story forward. This is why Temple of Doom is the weakest in the series; the movie grinds to a halt to explain why those stupid Sankara stones are such a big deal. In contrast, the two best Indiana Jones movies, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, don't bog down in talky exposition; the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail are universally recognized mythic artifacts, giving the movie space to develop Indy's relationship with Marion Ravenwood and Professor Henry Jones, Sr. As Lucas says in the interview, The Last Crusade finally came together after they just decided to go with a generic quest item and write the story around the father/son relationship: ""The story shifted from being about the MacGuffin."" (Emphasis Lucas'.) 

But the MacGuffin is exactly what takes over Crystal Skull. After the standard opening chase scene, much of the next two acts is spent explaining just what the hell this skull is, why it's magnetized, crystalized, kept secret by the government, buried in some catacombs, and why it looks like the missing link to Sam Cassell's ancestors. Basically, the film downshifts into exposition overload; instead of the swift thrills of the rolling boulder in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Skull feels more like you're watching the Black Pearl being hijacked by Davy Jones and why are Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom fighting and who the hell are these crusty sea-zombies and wait why does Geoffrey Rush show up at the end? 

In short, Spielberg Pirates the movie by getting tangled up in plot and losing track of the characters. We come back for sequels for the same reason we see old friends. Overstuffing the plot is like taking a vacation where all you do is sightsee — after a while, you just want to slow down and hang out with your buddies for a while. From the '90s on, almost every non-comic book blockbuster has tried to mimic Spielberg and Lucas's adventure franchises, but they always end up puffing up the CGI and the nonsense plot because their characters weren't very good. Pirates of the Caribbean almost pulled it off — Johnny Depp's uber-swishy Jack Sparrow could climb into the pantheon beside Harrison Ford's deadpan archeologist adventurer — but in those sequels the filmmakers didn't understand that the audience doesn't give a damn about whatever ""myth"" they're trying to make up. Unfortunately, Crystal Skull shows Spielberg and Lucas falling into that same trap.  

According to the interviews, it sounds like Lucas is mostly responsible for this misstep in film's conception, and Spielberg compounds the crime in the execution. The crystal skull has some sort of alien connection (the movie opens in Area 51), which Spielberg can't help but run into the ground. Spielberg told James Lipton that he ""believed in aliens,"" but it goes beyond simply believing that there's other life in the universe: Spielberg believes aliens are around us and contacting us all the time. This belief has enriched the spirituality of many of his films, but here, it just means 15 more minutes of CGI effects tacked on to the climax. This, after much of the first hour is Professor Jones explaining this whole skull/alien thing to his new sidekick like they're trying to crack the Da Vinci Code.  

This is the kind of thing a hacky Spielberg wannabe like Stephen Sommers would do in The Mummy franchise. Adding to the disappointment, Spielberg sets the movie up to be more politically relevant than what he could achieve with the cartoony Nazis of the previous films, but fails to follow through. Here, the Soviets, led by Cate Blanchett (outfitted as if Stalin's S&M call girl), blandly seek control of the world by trying to obtain some kind of superweapon. 

(Spoiler alert to end of paragraph) To Spielberg's credit as a cinematic craftsman, the movie shows why Spielberg is still a master showman: He films a nuclear explosion from within a suburban-style test home in Area 51. The entire town melts in a gust of radiation: mannequins' faces burn off, clapboard houses become dust in a second. There's a lot of metaphorical value here, and Spielberg seems to be making the Obama diplomacy argument: The world can survive Nazis and terrorism, but even Indiana Jones can barely handle the nuclear option. After this brilliant set-up, Spielberg simply drops the whole angle in favor of a mystical alien skull myth that's too incredible even for an Indiana Jones movie. 

This is the fatal miscalculation. Lucas again gets this right in the interview: ""The supernatural part has to be real."" In other words, for an Indiana Jones MacGuffin to work, the object of the quest must be supernatural, yes, but the artifact has to be a ""real"" myth that's so deeply ingrained in our culture that people instantly recognize its significance and already know its backstory. Here, the audience needs to be attuned to the magic powers of the … whatever Indy's chasing — not have Steven Spielberg's alien fetish sold to us. The movie has no room to breathe.  

Which, of course, is exactly what Dr. Jones does when he morphs into Indiana. In the classroom, the Holy Grail is some artifact from ancient people who believed things you can't prove. These beliefs, these myths, have no value to the academic except in how they explain the behavior of the studied people — except when Dr. Jones leaves musty wooden halls of the university and finds out that the Holy Grail really does have healing powers. As Professor Jones teaches to his students, the search for facts is more limited than the search for truth, which can only be discovered … out there. In this way, Indiana Jones inverts the archetype: The library and its ""facts"" is the imaginary world; the realm of myth, born out of human nature, is what's truly real. If Professor Henry Jones, Jr. were to give a lecture on this ""Indiana Jones"" figure, he might say that the swashbuckler is the daydream of an academic, who yearns to cast off the shackles of rigorous scientific inquiry and experience life's deeper mysteries.  

Ford's low-key performance is the best part of Crystal Skull, if only because he's the sole principle who's zeroed in on what makes the character work. Indy's ironic, aloof, endearingly arrogant professorial temperment has always underscored the punchlines, and Ford slips easily back into character after 20 years. Easily the most exciting part of the trailer isn't the promise of kick-ass special effects; it's Harrison Ford's deadpan ""Indy"" responses. ""You're a teacher?!"" ""Part time,"" he smirks, as if he's being cagey about his employment situation with an IRS agent. ""This isn't going to be easy."" ""Not as easy as it used to be,"" he agrees, as if he's directly responding to those Internet reports of wino-ness. The problem, of course, is that screenwriter David Koepp doesn't feed him enough lines, as if he spent all his creative energy cribbing old X-Files episodes to try to make this whole crystal skull thing work.  

On the plus side, the movie livens up considerably with the appearance of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, the hard-drinking love interest from Raiders of the Lost Ark; she and Ford create the same sort detached, we're-arguing-in-front- of-the-bad-guys humor that made The Last Crusade work. Shia LeBeouf as Mutt Williams, the James Dean greaser, is nowhere near as embarrassing as the Long Duk Dong antics of Short Round, and he's actually in-tune to the understated banter of Indy. Spielberg sets up several clever jokes; for example, Dr. Jones and Mutt escape the Russians in a diner by creating an Outsiders-style Greaser/Soc's brawl. But still, the good parts are obscured by the interminable untangling of this crystal skull myth and the bloated CGI-laced finale. No, this one is not on Harrison Ford — his impresarios failed him. You get the sense that if Lucas had his way, he would have turned this into Indiana Jones Episode 4: The Phantom Skull with Harrison Ford measuring Shia LeBeouf's midi-chlorian levels.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2008","  Release Date: May 22 Director: Steven Spielberg Writer: David Koepp, (story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson) Cinematographer: Janusz Kaminski Starring: Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, Shia LaBeouf Studio/Run Time: Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm, 124 mins.   Indiana Jones has neither swashed nor buckled on the big screen in 19 years, but he’s back in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which appropriately takes place 19 years after the last film. It’s now 1957, and Indy has aged along with his fans and, more importantly, the actor who plays him. But, aside from a couple of jokes about his age, you’d hardly know it. He still throws—and takes—more punches than the rest of the world’s archaeologists combined, but surprisingly, Harrison Ford, now 66, looks neither computer generated nor out of place in these fist fights. Whether it’s done with the latest technology or just fancy stunt work, the action in Crystal Skull has an almost antiquated realness, an art that I thought was lost in the embrace of CGI.   The film is fun, but it doesn’t hold a torch to the original. It’s too busy reconnecting severed ties and repeating our favorite bits, but it comes closer to capturing the magic of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) than the other sequels did, and parts of it are more thrilling than anything else in the entire series.   The plot involves an elongated crystal skull that looks like a glass rendering of Ridley Scott’s alien. Naturally, everyone wants it (wouldn’t you?), not because it looks like it’s filled with wads of useful cellophane but because whoever returns the skull to the temple from whence it came gets some sort of unimaginable reward, one that doesn’t seem to be monetary. The Soviets, like the Nazis who pursued the Ark of the Covenant in the first film, want the skull for nefarious purposes. Beyond this outline, the story is a tangle of barbed wire that hardly seems worth the bloody fingers it would take to straighten it, and screenwriter David Koepp doesn’t expect us to. Every once in a while someone sums everything up (“He’s telling us to look in Peru!”), and then the film dissolves to a map and follows a red line to an exotic new locale.   The red line starts at a warehouse in Roswell, New Mexico, dropping Indy into the nuclear age. In wide vistas, the low sun gives every gray cloud a thick orange outline, and the horizontal light makes every man, woman and polished fender seem to radiate with an interior glow. It’s a great look, which is probably why Spielberg and his director of photography, Janusz Kaminski, stick with it even when the film leaves the harsh Southwestern sun and moves to collegiate New England. Our heroes, with glowing hair and brightly lit temples, shine with a light that wouldn’t have been possible in the subterranean Temple of Doom. The Indy films were always best when their famous underground adventures were anchored by light, a lifeline which is either a few steps back or still overhead, streaming through a hole, lighting the staff of Ra, pointing the way from an opening that’s ever in danger of closing. The new film revels in that kind of crystalline vision. Kaminski pokes holes in the jungle canopy to let airy columns flood the subjects and let the action happen in full view. In the film’s centerpiece, a fantastic, absurd, high-speed chase through trees, Spielberg masterfully juggles five or six characters such that we always have a pretty good idea of who is where, even as they leap from vehicle to vehicle. This clarity seems to defy modern-action conventions that demand obscure, confusing visuals, and the result is thrilling.   Also great is Cate Blanchett as a tenacious, helmet-haired, thick-accented villain who makes her foes work for their gains. Shia Lebeouf plays a young tough who becomes Indy’s sidekick, but he stays mostly in the shadow of Dr. Jones, where he should be, providing welcome backup when called upon. And feeding the film’s potent sense of nostalgia is Karen Allen who reprises her role from Raiders, with more grins than booze.   Aside from the sustained invention of the jungle sequences, much of the movie feels like a recreation of something we’ve already seen, like the Vegas version of the Eiffel Tower. Half of the jokes fall flat, many of them dulled by sloppily—and it would seem unnecessarily—dubbed dialogue, and the closing credits appear gracelessly so that the film dribbles away without that big John Williams punch that even George Lucas knows to plug into the end of a Star Wars picture.   The film’s biggest gamble is its finale. Extraterrestrial wonderment has long been Spielberg’s trademark, but Indy’s close encounters risk cheapening a myth that usually has a more Earth-bound scale, just as Spielberg’s skinny aliens risked cheapening Kubrick’s A.I. Of course, the Jones myth already has a precedent for otherworldly objects (the Ark), so why sneer at the appearance of an actual UFO in The Crystal Skull? It’s pure Spielberg, and Lucas gets his own movie references: the film opens with a drag race straight out of American Graffiti, and in the climax, Indy steals Han Solo’s most famous line. ",POSITIVE
"Jun 1, 2008",For action fans it's precious metal with a pedigree.,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2008"," “You ain’t nothing but a hound dog!” Under Elvis’ energetic, era-setting tune, the first moments of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look almost cute. It’s 1957, daddio, and a jalopy full of kids in ponytails and jeans is roaring along a desert road, smiles wide and music loud. When they encounter a U.S. army convoy, all gunning engines and glowers, the class and gender tensions of the song’s lyrics — “Well, you ain’t never caught a rabbit, / And you ain’t no friend of mine!” — are redrawn along lines of age and occupation: the teens are rowdy and joyful, the soldiers are grim and focused.  Very grim and very focused. The jeep turns off the main road while the carefree youngsters ride away, unaware of the terrible danger embodied by this particular convoy. For they are not just any convoy, but a team of undercover Soviets, square-jawed and toting precious cargo. Bullying their inside a Nevada military base, the villains open the trunk and reveal that cargo — one Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), tied up and gagged and still wearing his fedora.  He’s in a tight fix, all right, which means just what you think it means: he finds ingenious, athletic, and incredibly convenient ways to get out of the jam, along the way introducing his chief adversary, the cartoonish Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), with jet-black pageboy and skintight leggings and boots. In search of a mystical, powerful skull, she solicits/forces Indy’s expertise. He resists, she insists, the first action set-piece begins.  This piece establishes high plot stakes and thematic focus. Escaping the Russians, Indy lands in what he guesses to be a small town but turns out to be populated with mannequins: living rooms and kitchens and sidewalks decorated with figures awaiting decimation by an atomic test. The catch is that the test has yet to occur, which lands Indy smack in the middle of a nuclear blast, an oddly appropriate catastrophe to beset the man who has survived all manner of natural disasters. Indy manages to survive the results of the American push for technological superiority ingenuity (“Now I have become death,” someone quotes Oppenheimer, who quoted Milton), while the screen lights up with bright orange devastation, followed by the mushroom cloud that heralds the new age into which Indy has steeped.  Not only is this era nuclear, it is roaringly capitalist, a point driven home when Indy learns an erstwhile colleague has been bought out by the Russians. “You think this is about flags, about uniforms, about lines on a map?” the traitor sneers. “It’s about money!” Though Indy has never been much of a team player or a nationalist himself, he’s not much interested in cash either. He’s dedicated to the pursuit of stuff for the sake of the pursuit, the thrills and the antics, the occasions to display his whip expertise, to elude what seems certain destruction — again and again. Since his first outing 27 years ago, he has shown himself repeatedly to be up for the good fight, the good chase scene, the good stunt, but never much interested in loot per se (he’s an archeologist, not a profiteer). So, when Indy learns that Irina — also known as “Stalin’s fair-haired girl” — means to track down the Crystal Skull of Akator, he’s slightly interested, then even more inclined to agree when he learns that a much admired colleague, Professor Oxley (John Hurt), is involved (and also kidnapped). Still, Indy is quite aware of Irina’s nefarious purpose. As she puts it, the skull is a means to subjugate the world. “We’ll change you, Dr. Jones, all of you, from the inside. We will turn you into us and the best part is, you won’t even know.” the fact that she sees it as a matter of you and us, that she has identified sides and named hers the bad, all-conquering, body-snatching one, makes her a worthy enough opponent for the great Henry Indiana Jones.  His greatness is mentioned more than once during his latest and presumably last adventure. Sometimes rollicking, sometimes sluggish, the movie points repeatedly to the well-known previous exploits of its hero and director. From vehicular chases to old-timey stunts to Indy’s superbly scrunched-up face whenever he has even to think about snakes, the film delivers familiar Jonesian business, then loops in a few extra tricks and gizmos, drawn from Spielberg’s Close Encounters and A.I., Duel and War of the Worlds. In between the running and the jumping, Crystal Skull includes as well the now requisite entanglings of fathers and sons, aliens and ambitions. Lucky for Indy he has help this time, not from the dad he so misses (and showcases in a picture frame on his desk at the university where he teaches classrooms full of eager students), but from the son he didn’t know he had.  That would be Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), introduced as a mid-’50s icon, astride a motorcycle, adorned in black leather jacket and Marlon-Brando-style cocked cap. Brash and impatient, Mutt roars into Indy’s sphere with a story about El Dorado and a map, as well as a way to immerse himself further in Irina’s plot. Neither Indy nor Mutt knows they’re related when they first meet (though you’ve known since the film was conceived), and they spend their buddy time observing their similarities, impressing each other with skills revealed in response to serial crises. They’re linked through Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who remains spunky but mostly irrelevant in this film, except when needed to beam on her man or provide a quick getaway in an all-terrain vehicle she’s commandeered.  It’s disappointing to see Marion cast mostly by the wayside, but not exactly surprising. Neither is it surprising to see the stereotypical menace provided by a slew of tribal warriors (looking rather like extras from Busta Rhymes’ “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” video) or the obligatory vehicular chase/fight. It is a little surprising to see the silliness that leads to the film’s gargantuan climax, a series of antics simultaneously hyper and enervated. From the run-in with flesh-eating ants to Mutt’s Tarzanical tree-swinging (with monkeys) to the Roswell-cover-up-explained plot (by way of “interdimensional beings” and John Hurt speaking “Mayan”), the film is both flailing and petering out, looking for a way to end.  Indy’s indomitable, of course, charismatic and clever. But as he’s surrounded by worn-out emblems and gestures toward a new decade, the cold war and the rise of corporate conformity, he’s also caught up in the very capitalist machinery that he would reject. The future looks inevitable and all “about money!”",NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2008"," While the phrase “I’m getting to old for this” is never invoked verbatim, a few cracks are made by Harrison Ford’s Indy at the expense of his archaeologically-ready bones. Ford, Karen Allen, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, action films with a plot … they’re all showing the signs of age. But the homily at the center of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn’t quite convert anyone because, well, if they’re not outraged by the previously analog series going full-on digital, they are apt to take note of how the tricks of the trade keep its participants and audience young at heart. If the majority are likely to fall more in line with the former attitude, it may be because the blockbuster demographic are still young enough to take their nostalgia (which is to say, the previous generation’s nostalgia) very seriously. Inconveniently for them, everyone else involved in the making of Skull seems wizened enough to admit that their nostalgia for the genre may have been temporarily blinding them to the serial format’s inherent disposability, reckless exposition and camp potential when they were kneeling before the phalanx of archangels back in 1981. They understand how formative exposure can make mountains of molehills. (Exception to the rule: Shia LaBeouf, whose overweening vitality is made to be the setup for the film’s final punchline — you’ll never hear an audience’s horror turn so swiftly to exhausted relief as you will the moment Indy’s trademark fedora changes hands.) Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of Los Alamos, the Cold War and Sputnik will recognize that Spielberg-Lucas have updated their format to reflect the popular tastes of the 1950s. The courtesy might not be quite as warmly extended by those who file Spielberg’s Close Encounters and E.T. under “prehistory.” But, as someone still young and impudent enough to whether this particular hard sell mightn’t be dovetailing off whatever cultural dearth sent Wild Hogs into the zeitgeist last year, I have to admit this is probably the smartest entry in the series. It might be a bit much to suggest that, after three films entirely dependent on the tactility of faith, Indiana Jones enters the Age of Paranoia in reflection of Spielberg’s apparent newfound spiritual relativism, but there’s definite meaning in the parallel set of bookending money shots — the first a low angle shot of Indy walking toward a blooming mushroom cloud, the second a high angle shot of Indy on the edge of a geographical and psychological precipice that holds long enough for Amazonian waters and mental clarity to come flooding back into the void. The matinee idol has been reduced to a gopher, but even gophers can dream paramount. Insanely awesome line. One of those “wish I came up with it.” And you’ve clarified that those bookend shots are less full-on mirror images than diagonal refractions along planes. Great write-up, Eric.",POSITIVE
"May 29, 2008"," It has been closing in on twenty years since our hero, Indy (Harrison Ford), thwarted the diabolical Nazi plot to steal the Ark of the Lost Covenant. It is now 1955 and the Commies have replaced Hitler’s henchmen as the world’s bad guys. The Soviets are searching for a mysterious artifact that will give them world domination and it is up to our hero and a few good friends to save the day in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Nineteen years after his last adventure, the bullwhipping archeological professor is kidnapped by Russian Officer Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") who needs his top secret knowledge to progress her paranormal research. Indy's old colleague Mac (Ray Winstone, ""The Departed,"" ""Fool's Gold"") warns the Russkies 'You don't know him!' and sure enough, Spalko's interference throws together ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" This long awaited followup is perhaps the most highly anticipated movie of the summer, but although it certainly produces the goods it also suffers from one of director Steven Spielberg's most common flaws - not knowing when to quit. Harrison Ford's age was anticipated to be the weak point here but he's more than up to bringing back an older but still spry and wry Indy and the forth installment has been lovingly crafted to resemble the old serial films it was based on (albeit given a 1957 polish), but some of the action sequences go on so long they become repetitive and Indy's reunion with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), which should be the heart of the film, has all the depth of a comic book. Spielberg lets us know right off the bat that we're not in the forties anymore, beginning with a group of teenagers racing down a desert road in a convertible, Elvis's ""Hound Dog"" blaring on the radio. They engage a U.S. military vehicle, with some suspiciously non-American looking soldiers, in a drag race, before that vehicle and its convoy turn off towards a remote Army barracks. Guards are gunned down, a trunk opened and an iconic hat hits the pavement. Indy's ordered to locate a crate of specific dimensions in an iconic warehouse with sliding doors labeled '51.' This leads to some nifty business where Indy employees gunpowder and bullets for their magnetic effects to locate the shrouded corpse of a certain famous alien before a terrifically staged escape sequence that features a glimpse of *the* Ark, an experimental vehicle that jet propels into the desert and an ill-timed entrance into a nuclear test site. If only the rest of the film lived up to its opening. Returning to University, Indy learns he's been put on indefinite leave by Dean Stanforth (Jim Broadbent, ""Moulin Rouge!,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" Denholm Elliot's successor) because of F.B.I. suspicions of collusion with the Commies. Bitter, Indy's about to leave the country when he's stopped by Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, ""Disturbia,"" ""Transformers""), a young man who fashions himself after Marlon Brando in ""The Wild Ones,"" who says his mother, Mary, sent him for help. Seems he's the ward of Indy's old colleague Professor 'Ox' Oxley (John Hurt, ""The Skeleton Key,"" ""V for Vendetta"") who has sent a mysterious missive which may or may not indicate he's lost his mind. This, is, of course, a puzzle pointing towards the titular crystal skull and its kingdom, so after a soda fountain fight staged for its era and a motorcycle chase through the school, Indy and Mutt are off to Peru (signalled with signature plane flying over map, route animated in red). After some typical spider-webby, hidden wall, live skeleton scenarios, the duo run back into the Russians and are brought to meet Ox where Indy also discovers that Mutt's mother Mary is really Marion and that Mutt is, of course, his son. Screenwriter David Koepp (""Jurassic Park,"" ""The War of the Worlds""), working from the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson (""The Terminal,"" ""Rush Hour 3"") hits all the signature marks. There's a beaut of a sequence where Indy and Mutt fight the Russians for possession of the skull straddling vehicles racing through the rain forest and Mutt earns his stripes by getting hung up in vines only to rejoin the fight Tarzan style. He also turns in his switchblade for a fencing sword (Mutt's bullwhip? The film's final sequence literally passes the hat.) But there's also the bit where Marion drives their WWII amphibious truck duck over a cliff and they survive not one, but three massive waterfalls with nary a scratch nor any real feeling of danger. The final adventure sequence is well staged with some nice special effects and homage to ""Raiders"" end, but the film's ending is all wrong, the final capper to the Indy-Marion reunion that's played too broadly, in part due to an over-caffeinated performance from Allen. Ford, on the other hand, is terrific, every bit the Indy of yore. He gets off more than his share of crackling line readings (I just about spit with his retort to Spalko's request to name her origin). Blanchett is also terrific as the film's villainess, a femme fatale in a Louise Brooks bob whose every eyelash is lovingly lighted by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""The Terminal,"" ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly""). Also good is Spielberg protege LaBeouf, a nice rebellious foil for Harrison who obviously has more than a bit of dear old dad in his genes. Even so, as likable as the lad is in the role, I'd no more look forward to a continuation of the series centered on Mutt than I'd want a Henry Jones Sr./Sean Connery spinoff. Broadbent provides warm collegial support, but both Winstone and Hurt are saddled with pretty stock characters. The best thing about this forth installment is its emphasis on education. There's a running joke about Mutt's having dropped out of school which Indy supports until he learns he's the lad's father and it turns out that the Mayan word for 'Gold' has another, richer meaning. In short, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" may not be the film that ""Ark"" was, but its (few) disappointments are overridden by the sheer joy of seeing Indy in action once again. It may have been less than 20 years for Indy but it is 27 years for us since we were first roused by John Williams now famous score and the action-packed antics of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., bullwhip and revolver in hand. Is the world ready for an older, though not much gentler, Indiana, as he sets out to stop the nefarious Commie plot and restore the titular object to its rightful place? It sure is! Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, George Lucas and all pony up to the bar once again with a new Indy adventure that pushes all the appropriate buttons and delivers all the elements that made us love the first film (but not so much “IJ 2&3”). Just like the first, action is the key in this fourth installment of the lucrative franchise with a tremendously complex and thrilling chase through the Amazon jungles as the film’s set piece. Homage, such as the expected snake, is well paid to “Indy 1.” Jonesd is joined by a whole bunch of new faces to the series and one from the original. Karen Allen returns as tough and resourceful Marion Ravenwood whom Henry has not seen for nearly two decades. This time, she has some information that she has kept from Indy all these years ­ he’s a daddy. Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is, like his mom, tough, resourceful and is skilled with using a switchblade. Together, they must thwart Russian Dr. Irana Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and her heavily armed followers as they seek the secret of the fabulous crystal skull that could give the baddies unlimited power. Wry humor, kitchy dialogue, fast-paced action, seamless special F/X, solid acting and homage to its original are all good reasons to see “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”. I rate it the best of the sequels ­ kind of like “Rocky Balboa.""",POSITIVE

help that Cate Blanchett doesn't sell the fearsome villain role. She's not fearsome, but it's not all her fault  the part is thinly written. All of this we learn in the first fifteen minutes. Filmmakers chose to create action in the genre of the amusement park ride. It's kind of fun, but we know there's no real danger. Hence, the film never has an edge (save that hotrod scene).
 
Adults won't be blown away, but I honestly think this is a better kid's film than Narnia
. The action isn't that scary, there's very little blood, we know the dangers aren't real  simply safe action. And it glorifies teachers. It glorifies learning and real word applications of school knowledge.
 
The story itself isn't all that special; it's the adventure, the fun, and the smug humor that keeps Crystal Skull charming despite its short comings.

"May 28, 2008"," As someone who never really cared all that much for the Indiana Jones movies—apart from Kate Capshaw singing “Anything Goes” in Chinese in the second one—I can’t say I’m surprised that I was far from overwhelmed by this late-in-the-day fourth installment. (Hey, now it’s a tetralogy—just like Wagner’s Ring cycle, but with CGI prairie dog action!) I am, however, surprised at the expressions of disappointment—and even outright anger—I’m hearing from a lot of fans. (Not all, mind you. There’s someone running around on Rotten Tomatoes attacking every negative review on the basis of, “It’s Indiana Jones…….shut the &^%$#@! up!” And people wonder why fanboys have a bad name.) While I agree that turning the thing into a kind of Close Encounters of the Indy Kind was a truly horrible idea, I thought that, overall, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at least deserved an “It’s OK” assessment. But I think it’s fair to say that “It’s OK” really isn’t good enough for $125 million or so worth of movie coming from the two aging wunderkinder of the blockbuster mindset, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  A lot of the negativity seems to be directed at Lucas and his fondness for CGI effects, but let’s be honest here—this movie plays like a Spielberg checklist. From the cute animal antics to the dysfunctional family schtick (Spielberg’s the guy who turned War of the Worlds into a domestic bonding drama) to the sci-fi trappings (completely unlike Lucas’ space operas), this is Spielberg country. However, the clunky storyline, which thinks it’s surprising you at every turn when it isn’t, is Lucas-like in the extreme, while the 1957 setting is edging into American Graffiti (1973) territory. But come on, both Spielberg and Lucas are fascinated to the point of obsession with their respective childhoods. In the end, it’s probably a wash as concerns which of the two pop culture auterists is to blame or praise. Crystal Skull accomplishes the unthinkable by both expecting too much of its audience and simultaneously insulting their intelligence. It asks viewers to grasp the idea that duplicating the look of cheesy 1950s-‘60s process work is deliberately meant as homage to films from that era and not merely bad effects work. And it does this without stopping to realize that a lot of their viewership consider Raiders from 1981 a really old film, and have little knowledge of or interest in “antiquities” from a period as remote as the ‘50s.  Then the filmmakers turn around, introduce the viewers to plainly Russian bad guys and insist that Indy say “Russians!” just in case anyone didn’t get it. Worse, the scene is set at Area 51 and the object of the Russians’ interest is clearly a vacuum-packed alien (they show us the damned thing!)—but they assume the viewer can’t guess where this is all going. Even if the audience doesn’t feel talked down to, they’re apt to wonder just how dumb Indy must be to not figure out what’s going on. This runs through the whole film. The viewer knows what Indy’s gotten himself into in that model suburban neighborhood before he does. It’s pretty obvious just who “Mutt” Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is from the onset. And on and on. Indy is surprised on every occasion. Moving the story to the 1950s was essential to explain Harrison Ford’s age, but it’s also where the film starts to go wrong. The earlier films tried to recreate the feeling of a 1930s-‘40s serial, which gave them a template that’s missing here. The last-gasp serials of the 1950s were, to put it kindly, not very good, even by the none too exacting standards of the serial film. It’s perhaps not coincidental that Crystal Skull takes place a year after even the indefatigable Sam Katzman called it a day as concerned knocking out serial films. The simple criminal mastermind and a world stage with clearly identifiable bad guys didn’t work so well in the Cold War days. This plagued the later serials and it plagues Crystal Skull.  Injecting a note of anti-McCarthyism is nice liberal lip-service, certainly germane to the era, and probably sincerely felt by Messrs. Spielberg and Lucas. Indy being unreasonably blacklisted as a commie and losing his teaching position is workable, but it’s a plot device that never plays out, especially since Indy returns from his adventures with no kind of proof of his innocence. The matter is just dropped and his name is mysteriously cleared. As a stand against 1950s red-scare witchhunting, it’s remarkably weak tea. The hoke value is remarkably high, but that’s not the real problem, since that’s a staple of the series. The flurry of monkeys is pretty cool simian-value stuff, but Shia LaBeouf turning Tarzan is just silly. The crystal skull itself is plain awful. It looks for all the world like a bad plastic model with crumpled cellophane at the center. The action sequences try too hard and are often risible. Just who are these guards of the “Kingdom” and do they simply loiter inside those plastered-over columns on the off-chance that someone will happen by? Who plasters them into the columns anyway? Why does Spielberg end the film on the most boring image imaginable? Shouldn’t the final shot of such a film be iconic? What do we get? A dull shot of a remarkably sterile empty church? What? In the end, if you’re willing to go with it, Crystal Skull can be an amusing couple of hours, even if it’s hardly the “event” it ought to have been. More, it’s possible to look at the way Spielberg puts scenes together, and realize you’re looking at the work of a true craftsman who understands filmmaking. At the same time, it’s impossible not to realize that this craftsmanship is at the service of a screenplay that doesn’t deserve it. Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and scary images.

Thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion. Your score is kinder than your words, which is to say it’s a similar view to mine.  I had less issue with the alien plot and more with the over-the-top (even by Indy standards) “superheoic” action. My score is, I think, fair. I can’t say this is actually a bad picture, just an underwhelming one. I’m interested to see someone who doesn’t have an issue with the aliens, since that’s been the no. 1 complaint I’ve encountered. I think these stories are less about the plot details, as I find aliens about as hokey and out there as non-existent religious artifacts, ancient knights guarding tombs, and arks that make people’s faces melt and heads explode. To me the problem lies in the over-the-top elements which make certain scenes here more akin to a Raimi Spider-Man film than Indiana Jones.  Because when these films are nothing else, they’re great Chaplin & Keaton-esque physical adventures.  But the cartoonish nature of the newest film makes a parody of even that already-extreme level of action-adventure. It’s a nod to the audience that even he doesn’t believe what just happened and it makes the scene charming and winky, rather than just accepted that no one would even bat an eye at such a thing, which is part of the problem throughout this film. In previous Indy films they dealt with The Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant, so why not little green men?  In Indy world it’s certainly plausible. I didn’t mind the alien theme at all.  Thought it was pretty interesting.  However, the film lacked the emotional resonance and “soul” the other 3 possesed.  Felt a little rushed and didn’t seem like the characters were in any real danger.  Overall it was entertaining and just great to have Indy back!  i give it a B. I’d surely rank it last amongst the four.  Yes, even behind Temple Of Doom, which while also over the top and silly, felt like an Indy film more than Crystal Skull. The ants and the monkeys were really fake looking to me.  Could these effects have been done without CGI?  Probably.  But I think the ease with which they are now rendered can stop the director from asking whether or not they really pay off.  I think having to train a bunch of real Macaques or golden tamarins might have led to a lot of second thought on that gag.  It’s kind of like genetic engineering.  We’re spending a lot of time thinking about what CAN be done, and not enough thinking about whether or not it SHOULD be done. I do rather like Mr. Sunday’s idea for owning up to the preposterous nature of it all. My biggest qualm is that it might have made it a little too jokey. It slightly reminds me of Bob Hope in Son of Paleface telling a couple of reappearing vultures, “Beat it or you’re gonna make the whole thing unbelievable.” and remember something, these films aren’t made for smart ass critics. They’re for kids and teens. The 10 year old two seats from mine could barely contain his excitement and when I watched that chase through the Amazon jungle, I could barely contain my happiness either. I’ll up you one because I’ve never considered Raiders a classic. I still don’t. It’s a pop culture milestone of some sort, but that doesn’t make it a great film. That’s pretty hard to swallow when you’re talking about a movie that’s riding heavily on nostalgia for something started 27 years ago that hasn’t been revisited for 19 years in terms of a new movie. And in this instance, the critics have tended to be more enthusiastic about the film than the public at large. But instead we’ve no time to appreciate their peril or react to it (hey look, a water fall…woosh!) and that happens three times, no less. It’s visually cool with some nice wide shots, but not viscerally compelling because there’s no time spent fearing it. An excellent point. This is also another instance of where it’s too easy for the viewer to be ahead of the characters. Weren’t you completely expecting the next two waterfalls based on the gibberish John Hurt’s character had been spouting? Good points….OK, Raiders in not a “classic” among all films, but it is a milestone for modern adventure movies. It’s a classic for all the amazing stuntwork that went into it.
Now, all we get is CGI bullets and CGI fistfights :(
Think about all the movies that have tried and failed to be the next “Indiana Jones” or the original “Star Wars”.  And as for predictability,….yes, I guessed every single twist ahead of time….as a viewer I sometimes felt smarter than Jones….how he fell for Mac’s bull a third time is hard to swallow. Apparently, Lucas and co. just followed their formula to a tee and if you like that formula, you’ll dig the film. If not, then this old fashioned kind of story is not for you. I think having to train a bunch of real Macaques or golden tamarins might have led to a lot of second thought on that gag. An excellent point that I missed earlier. The odd thing is that the night before Crystal Skull I ran the monkey stampede climax of William Thiele’s The Jungle Princess (1936) for Mr. Souther — in part to demonstrate my pet theory that any film ever made could benefit from a climax involving stampeding simians — and that silly old Dorothy Lamour vehicle (her first movie) actually does use real monkeys. It uses lots of real — and apparently pretty aggravated — monkeys. They are ever so much more satisfying than the computer-generated variety. See also: Charlie Chaplin beset by a bunch of monkeys while walking the tightwire in The Circus (1928). Both cases suggest that CGI is simply laziness. There probably are better adventure films post-Indy and better sci-fi since Star Wars, but I can’t think of anything really comparable, because there’s a particular kind of regression at work with both. Both are essentially serial films with bigger budgets and (sometimes) better acting. Has anybody else actually made that attempt? If they have, I’m forgetting who they were and what they made.  I think part of my problem with the whole thing — the whole Indiana Jones and Star Wars business, not this film specifically — is that they’re not truly old-fashioned in the way a Flash Gordon serial is. Instead, they’re somebody’s post-modern idea of old-fashioned. Given the option of watching Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars (1938) or Star Wars, I’ll opt for Flash Gordon. Its naievete and quaintness is real, not carefully calculated. But in the end, I’d probably rather watch Bergman’s Persona than either, if it came right down to it. Then again, being the mass of contradictions that most film lovers are, I might very well opt for one of those “embarassing” titles I mentioned in last week’s Screening Room. Bottom line for me, though, is probably that I own copies of Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars, Persona and all but one of those “embarassing” titles, while I’ve never felt any desire to own a Star Wars or Indiana Jones title. That’s not really a quality judgment so much as it’s a simple statement that I don’t find them very interesting. Now, how much of that is born of a degree of resentment over what the whole blockbuster mentality did to filmmaking overall (sorry, but filmmaking from about 1964 through 1975 with the advent of Jaws was just a lot more adventurous) is a point to consider. The movie-goers, in the packed theater I viewed this at, were lethargic at the end of the movie and waiting for it to end…Me too. You and they must not be alone. On Friday analysts were all in agreement that Crystal Skull could not be dislodged by Sex and the City for box office supremacy this weekend. According to Box Office Mojo earlier this afternoon, Skull is projeted to end up with an additional $46 million for the weekend, which Sex is likely to end up with $55.7 million. Now, I’m not saying this is a good thing. I’m not the one reviewing Sex and the City, but I did see it and it made me realize what a fine movie Crystal Skull was on a relative basis. Still, I think it’s funny when the analysts are wrong. Plus, it strengthens their character. No one anticipated the manner in which SEX evidently “speaks” to female moviegoers. I don’t think it’s early box-office success is so much indicative of the movie per se, as it is what it represents. That is, throughout the course of the show the men came & went, but the bond between these four central female characters remained constant. Female audiences are making it their “own” moviegoing experience.  This is a somewhat unique event, because it’s not just a so-called “Chick-Flick”. To call it that is unfairly dismissive. This time around it’s something different. To my astonishment, women identify with these characters–without much regard for the staggering shallowness of their behavior. The only characters that I can think of from recent vintage that were on this shallow a level are the SEINFELD gang. Though, that was obviously by design–“No Hugging & No Learning”–and central to the running schtick. Not sure here that’s the case.  And yet because its audience is about 85% female, it deserves that accolade more than any romantic comedy the term’s ever been applied to. Actually, I think dismissing it as a chick-flick might be a kindness. Did not My Big Fat Greek Wedding accomplish much the same sort of thing?  It took longer to build (since it didn’t have the benefit of being a hit TV show) and will SURELY have longer theater legs than Sex will likely have (I see significant drops here the next couple weeks), but that was a movie experience also made up of mostly female viewers, no? Sorry to be a stickler (what can I say, I’m an editor), but I think the phrase you’re looking for is “Jumped the shark,” which refers to the bizarre [i]Happy Days[/i] episode where Fonzie literally water-ski jumps over a shark in what appeared to be an attempt to boost ratings. I don’t think the two are really comparable. At least, I don’t remember Greek Wedding being any more heavily skewed in terms of viewership of women than any standard romantic comedy fare. I remember that locally it was jump-started by the distributor setting up a special free showing for the local Greek church. (I doubt that was just an Asheville approach.) And like a lot of movies of a similar genre — Bridget Jones’s Diary is a much better movie that comes to mind that fits — a huge portion of the box office that kept it going consisted of women going to weekday matinees. I think the surprise here lies in a collection of unusual factors starting with the sharp divide in gender, but also including the R rating (Greek Wedding was a mere PG, by the way) and the simple fact that it dethroned the supposedly unassailable Crystal Skull. Of course, the R rating may have helped figures slightly, since R rated films traditionally do better at night when ticket prices are higher (I don’t know if anyone has tabulated money vs. actual attendance). It’s also necessary to factor in the rather shrill and shallow tone of Sex and the City, making it a very different proposition than Greek Wedding (not that Greek Wedding wasn’t shallow; it just didn’t advertise the fact). The legs question is an interesting one. I’ll be surprised if there’s not a sharp drop off almost at once — not that Kung Fu Panda or You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (this week’s releases) are in anything like the same target audience, nor for that matter are the following week’s, The Incredible Hulk and The Happening. Greek Wedding had an advantage by being pushed out in limited release in the spring where it wasn’t trampled in the rush of summer movies. Also, that limited release approach worked to build an audience (though that’s a type of release approach that’s worked less and less well in recent years). All this will doubtless get more attention when Justin’s review (I saw it with him, but I didn’t review the film apart from some comments on the radio last Friday) of Sex comes out tomorrow. “While I agree that turning the thing into a kind of Close Encounters of the Indy Kind was a truly horrible idea, I thought that, overall, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at least deserved an ‘It’s OK’ assessment.” That’s not exactly panning it. It strikes me as being about right for 3 1/2 stars. I’m sorry it doesn’t satisfy you, but then you seem strangely compelled to find fault whenever you think you can. It’s simple arithmetic–With a 5-Star system a
3.5 is the equivalent of about a C+/B-. With the level of talent–and limitless budget at their disposal–a C+/B- is deserving of a panning. It’s simple arithmetic–With a 5-Star system a
3.5 is the equivalent of about a C+/B-. With the level of talent–and limitless budget at their disposal–a C+/B- is deserving of a panning. That’s kind of the way I look at it when doing the five star approach — 3.5 is not approaching rave status or even a recommendation. It merely means it’s not without some merit and interest. In other words, it’s okay, but not exactly world-class stuff. I don’t really envision anyone seeing a 3.5 and thinking, “Boy, he really liked this one, it must be good.”",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2008"," In 1989, when Sean Connery showed up in the third Indiana Jones movie, as Indiana’s father, Henry Jones, he was no longer a young man. But Connery, then fifty-nine, had relaxed beautifully into middle age. Playing alongside Harrison Ford’s Indy, he was crotchety yet formidable. The father was a medievalist, the son an archeologist, and both were obsessed with lost treasures of unimaginable worth and extraordinary powers, and Connery turned a rivalry with the younger actor into high-style mischief. Nineteen years later, in the fourth movie in the series, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” Ford, now sixty-five, is still playing Indy, but he can’t be described as a man relaxing into middle age. He’s in great shape physically, but he doesn’t seem happy. He’s tense and glaring, and he speaks his lines with more emphasis than is necessary, like a drunk who wants to appear sober. In the earlier movies, Indy was often surly, but his scowl turned into a rakish smile—he dared you to think he was afraid to do something, and then, before you had quite registered the dare, he raced away and did it. Ford combined swagger with charm, and he was quick; he moved as if he had steel springs in his legs. He rolls and jumps well enough in “Crystal Skull,” but his hostile unease in some of the dialogue passages is a real killjoy. And it doesn’t help that the screenwriter, David Koepp, who also worked with Steven Spielberg—the director of all the Indiana Jones movies—on the “Jurassic Park” series and “War of the Worlds,” isn’t good at the kind of arrogant banter that was so large a part of the earlier films. In “Crystal Skull,” Indy keeps his whip mostly furled, and his words don’t snap, either. On balance, it was a mistake for Spielberg and George Lucas (who dreamed up the characters, co-wrote the stories, and produced the series) to revive “Indiana Jones” after so many years. “Crystal Skull” isn’t bad—there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances—but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. Stretches of this picture are flat, fussy, and dull. Trying to regain the old rapture, you have to grasp at the few scenes that work—most of them at the beginning. The first three films were set in the nineteen-thirties and drew on Art Deco styling in clothes, cars, and aircraft. Spielberg has a taste for sleek modernism, enhanced by a boy’s-illustrated-book notion of cool—everything was a little more streamlined and snazzy than life. “Crystal Skull” is set in the nineteen-fifties, and it begins, in Nevada, with the same quintessence of period style. As kids hot-rod across military sites with Elvis on the radio, Spielberg catches the era’s uneasy mixture of blandness, latent revolt, and apocalypse, the jukebox-and-pompadour youth culture side by side with nuclear fears. There is a brilliant, unnervingly funny sequence in which Indy, after escaping some K.G.B. agents (they were trying to steal some of his earlier finds, hoping to use their powers to control America), wanders into a small town with neat wooden houses and square, close-cropped lawns adorned with smiling mannequins of typical American families. Indy enters a house, where “The Howdy Doody Show” blares from a TV. Suddenly, he hears a loudspeaker announce a countdown and realizes that he’s about to be nuked in a test blast. In a later sequence, young Shia LaBeouf makes his entrance wearing a black leather jacket and riding a motorcycle—like Marlon Brando in “The Wild One.” He’s a snarling kid named Mutt, with a thick, frequently combed wave of hair; he calls Indy “Teach,” and he needs a father—like James Dean in “Rebel Without a Cause.” The K.G.B. agent Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett, takes off from Lotte Lenya’s slit-eyed Commie menace in “From Russia with Love.” Blanchett wears a full-body flight suit in Soviet gray—drabness turned into fashion by her trim figure—and a rapier hangs from her waist. She enunciates like crazy in Russian-accented English and tilts her cheekbones toward the camera. As is often the case with this actress, she’s the best thing in the picture. One tries hard not to be distracted from any available pleasure by the plot—thickly woven gibberish about the lost Amazonian city of Akator (formerly known as El Dorado), a crystal skull that has been taken from a temple, and a brain-fried archeologist nicknamed Ox (a quavering John Hurt, who is no ox). Sure enough, after a while the movie settles happily into one of those long chases which Spielberg does better than anyone else. The good guys hurtle down a jungle road in an open truck, while Blanchett and her henchmen follow in another truck on a parallel road. The two sides shoot at each other, various people jump, or are flung back and forth, like volleyballs, between the vehicles, and LaBeouf, after a sword fight and a karate match with Blanchett, winds up straddling the trucks and receiving many blows to the crotch from passing branches, before grabbing onto a vine and swinging his way through the jungle. The sequence ends with Indy and friends going over a cliff in their truck. As they fall, they hit a tree sticking out from the cliff wall, which bends slowly downward, like a giant sapling, and deposits them gently in a river below, where the truck turns into a pontoon boat. In a sequence like that, with wild improbabilities linked by speed and rhythm, Spielberg re-creates the spirit of Buster Keaton’s most elaborately synchronized gags, but on a much grander scale. (The Spielberg chase has been the subject of an hommage on TV’s “Family Guy,” in which Peter Griffin fights a giant chicken on many moving vehicles.) The first Indiana Jones movie, “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), had a romping confidence that was electrifying. It was not just an action-adventure movie; it was a spoof of an action-adventure movie, an exuberant parody of the kind of schlock shown at weekend matinées in the fifties—movies about cursed tombs and strange rites and “natives” chanting mumbo-jumbo in studio jungles, or waving swords amid the bazaars of some back-lot Middle East. The stolid hero would gently approach the “love interest,” a scientist’s daughter. In “Raiders,” Karen Allen was the love interest, and, flirting and scrapping with Ford, she had a huge smile and a directly sexual way about her that smashed old cautions. The pattern was set with that film and it varied little in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” (1984) and “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989). At the center of the movies was a search for a buried sacred object (an ark, a stone, a grail) from the ancient world. To prevent the villains from getting hold of it (Nazis in crisp uniforms appeared in two of the pictures; a wild-eyed, blood-sacrificial Thuggee cult in the third), Indy set off from his quiet classroom for some exotic, sun-drenched place, where he would rout thirty excitable men in turbans by using just his fists, a whip, and a revolver. A hard-fighting woman joined his quest, only to prove more difficult to handle than the bad guys. To reach the tomb of the sanctified object, he entered filthy pits and mucky tunnels lined with snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, and rats. He had to be spiritually pure, as well as physically adroit, to get past the swords, spikes, and moving walls that booby-trapped the entrance to the inner chamber. Yet Indy never wanted the sacred object for himself (the relics the K.G.B. were after had been laid away in a warehouse); he usually returned it to its rightful owner or just left it in place. The search was everything; renunciation of the spoils was his purity. As he left the chamber, it collapsed around him, but he escaped.

"May 27, 2008"," Has there ever been a TV series more polarizing than Sex and the City? It polarized me: First it drove me crazy (like itching powder), now I’m madly in love with it. It’s hard to feel halfway about these women and their unabashed materialism, overprivilege, and self-indulgence, their overdependence on and objectification of men. But what a hoot it is to see babes, for once, doing the objectifying—and talking dirty and sleeping around and measuring their fantasies against the sobering truth of male emotional insufficiency. If the core friendship of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte is the biggest fantasy of all—they complement one another perfectly; they’re never too competitive—it’s a moving design for living: existential haute couture. The movie, which reunites the whole cast, even if the other actresses aren’t palsy-walsy with Kim Cattrall, has the delish/insufferable mixture about right. (It wouldn’t be SATC if it weren’t a little annoying.) Sex and the City: The Motion Picture (not the actual title) is a joyful wallow. And it’s more: In this summer of do-overs (The Incredible Hulk, a new Batman versus a new Joker), it’s what the series finale should have been. For one last time, the relationship columnist–cum (no pun intended)–anthropologist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) tests the fairy-tale trappings of modern romance—turns them inside out, pulls at the loose threads, and wrings the tears that have saturated them into iridescent cocktails. (God, that’s terrible. I have to work on my Bradshaw-esque relationship musings.) It’s not that the writer-director, Michael Patrick King, breaks new ground; it’s that these women are in their fifth decade, and age is a more insistent subtext. The time for do-overs is almost up. The movie opens three-plus years after the series finale, and in case you missed that (or the whole show), Carrie helpfully brings you up to date over the opening credits. Morose Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) lives in (shudder) Brooklyn with her mousy husband (David Eigenberg). Chipper Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and hubby Harry (Evan Handler) have adopted a Chinese toddler, whose presence makes it somewhat more difficult to babble openly about cunnilingus. Wilting from monogamy, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is living on the beach in California with her actor-client-and-hunka-burnin’-love Smith (Jason Lewis)—which reduces Cattrall’s face-to-face encounters with her co-stars by about a third. Carrie, of course, has finally settled into the arms of the rich and powerful Mr. Big (Chris Noth) in happily-ever-after-land and can now afford even more designer clothes and shoes. But it’s not quite enough. They’re not formally hitched. What if he dumps her and she has to auction off her jewelry? (This comes to her at the auction of a spurned wife’s jewelry.) Maybe, she says to Big, they should tie the knot. “I wouldn’t mind being married to you,” he replies, bloodlessly. By the way: Is Chris Noth aging into Eddie Munster? I shall not spoil what follows, but the wedding sequence (about midway through) is a heart-stopper—a mirthless farce in which cell phones and limos function as agents of the unconscious. It’s a chance to watch Parker pull out the acting stops, and she’s spectacularly good: The neediness that makes her one of our giddiest comediennes is also a kind of black hole. Parker has come in for some monstrous derision of late—and I suppose it’s understandable, given that she’s pushed on billboards as the personification of kitty-cat sultriness. But you can sense the fragility beneath the poses. She’s always the little girl dressing up, wriggling from one outfit to the next, elated for a bit but apt to wither in the face of rejection or self-doubt. There are plenty of reasons to resent Carrie’s incessant hunger for designer anything, but how can you resent Parker’s fleeting enchantment? It’s what anchors the show. Those outfits, by the way, are lulus—designers must have fallen all over themselves to get their stuff into this movie. A woman sitting next to me only took notes on the clothes; behind me came regular gasps of pleasure and (occasionally) horror. In one of the most sublime scenes, Carrie cleans out her closet (in preparation for a move) and models her dated getups for Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha. The friends have placards: TAKE and TRASH. It brought a tear to my eye when Carrie emerged in the little tutu from the show’s credit sequence. Oh, take take take! Sex and the City will make queeny fashion enthusiasts even of those of us whose chief association with the word runway is “airplane.” Camp, of course, is central to the appeal, especially when Cattrall is onscreen—her insouciant vulgarity is indispensable. (I don’t care what she’s like off-camera.) But the high-spirited bitchery doesn’t drown out the softer, more realistic notes. Nixon’s prickly ambivalence over her marriage (and the sacrifices it demands) makes for a bleak subplot. She’s going a little crazy—she’s the movie’s sole representative of repression—and her bitterness has consequences for Carrie. The balance between dark and light often tips to the dark—which makes Kristin Davis’s old-fashioned ditzy double-takes all the more essential. (She’s such a cutie.) I haven’t carped about the smooth-FM music or the fact that the hetero men (Mr. Big semi-excepted) are nonentities. But Sex and the City’s nod to the nonwhite is scary. Jennifer Hudson plays Carrie’s personal assistant, and Oh my God, it’s Hattie McDaniel for the new millennium: Instead of cleaning Carrie’s house, she cleans up her computer files (although she does help declutter the apartment, too). She admires her mistress in those beautiful outfits. And check out that smile when you give her a Louis Vuitton handbag! Please, Sex and the City, do not pretend you exist in the real multiracial world. White will always be your new black. No mainstream filmmaker since Orson Welles can touch Steven Spielberg when it comes to camera movement and composition—or, more precisely, to composition that gets more vivid as the camera moves. You see that in an early shot in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones is held at gunpoint by murderous Soviet soldiers led by Cate Blanchett as an icy paranormal research scientist named Irina Spalko. They’re in a top-secret warehouse, where Spalko orders Indy to locate something precious. The shot is of Indy climbing crates: He’s in the foreground as the camera tracks back and up, and as it does the space opens up behind him; we see Spalko and the soldiers while the warehouse, with its obstacle course of boxes, spreads out in the background. That’s it: Nothing flashy, but it tells you, simply and elegantly, everything you need to know about the setting, the threat, the variables in play. It’s the work of a man with film storytelling in his blood. What a bummer when the story he has to tell is a cosmic nothing. But what a lackluster quest awaits the aging adventurer and his skeptical young foil. In the warehouse, Indy gets the drop on Spalko and her men, but then they get the drop on him. But then he gets away. But then the Commies have him trapped. But then he gets away but then gets captured but then escapes but then Irina shows up when he’s sure he has lost her. “We meet again, Dr. Jones.” No kidding. The action is the movie’s raison d’être, of course, but the setups are wittier than the payoffs. A bit in which Indy sinks into a sandpit and in lieu of a vine Mutt throws a snake (Indy’s phobia) has too many beats—it’s laborious. The good guys’ raft plunges over three progressively more epic waterfalls: riotously scary in prospect but with nothing at the bottom but splashing. Only a sequence involving ravenous army ants has the requisite punch, and that’s because it’s gross-out horror. (The eponymous skull, though, is a letdown: In design, it cannibalizes Alien’s H. R. Giger; in execution it looks like Lucite filled with bubble wrap.) Harrison Ford used to lighten his clenched persona with goofy shrugs that said, “I can only go so far with this hero stuff.” But the years have dried him out; he seems like a peevish movie star who’s too self-centered to interact. When he’s supposed to realize that Marion is the love of his life, he looks as if he’s gritting his teeth to kiss her. Blanchett—a great art object, her satin skin taut over those Asiatic cheekbones—hits the same note with diminishing returns. How many variations are there of “We meet again, Dr. Jones”? Crystal Skull is more energized than the limp Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which was Spielberg’s attempt to atone for making Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom too intense, too scary, too good. (It brought outcries from bluestocking critics and ushered in the PG-13 rating.) But even with Spielberg’s pet absent-father-and-son theme, the new movie is impersonal—he has evolved beyond cartoon filmmaking. The computer-generated imagery removes the intangible elements of gravity and depth of field we see in that early warehouse sequence, and the state-of-the-art effects have a way of making the ages of the actors more, not less apparent. As this elderly crew (only LaBeouf is under 56) rushes down a stone staircase to escape a CGI rock slide, you can almost hear their joints creaking. Or is that Spielberg, impatiently drumming his fingers? Tom Kalin’s Savage Grace recounts the (true) cautionary tale of Barbara Daly Baekeland (Julianne Moore), a not too worldly but socially ambitious beauty whose abandonment by her husband (Stephen Dillane), dwindling finances, and—here’s the singular note—homophobia coalesced into one bad trip for her son, Tony (Eddie Redmayne). Always overmothered, the unambiguously gay young man became the repository of Barbara’s hunger for control. Why, she would convert him to nondeviant sexuality if she had to sidle into his lap and stick his willy into herself.  Kalin lays this out with a touch of Madame Tussauds—the film is archly posed, with a score (by Fernando Velázquez) that’s rich in portentous strings. (Is there a theremin in there? Probably my imagination.) But Howard A. Rodman’s script has a lot of juice, and the rhythms are so pregnant that the air vibrates with something, even if you’re not sure what. Moore is virtuosic when it comes to chewing the scenery while standing stock-still—perfect for the going-to-seed failed movie actress Barbara. Dillane—whose Leonard Woolf was the best thing in The Hours—is infectiously uncomfortable: You don’t entirely blame him for bolting. Redmayne is … queer, in the old sense: physically detached, with only his bulgy eyes signaling his inner panic. In its frigid way, Savage Grace is potent: It makes incest a state of mind. BACKSTORYThis spring, Harrison Ford was elected to the board of directors of the Archaeological Institute of America, a group with some 250,000 members, whose president offered this explanation: “Harrison Ford has played a significant role in stimulating the public’s interest in archaeological exploration.” Not everyone was so thrilled—one dubious anthropologist at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa (dissertation topic: “mining and indigenous people in highlands Papua New Guinea”) posted the following comment: “My ever-tenuous grasp of the line between fantasy and reality seems to be slipping away again.” Sex and the City

"May 27, 2008","It's not fair to ask the film to appeal to your somber, jaded adult sensitivities when the reason you fell in love with Indiana Jones in the first place was because it was the stuff of boyhood daydreams.",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2008"," It’s 1957 and Indiana Jones (Ford) has been busy since we last saw him, all the way back in 1938.  Among other things, he appears to have fallen in with the wrong crowd (again), somehow getting himself and his partner, Mac (Winstone), kidnapped by a gang of Soviets led by a would-be psychic/doctor Spalko (Blanchett).  The bad guys want Indy to help them locate something that he helped recover from a crash site in Roswell some time before.  They think that this is the key to figuring out…yes, you guessed it…a super-weapon which will help them rule the world.  Moohoohahaha. [ad#longpost]Let me take a moment to explain where I came from to get to this film.  The original Raiders is a classic.  It’s exactly what Lucas and Spielberg set out to make: an homage to vintage serial heroes.  It’s fun.  It’s timeless.  And its rewatch value is through the freaking roof.  The prequel, Temple of Doom, I recently realized that I didn’t care for it as much.  Rewatching it when the boxed set came out on DVD, I found myself turned off by its darker sequences.  I know that sounds weird: me, getting turned off by darker sequences.  But I thought they were too dark for an Indiana Jones film, if that makes sense.  Last Crusade I was never crazy about, despite enjoying Sean Connery. So when it comes to the Indy Trilogy, to me it’s all about the first film, because that’s the nearest and dearest to my heart.  Also, as modern filmgoing audiences, we’ve been taught to regard all films, but especially sequels like this one, with a great deal of suspicion.  Throw George Lucas into the mix, who dashed the hopes and dreams of a generation with his crap prequel trilogy, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Here’s the bottom line: I really wanted to like this film.  How can you not like Indiana Jones?  Even in a poorly written cobbled together mess like this, the character still shines and Ford can still bring him to life.  The action sequences, even the most implausible ones, I was fine with.  Even the overarching McGuffin of the piece, I was fine with.  It’s just that…if you try to actually think about the plot of the film and why things are happening the way they’re happening, it doesn’t make a lick of goddamn sense.  And that’s because the script, I’m afraid to say, is rubbish. Unfortunately, I’m held by my own desires to write spoiler-free reviews from pointing out any of the finer details as to why it’s rubbish.  But I will say this: once you get to the end of the film, you realize that the titular crystal skull shouldn’t be out and about in the first place.  And that the special properties it possesses seem to only take effect when it serves the plot for it to do so.  Handy, huh? I’d also like to point out here that I’m not a big stickler for plot holes and nonsense when it comes to films like this.  Because it’s not like the basis for films like this were the bastions of continuity and reality-based adventure.  But this isn’t just a few shreds in the storyline–the entire thing is flawed from the ground up and just makes no freaking sense if you stop to think about it. And there’s the rub: I could stop and think about it.  Perhaps if the character of Mac hadn’t been given just a few lines about how he and Indy were such buddies and long-standing partners and I was supposed to care about him for his twists and turns–that might have helped.  Maybe if Blanchett’s Russian accent had been better.  Maybe if Karen Allen’s much vaunted return had been given a little bit more breathing room before bygones were bygones.  Maybe if anytime somebody stopped getting hit or action slowed down the film didn’t start to grind into a slow, limping halt.  But that’s just it–all of that was problematic and finally, my brain woke back up and was pissed. LeBeouf isn’t at fault–he does well here, although I think he actually was given more to work with in Transformers, sadly enough.  And the Tarzan bit was just way, way too much.  I know I’ve seen lots of people complaining about the copious amounts of CG used–I don’t have the same problem.  I figure when your beginning, middle and ending don’t even hold together in a light breeze, your problems are much more fundamental. It’s a damn shame that Spielberg couldn’t get it together enough to make this better.  Either the filmmakers are idiots for not realizing that they’re making a flawed film, or they think we’re idiots and won’t notice.  Whichever it is, Henry Jones Jr. deserved better. Your review is spot on. My brother-in-law and I both had similar problems with the film as you pointed out. For him it was the “George of the Jungle” scene that completely soured him to the film. For me it was the first time I saw the Crystal Skull. Up until that point the film was a fun adventure. All events in the US and at the university were fine, but as soon as I heard Mariachi music in a Peruvian village (this was pure laziness, it’s as if nobody working on that film knew the difference between Chicano music and Andean indigenous music) I knew things were going to get worse. And I was proven right as soon as that stupid skull appeared. From that point forward it was one mess after another. There were still some good action sequences, but the plot, character dialogs, and the overall feel of the film seems haphazard and irrational. It was just plain dumb and boring. When my children started losing interest I knew the film was a failure since this was the target audience they were aiming for. I see all my movies for free so it’s usually easy to be a little forgiving. But this was a bit messy. I liked what they were trying to do with it, liked the few sort of Lovecraftian undertones (I’m a sucker for Lovecraftian undertones) but they certainly fell short. Points for trying but not much else. Also big points off for the monkey bit, that was just painful. Who reads and greenlights the scripts for these things anyway? I really wonder if people just can’t approach these “legendary” directors/writers with basic and/or glaring flaws in their movies  or do the writers/directors have their heads so far up their own asses that they just won’t hear any criticism because they produce nothing but cinema masterpieces? All said, I had fun watching it for nada while waiting for The Girlfriend to get done work. I don’t know if I’d have been very happy shelling out real green paper for it though. I agree with another reviewer who said it’s mostly WE who have changed, not Indy. Still, wouldn’t you think that Spielberg would have given that fact a little consideration, giving us a movie that met just a FEW more adult expectations? After all, he had almost 20 years to think about it. Finally the main thing that bothered me was how the movie seemed to slow down pacewise at the temple portion.  I agree with blank-mage the temple destruction scene and interdimensional brooha don’t belong in an Indiana Jones movie.  At least it seemed to be done poorly. Finally this movies feels slightly like the Spielberg/Kubrick film AI in that there were two distinct movie visions.  IN IJ4 the visions belong to Lucas and Spielberg.  I believe i had difficulty with the input that came from Lucas.  I beli9eve at times he only makes movies for himself and that he has forgotten how to make them for an audience.  The elements I really liked had the touch of Spielberg who I think still can make a movie audiences will love.   I think Lucas’s idea to make Shia the star of the next IJ movie is terrible.  I like Shia and all but like Ford was quoted as saying he is Indiana Jones.  I would like to see a 5th movie though call me a glutton for punishment. Halloweenie:  While I agree that we’re obviously not the same audience we were 20 years ago–nor are the people who were the ages we all were respectively 20 years ago the same as we were–and I agree that Indy as a character is the same…if you put the first film and the fourth film side by side, I think the people who’ve changed the most are George and Steven, sadly. And I admit freely–like I said, Doc respectfully disagrees with me–that TEMPLE has its defenders and if the film works for people, then rock on.  I don’t hate the film–it’s inhuman to hate a film with a character as cool as Short Round in it. I agree with most of these comments.  As a die hard Indy fan I wanted to love this movie. Wow, was I let down!!  The sad thing is they could have had a good story line but it was overshadowed by the absolute riduculas action scenes.  In all the Indiana Jones movies he has always got himself into somewhat impossible situations to get out of and pulls it off.  The way he gets out of them has always been far fetched but yet done in a way that you can believe it ie: jumping out of the plane in the inflatable boat in Temple.  However this latest film was just over the top and intellegence insulting in the escaping death scenes.  Comon!!, surviving the nuclear blast in a fridge then to watch the mushroom cloud to the distance.  I found myself concentrationg more on forgetting all the stupid scenes so much that I lost track of the story line.  Then Shia (Mutt) swinging from vines and Marion driving off the cliff to a perfectly placed waiting tree to lower them down to the water..I almost walked out!!!!…I honestly think that Sly Stallone totally succeded in his Rocky and Rambo return were Spielburg and Lucas failed BIGTIME!!! Do you think Spielberg is losing his marbles?  Every movie he’s done recently has had aliens in it.  Maybe he should go rerelease “Saving Private Ryan,” and add a bit at the end where the soldiers catch up to Hitler, Tom Hanks pulls the mask off, and we see an alien’s face underneath.  WEAK.  As someone else said, Indiana Jones was never, ever about aliens…lost treasure, jungles, the unknown, sure, but never aliens. Blanchett’s Russian accent made me cringe, it was was though she was almost mocking Russian accents, doing a stereotypical bad Russian accent rather than trying. LeBeouf I like but was miscast.  He just, at this age at least, cannot pull off an action-hero in waiting.  Mischevious kid, yes, but not more. Also 2 people in the movie were under retirement age: LeBeouf and Blanchett.  Want to watch a bunch of old fogeys run around in a jungle and kiss and mess with aliens?  Is that what Indiana Jones has come to?  Jeesh. Redline:  You know, I was fine with the aliens.  Better than I thought I would be, since to me, aliens are just another slice of the paranormal.  I thought Shia would have done a better job with a better written character, personally.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2008"," Steven Spielberg's directorial debut, Duel follows mild-mannered businessman David Mann (Dennis Weaver) as he's unwittingly caught up in a game of deadly cat-and-mouse with an unseen (and seemingly unstoppable) truck driver. Spielberg's undeniable prowess behind the camera is in evidence right from Duel's opening frames, as the movie kicks off with a captivating sequence shot from the perspective of the central character's car - with the narrative, past that point, segueing into a slow-burn first half revolving around the escalating conflict between Mann and the aforementioned truck driver. It's perhaps not surprising to note, however, that Duel suffers from an increasingly meandering midsection, as Spielberg's efforts at sustaining a full-length-feature running time pave the way for a number of padded-out and needless sequences. And while the movie boasts quite a few palpably tense moments - eg Mann attempts to figure out which patron at a diner is his relentless pursuer - there ultimately does reach a point at which Duel begins to wear out its welcome. (It's a vibe that's compounded by a final chase that goes on far too long.) The end result is an erratic yet sporadically thrilling piece of work that benefits from Weaver's consistently engrossing performance, to be sure, and it's ultimately clear that Duel stands as a surprisingly sturdy first effort for a filmmaker who would (obviously) go onto bigger and better things.  Directed by Steven Spielberg, Jaws details the chaos that ensues within a small island community after an enormous great white shark begins attacking its various inhabitants - with the film, for the most part, subsequently following Roy Scheider's police chief Martin Brody as he teams up with a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss' Hooper) and a grizzled fisherman (Robert Shaw's Quint) to kill the beast. There's ultimately little doubt that Jaws fares best in its opening half hour, as Spielberg, working from a script by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, does a superb job of establishing (and sustaining) an atmosphere of incredible tension - with the movie's justifiably legendary opening paving the way for an engrossing first act that's heightened by both Scheider's magnetic performance and the inclusion of several unbearably tense interludes. (In terms of the latter, it is, in the final analysis, difficult to do much better than the sequence wherein Scheider's Brody anxiously keeps an eye on a beach full of potential victims.) It's only as the movie progresses into its increasingly uneven midsection that one's interest begins to flag, as the narrative, which boasts more than a few lulls (eg Brody and Hooper drunkenly attempt to locate the shark themselves), suffers from a distressingly padded-out feel that's exacerbated by an ongoing emphasis on the three protagonists' uneventful (and distinctly repetitive) exploits at sea. (Quint's justifiably legendary story about his time on the USS Indianapolis is a rare highlight within this stretch.) And although the less-than-threatening nature of the title creature is, admittedly, not as problematic as one might've feared, Jaws is, when everything's said and done, unable to wholeheartedly live up to its place as a classic man-vs-beast thriller. Justifiably one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history, Raiders of the Lost Ark boasts a myriad of positive attributes that effectively compensate for the relatively uneventful and overly talky opening hour. While one would have to be flat-out insane to refer to any aspect of the movie as dull, it's ultimately impossible to deny that the pacing within the first half just seems off somehow - as screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan initially places a far more prominent emphasis on expository conversations and sequences than entirely necessary. Still, the storyline - which follows archeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as he attempts to track down the fabled Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis - has been peppered with a number of appreciatively engaging elements that ensure there's more going on here than just a series of brilliantly conceived and executed action set-pieces (with the undercurrent of humor nicely breaking up the tension at certain intervals). At the film's heart, however, lies Ford's virtually flawless turn as the central character; outfitted with Jones' iconic whip and fedora, Ford effortlessly transforms Indy into a figure that's often as cool as he is relatable - a vibe that's undoubtedly heightened by the actor's palpable chemistry with costar and love interest Karen Allen (as Jones' former flame Marion Ravenwood). It's also worth noting that the aforementioned pacing issues inevitably become irrelevant, as there reaches a point at which the increasingly propulsive narrative essentially carries the movie through to its appropriately memorable conclusion. Steven Spielberg's refreshingly (and expectedly) old-school visual sensibilities cement Raiders of the Lost Ark's place as a modern classic, and it does go without saying that none of the sequels have quite managed to successfully duplicate the film's seamless blend of action and comedy (ie the second possesses too much of the former, while the third is almost overflowing with the latter). While Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an obvious step down from its stellar predecessor, the film generally remains a tolerable endeavor that's elevated by Harrison Ford's engaging performance and the inclusion of several genuinely thrilling action sequences. This time around, Ford's Indiana Jones must battle a sinister cult leader (Amrish Puri's Mola Ram) bent on world domination - with his efforts consistently hampered by his two unlikely sidekicks (Jonathan Ke Quan's sassy Short Round and Kate Capshaw's whiny Willie). Director Steven Spielberg - working from Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's screenplay - kicks things off with a frenetic first reel that's nothing short of exhausting, as the filmmaker bombards the viewer with a barrage of action that just feels needlessly noisy and almost entirely free of context. And while Spielberg slowly-but-surely does manage to draw one into the admittedly thin storyline, there's never a point at which Quan's Short Round and (especially) Capshaw's Willie are successfully able to ingratiate themselves to the audience - with both characters coming off as wholly inferior successors to Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood. Ford's expectedly solid turn as the title figure proves instrumental in allaying their ineffectiveness, however, and there inevitably reaches a point at which the frequent lulls in the narrative are rendered moot by the proliferation of high-octane set-pieces (ie the third act's famed mine chase). Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is undoubtedly heads and shoulders above the majority of its adventure-movie brethren, yet it's ultimately impossible to view the film as anything but a drastic step down from its superior forebear. Perhaps in an effort to compensate for the second installment's pervadingly dark vibe, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade has been infused with a breezy sensibility that's often just a little too light-hearted for its own good. And while it's impossible to deny the film's status as the very best of the series' sequels, there does reach a point at which one can't help but long for the relative grittiness of the first installment. Opening with a fantastic prologue revolving around one of Indy's early escapades - in which the character, played by River Phoenix, first dons his iconic fedora and whip, receives that infamous scar across his chin, and discovers his fear of snakes (all in the same afternoon!) - Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade follows Harrison Ford's legendary archeologist as he teams up with his curmudgeonly father (Sean Connery's Henry Jones) in an effort to track down the mythical Holy Grail before the Nazis. It's clear almost immediately that Jeffrey Boam's fast-paced and sporadically irreverent screenplay plays a significant role in the film's drastic improvement over its immediate predecessor, with the inclusion of several thoroughly thrilling action set-pieces - as well as the palpable chemistry between Ford and Connery - ultimately elevating the proceedings to a level of quality that's as close to the original as this series is likely going to get. A strong candidate for Steven Spielberg's best film, Jurassic Park follows several figures as they're invited to a sneak preview of an island theme park that features living, breathing dinosaurs - with problems ensuing as the deadly creatures, including a Tyrannosaurus rex and a pair of cunning Velociraptors, manage to break free from their confines. Director Steven Spielberg, working from David Koepp and Michael Crichton's screenplay, does a superb job of immediately capturing the viewer's interest, as the filmmaker kicks the proceedings off with a fantastic (and thoroughly engrossing) sequence revolving around the disastrous efforts at moving the Raptors. From there, Jurassic Park just grows more and more involving as it progresses - with the irresistible storyline heightened by the efforts of a seriously impressive cast of characters. In addition to solid supporting turns from folks like Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, and Martin Ferrero, the movie benefits substantially from the nigh iconic work of stars Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Sam Neill - with the latter's consistently electrifying performance standing as an obvious highlight within the proceedings. There is, of course, little doubt that Jurassic Park is at its best during its now-legendary action sequences, as such moments have been infused with a tense, palpably hypnotic feel that proves impossible to resist - with the film's high point undoubtedly the engrossing T-Rex attack that comes fairly early on. And although it admittedly does feel a little long here and there, Jurassic Park is, ultimately, as close to a perfect big-budget popcorn movie as Spielberg has ever gotten - with the impressively timeless special effects cementing the film's place as a justifiably unforgettable piece of work. It's clear right from the word go that The Lost World: Jurassic Park marks a considerable step down from its sublime predecessor, as director Stephen Spielberg and scripter David Koepp, in their efforts to top the original, offer up a erratically-paced and far-too-episodic narrative that contains almost as many lulls as it does highlights. The story, which follows Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm as he returns to Jurassic Park's dino-filled island to rescue his girlfriend (Julianne Moore's Sarah), has been bogged down with superfluous elements that compound the film's palpably unsteady gait, with the bulk of the narrative's first half devoted to the exploits of characters that remain woefully underdeveloped and unsympathetic. (It is, for example, hard to work up any real interest in the continuing exploits of several vicious hunters.) It doesn't help, either, that The Lost World: Jurassic Park suffers from an oddly low-rent visual sensibility, as director of photography Janusz Kaminski proves hopelessly unable to replicate the lush, cinematic landscape established by Dean Cundey in the first movie. The film does improve once it passes a certain point, however, with Spielberg offering up a handful of undeniably exciting set-pieces - including a fantastic sequence involving an attack by two blood-thirsty Tyrannosaurs. And although the movie does boast a few more engrossing moments in its second half - eg Malcolm and company must avoid the advances of several raptors - The Lost World: Jurassic Park ultimately falls prey to the various trappings  that tend to afflict modern-day sequels (ie bigger is not always better). Saving Private Ryan follows a group of American soldiers as they embark on a quest to find and rescue the title character during the Second World War, with the film detailing the various problems that crop up for the grizzled squadron during their increasingly perilous journey. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg kicks Saving Private Ryan off with an intentionally disorienting sequence detailing the chaos of the infamous Normandy Landings, with the effectiveness of this impressively conceived and executed opening hindered by Spielberg's aggressive reliance on shaky camerawork. (Spielberg's decision to launch directly into the action without first introducing the characters also makes it difficult to wholeheartedly care about their plight, admittedly.) It's the emotional resonance of the movie's main plot thrust that eventually proves instrumental in capturing the viewer's interest, as Spielberg, working from Robert Rodat's screenplay, slows the proceedings down considerably and begins transforming the various protagonists into increasingly compelling (and sympathetic) figures - with this vibe heightened by the stellar efforts of a flawless cast that includes Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, and Tom Sizemore. The deliberate midsection, which seems to contain an equal balance of superfluous and engrossing sequences, paves the way for a protracted final battle that's admittedly quite well done, although, like everything else within the proceedings, this stretch feels as though it could've been substantially trimmed without losing anything significant. By the time the heartwrenching finale rolls around, Saving Private Ryan has established itself as a sporadically gripping yet persistently erratic war drama that could (and should) have been so much better - with Spielberg's typically overindulgent sensibilities muting the impact of the film's more overtly captivating moments. An incredibly ambitious (if not always successful) sci-fi effort, Artificial Intelligence: AI follows a highly-advanced robot child (Haley Joel Osment's David) as he's abandoned by his adoptive parents (Frances O'Connor's Monica and Sam Robards' Henry) and left to fend for himself - with the narrative detailing the decidedly epic journey David embarks upon to transform himself into a human boy. There's little doubt that Artificial Intelligence: AI improves steadily as it progresses, as writer/director Steven Spielberg delivers an exposition-heavy opening stretch that's intriguing, admittedly, yet not exactly as enthralling as one might've hoped - with the movie nevertheless benefiting heavily from its strong performances and impressively-conceived futuristic landscape (ie it feels plausible without crossing the line into ludicrous). The erratic first act, devoted to David's ill-fated stay with Monica and Sam (and their ""organic"" son), eventually does give way to an unexpectedly gripping midsection littered with electrifying images and sequences, with, especially, David's jaunt through a robot-killing ""flesh fair"" and hedonistic, adults-only city boasting   a seriously propulsive feel and jaw-dropping visuals - with this stretch, which is clearly the movie's high-water mark, as purely captivating as anything within Spielberg's erratic body of work. And although the movie stumbles quite badly in its third act - ie there reaches a point at which the story could (and should) end and yet Spielberg can't resist concluding the proceedings with an overly sentimental coda - Artificial Intelligence: AI is nevertheless an impressive piece of work that's aged surprisingly well in the years since its 2001 release.  With Minority Report, Steven Spielberg returns to the futuristic terrain he explored in last year's A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. But in attempting to craft a film meant to appeal to a wider audience, Spielberg has emerged with one of his most uneven movies to date. Unlike the majority of futuristic flicks, Minority Report, which follows Tom Cruise's John Anderton and his Pre Crime team as they stop perpetrators before they do anything, presents a future that's not only completely original, but seems plausible. Aside from the whole notion of Pre Crime, aspects of this society seem like the natural evolution of where we are now (example: cereal boxes come alive with cartoons once you handle them) and Spielberg treats this world as though it's the present. We're never treated to loving slow-motion shots of the vast futuristic horizon; rather, the movie plays out as though it could be occuring in any time period. When you get right down to it, Minority Report is a film noir - complete with shadowy cinematography. Shot by Spielberg regular Janusz Kiminski, the movie has that same hazy and dark look that made the film noir genre famous. The technology in Minority Report is just as fascinating as you'd expect from those ever-present commercials and trailers. Those bizarre robotic spiders that featured heavily in the marketing of the film are obviously really cool to look at, but they also serve a purpose in the film that doesn't feel forced. Likewise, the various other facets that make up this futuristic society are integrated into the film pretty seamlessly (eg the commercials that address individuals directly). The Pre Crime facility itself looks like a contemporary police station, except it's adorned with expectedly wild-looking advancements. The method by which the precogs present their findings is decidedly low-tech, but still, the whole look of the flick is easily the best thing about it. The movie can easily be broken down into three separate but distinctive parts: the introduction of this world and the whole notion of Pre Crime, Anderton's realization that he's going to be arrested for murder and the investigation/getaway that ensues, and a third act that goes on far longer than it should and throws in a whole conspiracy angle that's not really necessary. The first two-thirds of the flick are astounding - Spielberg's certainly at the top of his game and Cruise has never been more compelling - but that last half hour or so is completely and utterly superfluous. There comes a point in the film where it could logically conclude (with a five minute epilogue, of course), but the film just keeps chugging along for another 30 minutes - throwing in an epic conspiracy and an obligatory happy ending for Cruise's character. It was a struggle to pay close enough attention to follow the myriad of revelations that came fast and furious during this stretch, and truth be told, it was even harder to care. Having said that, there is a lot worth recommending about Minority Report, most notably the fantastic futuristic environment created by Spielberg. Had it been trimmed substantially, the film would no doubt have been one of the best flicks of the year. As it stands, it's still excellent summer fodder. Unlike some of Spielberg's recent films, Catch Me If You Can isn't designed for anything more than escapist entertainment. There are no lofty intentions here; Spielberg's revisiting his roots, in a manner of speaking, by crafting a movie that's fun. Though there are some serious moments, the film, which follows con artist Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he's pursued by a dogged FBI agent (Tom Hanks' Carl Hanratty), has a breezy atmosphere that certainly helps keep boredom at bay - especially during some of the more needless sequences. DiCaprio gives one of his very best performances, here playing virtually the polar opposite of his character in last week's Gangs of New York. Frank is the sort of person that gives into each and every one of his whims, no matter how small or big. It's the sort of character that in the wrong hands could come off as smug and egotistical, but DiCaprio infuses Frank with a sense of wonder that's quite appropriate. This is a kid, essentially, who's doing things that most adults won't experience. Equally good (if not better) is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the determined FBI man out to capture Frank. Sporting a convincing enough Boston accent, Hanks is just as charming as ever, even though he's technically playing someone we should be rooting against. The supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces, from Martin Sheen to Jennifer Garner, but it's Christopher Walken, as Frank's father, who makes the biggest impact. The core of the film is the relationship between Frank and his father, and Walken is completely convincing as this man who's happy for his son, but too proud to accept any of the benefits of his success. But as marvelous as the cast is and though the story is quite interesting, Spielberg doesn't know when to call it quits. Catch Me If You Can is the most frustratingly overlong movie since Meet Joe Black, another film that would've been so much better had it been trimmed down to 90 minutes. Here, most of the scenes go on for a minute or two longer than they should and there are whole sequences that should have been excised. For example, Garner pops up midway through as a prostitute that seduces Frank. It's a six-minute scene that doesn't add a single thing to the film, and could have easily been removed. It's point was likely to show that Frank is doing things that most teenagers aren't, but we've already established that. It's superfluous elements like that which make Catch Me If You Can an entertaining enough way to spend two and a half hours, but with this director and this cast, it should have been so much more. Well, the writing's been on the wall for some time now; after several less-than-stellar efforts, Steven Spielberg's finally emerged with a mediocre film. While this isn't to say that The Terminal is bad, it's impossible to shake the feeling that it belongs on the small screen. And coming from a director as visionary as Spielberg, that's certainly not a good thing. The film is comprised mostly of comedic vignettes that aren't all that funny, as the plotless narrative follows Tom Hanks' Viktor Navorski as he's forced to make an American airport his home after his country undergoes a revolution. The screenplay, by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson, revels in sitcom clichés and stock characterizations, which ensures that the movie possesses a distinctly sentimental feel. Now, it'd be easy to say that this is Spielberg's attempt at a Capra-esque fantasy, but even Capra didn't play things quite so obviously. This is a movie that not only has a completely superfluous villain, but he's an over-the-top villain to boot. The convenient manner in which the various storylines are resolved is exacerbated by the fact that the majority of these characters are just too cute to be believable. There's nothing wrong with a stereotype here and there, but the movie is overrun by quirky figures - which undermines the occasional glimpses of genuine emotion. Hanks' Viktor should have been absolutely compelling - he still is to a certain extent, thanks primarily to Hanks' expectedly wonderful performance - but the screenplay forces him to interact with these well-cast but ultimately implausible characters. While there's no denying that the set in which The Terminal's been filmed is impressive, Spielberg - along with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski - never really takes advantage of its grandeur, except when blatently lingering on some painfully obvious product placement. The film's look is surprisingly bland, in fact; the only real indication that this is a Spielberg film are the many instances of lens flare, a trick the director has inexplicably become obsessed with as of late. About the best thing one can say about The Terminal is that it's cute and inoffensive - not exactly high praise when talking about a movie directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks. At a running time of around 118 minutes, War of the Worlds is Steven Spielberg's shortest film since the early '90s - yet the film still sports the same sort of uneven pace that's been plaguing his movies for years now. While War of the Worlds does feature a number of genuinely thrilling and surprisingly frightening moments, it's also rife with needless subplots and overly simplistic instances of character development. Tom Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a deadbeat dad who finds himself stuck with his two kids for the weekend. Said kids, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), clearly aren't thrilled about the idea, but everyone's misgivings are soon rendered moot. Aliens from an unspecified planet have arrived on Earth and have begun systematically exterminating everyone in sight. This leaves Ray with little choice but to grab his kids and make a run for it. The most striking and surprising aspect of War of the Worlds involves the brutal, uncompromising nature of the invading extra-terrestrials. Spielberg doesn't shy away from depicting their deadly modus operandi, something that's made perfectly clear in their first major appearance. After emerging from beneath a city street, vicious tripods (so named because of their three-legged appearance) abruptly begin attacking the awe-struck onlookers - literally vaporizing them to the extent that all that's left are their clothes. It's pretty harsh stuff, and not at all what one has come to expect from Spielberg; to call War of the Worlds inappropriate for small children is a gross understatement, and there's no denying that this is his most harrowing science fiction film to date. What prevents the movie from becoming an instant classic, then, is David Koepp's unusually ineffective screenplay (this is, after all, the guy who wrote Jurassic Park). While Koepp does a nice job of establishing the story and characters, the writer peppers the story with far too many instances of conflict among the human characters. As a result, there seems to be almost as much screentime devoted to the alien invasion as there is to Ray's squabbles with various characters (ranging from a blood-thirsty mob to his own son). Such antics can't help but feel superfluous (there's an entire subplot with a survivalist played by Tim Robbins that's particularly pointless), given the imminent and deadly threat from the tripods. This is compounded by Koepp and Spielberg's heavy-handed use of 9/11 imagery, from the white powder Ray is covered in after returning home following an encounter with the tripods to the walls plastered with posters of missing loved ones. It's fairly obvious that Spielberg and Koepp are attempting to link the aliens to terrorists, but the two go overboard and place the emphasis on similarly over-the-top elements designed to clearly spell out this connection. Likewise, Ray's journey from negligent father to attentive caregiver is far from subtle - yet despite such deficiencies, War of the Worlds essentially remains entertaining throughout. Cruise delivers an expectedly charismatic and engaging performance, while Spielberg does a fantastic job of imbuing the film with an unusually gritty, realistic vibe (Independence Day this is not). Overlong, ponderous, and erratic, Munich is easily the most ineffective movie of Steven Spielberg's career and only cements the feeling that the director is now more interested in churning out ""important"" films than in entertaining his audience. Though well acted and impeccably shot, the movie remains curiously uninvolving throughout its ridiculously bloated 164-minute running time. Based on the true story, Munich follows five Israeli assassins - led by Eric Bana's Avner - who are assigned the task of hunting down and executing 11 Palestinians believed to have planned the massacre of Jewish athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games. While there are plenty of individually compelling moments here - particularly the sequence in which Avner and company come awfully close to blowing up a little girl - the distinct lack of dramatic tension effectively prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly embracing any of the central characters or their cause (this is despite the uniformly superb performances, with Bana a clear standout). Spielberg's expectedly heavy-handed approach is exacerbated by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's screenplay, which is painfully unsubtle and filled to the brim with poetic but thoroughly inauthentic instances of dialogue. The final straw comes towards the end with a laughably overwrought sequence in which Spielberg cuts between footage of the Jewish athletes being murdered with Avner and his wife having sex, as the director clumsily hammers home the extraordinarily obvious point that Avner's psyche has been damaged by the killings. The majority of Munich is similarly substandard, and it's difficult to imagine just what Spielberg was hoping to accomplish with this disastrously inept piece of work. After an absence of almost two decades, globe-trotting archeologist Indiana Jones returns in an adventure that's admittedly not quite as effective as its immediate predecessor - yet there's ultimately no denying that the film is as thrilling and enthralling as one might've hoped. The storyline - which follows Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones and Shia LaBeouf's Mutt Williams as they attempt to uncover the mystery behind the fabled objects of the title - has been infused with far too many needless digressions and subplots, however, and it does become clear that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is surely the most blatantly uneven of the four films (ie enough with the exposition already). This is despite Ford's surprisingly engaging performance and the expected inclusion of several electrifying action set-pieces, though there's little doubt that the movie is at its best during its quieter, more introspective moments (ie a superb sequence in which Indy laments the deaths of his father and mentor). And while LaBeouf acquits himself quite well and Karen Allen's return as Marion Ravenwood is nothing short of delightful, the film suffers from an increasingly erratic pace that's ultimately exacerbated by a finale that feels as though it'd be more at home within an episode of The X-Files. Still, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull generally remains an affable piece of work throughout its undeniably overlong running time - which ultimately does ensure that the film fares a whole lot better than such contemporary big-budget travesties as Transformers, Rush Hour 3, and the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Based on the comic-book series created by Hergé, The Adventures of Tintin follows intrepid reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) as he and his faithful dog Snowy find themselves caught up in a treasure hunt involving a centuries-old sunken ship - with the pair's efforts eventually assisted by a washed-up captain named Haddock (Andy Serkis). There's little doubt that The Adventures of Tintin fares best in its opening half hour, as director Steven Spielberg, working from Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish's script, does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the briskly-paced proceedings - with the energetic vibe heightened by Spielberg's kinetic, eye-catching visual choices (ie the filmmaker takes full advantage of the movie's animated atmosphere). It's only as the film segues into its progressively (and disappointingly) convoluted midsection that one's interest begins to flag, with the growing emphasis on the decidedly dull mystery at the narrative's core wreaking havoc on the movie's momentum. (It doesn't help, either, that Serkis' character receives more and more screentime as the story unfolds, despite the fact that Haddock is simply not interesting enough to justify the increased attention.) And although the film briefly recovers for an absolutely spellbinding single-take action sequence, The Adventures of Tintin ultimately comes off as a misguided, frequently overblown animated endurance test that's rarely as much fun as Spielberg has clearly intended. Unabashedly old-fashioned, War Horse tells the epic story of a boy (Jeremy Irvine's Albert Narracott) and his faithful horse, Joey - with the onset of World War II inevitably separating the two and triggering an expansive tale revolving around Joey's exploits on and off the battlefield. It's obvious right from the get-go that filmmaker Steven Spielberg is looking to capturing the feel and tone of a classic Hollywood production, as the director has suffused the proceedings with a number of elements designed to hearken back to similarly-themed epics from the past - with, in particular, the lush visuals, grandiose score, and episodic narrative ranking high on the film's list of old-school attributes. The handsomeness of the production is, in the film's early stages, offset by the almost excessively deliberate pace, as Spielberg, working from Lee Hall and Richard Curtis' screenplay, takes his time in allowing the narrative unfold to a degree that's often nothing short of maddening - with the best and most pertinent example of this the long, tedious stretch involving Albert's step-by-step training of Joey. And though there are a few decent sequences sprinkled here and there - eg Albert's father (Peter Mullan's Ted) reluctantly sells Joey to the war effort - War Horse's barely-passable atmosphere remains fairly consistent right up until a pivotal (and thoroughly engrossing) battle scene makes an appearance at around the halfway mark. The film subsequently becomes far more involving than one might've anticipated, as Spielberg places a growing emphasis on interludes of an impressively gripping nature (eg Joey, caught in barb wire, is assisted by two enemy soldiers working together). The narrative's increasingly heartwrenching bent - eg it's virtually impossible to sit through Joey and Albert's inevitably reunion without experiencing a palpable lump in one's throat - ensures that War Horse finishes on an almost incongruously positive note (especially when compared to its first half), and it is, as a result, finally impossible to label the movie as anything more than a sporadically electrifying yet terminally uneven (and overlong) piece of work. Inspired by true events, Bridge of Spies follows insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) as he's recruited by the government to help rescue a pilot detained in the Soviet Union - with the movie detailing the many, many complications that arise for Donovan along the way. Director Steven Spielberg, working from Matt Charman, Ethan Coen, and Joel Coen's screenplay, does a superb job of immediately luring the viewer into the padded-out narrative, as Bridge of Spies opens with a fascinating stretch detailing the mundane activities and eventual capture of a mild-mannered Russian spy (Mark Rylance's Rudolph Abel). Once past that point, however, the film segues into a slow-moving and only sporadically absorbing midsection - as Spielberg, in typical fashion, imbues the proceedings with an egregiously deliberate pace that slowly-but-surely drains one's interest and enthusiasm. It doesn't help, certainly, that the storyline has been peppered with a whole host of somewhat interesting yet wholly needless segments, while, worse yet, the film's second half finds itself devoted almost entirely to the minutia of Donovan's ongoing efforts at brokering a deal for the aforementioned pilot's release (ie the movie, past a certain point, seems to consist solely of negotiation sequences). Exacerbating the film's hands-off feel is Janusz Kaminski's typically inept handling of the visuals, as the cinematographer injects Bridge of Spies with a decidedly uncinematic vibe that ensures the movie's various sets couldn't possibly look more like sets. The end result is yet another late-career misfire from Spielberg, with the movie's failure especially disappointing given Hanks' engaging and thoroughly ingratiating turn as the idealistic protagonist. Disappointingly flat almost from start to finish, The Post details the true-life efforts of several newspaper men and women to expose a massive political cover-up. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg delivers an almost episodic narrative that's lacking in an obvious entry point for the viewer, as the director's decidedly dry approach to Liz Hannah and Josh Singer's screenplay makes it increasingly difficult to connect to the scarcely-developed characters - with the movie, for the most part, coming off as a series of impressively staged yet entirely drama-free reenactments of real events. It's ultimately clear, however, that The Post manages to stave off total irrelevance thanks mostly to its superior production design and stellar performances, with, in terms of the latter, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks infusing their thin protagonists with far more life and vibrancy than the script affords them. (This is despite the fact that Streep's Kay Graham is trapped within a wheel-spinning sexism subplot that feels fairly needless until the film's third act.) Spielberg's deliberate sensibilities do, at least, ensure that there are a handful of far-more-exciting-than-one-might've-anticipated sequences within the movie's second half, as this portion of The Post boasts a sense of urgency  that's otherwise missing from the overlong proceedings. It's a shame, then, that Spielberg undermines the final stretch's effectiveness with a subtle-as-a-sledgehammer conclusion, and it is, in the end, impossible to label The Post as anything other than an extremely minor entry within Spielberg's increasingly erratic filmography. Based on the book by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One transpires in a future wherein much of the populace primarily lives and works within a virtual world known as the Oasis - with the narrative following a scrappy teenager (Tye Sheridan's Wade Watts) as he and several other contenders set out to find three well-hidden keys (with the victor ultimately gaining total control of the Oasis). It's clear almost immediately that filmmaker Steven Spielberg is the absolute wrong choice to helm this adaptation, as the director, working from a script by Cline and Zak Penn, delivers an extremely slick yet hopelessly bloated blockbuster lacking in momentum or compelling characters - with the movie's consistently mediocre atmosphere perpetuated by a distressingly ugly visual sensibility and an emphasis on long, frenetic action sequences. (There is, in terms of the latter, an entirely computer-generated climactic stretch that's nothing short of interminable.) The film's hit-and-miss vibe, which is increasingly more miss than hit, is at least alleviated by a sporadic peppering of effective interludes, with the most obvious example of this a thoroughly entertaining scene set within the world of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. There's just never a point at which one is wholeheartedly able to root or sympathize with the flat central character, though, and it's clear, too, that the decision to omit and change large swaths of the source material contributes heavily to the pervasively erratic feel - which does, in the end, confirm Ready Player One's place as just another ill-conceived and executed endeavor from a director well past his prime.",POSITIVE
"May 26, 2008"," 

The opening of this latest
 Indy 
could be taken as a way to possibly deflate all the hoopla surrounding the film. The film begins with the Paramount logo, with its famous mountain, dissolving into a gopher hill. It's almost as if Spielberg is saying, okay I know you're expecting a lot and the anticipation is high but don't make a mountain out of a mole hill, or in that case a gopher hill. It feels self-deprecating, as if to remind us that this is not a film that's meant to be taken seriously, it's just meant to be fun.
 The action in this case picks up 19 years after
 Last Crusade 
left off. We find a military convoy heading out into the Nevada desert in 1957 as Elvis blares on the car radio. But it's right in the middle of the Cold War and the ""soldiers"" turn out to be Russians infiltrating an army base. They arrive at Hangar 51 (in an odd way this film may provide the perfect warm up for the new
 X-Files 
movie) and drag Indy (Harrison Ford) and his new sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone) out of the car. An all-business Russian agent named Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in a Louise Brooks style bob) informs Indy that he will help them find a crate containing some mummified remains that's lurking somewhere in Hangar 51. The contents of that crate set the plot in motion and leads to Indy getting suspended from his teaching job over suspicions of him being a Red; hooking up with the rebellious teenager Mutt (Shia Le Beouf) who needs help rescuing his mom and teacher; reuniting with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen); and trying to return a mysterious Crystal Skull to a temple deep in the South American jungle. Aw heck, that sounds like something Indy could do in his sleep.
 
 Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
like
 Star Wars 
before it, took the Saturday morning serial to new heights - kicking up the budgets, production values and action. This latest outing doesn't top the energy and breathless sense of fun of
 Raiders 
or the delightful character development afforded by Sean Connery as Indy's dad in
 The Last Crusade 
. But the latest Indy adventure is head - or should I say skull - and shoulders above
 Temple of Doom 
(that grim misstep in the series).
 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 
could use better pacing and more ingenious scripting, but Ford and Spielberg jump back into the saddle determined to have a good time.
 At last summer's Comic-Con, Spielberg delivered a message to attendees stating that he was making this film ""for them."" He said he had to make other films for himself but
 Indy 4 
was for the fans. This creates initially made me worry because designing a film to please a fan base isn't always the way to make the best movie. And the resulting film does have some things that feel clunky as Spielberg tries to tie up some plot strands from other movies. It also means that Spielberg tries to cram a lot into the film to please everyone. The result is a film that's carrying some extra weight and could have easily been trimmed down to a leaner, meaner running time.
 That said,
 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 
still delivers the goods. Spielberg and writer David Koepp (the only one credited with authorship of this final draft) stay true to the Indy formula by delivering more stunts and fights than special effects; by making sure to show Indy both in the field and in the classroom; and by maintaining a sense of humor throughout. The film addresses Indy's age early on with a reference to how it was easier to get out of binds when Indy was younger. Then in the first action scene in the hangar, Indy engages in some not quite dazzling maneuvers that poke fun at the fact he's not the man he used to be. But after this and a joke by Mutt asking Indy if he's ""like 80 years old,"" the film pretty much lets Indy prove that he may be older but he's still Indy. And he's still pretty amazing. The fights and stunts have a distinctly American feel, avoiding the wirework and gravity-defying agility and grace of Asian action films. Instead, they are rough and tumble exchanges with a lot of slugging, and frequently involving vehicles. My favorite stunt involves Indy being pulled off Mutt's motorcycle and into a car with Russian agents. Battling the agents in the car for a few moments, Indy then climbs out and back onto the bike. Then the whole thing ends with the motorcycle sliding to a stop in the campus library where Indy answers a student's question about reading material. There's also a sword fight between Mutt and Irina standing on jeeps. The scenes push the bounds of realism but do so with an old school Hollywood flavor that makes them incredibly fun to watch.
 Spielberg and Koepp also toss in a slew of knowing references - a spilled box at Hangar 51 reveals the Lost Ark, and Indy confesses to having ridden with Pancho Villa, alluding to something on a
 Young Indy 
TV show. Plus Irina tries to read Indy's mind in a manner that seems lifted from Obi Wan Kenobi and you half expect Indy to say ""those Jedi mind tricks won't work on me sister."" Then Indy gets to utter Han Solo's famous line, ""I got a bad feeling about this."" You get the feeling that former film students Spielberg and Lucas were joking around on the set and trying to sneak in references to each other's movies. Spielberg even closes out the film referring to his own movies,
 Close Encounters of the Third Kind 
and
 E.T. 
But that's all I'm going to say about that.
 Indy's durability gets a severe test in
 Crystal Skull 
as well. This is a bit of a plot spoiler so skip this graph if you want to know nothing about the dangers he encounters in his latest outing. With his natural aplomb, Indy reacts to the discovery that he's on an atomic blast site with a simple, ""This can't be good."" But lucky for him there's a lead lined refrigerator to jump into and get thrown to safety in. (This escape plan is actually reminiscent of what the main character does in the Hong Kong actioner
 Time and Tide. 
) Now it's a bit difficult to make light of anything involving a nuclear blast -- with
 Dr. Strangelove's 
nimble-footed and razor sharp satire being the exception that proves the rule. And while I wish they could have come up with some other ""gag"" to rattle Indy's cage, the absurdity of situation does recall how in
 Raider's 
Indy clung to a sub to travel across the open sea. And that basically set the ground rules -- credibility is not what these films strive for, and the blatant way they push credibility makes it play more as style than as mere lazy cheats. Plus my friend reminded me that didn't Indy drink out of the Holy Grail or at least touch it, and wouldn't that make him close to immortal or at the very least more durable than mere humans like us? Well why not! I'll buy that absurdity because at least it's consistent with the universe created for the film. No one is trying to be realistic so why bother to hold everything to a standard of reality that's obviously not meant to rule this universe. If you want to point out all the things that couldn't possibly happen, then you are probably not the right audience for this film. This is a popcorn movie meant for diversion and its cartoonish improbabilities are part of its charm. It doesn't embrace its big dumbness with the same audacity as
 Live Free and Die Hard 
, but it happily throws reality out the window, just like those old Saturday morning serials where the heroes were left in cliffhanging, inescapable predictaments yet when you caught up with them the following week they had always managed to miraculously escaped.
 Going into this, though, I have to confess to misgivings about the casting of Shia Le Beouf as Mutt. Now when Spielberg cast River Phoenix as a young Indy in
 The Last Crusade 
that felt right from the very beginning, and added a delightful dimension to the film. But Shia, of Disney TV fame, being cast in a role that seemed to be the heir apparent to the Indy franchise - that made me wince. Add to that the fact that he was dressed like Marlon Brando from
 The Wild One, 
and well it just seemed to be going from bad to worse. But fortunately, Le Beouf does more stunt work than acting and when he tries to put on the hat, Indy snatches it away as if to say this old man still has plenty of kick left in him. But I will say that when Shia's Mutt dips his comb into a glass of Coke to make his hair nice and stiff, that got one of the bigger laughs in the film.
 The success of the film, though, really rests with Ford, and as Indy, he still wins us over. He's a scruffy, tough customer who takes a beating and keeps on ticking. He's got a redeeming sense of humor and a matter-of-factness that's appealing. And when Ford's Indy meets back up with Karen Allen's Marion, Ford becomes downright boyish. Although I have some complaints about the script, Koepp does give Indy the perfect line as a retort to Marion's inquiry about there being other women in his life, he says yes but ""they weren't you."" Anyone who's been a fan of the films knew that Marion was his perfect match and it's great to see Allen back in the role and still feisty. We've missed the presence of a strong woman in the other films. Seeing the two of them together is quite satisfying. It would have been nice if Connery returned as Dad, but oh well.
 
 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 
(rated PG-13 for adventure violence and scary images) is highly enjoyable pop entertainment. It doesn't capture the verve of Raiders but rather is quite honest about the fact that Indy, Ford and Spielberg are all a little older and a little slower. But the film works because they have all retained a sense of fun and still get a kick out of what they are doing. This isn't great art, just great fun.
 QUICK ADDITION: There will be an outdoor screening of
 Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation 
-- the shot-by-shot remake of
 Raiders 
begun by a pair of pre-teens in 1982 and completed more than a decade later. Spielberg was so impressed by their efforts that he gave his blessing to the project and helped the two young filmmakers get their film screened. What's most impressive is the ingenuity of these kids in coming up with cheap ways to imitate the expensive special effects. The San Diego screening takes place at the Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla on Thursday, July 10th at 8pm.
 ALSO: I had a chance to see
 Indy 4 
in both digital projection at the newly re-opened, state of the art digital AMC Plaze Bonita Theaters and projected in 35mm at the Reading Gaslamp Theaters, and I have to say that the digital projection was hands down the better, more impressive screening. At the Gaslamp the film began with the wrong gate in the projector, which meant the film was in the wrong aspect ratio, then the focus was off for a good ten minutes. But at Plaza Bonita, the image was consistently sharp, the aspect ratio and framing were perfect, and the audio sounded great. So considering that multiplexes do not have a projectionist sitting by each projector monitoring the screening, and that the art of projecting film is being lost, I am beginning to be sold on digital projection. So check out the new AMC Plaza Bonita for yourself and see what you think.
",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2008"," Judging by the adequacy of Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indy shouldn't be put out to pasture just yet, but he's certainly not in Triple Crown shape. Actually, the nineteen years since Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade have taken their toll on the story-shaping skills of the creative team more than the hero's physical prowess or ability to extract himself from perilous situations.  A certain amount of humorous self-reference was integral to the first three pictures in the popular series. This entry feels hokey and jokey, mired in nostalgia and strewn with Spielbergian and Lucasian themes as fake as the cobwebs used on the sound-stagey sets. Instead of a taut narrative, there's a kitchen-sink approach to plotting that requires too much exegesis (think National Treasure) and results in a creaky cartoon effect. In a story containing many less-than-fresh referents and influences, Indy has close encounters with a cardboard Commie villainess (Cate Blanchett), an atom bomb, space aliens, Spanish conquistadors, his progeny, and an old flame.  It's as though director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas rummaged through their respective bodies of work to find themes to recycle. For Spielberg, it's patrimony and extraterrestrials. For Lucas, it's 1950's drag racing and the malt shop angst of American Graffiti. On the plus side, the long, digitized action sequences are exciting -- up-to-snuff if not innovative -- and there's enough spookiness to make an impression on younger viewers. The period is the Cold War, when the Red Scare and an atmosphere of suspicion predominates at home and abroad. Russian KGB agents commanded by Stalin's favorite operative Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett sporting a Cleopatra hairdo and rapier) have captured Indy and a British spy colleague Mac (Ray Winstone). At a military warehouse in the Nevada desert, they uncrate an otherworldly creature from the infamous Roswell site in New Mexico. Indy escapes but must shield himself from a nuclear blast that has dire fallout. The FBI starts snooping around and he resigns his university professorship.  On his way out of his quaint college town, he encounters Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a greaser on a motorcycle and the spitting image of Brando in The Wild One. Mutt asks Indy to help him find his godfather Oxley (John Hurt), one of Indiana's closest friends and a fellow archeologist, who claims to have found the crystal skull of the title. Mutt's mother has also gone missing. After a chase through the halls of academe, Indy and his newest sidekick head down to South America and promptly retrieve the skull. But Spalko and her goons are waiting with Oxley and Mutt's mom, who turns out to be Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) Indy's love interest from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  The movie's middle section takes place in the Amazonian jungle, with obvious and intermittently thrilling debts to both modern special effects and Tarzan flicks of yesteryear -- the latter including vine-swinging, giant waterfalls, and voracious red ants. In possession of the mysteriously powerful skull once again, the quintet of Jones, Mutt, Oxley, Marion, and Mac make their way to the fabled Mayan city of gold where the heavens open in a strained, faintly absurd climax. The message seems to be that the unfettered, unprincipled quest for knowledge can be dangerous and you have to know when enough is enough. One sign this franchise may have reached that point -- and doesn't really believe in itself anymore -- is how the revelation of Mutt's provenance is played for dumb laughs. The humor is lacking, much as the attempt to rekindle a romance between Indy and Marion feels perfunctory, their initial bickering annoying, and the overall story random.  Expectations may be unfairly high, but Crystal Skull's problems aren't simply relative to the first three movies or evident in comparisons with similar pictures made in the interim. Retro lighting is supposed to evoke noirish romantic adventures and Saturday afternoon serials, yet signals plodding self-parody by exposing how artificial the enterprise looks and feels. John Williams' famous theme and incidental scoring sounds dated, enhancing the sense of fatigue.  Returning to the thoroughbred metaphor, high stud fees are all our aging hero can expect to win going forward. That is, unless Spielberg and Lucas -- experts at keeping lucrative franchises alive -- can fashion a narrative for Mutt/Shia LaBeouf that a third generation of Indy fans will find compelling and fit for the winner's circle. Don't count them out. ",NEGATIVE
"May 26, 2008"," Is that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen locked in an embrace or Jim Broadbent and Dame Judi Dench?  Because this is the kind of on-screen sizzle you can't get unless you wear your good teeth. Karen was once famous for drinking men under the table, and from the looks of her it's there they'll stay.  As for Indy, now that he has reached the two-thirds century mark, it's time to stop using the whip and start using the term ""whippersnapper."" When asked to comment on the oil-and-water chemistry between himself and Allen, Ford would say only: ""Every day I pray for that boulder to run me down."" I don't want to suggest Hollywood will bring back anything, but Sony Pictures has announced a new version of It Happened One Night, ""and we have removed Claudette Colbert from the backlot freezer so two production assistants can thaw her out with a blow dryer,"" said an excited Sony spokesperson. Now don't get me wrong, I love the Indiana Jones series as much as the next guy.  And God knows I had high hopes for this chapter.  But by the end of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I felt like I had been watching Indy vs. Predator, with a little Leprechaun in Outer Space thrown in.  I knew I was in trouble when Indy teamed up with a Chucky doll. Harrison is not exactly engaged in this movie.  He actually looks like he's counting down the seconds until his stunt double swings in.  And God knows he doesn't have many seconds to count. ""Actually, I'm counting down the seconds until I can count down my money,"" said Ford, as he departed on his final adventure: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Isolated Wyoming Ranch. At least I learned something: You can survive a nuclear blast by closing yourself in a refrigerator.  And not just because that's where the food is. ""I wish I could have ducked and covered when Karen Allen went in for a wet one,"" muttered Ford to the actor who played Short Round in Indy II and - shockingly - seems to have superior judgment in choosing projects. ""Yes, Queen Latifah is a wild card,"" said Steven Spielberg.  ""We need more cred among an ethnic audience ever since we burned savages alive in Indy II."" And then there's the oblong crystal skull - a magnetic crystal skull.  ""That means you can never lose it when it's stuck to your refrigerator and you should never carry it with your ATM card,"" said screenwriter David Koepp, who has obviously thought of everything previously, thus leaving ""everything else"" to this movie. ""You call him Dr. Jones, doll!"" screamed Shia LeBeouf, swinging through the jungle on vines like Tarzan because he saw the monkeys do it first.  ""I do whatever the monkeys do,"" said LeBeouf, as he plucked fleas off Karen Allen and threw his own poop at Cate Blanchett. John Hurt costars as a scientist who lost his mind when he stared too long into the eyes of the crystal skull.  This is what happens to me when I stare too long into the eyes of Regis & Kelly. Whoever returns the misshapen crystal skull to the city of whatever-it's-from will control its power.  ""We don't know what that means but we suspect it involves millions of dollars of CGI,"" said Ford.",NEGATIVE
"May 25, 2008"," ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a sweet
finale for an icon who could very well live forever on DVD (or
whatever the next format happens to be). I couldn’t help but think
that I’ve watched Indy movies on Beta, LaserDisc, VHS and DVD …
formats that have survived generations of media. The stories —
quite deservedly — have survived the test of time, too. This time, the tale is set in Nevada during 1957, where Indiana
Jones (Harrison Ford, in case you have forgotten) has been
kidnapped along with his friend Mac (Ray Winstone, “Beowulf”). A
group of creepy Russians led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) takes
the duo to a warehouse full of military secrets. (Look closely and
you’ll see the Lost Ark!) Irina wants Indy to help her fetch a
mysterious object. Of course, Indiana escapes and ends up back in the classroom,
where the college dean (Jim Broadbent, “Hot Fuzz”) gives him an
extended leave of absence. Suddenly, a young guy named Mutt (Shia LeBeouf, “Disturbia”)
appears to ask for help finding another professor who’s been
hunting for archaeological wonders. The two pair up and head to
South America, where Irina finds them once more. And Indy once
again finds Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, reprising her role from
“Raiders of the Lost Ark”). Romance and humor abound. Also coming at the audience in waves
are entertaining chase scenes involving various kinds of vehicles
and the usual predators (both human and insect variety). So what’s missing? Well, I, for one, wanted to see Sean Connery
again as Indy’s father. Still, it’s great good fun to be in the
familiar company of Indiana and Marion, who share the same
enjoyable chemistry they did decades ago. And helping to set the
pace is that familiar theme music by the wonderful John
Williams. No pretense is made that Indiana Jones is a kid. All the way
through, in fact, various characters (including his own) reference
his age. At one point, Mac says, “This ain’t gonna be easy.” And
Indy replies, “Not as easy as it used to be.” This isn’t a brain-teaser of a movie; rather, it’s a
crowd-pleaser. And with a recession looming, soaring gasoline
prices and a nation conflicted about an upcoming election and a
current war, this escape to Indiana is just what we need.",POSITIVE

National release
AFTER all the hype and secrecy, after months of speculation on Harrison Ford's hair colour, it is hard to know whether Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a superlative action adventure or another predictable rehash of the franchise, with its improbable stunts and special effects. I've decided it must be both. Certainly it's a long time since a film has given me so much pure escapist pleasure. But one or two quibbles should be dealt with first.  When Indy is trapped in the quicksand, why couldn't he have thrown his bullwhip to his rescuers instead of sending everyone off to look for a rope? Then it wouldn't have been necessary to grasp the slimy object used to haul him tosafety.  And what about Indy's gravity-defying brown felt fedora? It is true that he wears it through thick and thin, and it remains miraculously in place, even when he plunges over a waterfall in Steven Spielberg's best imitation of The African Queen. But when KGB goons are also seen wearing felt fedoras, Indy's no longer looks quite so special. A great disappointment.  All right, no more nit-picking. For the most part, Spielberg gets the balance triumphantly right. We open with a brilliant sequence in the Nevada desert. The year is 1957 and Soviet agents have infiltrated a US military base where a nuclear bomb is being tested. Indy stumbles into an idealised all-American suburb, complete with pets, housewives hanging out the washing and dad hosing the car.  But they're all dummies, strategically placed to test the impact of the blast. Indy takes refuge in a kitchen fridge and is blown to safety. For a moment I thought it was curtains for him, with the film only 20 minutes gone.  Nothing quite matches the bizarre exhilaration of this opening scene, however strenuous the chases to come, however insistent the old John Williams score. Much of the film's charm comes from its reminders of Cold War rivalries.  Irina Spalko, the Soviet spy chief played with sly relish by Cate Blanchett, is pure delight: a dead ringer for Rosa Klebb in From Russia from Love, handy with sword and rapier, familiar with Milton's poetry, a three-times winner of the Order of Lenin.  The Soviet Union comes across as a worthy adversary for the mighty US. I think Vladimir Putin, who restored the old Soviet national anthem, would love this film more than I did.  As internet users discovered months ago, the Russians are looking for the Crystal Skull of Akador, said to be guarded by the living dead in the Amazon jungle. Its psychic properties may be useful for military purposes.  We are told that five writers, including Tom Stoppard, were asked to lend a hand with the script. But Spielberg, after Schindler's List, didn't want another Indy instalment with Nazis depicted in playful adventure mode. So everyone settled on a screenplay by David Koeff, in which the Soviets make excellent villains (as they did in the early Bond films).  It's a film well tuned to its own sense of nostalgia and the images of its time: steam locomotives, Pan-American DC3s on flights to Peru, anti-red paranoia, the warm-toned interiors of Marshall College, where Dr Henry Jones lectures on archeology.  There are the expected references to Spielberg's favourite films (not just his own). A framed photo of Sean Connery (Indy's father in the third instalment) and one of Denholm Elliott (who once played his academic colleague, Dr Marcus Brody, the part filled here by Jim Broadbent) add to the mood of celebratory introspection. When Shia LaBeouf arrives on his motorbike, in cap and leather jacket, to offer a token interest for younger audiences, we may take him for the young Marlon Brando.  Spielberg insisted on live stunts in preference to computerised imaging. And somehow it shows. I've always loved his fondness for lumbering pre-electronic technology: weights, pulleys, hidden compartments, counter-balanced structures, rivers of flowing sand. Crystal Skull seems to me weakest when it turns to the supernatural. I don't mind swarms of flesh-eating ants (the fate reserved for one Soviet agent), but shadowy zombie figures rising from their tombs somehow look out of place in Indy's world of tangible artefacts.  The good news is that Ford looks wonderful. In the dark with the light behind him he could easily pass for 64. It's a dauntingly athletic performance. And it's so long since we saw him in The Last Crusade that it's hard to remember how he looked in the bloom of middle age. The last time Ford's bare torso was in view was in What Lies Beneath, when he proved a less than gallant husband for Michelle Pfeiffer.  He has no trouble in Crystal Skull winning over Karen Allen, who returns from Raiders of the Lost Ark for a sketchy appearance as his former love. Sensibly, the smoochy stuff is played down.  One can be an action hero or a romantic hero, but to try to be both at Ford's age would be stretching one's luck. Kisses are reserved for the final moments.

"May 25, 2008"," Indiana Jones and, in many ways, Harrison Ford, make an effective comeback in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. While it hits a few snags along the way, the latest in this cherished film series is certainly worth the wait and contains enough big-wow moments to cancel out the negatives. After a nice opening visual gag, director Steven Spielberg takes us to 1957, where an older Indiana Jones hasn’t changed his fashion sense. A creaky, craggy man is pulled out of a car trunk and thrown to the ground next to his hat. He puts it on, straightens up, faces the screen and, just like that, the man is back. Any question of his age slowing him down are quickly dismissed when he starts bouncing from box to box in a warehouse, swinging from the rafters with his bull whip, and punching Commies out of moving trucks.  This time out, the bad guys are Russians led by a psychic psycho named Irina Spalko (a hammy Cate Blanchett). Irina and her cronies are searching for some crystal skull thing that will make the owner all-powerful. It’s a bunch of nonsense, but the quest to return the skull to an ancient temple paves the way for lots of cool action set pieces. It also allows for the introduction of Shia LaBeouf as biker dude Mutt, and the reintroduction of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, by far the coolest of Jones’ past girlfriends.  LaBeouf establishes himself as a decent action star with his performance. (He’s my nominee for the next Spider-Man.) Seeing Allen again, and hearing her scream “Innn-deee!” in that special Allen way, is a major geek treat.  Among the action set piece delights would be a Jeep chase in a jungle where Mutt has a sword fight with Irina while straddling the Jeeps in motion. There are also motorcycle chases, poison dart dodging, sand trap escapes, waterfall plunges and an especially exciting escape from an atomic blast. There is also a very funny scene playing on Indy’s fear of snakes.  Through all of this, Ford—doing plenty of his own stunts—not only keeps up with his younger counterparts, he outdoes them. This guy used to be one of my favorite actors, but he’s depressed me quite a bit of late. While I enjoyed his sinister turn in What Lies Beneath, I think his film choices and performances have been quite lackluster over the last oh, say, 15 years.  No matter, because this 65-year-old passes for a sprite 45 this time out, as if putting the fedora back on has jump-started his internal engine. It’s as if some of the Holy Grail water he spilled on Sean Connery in the last Indiana movie entered his body and gave him some extra kick. He’s invigorated and hasn’t lost a step. In a film full of special effects, he’s the best one.  Spielberg captures the look of past Indy films with the help of his cameraman of recent choice, Janusz Kaminski, who shot such Spielberg pics as Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report. The movie looks and feels very much like it is part of the franchise, and composer John Williams contributes mightily to that vibe. It’s great to hear the Indy theme again.  There were times when I honestly didn’t know what was going on. Side characters like John Hurt as a crazy professor and Ray Winstone as a sometimes Indy sidekick don’t really serve the story well. Blanchett, who I normally love, grates a bit as the villain, her character’s intentions not all that clear. ",POSITIVE

Moments after the final credits  stopped the first Indiana Jones movie in 18 years, Eric and J.D. turn on the camera and record their instant reaction. Not only did they screen “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” early, but the movie played at the Screenland Armour, a 1920s theater in Kansas City that has been newly restored to its old glory. It was a fitting debut for a cool, retro-designed theater. But how was the movie? I had much more trouble with the lame crystal skull plot than you did. When wrting my review I actually graded a little harsher than my intitial reaction because almost of all of the good parts this time around rely on nostalgia of the earlier films which it hopes is enough to carry a really dumb plot, which Lara Croft wouldn’t even attempt, to the finish line, without adding anything of substance to the franchise. A fine summer popcorn flick, but a disappointment, far beyond the likes of Temple of Doom, for what could be Indy’s last adventure. I’m with Alan. There were some good lines, but the Crystal Skull thing was silly. And I felt like they were just out of real ideas. It was like a re-tread rather than breaking some new ground (like they did so well in the third edition).",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2008"," SPOILERS BELOW""Indy 4"" is a deep shallow movie, poignantly personal and rich in humor, action and visual wit while still feeling very relaxed, sort of like mid-to-late period Howard Hawks (all that bickering and joshing around and philosophizing reminded me of ""Rio Bravo"").  I adored it. I think it's different from but equal to ""Raiders,"" and so immense and complex in all its aspects (despite the tossed-off feeling characteristic of Spielberg) that it could only have been made by a director with two-plus decades to hone his craft and expand his horizons. There is too much in your review to respond to after just one reading.  For now, I'll just thank you for making me feel less alone in my ecstatic response to this movie (I saw it opening day with my younger brother, and we were both so jazzed afterward that if I didn't have to head home and relieve the babysitter, I would have gotten right back in line and seen it again). Thanks also for bringing up the bookended, mirrored images of Indy (at the end of the prologue and the end of the climax) dwarfed by otherworldly panoramas (did anybody else note these twinned shots in a review? Lots of people noticed the mushroom cloud, but I don't recall anyone citing the second shot, which answers and expands upon the first).  This film is very much about knowledge -- knowledge of self, of family, of national and personal history; congruently it's a celebration of Indy's smarts (book and street).Janusz Kaminski has probably done as much to shape Spielberg's aesthetic in the second half of his career as John Williams did during the first.  All three men are in fine form here.I'll also add that I think you're absolutely dead-on about the movie being the first Indy to take place in a time of which Spielberg has actual recall -- which does explain why it has such a knowing, intimate vibe and such a  visit-to-the-Smithsonian aspect, what with all the cultural signifiers colliding like ping-pong balls in a washing machine.  (For long stretches of the movie Indy seems like a doll tossed about by cosmic forces.)   I need to see the film again to judge whether the space-between-spaces, the attention paid to time and loss, the preoccupation with migration/exodus and extermination/rejuvenation all cohere as well as I thought they did the first time.So many reviews have dismissed the ""space between spaces"" line as vague sci-fi nonsense, apparently not thinking that there's a reason that John Hurt's character says it, and there might be a reason why this same character delivers the line about all the time lost in waiting at the end of the film.Spielberg's one-world vision is very much in evidence here, too -- the sense that language, geography and generations are arbitrary barriers that can be transcended, or perhaps collapsed, under the right circumstances.  The extradimensional creatures being separated into 13 aspects/layers and then collapsed into one dovetails nicely with the family dynamics of the film, with the nuclear family of Indy/Marion/Mutt, splintered by time, distance and withheld knowledge, finally getting reunited. There's a father/son-holy ghost thing going on, too, with the ghost of Henry, Sr. (glimpsed in a photo) emerging in Indy's cantankerous Old Man Wisdom posturing, and the grandfather and father merging seamlessly with the son in the end.  (The bit with Mutt picking up the hat has been unfairly misread by so many reviewers and critics. True, Lucas has talked about a spin-off, but look at the scene itself: the wind blows the hatt toward Mutt, he picks it up and starts to put it on, then Indy, the rightful owner, snatches it away and walks off into the sunlight.  It's like the movie is saying, ""Don't get ahead of yourself, kid -- you don't get to wear the hat unless the owner is willing to part with it.""David Koepp did a great job with this screenplay.  As a blueprint for a comedic action/adventure loaded with cultural signfiiers, it's damn near perfect.I suspect a lot of people are going to accuse you of reading too much into what is advertised as a popcorn entertainment. But I don't think it's possible to read too much into a movie by a director as careful with his compositions, camera moves and edits as Spielberg.  He truly is a director whose images can be read -- usually that's where his films' complexities lie, whether the screenplay is straightforwardly expository or more theatrical/poetic.  This is as rich a movie as he's ever made. Fantastic review Keith (and Matt too). I'm glad I finally found a worthy critic who has stepped up and write a detailed review of what makes this film so great. It's sad when I hear people comparing this to the prequel putting all the blame on Lucas over silly CGI issues and Shia monkeying around. Even though Spielberg has noted that this film was made for the fans, and not the critics, it is clear that he aims for both. It sure would be nice to find deeper meaning (or, anyway, deeper meaning that has any intellectual force) in this movie, but it's just a terrible, terrible picture, a plainly awful Spielberg movie to rival ""1941"" and ""Hook."" Everything exciting and involving (the test-site sequence, as fine a thing as Spielberg has ever made) only makes the movie's overall failure more acute. It's as though he said, ""OK, George, you want a UFO? You got it, buddy."" The screenplay is miserable, the acting indifferent and most everything else insulting. And it breaks my heart. It is interesting that most commentators seem to want to deal with this fine film as a direct follow-up to the director's other Indie-movies without crediting the hugely-impressive canon of work he has completed in between.I think your article redresses the balance very nicely, well done! I wrote about this a few days ago here, so I'll just say that any review of Crystal Skull has to acknowledge how deeply inferior this movie is to both Raiders and Last Crusade, and how unnecessary in the context of those two very good films as well. It's fun to go back to Indiana Jones after all this time, sure, but it still would have been better for all of us—and for Indy as a cultural touchstone and object of art—to have just left well-enough alone. Keith, you hit upon the points I've been chewing over for a few days (especially the ""nuclear family"" theme and the Hitchcockian devotion to the resonant image), and a few more I thank you for illuminating. Thank you for your insight and your refreshing rebuttal to critics seeing only a shallow CGI fest. Crystal Skull is definitely worth a second (and third , etc.) viewing. Keith: I appreciate your review. I find “Crystal Skull” far from profound, but at least your appreciation provides visual evidence (unlike, say, Armond White’s, which insists that everything he calls profound is profound, without really arguing why). And I agree with you and Matt that Spielberg is too thoughtful a filmmaker to presume that the aforementioned visual compositions were somehow accidents. I respect that.But I couldn’t possibly disagree more about the quality of the screenplay, which I feel fails to capture our understood character of Indy or to establish a new one.Has Indy ever seemed less urgent? In the original trilogy there’s a delicious blend of fascination or exasperation, always one or the other, making Indy the guy with the tapping leg, unable to sit still. This Indy is mostly inert, no matter how fast those jeeps drive, no matter how far those waterfalls drop.The final moment with Mutt and the hat is well conceived, as is the moment in the Russian jungle camp, where Indy is rambling on (becoming his father before our eyes) and Mutt surveys the scene, decides “to heck with it,” and makes an impromptu getaway attempt (becoming Indy before our eyes). But what about …* Indy’s apparent 20-strikes-and-you’re-out relationship with Mac? When did Indy become so damn forgiving?* Indy’s eventual willingness to collaborate with Irina, which in any other movie would have made his skin crawl.* The way Indy immediately accepts Mutt as his son and Marion as his wife. They go from reunited past lovers to lifetime friends in about 3 seconds with no chemistry whatsoever.I could go on. But why bother? The film may indeed be filled with deep thoughts, and Spielberg has earned the right to have us pause long enough to admire the message underneath. Still, the message on top provided no magic for me whatsoever. If the film doesn’t work at its most basic level, what’s subtext worth?My comparatively skin-deep review is here, should anyone care to read it. I have to say I'm shocked that Matt loved this film and I agree with Jason's review.This is just a bad film.  The first half hour sort of works but it just falls apart afterward. I know we have to suspend disbelief in these films but there a scenes he that make me gasp with incredulity.  1)Why is the only thing that shoots out of the mushroom cloud is Indy in the refrigerator? Where are the other refrigerator's?, just stupid.2)How does Indy survive the launch out of the cloud? He should be crippled.3)The horrible CGI chase sequence in the jungle.  It looked fake with no respect for the laws of gravity. 4)The absurd swordfight with Mutt taking it in the crotch. Lucus school-yard humor triumphs again.5)I won't even go into the horrible Mutt is tarzan with the monkeys sequence.6)Marion drives off a cliff on purpose because she knows she will land safely on tree branches???? I almost walked out of the movie at that point.7)The horrible 3 waterfalls.8)When we don't get CGI, we get really fake looking sets.  What happened to the great on location shooting of the prior films?9)The screenplay is horrible. Jason already said it all.  I really feel bad for Karen Allen in this (I hope she got paid well).10)The whole Mac character was absurd (and the fact that Indy keeps trusting him).Where is the danger and grittiness of the prior films? No wonder Spielberg and Ford were resistant to this idea for years.  They knew Lucas was off his rocker.  They loved Darabont's script which Lucus (the screenwriting genius) nixed.  Ford and Spielberg finally caved in to Lucas (I'm sure the money helped) and created this CGI mess.And don't tell me that all of the films are equally absurd.  This one takes it to an entirely different level and the key difference is that here they don't earn it.I saw it last night and I'm still in disbelief. I've always found general fan reaction to Spielberg & Lucas rather fascinating.  Not to pigeon-hole, but the general perception is that Spielberg is good and Lucas is bad, so when they collaborate on something that they find less than satisfying, they choose to arbitrarily assume that everything they didn't like was Lucas's idea and everything they did like was Spielberg's idea.  Such an assumption seems so illogical, yet so many insist upon it.  I don't get it.Anyway, I found the film to be excellent, and it does have a thematic weight that not enough are recognizing. I like this label: ""a deep shallow movie."" For me, the rich subtext almost forgave the careless surface, including the terrible acting (Allen seems too aloof to participate in the movie and actually play her character, Ford lacks any kind of seriousness whatsoever). I also couldn't decide if the DP was creating an intentionally hallucinatory color scheme for his atomic-age tale, or if this was just a way of blurring the CGI transitions. Although I usually adore Kaminski's work, I prefer a crisper, more ""analog"" look (Slocombe) for my Indy movies. However, the choice of story was brilliant for the 50s, when pop culture had shifted into sci-fi panic. The opening sequence thrilled me: those Russian soldiers enviously watching the American teens speed along the desert road, the Atomic Cafe, the faux Levittown, etc. All this, plus Indy's conversation with Broadbent's Dean, gave me a ""no country for old men"" feeling about America in the 50s. Indy-as-veteran was a great choice. It's almost as if the series never stopped for twenty years. Instead, we can just fill in the gap in Indy's chronology by watching Spielberg's interim war movies. Thanks for the great analysis, Keith. I didn't like the film as much as you, but I've certainly thought about it a lot since yesterday. Anon: ""2)How does Indy survive the launch out of the cloud? He should be crippled.""This falls under the heading of ""stuff you complain about only when you didn't like the movie.""It also reminds me of a conversation overheard during the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie ""Sudden Death,"" between two guys who spent a good part of the movie counting how many bullets each character fired and complaining if they fired more bullets than a particular firearm could hold in real life.In the last movie, Indy survived a face-to-face encounter with Hitler, who signed his dad's book; shot three Germans with one bullet, and saved his father's life with water from Christ's Last Supper cup, then exited the scene of the miracle with an 800-year old knight waving goodbye to him.There are no rules here -- only Spielberg's sense of momentum, which (if it's working for you) can crank up your heart rate no matter how ludicrous the onscreen action. Clearly the movie didn't work for you. I don't think any further common ground is possible here.Jason: ""Has Indy ever seemed less urgent?""No, he hasn't. But he's 65 years old, he's buried his father and his best friend, and he's getting drummed out of the profession that defined his real-world identity for most of his adult life. I'd be exasperated, too.Plus, old guys don't move or behave as urgently as young guys -- partly because they're older, partly because they've been around the block a few times and don't get worked up as easily. I bought Indy completely in this movie -- as other posters have noted, he's turning into his dad (loved the running gag with Indy chastising Mutt for not finishing college), except he can still kick ass. Matt: I noted that Indy is turning into his dad, but the character still doesn't work for me. And I don't think he is exasperated here, that's part of the problem. Sure, we can say that he's older now and imagine all the ways that he would have settled into his silver-haired years like any normal person. But any normal person wouldn't survive the explosion and walk away as if it were no big deal. Indiana Jones can do that. And James Bond can do that. Etc. And that's why I have no problem with that specific scene. But once we start forgiving all that Indy isn't (and I'm talking emotions here more than feats of daring) by making him normal, what's the point, unless it's to explore all the ways that he isn't what he used to be? And this film doesn't do that.To look at Indy another way: I'm not pissed that Superman didn't fly in this picture. I'm pissed that Superman watched a purse-snatching right in front of him and didn't give a hoot. That's where the lack of urgency taints the character.But, hey, Indy (and the film) worked for you, not for me. Fair enough. I'm not trying to argue away your reaction to it. I truly wish I'd responded to it as you did.On a different subject though: In my earlier comment I said, in essence, that Spielberg has earned the benefit of the doubt in some areas. But at the same time, I wonder if ""Raiders"" would have taken off if Spielberg made it in the CGI era.Judging by this movie, the boulder, the snakes, the plane that chews the bald dude's head, the truck that Indy slides under and behind, all that would have been digital. Spielberg and Lucas can pretend all they want that digital is as visceral as old-fashioned movie magic (real snakes, real plane, real truck, etc.), but it just isn't. Or am I alone here?Let's remember that ""Jaws"" was saved by a shark that didn't work (prompting Steve to rely on the fear of the unseen, which is much more effective). Let's remember that in ""Raiders"" he kept asking for more and more snakes, because the floor had to crawl. And crawl it did. Just like the tomb in ""Last Crusade"" crawled with rats. And then you get to ""Crystal Skull,"" and, forget about monkey business, what about the ants? Do the ants rival the snakes or the rats? Is it anywhere close?Many of the gimmicks in ""Crystal Skull"" are good gimmicks, or just as good as those in the original trilogy. But they are so empty, thin, so EASY. I can't imagine a young Spielberg, desperate to prove himself, accepting digital. I think he would have found it to be the easy way out, except when there was no other option. But now it's as if Spielberg thinks he's earned the right to give us a cartoon. I think that's a step back. It's as if Spielberg is at his best when challenged. ""Crystal Skull"" feels mailed-in. As you know, Keith, I dug it a lot, too; and, boy, what an essay! Thanks! I saw it twice in two days and I really think it's kinda great -- in a distinctly ""late Spielberg"" way, as opposed to the ""early Spielberg"" style of the first three. Like Matt said up top, a big part of it is the role Kaminski's played in that evolution: as much as Spielberg said he tried to turn back his style clock, I don't think it's possible for him and Kaminski to shoot the way he and Slocombe shot pictures. And I think that's a good thing. As much as I still dig the ""crisp"" look of the first three (as Joel said), that hovering that's come to define the Spielberg-Kaminski aesthetic is ridiculously cool and appetizing. After seeing the first show possible on Thursday (at the wonderful Castro Theatre in San Francisco; go!), all day Friday I thought about how delicious a Spielberg movie looks. If I could, I'd eat that shot of Indy running his car into Spalko's, slamming her car together with Marion's on the left side of that jungle divide (is that a tree?), that sends Spalko onto Marion's car and Mutt onto Spalko's in turn. It's a three second shot, maybe, but damn if that lateral move doesn't tickle me right. Indeed: I don't need mushrooms when there's this and _Speed Racer_ on movie screens. This falls under the heading of ""stuff you complain about only when you didn't like the movie.... It also reminds me of a conversation overheard during the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie ""Sudden Death,"" between two guys who spent a good part of the movie counting how many bullets each character fired and complaining if they fired more bullets than a particular firearm could hold in real life.True, but the comparison is telling. I think we all expect more from Spielberg than Van Damme. And the monkey army, I have to say, is well beneath both. (As for the aliens, don't get me started.)Eloquent arguments, as to be expected, from Keith, Matt, et al, but I'm with Jason on this one. I can see how Indy's motivations could be interpreted -- he's old, he's tired, he's a veteran, he's learned to make compromises -- but that's the viewer doing Spielberg/Lucas/Koepp's work for them. There's nothing wrong with a little mystery and interpretation, but ultimately the onus should be on the filmmakers to make the case -- as they did for me, with varying degrees of success, in the first three films. If they miss wide of the mark, then all the other distractions (monkeys, prairie dogs, goddamn aliens) become much more glaring, and I think they fit into an Indiana Jones movie about as well as Shia LaBeouf would be if he wandered into Meerkat Manor (although, if they were man-eating meerkats, the latter might at least be amusing). MZS: This falls under the heading of ""stuff you complain about only when you didn't like the movie.""Exactly. I'm in agreement on some of the complaints with Koepp's flat script, but this is an Indiana Jones movie. Plausibility is not something worth seeking here. I appreciated the shot of the ""lead lined"" notice on the fridge before Indy climbed into it, as if Spielberg were giving the audience something upon which to hang their suspension of disbelief.Marion's drive onto the branch was the equivalent of Indy's faith leap in Last Crusade; I liked how that bookended. Shia's CGI swing with the monkeys made me cringe, but the homage to Tarzan was right in line with the Indy series' serial based roots. It was goofy but I got over it.I am not in love with the movie, as Keith and Matt are. It's a good time waster, and there certainly are deeper themes about aging and family to be found, but there were times I felt disengaged from the movie and I have to blame the screenplay. Dialogue goes clunk and  whatever feelings I felt by seeing Marion and Indy reunited came more from my history with the first film than anything written for this one. The Ray Winstone character was also mishandled; at first I thought his constant reappearance was a play on how Indy's Benedict Arnolds (like the monkey or Alfred Molina) meet their demise soonafter the betrayal, but I realized it's just sloppy writing.Cate Blanchett didn't even bother to keep her accent, not that it was good in the first place. Her Aussie accent kept peeking through; she sounded like Crocodile Tolstoy. Every time I looked at her, I saw her Pushing Tin co-star Angelina Jolie in this role (sort of like Jolie's turn in Sky Captain). Lucas said she was supposed to be dominatrix-like, something Jolie would have pulled off with ease. Blanchett isn't scary enough to make someone use their safe word. Her fencing duel was a lot of fun, though. Temple of Doom still ranks last on my Indy-o-meter, but this one didn't make me as sorry as I thought I'd be. I enjoyed it more than I expected, flaws and all.Oh yeah, many of the complaints here seem to be basing the criticism off what they wanted to see, not what they got. Anybody complaining about aliens in a Spielberg-Lucas movie hasn't been paying attention to the directors' work. Anybody complaining about aliens in a Spielberg-Lucas movie hasn't been paying attention to the directors' work.Or, we have paid attention and been-there/seen-that fatigue has set in.In any case, context is everything. Aliens in E.T. and Close Encounters -- no problem. Aliens in Indiana Jones -- potentially more plausible than if they'd popped up in, say, Empire of the Sun, but other than Cate Blanchett's faint resemblance to a Vulcan, the movie didn't make the case for me. Aliens in Indiana Jones -- potentially more plausible than if they'd popped up in, say, Empire of the Sun, but other than Cate Blanchett's faint resemblance to a Vulcan, the movie didn't make the case for me.I don't get what you mean by this.  Why should the film have to make a case for aliens?  Aliens are just a storytelling a tool.  In some films they do exist, and other movies they don't.  You might as well say ""The Last Crusade"" is lousy because it didn't make a convincing enough case for the existence of Jesus. I thought for sure that Odie would get up and leave the theater when the monkey's went on the attack.  As my brother leaned over and said to me when Mutt morphed into Tarzan: ""Swinging on vines like Tarzan is never a good idea.""  Indeed, that was the groaning moment in OctopussyMy two cents: I was excited that the film was much better than I thought it would be, though it still doesn't rank up there with Raiders or Temple.  I confess to losing some interest in the alien plot stuff and the chase through the rain forest went on so long that it started to drag and I was wondering what the point was.  But then it turned into ""Lenigen vs. the Ants"" and things picked back up.  I was awestruck at the gargantuan carbon footprint of the aliens.  The highlights were the campus chase and the nuclear explosion (Keith laid out some fine analysis on the latter).Connecting this film to previous discussions from the Indie blog-o-thon, I couldn't help but wonder what the difference was for Spielberg in depicting Soviets in this film and Nazis in the first trilogy.  Perhaps he needs to make the equivalent of a Schindler's List showing the horrors communism to realize he did it again.But alas, the movie was great fun and I didn't need any dialogue to feel the chemistry between Marion and Indy. Good stuff. Re: the presence of aliens in an Indy movie. As I mentioned above, I think that the sci-fi ""artifact"" is a stroke of brilliance, demonstrating the shift in pop culture into the atomic age. In all the movies, the artifact that Indy pursues promises some sort of otherworldly gift to mortals: eternal power, eternal youth, and in this case eternal knowledge. In 1957, it seems appropriate the aliens who materialized out of another dimension were just ""gods"" by any other name. And in the age of Oppenheimer, having both the knowedlge and the power to radically transform earth's inhabitants is no longer a bedtime fairy tale; it's an imminent threat to life as we know it. I can't defend the execution, but the ideas behind this movie's story are both clever and appropriate to the era. I don't get what you mean by this. Why should the film have to make a case for aliens? Aliens are just a storytelling a tool. In some films they do exist, and other movies they don't.I guess I meant that it felt less like an Indiana Jones movie than a third-rate episode of The X-Files. I don't think Last Crusade is without its problems either, but Boam did a better job at integrating the Grail Quest (mainly through Henry Sr.) than Koepp does with his plot device here. Just my opinion. This movie can't be judged on terms of good or bad. It's a gleeful updating of a bad 1950s movie. That's the point. It's not taking something bad and trying to redo it as something good. It's just a big budget modernization of it.Even the filmmaking is playing off its cheesy references. Anybody notice that in the crypt Indy asks Mutt to shine the torch because he needs light -- yet the set is obviously completely over-lit? Or, even better: the scene at the diner where the camera first shows us that Indy is sitting right in front of the window/wall -- then we suddenly cut to an OTS that ridiculously puts the camera in a location that's already been established where it can't physically go.It's like if Godard directed a blockbuster. The best review that I've come across - you've so succinctly worded how I feel about Indy amongst the suburban facade and about-to-erupt nuclear rubble.What really galvanized me (even choked me up) was to think back to that golden, sun-crisp, horizon-fade of LAST CRUSADE - with Brody and Jones, Sr. in tow - after we've learned of their passing (via some expository convo with the Brody stand-in, Jim Broadbent). It's a beautifully crafted moment, and just one of many that I can't wait to see again. Marion's drive onto the branch was the equivalent of Indy's faith leap in Last Crusade.I gotta disagree with this -- on two levels -- and think it serves to illustrate the central problem many of us have with the film.1.  The leap of faith was a critical moment for both the character and the story.  Yes, it was largely an 'unreal' moment, like the branch, but it was central to Indy's journey of embracing the reality of his father's obsession.  Additionally, it was also key to building up a sense of awe for the audience to buy into the idea that this really could be the resting place of the grail.  The branch sequence, however, does little for the character.  I get that it's meant to show that Marion is not just a damsel in distress, but there was little doubt that she was that kind of woman to begin with.  Imagine the exact same moment with an otherwise flighty and fearful heroine.  Now it means something.  As to story -- yes, it gets them in the water, but there was no danger for her to escape by that point: the Russians were already climbing down the cliff, and there were no more ants in the car (miraculously -- don't get me started on the editing of the entire jungle sequence) .2.  Before his leap of faith, Indy's scared.  He's nervous and not sure it'll work.  And when it does, he's even more amazed than the audience.  He feels for us.  We feel more a part of the adventure because of his emotional reaction to it.By contrast, Marion has it all planned out, it works exactly as she expected -- nothing goes wrong, there's not even a moment where she thinks ""uh oh, maybe this was a bad idea"" -- and we don't get a woop of unmitigated joy, or even a sense that maybe her feined bravura was just that, when something so amazing does work.Simply:  that short scene sums up everything that was wrong with the movie.  I thik if nothing else, the resonance of the Indy films -- in tone at least -- is about the characters' real reactions to the unreal.  His hand hurts when he punches someone.  You can see him realize at times that he's in honest-to-god mortal danger.  Things almost always go wrong the first (and sometimes second and third) times, and then when they do turn out alright, he's both amazed and thrilled.After all that, I should say I didn't hate the movie and -- apart from the branch scene and the monkeys -- I didn't even mind some of the more absurd moments.  However, unlike the original films, the characters rarely were used to enhance the action, the drama or the even the sense of sacred. That would have been nice. Finally saw Skull last night -- as it happens, the first of the Indy movies that I have seen without my father (he's not dead, just retired to the country) -- and I liked it quite a bit, althought not so much as to overlook its flaws entirely.First, the script was, as noted, about as flat and disappointing as the modern blockbuster-manufacturing industry can produce.  John Rogers goes on and damned on about screenwriting and ""breaking the story"" over at Kung Fu Monkey, but I've never understood why every character in every big, expensive movie has to express him- or herself in the language of the first draft, even as the beats of plot and action reflect, for good and for ill, the gangwar years of battling drafts and credit controversies (""How many aliens?"" is worth fighting over, for Lucas and Spielberg; ""If you want to be an archaeologist, you have to get out of the library,"" said in a library, is apparently sufficiently witty).Second, ""Mac"" was a drag and a waste of celluloid from the moment he survived the warehouse.Third, I really wish we had seen three or four more Indy movies in the interim: Indy in Berlin, Indy chasing the Spear of Longinus in the South of France, Indy punching out the Ahnenerbe in Iceland, Indy running from the Arab-American Oil Company in the City of the Sands in the early '50s, Indy's father's diegetic death and consequently articulated regrets of being (to his knowledge) childless, etc., etc.  In another universe, people are laughing and chatting about references to Indiana Jones and the Army of Ghosts or whatnot as they leave Skull, and I assume it is a more satisfying experience.Fourth, where the hell was Sallah?Fifth, and a bit more seriously, density is a problem in the Indy movies, and miscalbration is a corollary to the texture lost when Indy survives a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator: Raiders was ideal -- a persuasive McGuffin, smooth details, convincing backstories implied in Belloq and Marion, relatively realistic infrastructure (the Nazis brought archaeological dig teams, trucks, soldiers, airplanes); Doom was too dense, sodden with an excess of gore and unfashionable racial implications, with an unappealing McGuffin; Crusade was too light, as its long-lost hiding place was too well-lighted, without the well-integrated teams of villain support staff that Raiders had, and a highly sectarian McGuffin.  Skull's skylighted tombs and caverns were sort of silly. Something I forgot to add:And as for Skull's density, there seemed to be an awful lot of things floating (on the river, in the air, on the antigravity ether). I find myself agreeing with most of what the naysayers have been saying, except that I enjoyed myself. But this movie is far worse than the other three. The opening is horrible. Utterly boring. But the movie ultimately won me over with its sheer silliness.The nuclear blast was odd.  It was here that the movie first became interesting for me, though the movie feints in the direction of seriousness which it then ignores.I don't buy Indy as having been an anti-communist spy. At all. While I agree with Jason Bellamy's review at the Cooler, I had to do some soul searching to figure out why I left the theater with half a smile on my face.  Half of the half smile was a stunning ""I can't believe they just did that…a “Close Encounters"" plot?  Really?  I really disliked it and found it an odd choice, only not so much.  We're dealing with the same guy who gave us the original Star Wars as well as ET, MIB, AI, etc…  We should have seen this coming.  Instead it felt contrived, easy, and not as cool as a real ‘50s era film could have been using the true Indy identity.  I wanted adventures that didn’t foreshadow aliens the entire time.  Too easy.  I wonder what the other script drafts look like that they worked on for so many years.Not a great movie, but I feel the actors didn't screw anything up.  Screenplay and plot...yikes!  The actors all get a pass.  It was nice to see Marion as her true self—without so much work done on her face that she actually looked like she had aged (I’d say well) along with Indy.As a decades long Indy fan who has been known to ruin evenings for others by quoting lines from the first three movies during viewings, this film ranks third for me.  I still have no flesh-barbequing desire to see Temple of Doom from my collection ever again.I’m disappointed, not devastated, as I thought I was going to be.  I’ve finally come to terms with the reasons for this:  I love the characters and it was good to see them back on the big screen; I had fun identifying and smiling in my head wherever scenes gave nods to similar ones from the previous films – which basically made up the entire film-- (the statue of Marcus Brody being hit by the Ruskies’ car and busting their windshield with his head); Oh, and did I mention I was an Indy fan? I can only imagine what the kids who were in diapers when Indy last graced the screen think about this mess. I saw it Friday with my kids, who are 7, 9, and 11.  For them, this was their first real experience with Indiana Jones; they had seen bits and pieces -- and Lego versions -- of the original trilogy, but never an entire movie.  I warned them that every Indiana Jones movie has gruesome deaths, so they were well-prepared.They loved it, I loved it.  There's a lot of griping around about obvious CGI but since I had already suspended my disbelief about the time Indy was tossing handfuls of gunpowder in the warehouse, it failed to register.  The ants were damned creepy.  The only thing that made me groan was Mutt swinging through the vines, and everything else -- including Cate Blanchett's accent - - was just seasoning for the delightfully goofy stew.I admit I'm hopelessly bourgeois, but ""you have to get out of the library,"" in the context in which it was delivered, was funny enough for me and apparently every one else in the full-house 1:30 matinée showing.I expected this movie to be tired, evoking a ""why did they bother?"" vibe.  I would really like to see it again.Keith & Matt thank you both for giving form to some of my feelings. Perhaps one way to bridge the critical gap here is to say that it's a mediocre movie (thanks to all the plot holes and story gaps people have mentioned) but a very good film (because Spielberg keeps those signifiers rolling)...? Count me among the folks who found Indy 4 disappointing in its sloppiness. (For what it's worth, my reaction was more negative after the first viewing, but softened the second time around.) I found the first forty-five minutes solid enough, but the movie goes slack right around the time Indy and Mutt procure the skull, and gets progressively worse from that point on. And the script throughout, be it due to Koepp, Lucas, or one of the earlier drafters, is terrible. (What's more, Ray Winstone, John Hurt, and poor Karen Allen are all wasted.)""This falls under the heading of 'stuff you complain about only when you didn't like the movie.""Maybe, maybe not...but there's a lot more of this stuff in Indy IV than the earlier films. Even notwithstanding the fridge (which I liked), the rubberband tree, waterfalls, and Tarzan Mutt (which I hated), the script is shot through with continuity errors. Why doesn't Indy know Spalko's name at his debriefing? (He just yelled it at her 5 min. earlier.) How did the baddies follow the Team Indy Power Rangers past the disappearing stairs? If the sand has never been released, who are all those bodies at the bottom? Are the natives living or dead? If the former, what are they doing in the walls? If the latter, why do poison darts and machine guns kill them? Sloppy.Yes, I realize that the Indyverse has always involved suspension of disbelief. (How did Indy survive the sub ride in Raiders, for example?) But Crystal Skull is rife with ridiculousness, when it's not drowning in exposition or poorly written bon mots. ""Their treasure wasn't gold, it was knowledge. Knowledge was their treasure."" Yes, you just said that. Lawrence Kasdan, this isn't.All in all, I didn't hate the movie. (As I said, I liked it enough to see it twice.) But, given the two decades the team had to formulate a decent script, I found the finished product disappointingly poor. My theory on the whole driving onto the branch bit - it took awhile before Marion got back to pick up Indy and Ox.  Isn't it likely that she took a minute to figure out an escape route?  It wasn't a leap of faith, it was a cunning plan. I read this movie as straight-up self-parody. I thought the Paramount mountain getting pulverized was a big clue that this was going to be a movie that pulverized the conventions of the earlier movies. So I'm not sure why anybody is implying that this movie is somehow less than what its creators intended. This is basically the ""Bride"" to the earlier films' ""Frankenstein,"" and as such, it's pretty damn brilliant. I think you can argue preference, but not aesthetics. If you want a wiseass, dark, urgent movie for younger men, this is not your film ... a point it explicitly makes several times.If any other director on this planet made a movie in which Indiana Jones met aliens/AI robots from other Spielberg movies, we would hail him as 1) a genius, or 2) Philip Jose Farmer. I think Devin hits the nail on the head. If you watch the sequence, Marian first sees the cliff and looks over and you see her smile. It then cuts away from her and back to Indy, and the rest. Later when she rescues everyone and guns the engine to drive off the cliff she is doing exactly what she already figured out in her head. This is the 'spunky' Marian we all met at the very start of Raiders (not the screaming banshee in the middle and end of Raiders), and it was nice to see that version of her in this movie. Actually, Chris P above has it right, though there's no arguement that Marion knows exactly what she's doing. Here's an except, more above:""Marion has it all planned out, it works exactly as she expected -- nothing goes wrong, there's not even a moment where she thinks ""uh oh, maybe this was a bad idea"" -- and we don't get a woop of unmitigated joy, or even a sense that maybe her feined bravura was just that, when something so amazing does work. Simply: that short scene sums up everything that was wrong with the movie.""I couldn't have said it better. This is a movie void of suspense or tension. To which I say that we do get that sense of unmitigated joy in Karen Allen's smile after the stunt works, a visual cue that rhymes with her beatific reaction to Indy's ""none of them [the other women in my life] were you"" and with her mad ""are we still alive?"" laughter after they go over the three waterfalls.Despite its surface appearances (and based on my two viewings) I think this is a movie of tremendous subtlety and untold depth, and all the more impressive for the ease (as only a genre specialist like Spielberg could accomplish) with which it is executed.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2008"," 
Confronting perhaps his two greatest - and strangest - challenges to date in this eagerly anticipated fourth installment, Indiana Jones faces down a nuclear mushroom cloud and also possible revelations around his brand new identity as, well, a baby daddy. And in no way a guy to let age cramp his style, this feisty senior is still into mowing down his opponents with the brain and somewhat less brawn that typifies his both stylish and zany frantic antics. We meet up again with the daredevil university academic in the midst of the Cold War. Indiana has been kidnapped by a Soviet military regiment disguised as US soldiers, and transported via car trunk to a nuclear facility in the New Mexico desert in order to assist in divulging top secrets. Presiding over the Soviet infiltrators is saber swinging Colonel Spalko who is determined to raise her IQ by acquiring telepathic powers.(Cate Blanchett, segueing from doing Bob Dylan to an icy Marlene Dietrich impersonation). Indiana escapes via a handy flying fridge and returns home, only to now find himself a victim of the Red Scare, as he's suspected of consorting with the KGB by the FBI and driven out of his teaching position. Disgusted with the paranoid turn the country has taken, as the government seems to 'see communists in our soup,' Indiana takes off for a new back-to-nature excellent adventure in search of the mythic omnipotent Crystal Skull. And he's apparently in league with local motorcyle punk and brand new sidekick Mutt (Shia LaBoeuf), jetting off to Inca turf in Peru. And with Doc Spalko and her menacing minions in hot pursuit. 
Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, though tempting viewers the fourth time around, feels fresh and alive as ever with its combination period charm (the Good Humor Ice Cream truck, a desert roadside Atomic Cafe, Elvis jiving, and Howdy Doody on the TV), humble heroics, kooky better-late-than-never romance, and fairly breathtaking though at times overly long clash-and-dash interludes. And yes, despite some impossibly cartoonish Soviet dumbell meanies, hokey abracadabra escapades, caricatured howling jungle tribes, and absolutely no explanation for these white guy tropical trespassers presuming a license to loot. But while Indiana goes about his business shake-rattle-and-rolling around the tropics, dodging red ant stampedes, cracking secret codes and heads alike, unwrapping undead Inca corpses and separating inconceivable arti-facts from fictions as brainiacs and bad guys collide, Spielberg keeps viewers captivated for the duration. Just because there's never a temptation to take any of it too self-seriously, a potential kiss of death for any blockbuster adventure. Not to mention that humor is always a special effects plus.

"May 24, 2008"," With his crooked smile, famous fedora and trusty bullwhip, one of our favorite action heroes returns to the screen in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Played for the fourth time by Harrison Ford, Indy still charms and delights us. Hes a little worse for wear physically but just as dedicated to finding incredible artifacts, no matter how dangerous that may be -- unless snakes are involved, of course. This time Indy gets drawn into the search for a mysterious crystal skull. His major rival? A ruthless Soviet agent, portrayed to the hilt by Cate Blanchett, who desires this strange object for her own nefarious purposes relating to the Cold War. Plot takes a back seat to fast-paced action and amazing set pieces in this latest Indiana Jones outing. Thats no surprise, for we expect to be thrilled while watching Indy escape harrowing chases and fight his way out of desperate situations. But there are surprises here, including one relating to a new character played by Shia LaBeouf and a second involving old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). From its exciting opening sequence to its clever closing scene, Crystal Skull made me grateful to Steven Spielberg for deciding to film another Indiana Jones adventure. Spielberg definitely knows what viewers enjoy seeing on the big screen: humor, action, suspense and characters we care about.  Crystal Skull, however, belongs to 64-year-old Ford. His Indiana Jones may be older now, but he looks terrific. I understand Ford spent a great deal of time in the gym preparing for this film -- and it shows. Also, Fords ability to project a wonderful wry humor hasnt dimmed one bit. Welcome back, Indiana Jones! ",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2008","Indy, it's great to have you back. When's the next one?",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2008"," Well, boys and girls, here’s a sequel some 19 years 
		in the making. Watching Harrison Ford put on the brown fedora (- 
		Which really should be more beat-up than it looks) for the fourth 
		time as the archeologist and part time college prof, Dr. Henry “Indiana” 
		Jones is as familiar as putting on your favourite pair of sneakers, but 
		this time around the kicks have lost some bounce. The lowdown: Our erstwhile adventurer is in the 
		1950’s Nevada desert delivered in the trunk of a car driven by a mob of 
		KGB agents.  Mother Russia wants to get her rosy mitts on a certain 
		artifact known to Dr. Jones, an artifact that will allow Russia to - 
		wait for it - rule the world! It is the crystal skull of the title that 
		we discover is some sort of psychic brainwave amplifier which will allow 
		the Russians mind-control over the earth’s population. Missiles, we 
		don’t need no stinkin’ missiles! The action then shifts south of the 
		border as Jones is accosted by a young man called Mutt ( Sean 
		Connery, Indy 3, ""We named the dog Indiana"" - geddit?) who tells him 
		two of his associates, including the fabulously feisty Marion Ravenwood 
		from Raiders of the Lost Ark, are being held captive by the Russians. So 
		it’s have whip, will travel, as Jones makes his way to a Mayan Temple in 
		Peru (?!) to find the origins of the skull and to save his friends. Our familiarity with the Indiana Jones legend is 
		taken for granted and sometimes smacks of presumption. Indeed, seeing 
		composer John Williams' name appear on the opening credits gave me a 
		fannish squee at his return as another essential part of the heart of 
		the Raiders team. Little did I know that for the first time in history 
		my patience with a Williams score would be sorely tested as the seminal 
		Indy theme is used ad-nauseum throughout the film. By the 300th 
		motif, I was sure the piece was being used as some sort of 
		not-so-subliminal “applause” sign, letting the punters know when we were 
		supposed to ooh and ahh at a particularly clever or awe-inspiring 
		moment. Thank you sirs, but I can make up my own mind there. So can the 
		entire generation who has grown up without a new Indiana Jones feature 
		in the cinemas and will be looking at this film on its own merits 
		despite being continually urged to cheer. This is not to say any of the fault of the where 
		Indy 4 veers off course has anything to do with Harrison Ford. Indeed, 
		Harrison Indiana Solo Ford is more than primed for the task and as we’re 
		shown in a funny decontamination sequence, Gramps isn’t shy of a 
		six-pack. Ford’s as up for it as ever and while there must’ve been a 
		corps of  stuntmen subbing in the higher-demand action scenes for the 
		sixty-six year old actor, Ford throws himself into the chase with 
		unbridled glee. There’s a lot more running, jumping and climbing trees 
		from the fetching senior citizen than one might think. And bless, I 
		doubt there’s any other actor of his years that could pull off his 
		boyish rakishness as he butts heads with the KGB, FBI, a Red-baiting 
		college administration and angry Mayans. He can still deliver the funny 
		as well; the quicksand scene is silly but pretty priceless. Cate 
		Blanchett stretches no muscles other than those in her fencing arm as a 
		Russian spy complete with Louise Brooks shellacked bob and Natasha 
		Badenov accent. Early on her character is established to have some vague 
		psychic powers and it’s a device that goes nowhere past the first and 
		last scenes. Ray Winstone hasn’t much to do as a possible double/triple 
		agent. The only person besides Ford who looks genuinely happy to be 
		there is Karen Allen as Marion, whose energy gives a big jump start to a 
		film that has a lot of flat moments. Shia LaBeouf’s casting worried me 
		because I just don’t see in him as the refreshing new talent so many 
		seem to. He’s the same in every film I’ve seen him to varied effect. As 
		he literally rolls onto the screen in head-to-toe Wild One drag complete 
		with Marlon Brando cap and leather jacket badges, I never once believed 
		him to be some juvenile delinquent, but he keeps up with Ford without 
		saying too much, so it’s okay. I was afraid that like Richard Dreyfus 
		who I absolutely loathed as a full-on irritant in Spielberg’s Jaws (- 
		Team Shaw every time), LaBeouf was going to wear the mantle of 
		Spielberg avatar in this film and I’m happy to say not so much. Still, I 
		wasn’t alone in the cinema when I breathed a sigh of relief that the 
		fedora seems passed over the whippersnapper. Oh, and I protest the lack 
		of Sallah! For all that I kvetch I couldn’t hate the film 
		entirely. Mostly because of Ford and Allen and their infectious

"May 23, 2008"," by Walter Chaw Let’s talk about hats–fedoras, in particular, and how they evolved from the image of the hard-boiled detective in the American noir cycle into the chapeau-of-choice for Coppola’s gangsters in the anti-hero ’70s. How Harrison Ford’s Deckard from Blade Runner was originally conceived with one of the hats to go with his trench coat before Raiders of the Lost Ark made an American icon out of Ford’s swashbuckling archaeologist Indiana Jones, and how that didn’t stop child-killing child-molester Freddy Krueger from getting a fedora (singed and blood-stained, but so was Indy’s) in 1984–the same year, as it happens, that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas turned their American icon into the star of his own horror movie with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The relationship between Americans and the hats their heroes wear is a complicated one. A Freudian would offer that hats are tumescent–the loci of masculine power, a metaphor for the penis/head–and that losing a hat is the equivalent of castration. My favourite example of that theory in practice is Joel McCrea losing his in a field of windmills to the trilling, mocking laughter of ladylove Laraine Day in Foreign Correspondent. The Coen Brothers make it a throughline in Miller’s Crossing, too, as Tom loses and reclaims his hat in cycles of power and powerlessness. I think it means something in the fourth Indiana Jones flick that evil Russkie Spalko tips the brim of Indy’s hat in an attempt to read his mind instead of knocking it off entirely. Here in 1981, when fedoras were mainly still just popular shorthand that a film was a period piece, comes self-centred, glory-hungry, mostly irresponsible, philandering, unpleasant, probably-colonial beefstick Indiana Jones, striding off the pages of pulp adventure comics and Saturday-afternoon matinee serials square into the first Reagan administration. He was the first time-traveller in a decade of them, and his popularity and the reasons for it are in lockstep with Reagan’s in hindsight: We like these guys because even though they’re assholes, they’re our assholes. We created them. We are in tune with the purity and simplicity of their bellicosity. They are the perfect avatars for the kingdom of halcyon boyhood that has within its borders the city on the hill, shining there in the middle of that Morning in America. The only tragedy of Indiana Jones is that rather than continue to reflect the waxing and waning of the brutal felicity of our national identity, it only came to reflect the softening and equivocation of Lucas and Spielberg, the most fiscally successful of the Film Brat generation, swallowed whole by the lie of their responsibility to the audiences they created. By the myth of themselves, metastasizing the frustrated invention of the outsider into the onanistic call-outs that mar most of Stephen King’s work from the last twenty years. (Yes, we know you invented a couple of cities in Maine; get an editor.) It’s often said, and it’s more true than not true, that Spielberg has been making and remaking Jaws and E.T. since 1982. The greatest irony, of course, is that that popular audience was reared on the diet of despair and darkness fed them by their blockbusters: Luke losing his hand and discovering that daddy is Hitler; Brody getting slapped by “that Kintner boy”‘s grieving mother; Roy abandoning his young family to go fly around with aliens. How about a Nazi, a Frog, and another Nazi getting their faces melted off by a Jewish WMD while Indy and his girlfriend avert its gaze? The run-up to the unbearable slightness of summer movies was, in fact, the tailings of the New American Cinema, the paranoid cinema of the American 1970s. Whatever made Spielberg think he needed to impose happy endings and framing stories on his films is, at the end, a larger tragedy than whatever it was that made Lucas a simpering, anti-intellectual douchebag (my guess is it has everything to do with his 1983 divorce from Marcia Griffin: his brain, courage, and heart). Spielberg was the real deal–and the only movie he’s done since E.T. with any balls is the chilly Catch Me If You Can. He has a million-dollar arm, though I have a good idea about that ten-cent head of his. But in 1981, fresh off his first real disaster (1941) and united with buddy Lucas, Spielberg had something to prove. And so, he proved it with the impossibly good Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones (Ford) is an archaeology professor who moonlights as a tomb raider, scouring the planet for artifacts buried in jungles and deserts where they’re watched over by deadly boobytraps, unpopular religions, and deadlier brown men. He’s armed with a whip, a pistol, and his two fists; accompanied always by a fedora that, by the third film, gains a kind of anthropomorphic half-life (it’s like a movie where the hero’s penis is addressed as a person); and in this one, he’s joined by a girl, Marion (Karen Allen), he abandoned ten years earlier but with whom he reunites now that he needs an artifact in her possession. He’s a cad, and she treats him like one when, after a thrilling opening sequence that is among the most imitated and excerpted in film history, he shows up at her Nepalese bar one wintry night, demanding it as a favour for the greater good. It seems the Nazis also want Marion’s doodad as a piece of the puzzle to the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant–the vessel that supposedly holds the original tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want to use it as an occult weapon of mass destruction; Indy just wants to put it in a museum. The compromise is that the faceless U.S. government buries it deep in Xanadu. Raiders of the Lost Ark is Spielberg’s homage/fare-thee-well to unequivocal filmmaking when he’s finally earned the right, once and for all, to make whatever he damn well pleases into eternity. Why (how?) does one “sell out” when one is writing the rules of the game as he goes along? At its heart, the Indiana Jones saga is about the excavation and cultivation of nostalgia. It’s about curating found objects and the essential, primal power of the past to affect the present. It posits film as the ultimate repository of mythology, single-handedly, through its agency, giving tactility to The Bible (Old Testament in this one, New in The Last Crusade), pagan religions (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), and, finally, America’s own well of souls in the unapologetically fantastic first forty American minutes of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The first film also has the audacity to give its hero a job as a tenured professor in some stuffy new world University–one of the last holdovers from the ’70s, placing Raiders of the Lost Ark as, along with the previous year’s The Empire Strikes Back, a transitional film between an era interested in Clark Kent and one mostly interested in Superman. Arrayed against Jones are rival archaeologist Belloq (Paul Freeman) and Nazi stooge Major Toht (Ronald Lacey), the one in the employ of the other and, like Jones, more interested in the historical importance of the prize than in its military application. Jones and Belloq (as Belloq says in the preamble) are essentially the same creature, and by the last film, Indy’s long lost, recently-unearthed son Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) will refer to him, repeatedly and accurately, as a grave-robber. The harsh irony of Raiders is that after all the dust settles, the United States government puts the Ark deep in storage in an endless warehouse; the harsh irony of the quadrilogy is that, after four films, the series agrees that wisdom is dangerous and brings no profit to the wise. Still trailing the last noble vestiges of the ’70s behind it, Raiders of the Lost Ark remains about uncovering, exposing, and discovering that best efforts come to naught in the face of our ever-expanding, faceless, monolithic government. Presented as a re-creation of Golden Age serials, it’s a model of not just ’70s paranoia and the veneration of the anti-hero, but also the idea that Weapons of Mass Destruction are holy objects that don’t injure the righteous and, fascinatingly, are perhaps even punishments for unbelievers1. The entire series will eventually equate The Bomb with God. It was the perfect movie for the 1980s, and it made the society of humans living underground and worshipping an atomic bomb in 1970’s Beneath the Planet of the Apes more prophecy than science-fiction. There’s surprisingly little action in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it cooks like the proverbial motherfucker. In addition to the opening temple-run with giant boulder and duplicitous aide/lackey Sapito (Alfred Molina), there’s a confrontation in Marion’s bar, a fight in an Egyptian bazaar (Tunisia subbing), a fistfight with a giant bald German guy, and then an amazing truck chase. The rest rotates between what is basically a romantic triangle between Belloq, Marion, and Jones and the basics of an adventure plot that leads Jones to, eventually, the back of a U-boat and a deserted island chosen as a test site for the opening of the Ark.2 Both elements–the action and the exposition–are wondrously devoted to character development, and, more importantly, the film as a whole is frighteningly attuned to the wave as it was turning back to shore in 1981. The secret to Lucas and Spielberg’s eternity is that they were surfing in the sweet spot of the zeitgeist tube, whether or not they had any idea what the hell they were doing. Watching Spielberg come up with gags for the film–even accidental ones like Ford contracting dysentery or something and being too sick to shoot an elaborate swordfight sequence, leading to his pulling a pistol in the film’s second-best joke–are acts of creation akin to what I imagine Rilke was acting like when he wrote his Sonnets to Orpheus. I think of Belloq describing the Ark as a means through which to directly speak with God when I consider that Raiders of the Lost Ark is more or less evidence of Spielberg doing exactly that. Consider that scene where Toht pulls out a torture device to reveal, after a perfectly calibrated, perfectly weighted beat, that it’s…a coat-hanger. It’s a moment that speaks to not just Toht’s menace but to his vanity as well–and it reminds at a crucial juncture that the film is wry and aware of itself. Like that moment where Marion flips a mirror in a steamship stateroom and Spielberg does the old bit of a long shot where you can hear Indy’s scream, then the dusty, almost Vaudevillian punchline of Marion asking if he’s said something. Like that moment where Belloq eats a fly while waxing messianic about the Ark. The picture is unpredictable, dazzlingly so, and only partly because it walks the line between farce and horror with unconscious grace. No wonder it’s not only one of the most fiscally successful films of all time, but one of the most critically respected, too. George Lucas finishes his first Star Wars trilogy two years later with the comparatively weak and crowd-pleasing Return of the Jedi–the clues to the conspicuous softening of his middle coming first when he changed the keyword of that title from “revenge,” next when he decided to go to a planet of teddy bears rather than Wookiees, and lastly when he decided to let Lando live. For all the reasons to divorce George Lucas in the early-Eighties, Marcia probably left him because his scrotum fell off and/or as a result of which he stopped listening to her. Just as Lucas followed his greatest artistic success (The Empire Strikes Back) with Raiders, he again collaborated with Spielberg on the heels of Jedi with what was then called Raiders 2: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Hotly-anticipated, as would become de rigueur in the blockbuster ’80s, this sequel finds Lucas in a sour mood and Spielberg, too, who frankly would have probably made a film like Temple of Doom whatever his mood given that his gratefulness to Lucas for limiting his losing streak to one film seems to mean he’ll do anything Lucas wants him to do. For many, Exhibit A in that contention is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But to the matter at hand, Temple of Doom is an unbelievably crass, unpleasant, horrific picture that trades as its currency the exact sensibilities it purported to import from 1930s Republic serials. Sledgehammer racist, gleefully misogynistic, unapologetically crude, ignorant, vile in almost every respect, it’s also machine-tooled in its efficiency as an action-delivery system, and it uses its abominations as the means by which we’re kept, for the duration, completely uncomfortable. Notoriously the main reason the MPAA created the PG-13 rating (as a sop to Masters of the Universe Spielberg/Lucas, who apparently wanted to fuck up as many children as possible), the violence and the gore don’t begin to describe the all-consuming atmosphere of wrong the film exudes. It is every bit the movie it would have been pre-Code; the only thing missing, really, is an African-American Stepin Fetchit butler/nanny archetype for uncomfortable comic relief. Lucas would circle back around to take care of that with Episode I. It’s relentless, dada almost; to an 11-year-old me, Temple of Doom and the novelization of it I devoured the day and night before its release were my first exposure to the cold reality that movies didn’t owe me a breast to suckle, just a reflection of how wrong the world is. In that way if no other, it’s a quintessential film maudit, miscategorized because it occurred there in bright and shiny 1984 and not in 1949 when Jean Cocteau curated a series of outré pictures, nor in the Sixties and Seventies counter-programming, when censorship rules were in retreat before the rage of the undertow. A prequel set in 1935, one year prior to the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Doom opens in Shanghai with a performance by Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) in Mandarin of Cole Porter’s “Anything Goes.” It’s fair warning, thematically and stylistically, as Spielberg expands the prologue into a full-blown Busby Berkeley production number with a chorale of dancing girls. Cut to dapper Jones in white jacket, trading the ashes of an old Chinese emperor for a big fat diamond that captures gold-digger Willie’s eye. It’s the first joke of the movie, that grave-robber Jones would be paired with a chiseller and opportunist of another stripe. The scene sets up the Chinese as venal and corrupt, and there was a time I took this as affront–but no longer. Watching it as a man of almost forty, I see it as an accurate snapshot of Oriental representations in Yellow Peril pictures (featuring Fu Manchu, Mr. Moto, and Charlie Chan)–representations that, in truth, we’re still not free of in modern cinema. I’m not offended anymore, I’m resigned. An elaborate action sequence commences in which Jones does his best to recover a vial of antidote to a poison he’s tricked into drinking while Willie does her best to recover the diamond, knocked to the floor during the scuffle. It bears mentioning that Jones’s doomed sidekick this time, a Chinese guy (billed as Wu Han but nameless in the film, just like the Ewoks were in Return; he’s played by David Yip), takes a bullet for the Great White Hunter. I should also mention that the picture is profoundly colonialist and that this, too, is in tune with those old Republic serials and the attitudes of that–and every, if we’re honest–age. Temple of Doom, if it’s anything, is honest. All insects are honest. They can’t be anything else. When I saw this movie as a child, I was, above the ripped-out, still-beating hearts, the institutional child abuse, and the near-constant revulsion and terror, particularly dismayed by the character of Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), who was about a year-and-a-half older than me. I see now what I didn’t then, that the character is probably the only noble one in the film, certainly the only one worth rooting for and the only one who made me wonder about his fate once the movie was over. If it’s only a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark, after all, what has Jones done with this war orphan he’s adopted and turned into his personal driver? In fact, a scene in the original screenplay for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull would have returned Short Round to the cinematic canon (and given Quan one of his rare roles since hitting puberty) as the, yes, guy who drives Indy to his wedding. Now, see, that‘s racist. What Short Round is in Temple of Doom is an indicator of a culture in which there’s no countermeasure to the Short Round archetype–none. There’s no balance for a kid speaking pidgin English in an accent that decades of American programming have made ridiculous and servile. Short Round isn’t servile–not like Wu Han, anyway. Short Round is actually courageous, smart, resourceful, and the hero of the piece. It’s not his fault he’s the comic relief, it’s the fault of every single asshole watching it who thinks he’s an adorable chink monkey because they’ve never had the opportunity to see a substantially different representation of an Asian of any age in a Hollywood production. Short Round isn’t racist; the culture that produced him is. When I saw this movie as a child, I could almost predict what was coming: Indeed, all my buddies the next Monday were calling me “Shorty” and asking me to do the accent. For a kid wanting to “fit in,” Temple of Doom illustrated for me and all my friends my absolute difference. Anyway, Short Round accompanies Willie and Indy to deepest, darkest India and Pankot Palace in search of a mystical Sankara Stone, without which a pathetic little village, robbed of its children, will suffer and perish from famine and grief. This is racist, the idea that bwana from the sky will lead the backwards, Zippo-worshipping brown people to glory, and this early sequence that sets the story in motion offers the first of two times Spielberg and company will engage in the “ethnic food is gross” gag as Indy forces Willie to eat the meagre repast offered them by a council of elders. Part of that “company” involves, crucially, the loss of Lawrence Kasdan as screenwriter, replaced by the infernal dyad of Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck. The duo, who made the promising Messiah of Evil in another life, would go on to pen Best Defense and, for Lucas, the notorious Howard the Duck. In other words, fuck them. It seems this benign corner of paradise has been overrun by the brutal Thuggee cult, led by charismatic Mola Ram (Amrish Puri, just awesome), who can rip hearts out of people’s bodies without also immediately killing them. He demonstrates this once with a guy they drop into a lava pit; fails to demonstrate it on Willie before trying to drop her into a lava pit (doesn’t even try, really); and fails again to do it to Jones, though, admittedly, not without giving it a good effort. It’s a grisly, nay, ghoulish effect, and the first time we see it, our heroes are framed by a couple of human skins flapping behind them in their hiding spot. Testing boundaries? Temple of Doom is utterly shameless in its testing of boundaries, channelling Lucas’s unchallenged attitudes towards women and minorities without anything like a filter. Consider the Willie character, who spends the entire film screaming, whining, or in a state of estrous–and how she’s rhymed with Short Round as a child in Indy’s care, always needing back-of-the-hand discipline, guidance and instruction, cajoling, threatening. Among the throng of children liberated by our white hero at the end, count Shorty and Willie as the most visible of them, making Jones’s obvious desire to fuck Willie one of those unsavoury things and reminding us that Marion in Raiders of the Lost Ark was “just a child” when Indiana did things to her, then left her. The saving grace is that Spielberg is a genius. His timing is impeccable; a brawl between Indy and a hulking Thuggee on a rock-crusher conveyor belt, paralleled with Short Round battling a zombified kid Maharaja (Raj Singh)–who, mixing genres and racial intolerance, has constructed a voodoo doll of our good Dr. Jones–is beautifully choreographed and executed. The mine cart finale? Likewise, brilliant. Equal parts hilarious and horrible, Temple of Doom is the ’80s L’age d’or–another film, surreal and unpleasant, about a romantic pair in a constant state of sexual frustration, forced to endure the banalities of a corrupt ruling class, forced in both films at some point to fondle/fellate a stone statue. Plus, there are bugs. Whatever the intent of Temple of Doom, the impact of it is derangement and frustration and how those phenomena combine to create an appalling affront to civilization, and, ultimately, to provide a wealth of insight into the attitudes of a particular time and place. Seen in this way, Temple of Doom is something like a surrealist masterpiece: provocative, profound, the blueprint for every blockbuster like it that would follow in its hatred and suspicion of the Other. It’s a foundational film, lawless and fundamentally inexcusable, and it says all there needs to be said that it instantly became one of the top-grossing films in the land–that an entire industry adjusted itself to facilitate the creation of more like it. Its fascination for me is that I’m entirely incapable of not respecting it, even admiring it, while recognizing it for what it is. It’s my relationship exactly to a scorpion. After Temple of Doom and the whipping of children, the violence against Short Round by an intoxicated Indy (the series’ bleakest moment), the crocodiles ripping apart the bad guys in the ugly vengeance lurking right underneath the sparkle and wonder of Spielberg’s veneers–after this, Spielberg forever loses the muscle necessary to deliver appropriately hopeless endings to films like Minority Report, War of the Worlds, even Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan. This movie broke him. The terminal station for the filmmaker who did Duel, The Sugarland Express, Jaws, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, it is his most complicated and stickiest film. Small wonder, then, that the third entry is almost entirely free of controversy despite its thoroughly Christian conceit–handled, perversely, by a thoroughly Jewish director. Where it works isn’t in the refined slickness of its action or the perfunctory sexiness of its “Bond girl,” Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), but in its attempts, feeble though they may be, to address father-son issues between the obviously deranged Indiana Jones and his distant, doddering papa Henry (Sean Connery). Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade opens with young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) engaged in his first evangelical crusade on behalf of the necessity of interring other cultures’ artifacts in Western archives and, along the way, acquiring his whip, his chin scar, his fear of snakes, his fedora (in a scene that plays like a Bar Mitzvah), and, eventually, even his name. It’s also about, in its evasive, roundabout way, how Indy acquires his hatred of women and his disrespect for other human beings. I love the part where all of the students in the class he teaches mob him during office hours because Professor Jones is chronically absent. (This mob, by the fourth film, is reduced to trying to learn something from the old guy by stealing a question when he crashes a motorcycle into the library.) When The Last Crusade works, in other words, it works by literalizing Jones’s psychological devastation at being abandoned by his father and forced to carry the burden of a legacy he appears to bear grudgingly. It’s chilling–and it should be–when it’s revealed that Elsa has fucked both Jones boys. “I was the next guy, Dad.” This is Spielberg at his most Freudian. In this one, Indy teams with his father to find the final resting place of the literal Holy Grail. He will go to Venice, where he defiles a library and discovers an impossible catacomb beneath the sunken city; then to Berlin, where Hitler (Michael Sheard) signs his journal; then to the Holy Land and the “Canyon of the Crescent Moon,” where Jones “chooses wisely” before riding off into the sunset. Like a triumphal march, old pals Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus (Denholm Elliott) are aboard, and, indicative of the direction Spielberg has taken despite his forays into the lands of “serious” and “prestigious” entertainment at this point, everything’s treated like benign slapstick. Even the father/son issues are handled in a broad, eye-rolling fashion, with a fraught conversation in which Indy is entirely incapable of conveying the extent of the betrayal he’s felt from his father painfully, cruelly brushed to the curb. That this film is remembered as the lightest of the series goes a long way towards telling of Spielberg’s perverse desperation in burying this filial conflict. There’s not so much as an attempt to relate Indy’s divorce from Henry with mankind’s divorce from a remote concept of God–not unless a tossed-off reference to Henry as “Attila the Professor” by his bitter boy counts. Maybe it’s in a moment where Henry slaps his son clean across the face for “blasphemy” but not for suggesting that their absent, presumed-dead mother resented Henry’s obsessions as deeply as her son did. Still, there’s ugly, roiling subtext in The Last Crusade (not the least of which for its title) in the treatment of the noble Arab guardians of the Grail, in the erectile-dysfunction punchline that at the end of all the struggles is an old guy who can’t lift his sword over his head, and in a final punishment that results in the rapid aging of another lacking Jones’s purity. The idea of ageing is handled decently here if extra-textually, as Connery plays against his life’s work as a Scottish Y-chromosome, but like the father/son theme, it’s underplayed, leaving the film to jump from slick action sequence to slick action sequence, none especially memorable (no rolling boulders in this one; no heart extractions or mine carts, either). If there’s substance in this one, it’s in the excavation that Spielberg is now actively indulging buddy Lucas’s weaknesses–perhaps playing patsy to his unfinished ideas and undeveloped substrates in order to win the prize of being allowed to direct one of the films in Lucas’s upcoming Star Wars prequel trilogy. It’s interesting that even after that ship sailed, Spielberg’s disavowal of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull included his famous shrug and an “I just do what George tells me” grin. The Last Crusade is Spielberg paying off a favour while trying to earn another one. By the time we reach the next go-round, nineteen years later, he doesn’t have an excuse. There’s a tableau in the first thirty minutes of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that is so iconic, so breathtaking in its construction and implication within and without the text, that I was frankly glad to be alive at this moment in our cinematic history. Indiana Jones silhouetted in foreground-right against a mushroom cloud is something people like Baudrillard would/should worry over for entire volumes of critical theory. As Indy is permanently, pregnantly implanted on the collective psyche of the blockbuster generation, I do wonder if I’ll ever see a depiction of a nuclear blast again without looking at it through the prism of this avatar’s eyes. It’s like picturing Marty McFly jumping into the Holocaust, or Forrest Gump at Dealey Plaza–I won’t be able to help myself. And in this most derided of sequels, it’s by itself worth the price of admission. At this point in cinema’s history, it is the perfect encapsulation of entire volumes of critical theory about self-reflective works of art–of post-modernism, of the eruption of “new” archetypes with new mediums, of the importance and potency of film as the prime artifactor of new images in the last century-plus. It is, in one flashpoint, the reason no one experiences calamity anymore without comparing it to a movie image. Not a specific image, something from “a movie”–something from the only creator of image and experience with any currency in the modern conversation. In the shadow of no towers, no one compared the calamity to something from an opera, or a movement from a ballet. For forty minutes, Crystal Skull is genius. Exhilarating, imaginative, a comfortable marriage of George Lucas’s stunted puerility and Spielberg’s gifted puerility as the Paramount logo morphs into a gopher mound run over by a 1957 roadster we follow as it cuts through a military procession that…well, that would be telling. The worst-kept secret was that the picture was somehow about “Saucer Men from Mars,” and sure enough, the evil Reds, led by a Natasha-warbling Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), coerce our archaeologist into helping them locate certain artifacts unearthed at Roswell, NM. The implicit promise is that the film will deal with McCarthyism and the Red Scare in the United States, with Indy losing his job to the finger-pointers and forced to deal with Hoover’s goons impugning his patriotism. Consider the arc from the first film when Indy’s mentor, the lost Ravenwood, is called out as a Nazi sympathizer to this one where our Jones hissownself is accused of sympathizing with the sneaky Russkies. The opportunity for an Invasion of the Body Snatchers foray into small-town America (indeed, Indy’s buddy Mac (Ray Winstone) turns out to be a pod) is so ripe for the plucking here, so tantalizing given Spielberg’s gift for romanticizing Americana, that it points simultaneously to a better film and to an adaptation of “Mars is Heaven” that would, at last, be the perfect sci-fi vehicle for the boy wonder. Here’s a chance to understand that which drove Cold War paranoia–to find Indy in the United States for his last adventure, adrift in the nuclear, post-war age and demonstrating that Raiders of the Lost Ark wasn’t the fluke in the series for its smart, razor-sharp script and remarkable pop-insight into what it meant to be a Nazi appeaser in the form of Paul Freeman’s French baddie Belloq. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a seminal picture for a lot of reasons–many of them having to do with its comprehensive understanding of how the West viewed this period in history and how we view it still in all its glorious simplicity today. But what’s astonishing about the first part of this third sequel, up to and including the introduction of young sidekick Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, who makes his entrance as the spitting image of Marlon Brando in The Wild One) and a motorcycle chase featuring a disappointingly obvious stunt double for Ford, is abandoned remorselessly in its second half as Lucas decides to go to Peru–the sentimental old fool retreating back into the utterly, dishearteningly familiar. I’m not asking for a master’s course on the prevailing sociology of the late-1950s, I’m asking for the pop treatment of a shameful era in American history in exactly the same way as Raiders tackled the wartime Interzone (it’s Casablanca but better, no?) or, hell, like Crystal Skull itself does in that one mind-blowing tableau of Indy against the Apocalypse. Almost as good are moments where it’s revealed, wordlessly, that Prof. Jones’s class, once the province of moony-eyed girls with “Love You” printed on their eyelids, is now at least half young men; how Prof. Jones is probably detested by his students given how they go out of their way to try to get office time with him only to have him tell them to drop out and find some nice ruins to pillage. But the second hour is merely another jungle serial full of the same old waterfalls and riddles as Indy, reunited with Marion (Karen Allen, just terrible), traipses around, dodges Commies, and opens heavy stone doors with the clever manipulation of levers and cracker-jack deciphering of hieroglyphs. Its resolution is near-identical to the first film’s climax when it would have been apter to emulate its epilogue. Why not, for instance, have Spalko’s fate be her carving the secrets to cold fusion and light-speed travel into the walls of the cell of her Peruvian madhouse oubliette as a sad-faced nun shuts her forever from the world? Maybe have her writing dates on the wall (9/11/2001, 11/22/1963) while begging to speak to a nun. Wouldn’t such be the better price paid for her Mephistophelean act of knowledge-brokering than a broken bank’s worth of special effects that make her explode into digital sparks? The whole second half of the film is both smug and timid: It rehashes most of the major sequences from the first three films, while a nifty field of piranha-like ants is resolved in a way that doesn’t make a lick of sense. The most disappointing misstep, though, isn’t the script’s second-half pandering, the desperation of Allen’s overwrought perkiness, the not-subtle suggestion that Mutt is to be Jones’s heir-apparent in Lucas’s inevitable spin-off sequels, nor the anticlimactic final third that doesn’t know how to end itself, much less the series. No, the most disappointing misstep is that it doesn’t properly use John Williams’s score to rousing effect. Though I’m not much of a fan of Williams’s later work, his stuff from the Raiders period is as much a part of my generation’s core identity (and the bane of several generations of synchronized swimmer) as any single character; when Crystal Skull fails to even once introduce the obligatory trumpets where they would actually frenzy the desperate-to-be-frenzied, that’s the cruellest blow of all. It becomes clear from the music that everyone involved has lost interest. Aside from that first forty minutes, Crystal Skull is the first film of the four that’s poorly constructed. Consider that I wanted so much to be enthralled by this picture despite a gnawing realization that there was only ever one genuinely good film out of the original trilogy that I fought against its first half’s light’s long gutter and eventual wink-out. Say it ain’t so, Joe. Still, I’d go back to watch the forty minutes set in the United States again in a heartbeat, if only to imagine a rest of the film after the midway that had the balls to be something great instead of a little love note to itself and the die-hards. Raiders of the Lost Ark is like a primer on how to be an American boy. For a while, going to the movies was like this; if you grew up in the early-Eighties, popular film was fraught, reactionary, often insane. There weren’t guardrails. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is case in point. The fact that Last Crusade and Crystal Skull both made smug reference to the first film (in a cave painting in the third film, in the titular artifact in the fourth) handily undermines the freshness of the first two pictures–it archives them, makes them museum objects from a distant time and place and presents as good an explanation as any as to why so many, born too late, believe the third film is the best one when the real race is between the perfection of the first and the perfect lunacy of the second. In this way, the last two films make the first two films feel like jokes from a different era, and that’s the real tragedy of them–a tragedy that Lucas’s endless revisions to his pictures (the first Star Wars trilogy, sure, but also his earnest THX-1138) and Spielberg’s own “softening” of E.T. and, frankly, the endings to all his post-Doom films except, let’s say, Catch Me If You Can, maybe Munich, only underscore. They’ve become evangelists in the church of self-importance. Say what you will about Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom–neither was trying to change the world and neither gave much of a damn what you thought of them. If we talk about what’s changed in our culture in the last thirty years, it’s that the mainstream has become puritanical. I’m not sure how it would fly anymore if Marty’s mom were to try to rape Marty in a parked car. It’s caused the ugliness to go into the subtext of things like Transformers: Asshole, resulting in a film culture that pretends its white-bread American heroes are blameless instead of obviously, conspicuously a part of the colonial, grave-robbing problem. When the good colonials come in bearing rifles to subdue the aboriginal Thuggees to Willie’s “well, it’s about time,” what other message could there be? The plan in the later films is to make Raiders quaint and Temple of Doom a rumour; all they succeed in doing is magnifying that the first is a masterpiece and the second indelible. They don’t belong in a museum–they belong in a zoo. Find on the fifth disc a trio of progressively shorter retrospectives for each of the films that, when combined, total 126 minutes–coincidentally the duration of the third and longest Indiana Jones feature. By the Last Crusade portion, it’s clear that all involved are tapped out: Without warning, the participants go from doling out information to summarizing the plot–and lazily, at that. In print interviews, Spielberg has said he thought doing Last Crusade would help him to exorcise lingering demons about his relationship with his own father, but the production is portrayed as neither a cathartic nor an especially joyful experience by supplementals producer Laurent Bouzereau, who gets the most mileage out of his Raiders material. At last, Tom Selleck’s screen test for the role of Indy sees the light of day (he’s not awful, just Magnum-like), and Lucas hangs himself with statements like “I’m lazy” and the admission that he didn’t want to cast Ford, lest the actor be perceived as his “Bobby De Niro.” (Good thinking–it’s not like the Scorsese/De Niro collaboration had yielded any lasting results.) The Temple of Doom piece is almost as intriguing thanks to Spielberg’s eagerness to snitch on Lucas for pretending that Indiana Jones stories subsequent to Raiders were as good as written in order to extract a verbal commitment for a trilogy, as well as Capshaw’s defense of her regressive female character and the account of Ford’s herniated spine, an impairment that forced Spielberg to shoot with a double for several weeks as the actor recuperated from a controversial surgical treatment. I learned a lot from these segments, though I didn’t feel exceptionally nourished. Also on board are must-see featurettes–replete with archival footage–specific to the “Stunts” (11 mins.), “Sound” (13 mins.), “Music” (12 mins.), and “Light and Magic” (12 mins.) of Indiana Jones. Stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong’s explanation of how the rolling ball was achieved without the use of opticals is a lesson in ingenuity, and an amusing tribute to recurring bit player Pat Roach offers a surprise or two. It’s also nice to finally check in with composer John Williams (whose Indiana Jones theme is the heart-and-soul of the trilogy), who’s not so much as mentioned in the omnibus documentary, while Ben Burtt’s work on Raiders is justly honoured with revelatory and enthusiastic recollections (“This jungle is gonna be so friggin’ alien,” was Spielberg’s reaction to the animal noises that Burtt had fabricated for the beginning of the movie). And it is, of course, refreshing to hear Lucas extol the virtues of cheaply-accomplished, pre-CGI special effects. THE BLU-RAY DISCS
I’ve seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, conservatively, about a hundred times. I saw it the first time through my fingers as a terrified eight-year-old, then begged to see it three times more before it left town. It was the first movie we rented on our new VCR, the first movie I pirated VCR-to-VCR when blank cassettes cost over ten bucks apiece, and every day after school, I’d bake a plate of French fries and watch the damned thing. I know every beat, every skip. The apocryphal tales you hear of audiophiles internalizing the pops on their Coltrane vinyl? That was me and my EP-dubbed, pan-and-scan copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Watching it on DVD years later, I was shocked that the sound didn’t drop out when Marion clears her bar upon winning her drinking contest as it did on my stretched, abused VHS tape, and delighted to see more Nazis fried in proper widescreen, though it did make it harder to pick out the one who gets the lightning right in the eyes. Now it’s on Blu-ray…and they say there’s no such thing as a time machine. Viewing Raiders of the Lost Ark in HiDef on my gigantic television made me feel like that eight-year-old kid again, sandwiched between my parents, vowing that this would be the time I looked at what the Jewish ghosts did to that vaguely Asian guy with the coat-hanger. The 2.35:1, 1080p image is, in other words, glorious. The detail? This goes for each of the transfers: stupendous. The colours? Rich, saturated, utterly filmic. Being able to see every wrinkle on the date that poisons the monkey is enough to have me returning again whenever my kids want to test themselves and their gorge against the face-melting. For what it’s worth, Temple of Doom is the most attractive of the original three in HD, perhaps by default of being the most colourful and brightly lit. Raiders looks very satisfyingly like a film print while Crystal Skull looks completely undiminished from what it was on the big screen. (If it has a shortcoming, it’s that it brings the CGI into glaring relief.) These THX-certified presentations are incredible. The 5.1 DTS-HD MA tracks are, across the board, logical, loud, surprising, and revelatory. As to Raiders, the gunshots are like cannons, and the hiss of Toht’s palm burning on Marion’s trinket erupts like a basket of snakes. Best, John Williams’s triumphant theme erupts with life from every channel–this is what it felt like to sit engulfed in the movie as a child. Anything could happen, and did. Listen to the way that space changes in the soundtrack as we go from college halls to the stone auditorium unleashing the face of Jewish vengeance on a gaggle of Nazi stooges. Brilliant. If possible, the lossless resurrection of Temple of Doom is even more remarkable, from the slurp of the “snake surprise” to the full-field scuttling of insects to the roar of the inferno that Indy subjects Willie to when he, for the second time in the film, has a bit too much to drink. Last Crusade continues the technical excellence–the scene in Berlin is monstrous and enveloping, while the echo in the antechamber before the three labours of God is realistic-feeling as well. Then there’s the obvious excellence of Crystal Skull, which ditches the Dolby TrueHD track of the previous release at no expense to the mix. I liked the rustling of the ants a great deal as they emerged from the rear discretes, and the booms and grunts of the opening fight/flight sequence are genuinely powerful. Subtler moments like the release of sand in the key mechanism fill the soundstage no less impressively. HiDef trailers for each of the four films join their respective platters. All of the supplementary material’s been ported over from the 2003 “Adentures of Indiana Jones” DVD box set (see Bill’s sidebar), shucked here to a fifth disc that also includes a more recent “Making of” (51 mins., HD) for Raiders of the Lost Ark that delves a bit deeper into Lucas’s mythology of having imagined a series before Star Wars. Other topics broached: working with Kasdan (but, inexplicably, never working with him again post-Jedi); hand-aging Indy’s bomber jacket with steel wool and want-to; and how Danny DeVito was the first choice for Sallah but couldn’t get out of his “Taxi” obligation. I like Allen’s admission that the finished product was nothing like she imagined from the shoot, and I like that there’s extensive footage of the bazaar battle between Indy and the swordsman from before it became Indy shooting the swordsman. It’s better the way it lands in the film. The casting decisions, the deleted scenes, the glimpses into what might have been…all point to Spielberg having then, and maintaining now, an unerring sense of what is cinematic. Whether he still has a sense of what is honourable is the better question. A separate “Making of” (29 mins., HD) for Crystal Skull joins the conversation, containing all-too-revealing moments of Spielberg speaking of appeasing fan lust and doing what George tells him. When a fifth Indiana Jones film was announced, Spielberg spewed the same line: “We’re just waiting on George to come up with an idea.” There are better strategies for success, but it’s clear–he says it–that he doesn’t really give a shit. A parade of SD featurettes begins with “The Melting Face!” (8 mins.), everything you ever needed to know about how the melting-face effects were achieved. “The Creepy Crawlies” (12 mins.) acquaints us with the bug and reptile wranglers who populated the series with beasties (trivia: Ford doesn’t actually fear snakes! Capshaw does!), and “Locations” (10 mins.) is a travelogue with pop-ups. “Indy’s Women” (9 mins.) is an American Film Institute fluffer, abridged from what must have been an insufferable evening, that allows the ladies an extra strut and fret, while “Friends and Enemies” (10 mins.) devotes time to the various sidekicks of the series. In 1080p, we have an “Iconic Props” (10 mins.) piece that is fourth-film centric–stuff like the corpse-head cup from the second film goes unmentioned. “Effects” (22 mins.) features ILM guy Paul Huston discussing the heavy use of CGI in Crystal Skull. Finally, “Adventures in Post-Production” (13 mins.) provides a brief overview of editing, scoring, and so on, again for the last film. Gone is the lengthy behind-the-scenes doc from Crystal Skull‘s 2008 BD, in addition to that disc’s interactive timeline. They are not missed. I would, however, have appreciated commentary tracks, new documentaries, etc., but be careful what you wish for. Listening to Spielberg/Lucas go on for ten hours about films they don’t understand would be a unique torture. As someone who begrudgingly respects Temple of Doom while finding it almost intolerable to watch, this review is the most persuasive I’ve ever read to consider the film in a more positive-ish light.

It’s too easy and not accurate to write off Temple of Doom as “racist.”  It’s not racist; if anything it’s “culturalist.”  Lao Che and his sons weren’t representatives of the entire Chinese people, they were gangsters for God’s sake.  And Wu Han (who, contra your review, is absolutely named in the film — Indy: “Good service here.  Wu Han is an old friend..”) is disposed of quickly, but that’s not racist, it’s narratively expedient.
All of this (not to mention the notion that playing up Western culture shock at exotic dietary habits is anything but an amusing pander to the film’s widest possible audience), is to demonstrate what an enemy to clear thinking the modern academic obsession over “racism” truly is.  Seeing racism everywhere one looks is a sacred cow that needs slaughtering and fast.
I would love to see your version of Crystal Skull, particularly that beautiful notion for the ending.  That would have killed.

Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. The Monitor Daily amplifies and clarifies how we deliver on the Monitor’s purpose, to benefit humanity by reporting what is happening in the world and why – and how this information matters to you. It's been 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie, which helps explain the hysteria leading up to the release this week of Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" For the past month you couldn't open up a paper, surf the Internet, or turn on the TV without hearing about this film – this event. For those of us who do not regard the series as the pinnacle of Hollywood action-adventure escapism, all this hoo-ha may seem like a bit much. But then again, the three previous installments – ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" – made $1.2 billion worldwide. The ka-ching factor is so high that it's no wonder pulses are racing. The Indiana Jones movies began as salutes to the cheapo Saturday-afternoon serials that Spielberg and series producer George Lucas devoured as kids. But there's nothing cutrate about the budgets for these escapades. ""Crystal Skull"" weighs in at $185 million. I usually make it a point to review a movie, not its cost. But that's a lot of wampum for what is essentially – well, a Saturday-afternoon serial. These Indy films are not indie films. Harrison Ford, complete with fedora and rucksack, is back as Indiana. Did you ever doubt it? He may be 65, but he does a manly job of holding down the part. In fact, nothing much has changed with Indy – he's still surly and afraid of snakes. But a couple of key changes have occurred around him. For one thing, the time frame has now moved up to 1957. Make way for the cold war and the Red scare. Early on, Indy runs up against Col. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a Stalin fave and three-time winner of the Order of Lenin who, with Indy held at gunpoint, engineers a raid on a top-secret US Army warehouse in Nevada containing mummified remains of … well, let's just say the box is marked ""Roswell."" From this it is but a short leap – and there are many leaps in this film, short and long – to the discovery deep in the Peruvian jungles of the Crystal Skull of Akator (don't ask). Colonel Spalko wants to track down the origin of the skull, which she believes will grant her eternal knowledge – i.e., power. At least Spielberg and Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp haven't brought back the Nazis for a third tour of duty. Not that Russkies are much of an improvement. Neither is it such a great improvement to saddle Indy with an equally surly young sidekick, Mutt Williams, played by Shia LaBeouf, who's a dead ringer for Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" The pairing is all too obviously a ploy to attract a younger demographic, but I don't think the series needs this sop. The previous installments have been hugely successful with kids who only know these movies on DVD. Much more welcome is the return of Karen Allen as Indy's old flame Marion Ravenwood, even though they spend most of their screen time together bickering. Allen still has the most captivating smile in the business and she knows how to be spunky without being cloying (not as easy as it sounds). How does the new Indiana Jones movie stack up with the other ones? I'd place it somewhere in the middle, but since, as I say, I'm not a die-hard enthusiast, that's faint praise. All of the films seem too overly engineered, too by-the-numbers, too pushily ""iconic."" Spielberg is such a fantastically adept filmmaker that, even when he's working at half speed, he can work up a pretty good action sequence. But even the best set pieces in ""Crystal Skull,"" like the pursuit of Indy through the Amazonian jungle by the KGB, or a dive over a triple-decker waterfall, have a déjà vu quality. ""Crystal Skull"" is a fun ride, but if we have to wait 19 years for the next one, that's OK by me. Grade: B. (Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and scary images.) Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations.",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2008"," CHICAGO – After such a long respite from the beloved film progression, I was initially just as skittish about seeing Harrison Ford back in the Indy saddle as I was watching Sylvester Stallone back in the ring in “Rocky Balboa” in his 2006 comeback and then again in 2008 in his “Rambo” return. Ultimately, though, I had faith in director Steven Spielberg not to royally torpedo the monolithically anticipated “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which resurrects the Chicago-born, 65-year-old Harrison Ford as one of my favorite film characters of all time. In grappling with Ford’s real-life age, David Koepp’s screenplay comically writes in subtle jabs to wrangle with the reality. Just like Stallone didn’t try to hide it in “Rocky Balboa” and he instead decided to honestly portray it, so did Ford’s character grow older. Of course, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is still a major Hollywood product and Indiana Jones is still Indiana Jones. He still flings through the air with bird-like grace, whips all obstacles in his way with laser-like precision and is imbued with the film’s classic and campy “kapow!” sound effects. I love ‘em to pieces. While the character Indiana Jones has had an unfortunate television run by way of Sean Patrick Flanery in his young form from 1992 all the way through 2007, Harrison Ford as the real Indiana Jones we’ve all been enamored with last roughed it up in a major Spielberg production in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” in 1989. Before that, it was five years earlier in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” in 1984 and three years earlier in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981. Yes, that’s three years between the first and second, five years between the second and third and 19 years between the third and the fourth. Though Shia LaBeouf at first felt like he stuck out like a mutilated thumb (he’s most certainly no Jonathan Ke Quan, who played the lovable Asian sidekick Short Round in the second film), he was written in as much more than just a steadfast assistant. He has his own attitude, his own 1950s get-up, his own fascination with knives and swords, his own quick-thinking and fast-talking demeanor and ultimately his own brewing plotline. It’s a Goliath, too. Once we learn his true relation to Indiana Jones, we’re ultimately teased about his brewing ability to be Indy’s protégé and eventual replacement. While such a storyline is to be appreciated and realistically understood based on the realities of the series and Ford’s age, I wasn’t entirely sold that LaBeouf nailed the part of the irascible Mutt Williams. He spent too much time combing his hairdo – yes, I know it was a sign of the times – and wasn’t as rugged as he should be to even nearly fit in Indy’s shoes. There was storyline confusion there in his character as he flip-flopped between a slick greaser and a jungle-brawling Indy trainee. The jury here on LaBeouf is still out. While it was “Disturbia” in 2007 and then ultimately “Transformers” in 2007 that launched LaBeouf into the luminous limelight, I wouldn’t be heartbroken if he was replaced in a fifth iteration of the film. While Karen Allen was excavated out of Hollywood hiding for a respectable performance ultimately designed to satisfy your sentimentality for the series, thank the heavens again for the always “A”-list performance from Cate Blanchett. She makes her foray into the franchise as an menacing Russian who influentially disappears into her role. She’s spot on with her transformational image and accent and couldn’t have improved with hundreds additional takes. Jim Broadbent from 2001’s “Moulin Rouge!” is a refreshingly unexpected casting decision, John Hurt entirely escapes into his character’s insanity and Ray Winstone (who played the seminal “Beowulf” in 2007) felt like he was merely passing screen time and cashing a fat check. Aside from the interesting introduction of LaBeouf’s character, Blanchett’s villainous antagonizing and the return of Indy’s always entertaining adventures, history may most scratch its collective head about Koepp’s decision to scribe a plot that twists and turns down such an unexpected road. As we learn the true meaning behind the crystal skulls and their application, this plot evolution takes us to an unexpectedly bizarre place. Talk about a thing that makes you go “hmmm”. Indeed, the revelation is also unexpectedly bizarre in a way that makes your head go: “Um, am I still watching an Indiana Jones movie or did the projectionist splice in some other film as some sort of sick joke?” But alas, this is the real Indiana Jones deal. Despite some dubious decisions and anomalous outcomes, the spirit remains and Hollywood this time has fantastically exhumed its venerated roots. IMHO, this review was not well written.  I can understand not wanting to reveal too much of the movie in a review, but I felt like I was reading a vague mishmash near the end.  This review get 1 *. I saw the movie Saturday night, how can you not if you are a film fan? After a slam-bang beginning, in which Lucas and Spielberg basically pay homage to their baby boomer roots (Shia looking like Marlon Brando in “The Wild One” was a hoot, for example), the movie settles into another path that wasn’t as compelling. A friend of mine summed it up succinctly when he said “it looked like a video game.” Bingo! There were times I expected the point values to appear on the screen.

"May 23, 2008"," How does one preface a review of the first Indiana Jones movie in almost 20 years? Ultimately, I couldn’t decide between discussing my enduring love of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” making snotty remarks about Harrison Ford’s age, or embarking on a trenchant analysis of Shia LaBeouf’s career. So it’ll have to suffice for me to say that “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a very good film. And though it falls well short of the greatness that is “Raiders,” it may be my favorite of the sequels. Nearly two decades have passed since the events of “Last Crusade” and the world has changed dramatically. WWII is over, the Bomb is a reality, and the Cold War is escalating fiercely. Even so, Dr. Henry “Indiana” Jones, Jr. remains stubbornly – and comfortably – familiar, still sporting the same outfit and stubble as when we last saw him riding off into the sunset in “Last Crusade.” He’s much older, certainly, but that doesn’t mean he’s about to throw in the towel when a bunch of Soviet commandos order him to recover a crate containing… something recovered from the 1947 Roswell crash site. The first act, which ranges from legendary Warehouse 51 (current resting place of the Lost Ark of the Covenant, among other things) across the Nevada desert, is ridiculous; a near-constant array of action and stuntwork designed to convince us Ford is still up to the job. It’s also ridiculously entertaining, perfectly capturing the spirit of the franchise and starting things off on an admirably high note. And while all the things you’ve missed out on for the last 19 years are back (the hat, the whip, the punches that sound like someone slammed a Studebaker door on a side of beef), the high doesn’t really last. Indy’s adventures in the desert result in a forced leave of absence from his teaching job at Marshall College (where the students are still reading Michelson). On his way out of town, he’s approached by one Mutt Williams (LaBeouf), a wannabe biker rebel who insists he was sent by his mother on behalf of an old colleague to convince Indy to go to South America in search of a mythical lost city. The two set off, with the Soviets also in the hunt (now it’s Stalin who’s obsessed with finding occult artifacts). Led by future BDSM icon Col. Spalko (Cate Blanchett), the Russians aren’t quite as menacing as the Nazis of the first and third installments, but it isn’t like the Soviet Union ever killed millions of innocent people.* Along the way, puzzles are solved, betrayals are uncovered, and a beloved character we haven’t seen since “Raiders” is reintroduced. As much joy as it would give me to praise “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” unreservedly, there are some noticeable defects. We’ll take the excessive amount of CGI as a given, especially since I don’t think it’s possible for George Lucas to be involved in a movie unless at least a third of it is conceived in the design lab at ILM. Some of the results are, admittedly, pretty cool (the climax to the opening act, for example), but the majority is intrusive and frankly lazy. I realize in this day and age that it’s no longer necessary to go overseas and shoot scenes set in overseas locales… except that’s what they did for the first three movies. Far too much of the film’s second half is a frenetic assault of obvious green screen crapola (the fencing sequence is frighteningly reminiscent of the lava lightsaber duel in “Revenge of the Sith”), and is it really so hard to use actual monkeys? Really? And whether it’s an attempt to avoid long, “Temple of Doom”-ish, action-free sequences or simply capitulation to an audience one generation away from Max Headroom-style blipverts, Spielberg and Lucas are unwilling or unable to take a breather. So much time is devoted to jungle jeep chases and elaborate Rube Goldberg contraptions that we get precious little time to catch up with Marion (a still spunky Karen Allen) or learn more about what Jones has been up to for the last 20 years (though some tantalizing hints are dropped, any of which sound like they also would’ve made for a good movie). Surprisingly, LaBeouf isn’t as irritating as you might assume. If Mutt’s tough guy posturing seems tough to swallow, that’s because the character is actually a bright kid. And even when he screws things up, at least he’s relatively quiet about it, unlike Willie Scott or Short Round. I can’t deny it:  I had a s**t-eating grin on my face for most of the ensuing two hours. I also can’t deny that many of the criticisms about to be leveled at Spielberg and Lucas over “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” are well-deserved, but it’s still good to see Indiana Jones, and Marion, back in action one last time. And I sincerely believe it is the last, for while much has been made of Lucas’ comments about continuing the franchise with LaBeouf… well, let’s just say they make it pretty clear the hat won’t be handed down anytime soon. I knew I was going to have fun watching this short when I saw the monster. Most filmmakers, when doing horror, wisely hide their monsters. It’s not that... It's a gore film!  No, it's an art film!  No, it's a gore film!  No, it's an art film!  I got it...it's GART!

"May 22, 2008"," Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is kidnapped by a militant Russian scientist named Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) to steal a classified artifact from (where else?) a secret government warehouse filled with such things. After a typically daring escape, Indy’s world is turned upside down by his accidental “red scare” association with the Soviets, but a greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) puts him back on track with tales of a kidnapped colleague, a crystal skull, and an old acquaintance named “Marion” (Karen Allen, no secret there). Shortly thereafter, the heroes all realize that they are fictional characters, can pretty much do whatever they want, and watch the rest of the effects-heavy ending along with the audience before living happily ever after. The legacy of Indiana Jones isn’t difficult to explain. It’s the story of a manly man who never changes, never loses, and never loses his hat. The secret the audience holds is that Indy is never really in danger because he’s a hero, but Indy doesn’t know that, so we suffer along with his every near miss wince, daring escape gasp, and sudden renewed hope for life. The problem with The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that the author (yes, I’m talking to you, Mr. Lucas) not only inexplicably gives his characters the ability to succeed in doing anything remotely plausible that they attempt but criminally allows the characters to become keenly aware of this. In the first place, the villain is devoid of mystery. Cate Blanchett’s Spalko appears, takes charge, but doesn’t take orders. Her henchmen are barely Star Trek “red shirts,” written to die in horrible ways while the heroes move on. Second, the beginning of the film plays directly into the plot. No independent adventure here showing us that Indy’s still got it; all this is part of the complete story. Finally, only once does Indy actually look likes he’s in danger, but it’s too early in the film and that’s a bad thing. The credits identify one “George Lucas” as the writer here, so that’s where I’ll place the blame. The entire principle cast, from Harrison Ford to Cate Blanchett to Shia LaBeouf to Karen Allen, all are playing their parts to the hilt. But just before the start of the third act and just as the characters are really starting to feel like part of an Indy film, each character in turn suddenly realizes that there’s nothing they can’t do. Mutt figures it out first, then John Hurt’s character (hey look… the crystal skull is a get-out-of-danger-free card!) It dawns on Marion a few moments later for her to save the day, followed by Indy himself who even has the brass to count off the certain dooms they’re surviving. The heroes then simply walk to the last set location, watch the bad guys punished, and wait out the special effects until the credits roll (hey, it worked in Raiders, didn’t it?) Sadly, upon returning to their happy ending, there’s no exposition or explanation for it. You left the country on the suspected Communist list, then you return with honors and complete forgiveness (I guess the top government brass saw the movie’s ending, too). Maybe we all put too much pressure on Mr. Lucas and Steven Spielberg to deliver the Indiana Jones of yesteryear, or maybe too much emphasis was placed on maneuvering Shia LaBeouf into taking over for Harrison Ford (which he could do just fine). The people with the creativity, connections, and the cash could have made anything on screen happen, but what we got instead looks like someone ripped off Chris Carter. Indy and his fans everywhere deserved better than this. Actually, it could be argued that the “ending” was lifted from the first “X-files” movie… only Chris Carter did it better (ouch, did I just really type that?) Stop talking bullcrap!
This movie is great!
Dastardly Red Russians infiltrating an US facility, a cold hearted power crazy dominatrix, a warehouse full of government secrets, an a-bomb blast, saucermen from outerspace, the origin of the gods and human civilisations, natives with blowpipes and arrows, snakes, ants, monkeys, a motorcycle hero, swordfights, jungle chases, quicksand, a grizzled old fart who can still crack a whip, a maid Marion in distress and a cheesy happy ending!
Fun, fun and FUN!!! Richard, all those things are fine… if this was a documentary on the History Channel. When our favorite character has nothing more to do than deliver the McGuffin to the location of the big climax scene (actually, he didn’t get to do that either), he was pretty much on autopilot… kinda like the writer. “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” ripped off the best parts of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and undermined fond memories of the latter while doing it. This review hit the mark exactly.  After waiting anxiously for 19 years and going to see the midnight showing, I left cursing Koepp, Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford for allowing this to happen.  There was simply no concern for the well-being of the characters because they simply didn’t care what danger, no matter how implausible, they were confronting.  It felt recycled, at times like a Mummy sequel in Indy’s clothing, over-bloated with CGI, sappy dialogue that sometimes made me feel I was watching Adam West making 60s Batmanesque leaps of logic and non-sequiturs, and completely forgettable.  In fact, I can’t wait to forget this movie and pretend like it never happened.  As a lifelong, obsessed Indy fan, I DID DESERVE BETTER.  Much better than this uninspiring, unoriginal, going-through-the-motions tripe. I was a  little disappointed in the film.  I am convinced that Lucas has totally lost it.  He ruined Star Wars, now he is going after Indy.  I agree that starting the movie with the main plot is a big mistake.  Indy films, like 007 films follow a particular formula.  This one did not, and it suffered for it.  Acting wise…  I think Ford kind of mailed it in in the fist act, but got back to Indy form in the second and third.  Shia was OK, but his character had no real development.  The main plot was kind of stupid, it sort of followed the Fate of Atlantis video game form the early 90’s. This movie just plain sucks. I can already hear the choir of Lucas fanatics defending this piece of garbage just like they did with the last three Star Wars movies. Grow up people. …The content of the movie doesn’t even deserve to be talked about. Waste of breath. Waste of time. Waste of money. The sooner I forget this tragedy the better. I’m done. I need to throw up. I wish my mind could throw up what I just saw. Ugggghhhhhhhh!!!!! I agree with all of the comments above.  This movie was an absolute disaster.  This is all I need to keep on writing my graphic novel.  Who in the world is left to make good movies these days ? I honestly don’t see how people could “hate” this movie. Many people are just too clingy to “calssic” status to realize this movie was actually pretty good.
Indiana Jones has always been about the divine and the farfetched.
The ending was along the line of the other films (openinign the ark and the bad guys dying, picking the wrong grail and dying). The whole aliens thing was a good idea. Seriosuly, theyve done the judeo-christian bit twice alreay, it was time to move on to something more original.
I liked the movie, but of course there are some reasons to dislike it (since it wasnt perfect), but to disregard it completely? I think a fan of the series (im not a hardcore fan) couldnt do such a thing for any reason other than “ruining classic status”. Which I don’t beleive this film does, and besides thats a silly reason to hate a movie anyway. All the films have their own qualities which are likeable (some more than others). This one entertains in a creative fashion without stepping too far from originals. That is why id give it a 3/4. ANd I’d have to say its the 2nd best of the series. I’ve been obsessing over this film for the last day and a half. Not because I liked it, the exact opposite actually. I felt cheated, disappointment and rage that my favorite film character dwindled from bada$$ to Batman (The Schumacher variety). It’s comforting to read other people sharing my point of view.
On other threads, it is always brought up that George Lucas said something along the lines that this isn’t going to live up to the hype of the other Indy films. Because George went on record to say “Don’t get your hopes up”, that gives him a free pass to make a shitty movie? This is his baby, for crying-out-loud. It’s up to him, Steven, and Harrison to make a film that does live up to the hype. Don’t be satisfied with mediocrity. Put that movie against any of the other Indy movies and tell me it doesn’t deserve to be either forgotten, or a distant fourth.
Oh yeah. It’s an Indiana Jones film. I want stunts and explosions, not CG and blue screen. Someone else’s review I read mentioned the “theatrical set” appearance to the film. I swear you could actually see the spotlights sticking through the holes in the set in the burial chamber where the skull is found. Back, top left corner… you can actually see the white tubing! It was almost as if the movie were (and I’m feeling sick that I may be exactly right) written around the future creation of a theme park ride for Universal. You know, to replace that crappy “Jaws” ride. Bad people!!, did not you see, the Tarzan scene???, falling from a ultra big cascade not once but three times???, the flying Kenmore???
you guys ask too much!!, that is pure magic, bye!!.  Whaaaaaaa!! cleaning my tears. Man, you guys are all a bunch of self-important cynical dipshits. This movie was exactly what is should have been. Campy, funny, adventurous, and fun.
Let me get this right: If it sticks to its roots then it’s “recycling”, and if it tries something new it’s “betrayal”.
Get your pessimistic heads out of your asses and stop pretending Lucas murdered your mother with this movie.
The whole theater seemed to be digging it, and so did I.
Isn’t it fucking boring to hate everything? I mean, I understand this site is chock full ‘o SCARY RED SKULLS and you all have to act accordingly hardcore, but give me a break.
If you wanted ‘Raiders’ then go fucking RENT it. Keel, we’re sorry our opinion differs from yours. How can we hate everything when gave “Speed Racer” a positive review? And in the Thursday-night theater we were in, everyone went in very excited and somehow came out subdued, like waiting for a lottery number to be called out and finding out nobody had the right number. I completely agree this whole movie felt like the set up for a theme park ride. And Is it just me or did that “Crystal Skull” look like a crap plastic children’s toy? I have no problem with Indy up against the forces of darkness and supernatural themes but when you introduce parallel universes and Aliens that’s just stupid. This felt (and I swear I feel sink in saying this) like a cheap knock off of Tomb Raider… shouldn’t it be the other way around? I kept thinking through-out it how “star gate”-ish the movie was. Now – to me that’s not that bad of a thing, I love/adore Star Gate but this was supposed to be Indy! Oh well….it was enjoyable and Indy is as sexy as ever – even if he’s pushing 70. Also – I thought Marion looked better in this movie than in the first one. She’s wearing her years well. “Man, you guys are all a bunch of self-important cynical dipshits.
…
I mean, I understand this site is chock full ??o SCARY RED SKULLS and you all have to act accordingly hardcore, but give me a break.
If you wanted ??Raiders? then go fucking RENT it.” For something that was supposed to be as big as it was made from crystal, you’re right, Sasha… it didn’t seem to have any real weight. An adult human skull (which is porous bone) is about 2.25 lbs, while the slightly smaller pure-crystal Mitchell-Hedges skull weighs in at just under 12 lbs, almost five times more than a real skull (or about the weight of a light bowling ball). By contrast, the skull in “Indy 4″ looks to be at least three times longer, or a guestimated weight of about 35 lbs (heavier than a 16″ x 8″ x 8” cement cinder block), so imagine tossing something that heavy around. I give this film 3 out of 5 stars.  Three severe issues keep it from reaching the greatness it could have achieved.  First, it is out of the genre of the other Indy films – this one is sci-fi not action/adventure which is why at the end, I felt like I had seen a different film than I expected.  Second, the villains where stupid and uninteresting.  They never reached their potential so when they died, it was just sort of inevitable rather than a pent of relief.  Half the time, it seemed like Indy and Irena were working together to solve the mysteries.  I think Blanchet was not good in this role – poorly played and half they time she just ignored her accent.  The quest for knowledge is just a silly goal for an arch-villain.  Third, why such little explanation of what the artifact is they were going for?  It took too long to explain the plot.  I loved that in Raiders, we were told of the mysterious hocus pocus about 15 minutes in.  I think here, an hour into the film I still didn’t know what they were trying to do so the story just meandered about. Wow, I am glad that I read all these reviews. I have very fond memories of Indy, and it disappoints me that Lucas decided to destroy this series as well. I guess this is one more over-hyped summer movie I won’t see. And for all those people saying old = recycled and new = trash, I would have to disagree. The point is to keep what people loved from the original, and create something new and differentiated enough to recall the original, yet be new and fun on its own. That’s the mark of a good writer/director. Give people what they loved, and not 2 hours of CGI crap. I stopped watching Lucas movies after sitting through an hour of Jar Jar Binks. I could have made a better movie myself–easily, no sweat. Maybe a lot of us could have, I dunno; too bad those twits have control over so much of the industry. (At least they could have run it by one of us, in the development stages, for editing. I’d have consigned most of it to the garbage and pulled out something more palatably fresh.) The crystal skull has no brains. Lucas should have been a doctor: I’m cured. Lucas must be the worst writer director in history, if you look at the best star wars and indy movies they were all directed by people other than lucas and scripted by people other than lucas, empire was the pinacle of the star wars movies for me coz it had a director who knew how to direct and make a dramatic movie and how to dircet actors, lucas simply cannot write scripts or direct movies, his ego is so huge that he simply will not even entertain the idea that someone can develop his ideas into movie scripts better than him clear evidence of this is his documented(?) refusal to let speilberg direct a star wars movie and thats a shame, the direction of the last three star wars was terrible, the acting wooden the dialogue appalling, i physically cringed when the darth vader takes his first steps on his new legs with a ‘nooooooo” how awful,  and lucas’s done it again with indy 4.  Spielberg on the other hand is a genius as his track record proves, as a so called friend of Lucas’s maybe he should have a heart to heart with lucas and bring him back to reality?Lucas needs to let go of the thing he loves if it is to flourish coz he’s just strangling his own babies! I just wanted to say that if you haven’t yet seen the first three movies of Indiana Jones trilogy, be prepared to watch the forth installment cause it is one of the best summer block buster movie of all time out a doubt . We have seen two of the most dynamic duo couple along with a few new comers to join together with Karen Allen and Harrison Ford as being their son that Indy has never seen for quite a while now . Still Marion has her opportunity to take charge of things as well . I think in a way they seem to be one of the most amazing icons of actors that we haven’t seen for the longest time and it’s great to see all of them back in this particular movie including both Steven and George Lucas also . You know, I have seen this movie several times already, and I have to say, I totally disagree with the negative people here. Everyone has the right to their opinion, but I’ll tell you, if you think the people who even like the movie are simply “afraid to stand up to Lucas or Spielberg” that is completely wrong. Many people liked the movie, in which a lot don’t feel the need to go on line and rip on it. I personally am sick of people saying such negative stuff about Crystal Skull. In truth, it’s all about nit-picking. You could pick out aspects from the other three movies that would appear unrealistic and goofy just like the new one. As if tearing out someone’s still beating heart and for them to be still alive isn’t unrealistic. Sorry, but Temple of Doom was the worst of the series, not that it’s a bad film, but the first, second, and the fourth are much better. People have simply changed too much in 19 years to appreciate this new film completely. Raiders is still the best, but I consider Crystal Skull my personal favorite. People just aren’t watching it with an open enough mind. This is just my opinion, but I’ve seen the movie enough to stand firm and say it was an excellent adventure flick. Ross, it’s true that a number of people enjoyed the movie as it was. In fact, there’s a whole bunch of movies that kind of “happen” that are perfectly fine. I think that the biggest complaint here is that it felt as though Indy didn’t really matter, that all this would have happened whether he was involved or not. Additionally, if you start thinking about the story in question, things don’t make a lot of sense (Are the skulls evil? Should he return it at all? Will they come back?) In every other Indy film, Indy “saved the day” by making important choices (although it can be argues that all he really did in Raiders is save Marion, which is kinda all he managed to do here as well). For die-hard fans of the series, they wanted more Indy doing believable and important stuff and all they got was exposition and standing around watching special effects. Did Indy actually do anything WE couldn’t have done?",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2008"," Of all the emotions fighting for dominance as the end credits rolled on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — satisfaction, joy, even a pang of bittersweet sadness — the one that won out, for me, was relief. They’d done it — “they,” of course, being Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford. They had brought Indy back to us, our Indy, and they hadn’t screwed it up. Better still, they’d involved him in a cracking good tale very much in the tradition of the previous three adventures. Underneath it all is the hunger of all three to prove they can still pack a punch, draw back a curtain and make you gasp or laugh or both at once. Even as a die-hard Indy fan, I was nervously prepared for this outing to be lame and redundant. But I don’t quite understand the naysayers on this one: Crystal Skull delivers. A bit saggier in the jowls but no less inquisitive, tenacious, or witheringly sarcastic in the face of big evil lugs, Ford’s Indy is still teaching and still running afoul of people who want ancient doo-dads. It’s 1957, when the Russians were the big bads, and they seem to think psychic powers will help them rule the world. One of their number, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, camping and vamping deliciously), wants Indy to lead her and her minions to a crystal skull hidden amid the leaves, mummies and vicious ants of Peru. Along the way, Indy casts off a duplicitous partner (Ray Winstone), picks up a greaser sidekick named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf, who acquits himself with humor and grace despite the sneering of many fanboys), finds old colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt), who appears to have been addled by his exposure to the skull, and reunites with his great lost love Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Part of what makes Crystal Skull work for a part of the audience is the weight of nostalgia, the long gap between it and the last film (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, from 1989) — on some level it’s a farewell-tour package where the members of the band put on one last spectacular arena show. At least I hope it’s a farewell — any more after this would probably be pushing it. How’s the action? Spielberg stages it with a seemingly long-forgotten instinct for the mechanics of momentum and release. Other than an expendable bit involving Mutt and some monkeys (I smell Lucas all over that one), the sequences — clipped together by Michael Kahn with his usual unearthly mix of smooth and sharp — join suspense and comedy in just the right old way. And seeing Indy delve once again into some godforsaken cobwebby place where less cautious others have perished and rotted just made me illogically blissful. It occurs to me that Ford is often only as good as the co-stars who can bring out his snark and his vulnerability in equal measure. In recent years it’s mainly just been him up there, straining to keep some thinly written thriller or drama afloat. Here he works opposite the disdain of youth (LaBeouf), the hauteur of evil (Blanchett), the babbling of a cracked mystic (Hurt), and the fury of a woman scorned (Allen), though this last gentles into the familiar spiky rhythm of “Jones, you bastard, I love you! Now save us, you idiot!” The more detached reviewers can tell you exactly why David Koepp’s script is so blatantly contrived as to reteam Indy and Marion, but some of us have been waiting twenty-seven years to see these two together again, and if they had launched into a Bollywood song and dance it would not have blemished my gratitude one iota. The movie plays and sounds like a vintage Indy film, though it looks subtly different, sometimes not so subtly. Douglas Slocombe, who shot the previous entries, was a sorcerer conjuring deep shades of tan and red and blue. The images popped. Here, Spielberg replaces the long-retired Slocombe with his cinematographer since Schindler’s List, Janusz Kaminski, whose palette is a bit more washed-out. But I grew to accept this: Indy is grayer, we all are, and so is the film, which seems to truly launch — after a slam-bang opening capped with Indy silhouetted against a mushroom cloud, an image so ballsy-iconic I loved it as much as many will loathe it — with a saddening moment when Indy takes stock of the people he’s lost. So when Indy maneuvers around the long-dead in their crypts this time, he may see more in them now than he’s comfortable with. Crystal Skull tips its fedora warily to the march of time — I can’t adequately express how jarring it is to hear rock ‘n’ roll in an Indy film, as it’s meant to be. But that doesn’t mean we’re not still transported and rejuvenated by the journey. By the last scene, with Harrison Ford looking goofily happy in his bow tie, some of us can’t help grinning right along with him. That’s entertainment.",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2008"," Indy 4, the first sequel since Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade (1989), sort of holds up to the other successful box office but ordinary films in the noted action series, as it’s probably decent enough to get over for the fan base of the franchise even if it’s a downgrade from the others.  But this version never rocked my boat Daddy-O, as I found it filled with too much hokum, bogus nostalgia, contrivances, lame daddy jokes, uninspired acting, a dumb story, hard to fathom senior citizen heroics (by the 65-year-old Harrison Ford) even for a popcorn escapist blockbuster, a one-note humorless villain trying too hard to be funny and the unimaginative use of CGI. That’s not to say it was a bad film, it had a few pleasant scenes, but a film that underwhelmed me (and I wasn’t expecting much). Steven Spielberg directs (“Saving Private Ryan”/”Close Encounters of the Third Kind”/ “Schindler’s List”) it in an exhausting manner, trying at all costs to keep it old-fashioned, action-packed and cutesy charming. Executive producer George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson hand in the childish big boy adventure story that’s written without distinction by David Koepp.  It opens at a desert atomic testing site in 1957, in Nevada, the infamous Area 51, where a military convoy dressed as Americans turns out to be Russian KGB operatives led by a Louise Brooks-bobbed lookalike and Garbo sounding Ninotchka military scientist, garbed in dreary gray coveralls, named Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). When the villain gets to her military destination she dumps out of the car trunk the brown fedora wearing university archaeological professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his longtime OSS pal, Mac (Ray Winstone), and forces them to help her find one special crate in a military storehouse, filled with crates, that contains an alien made skull from the 15th century that was taken in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, by the Americans that she believes will help Russia win the cold war arms race. After a daring escape from the Russians, our hero must survive a nuclear blast and does so in a most unusual way. It then moves on to red-baiting FBI agents forcing Jones to take a leave of absence from his teaching post, as the decorated war hero is amazingly suspected of being a possible Red. He then hooks up with teenage greaser Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a jive talking Brando-ish caricature from The Wild One, who is a switch-blade carrying, black-leather motorcycle clad biker sporting a DA hairstyle. The kid possesses a letter with an arcane map that’s written in an ancient tongue and his mom wants the professor to translate it. It turns out to be about the fabled lost city of El Dorado, in remote Peru, that contains the rock crystal skull of Akator, and contains a farout mysterious legend. After surviving on the kid’s motorcyle a daredevil chase from the KGB agents, in a car, through the college library, the pair bond. At the ancient site in Peru the kid and Jones, armed with his trademark bullwhip reunites with the former lover he abandoned many years ago, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the kid’s mom, and also meets a babbling old colleague Professor Oxley (John Hurt) who is touched in the head after looking too long at the crystal skull. The foursome then must combat the overwhelming presence of the Soviets, going over three waterfalls, a harrowing chase in military vehicles, millions of swarming deadly red ants, head-hunters with poison darts, quick sand, scary caves, and all kinds of other catastrophes before finding out about the crystal skull’s ancient legend. The climax leaves us with a mysterious paranormal whirlwind, that looks like the leftover set from The Ten Commandments—it was that kind of a derivative film, that failed to feel inspired or of adding anything of value to the franchise.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2008","  If some 32nd-century archeologist were to unearth a DVD copy of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Paramount), her first task—after converting the barbaric early digital technology to a more current brain-wave-based viewing system—would be to understand what this object meant to the culture that created it. What combination of nostalgia, repetition compulsion, and love of big, dumb spectacle would have sent these benighted tribesmen back to the Indiana Jones myth 27 years after its creation and 19 years since Indiana last rode into the sunset? Why did the people of the early 21st century still need Indiana Jones? As our future archeologist might point out to her students, there’s no disputing the sheer workmanship of the artifact. Though none of the sequels yet unearthed can quite match the original for fineness of detail, this “Spielberg”—did the name designate just one man, or was it a group attribution for a guild of anonymous craftsmen?—was unquestionably a master artisan of the still-primitive film form. The mark of the Spielberg school is particularly evident in The Crystal Skull’scar-chase sequences. One spectacular chase through the Amazon forest, a wildly imaginative deployment of every possible combination of vehicle, weapon, obstacle, and flying human body, almost recalls the stunts of Buster Keaton (to invoke one of this long-dead civilization’s lost cinematic saints). And Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) himself, the archetypal whip-cracking archeology professor, is more miraculously preserved than the Roswell space aliens and mummified conquistadors he digs up over the course of the movie. It’s as if, after decades of exile in mediocre films now lost to the sands of time, the craggy 65-year-old (who, incredibly, still does most of his own stunts) has returned to the role he was always meant to play.  Surviving accounts suggest that some ancient scribes rose up against Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, calling it “sticky kids’ stuff” or “cynical, clinical gibberish.” Though it’s a scholar’s job to shed her 32nd-century prejudices and understand the belief systems of those long dead, our archeologist will have to ask herself: What were these scribes thinking? Were they expecting something more fun than Cate Blanchett as a pitiless Ukrainian KGB agent driven by a Faustian lust for knowledge or John Hurt as a scholar driven mad after staring into the eye sockets of a glass cranium from outer space? Were they disappointed with the return of the buoyant Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Indy’s tomboyish lost love? Were they too jaded to enjoy the fantasy of driving a jeep down three consecutive waterfalls or descending the ingeniously constructed retracting staircase inside a Peruvian obelisk to reach the portal to another dimension? Did they get to wake up every day and see a wittily choreographed motorcycle chase through the quads of Yale (called Marshall University in the film)?  Even the most enthusiastic future Indy scholar would have to concede that the movie’s habit of quoting from venerable Hollywood antiquities sometimes has the unfortunate effect of reminding the viewer that those movies were better. No amount of ducktail-combing or Harley-revving is going to make the doe-eyed Shia LaBeouf into Marlon Brando in The Wild One, and the close encounter that Indy and Co. experience when they finally reach that interdimensional portal is nowhere near as thrilling as Richard Dreyfuss’ apotheosis in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But expecting Brando-esque menace or Dreyfus-ian uplift from the Indiana Jones tetralogy is like going to the candy counter at the mall multiplex and asking for some goat cheese and a nice cabernet instead of malted milk balls and a Coke. Spielberg’s movies are crude but efficient systems for the delivery of pleasure—this is both the gift and the curse of the man who invented the summer blockbuster. Early in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the third installment in the series, Indy, seeking to recover a priceless antique from a brigand, brandishes the artifact and scolds, “This belongs in a museum.” “You belong in a museum,” the villain replies. It’s not meant as a compliment—immediately afterward, the guy throws Indy off the side of a ship—but I think history will prove the bad guy right. Indiana Jones—both the swashbuckling archeologist and the joyfully hokey, brazenly sentimental, obscenely successful franchise he sired—is a part of our culture’s Hollywood patrimony. When that Virgin Megastore gets excavated in 3112 A.D., I hope Indiana Jones ends up where it belongs.",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2008","Even as the movie occasionally trips over its nostalgias, it's still a likable, if unremarkable, entertainment, a pleasant echo of past delights.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2008"," To me, Raiders of the Lost Ark will always be The Movie. The ultimate movie, the movie that is synonymous with the word movie. Even more so than Star Wars, this is the movie that made me sit up and take notice and realize, Oh my god, I love movies. Oh my god, I wanna do something with my life that is all about movies.
So, you know, it was with a particular kind of dread that I approached Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I was afraid it would be like going to your high-school reunion and finding out that that cool guy you were madly in love with in ninth grade was now an accountant with a passionate interest in golf. Or like going to see Star Wars Episode I and discovering it was about an annoying little kid and a Rastafarian reptile. But it isn’t. It’s… Indiana Jones. Even as off-the-track as Harrison Ford (Hollywood Homicide, What Lies Beneath) has been for the last decade and a half — really, he hasn’t had a decent role since 1993’s The Fugitive — he’s suddenly Indiana Jones again. A little older, a little rougher, a little more mileage, honey, but… yeah. It’s kinda like you scratched that golf-loving accountant and discovered that, hey, maybe he’s still got it after all. All I know is this: I sat through two hours of Crystal Skull and when it was over, my jaw was aching, because I hadn’t stopped grinning like a little kid the whole time. I love this movie. I love it. Look: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are not attempting to break new cinematic ground here, like could be arguably said about Raiders, in that it was its own kind of accidental metacommentary on movie history — if nothing else, Raiders certainly had just the right impact at just the right time to influence an entire generation’s taste in pop culture. That’s not gonna happen with Crystal Skull — we’re just revisiting an old friend. Raiders was the asteroid crashing into the old entertainment world, making room for the fantasy action movie (as distinct from the sci-fi blockbuster, even if the two subgenres have since meshed). Crystal Skull couldn’t hope to have that same kind of impact… no pun intended. I can’t imagine why anyone would have imagined it would. So, yes, there’s a lot of little nods to all sorts of things we remember dearly from Raiders and Last Crusade (though not so much that middle movie that is probably better left alone), things that are here purely for nostalgia’s sake, because it’s a secret language we all speak, as dear old friends do. The movie opens with the old Paramount logo, the one that melted into the mountain in the opening of Raiders, and here it melts into, well, something else, and it’s very funny. The movie is set in 1957 amidst the Cold War and Red scares and all things Soviet, and though Indy never once says, “Russians: I hate these guys,” even though they keep showing up at inconvenient moments, you know he’s thinking it. You know that the screenwriters (David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson and George Lucas) and director Spielberg (War of the Worlds, Catch Me If You Can) left a little dead air hanging there in one scene so that we all in the audience could fill it in. And I love that. When someone here yells, “Those darts are poison!” you can’t help but go, Well, of course they are. This is where we are, in Indy’s world. And yet the situations Indy finds himself in here have moved with their times, too: it wasn’t just Reds we were afraid of in the 1950s, but flying saucers, too, and government conspiracies covering them up. So how cool is it that Indy finds himself at Area 51 as the movie opens, kidnapped by Soviet dominatrix-scientist Irina Spalko (the always awesome Cate Blanchett: Elizabeth: The Golden Age, I’m Not There), who smacks Indy around some and yells at him in that intimidating accent until he agrees to help them find something very special and unique in a big secret government warehouse? (Yes, it’s that big secret government warehouse where the Ark of the Covenant got tucked away. Not that the Soviets know that.) If Raiders was a 1930 adventure serial, then Crystal Skull is a 1950s sci-fi movie. Of course it is. What else would it be? Oh, and there’s this: You thought a big rock rolling out a cave constitutes peril? Oh man, just wait till you see Crystal Skull’s big-rock-rolling-out-of-the-cave. It’s, well… there was something else we were all terrified of in the 1950s, too, and Indy gets it right in the face. There seems to be a bit of a nudging toward a new movie series here with Indy’s hanger-on and reluctant assistant, Mutt Williams, who all but picks up Indy’s hat by the end of the film. But it might be best if Spielberg and Lucas left that alone. Shia LaBeouf (Transformers, Disturbia) is unquestionably adorable and very funny as Mutt, but while it’s awfully nice to visit Indy’s world again, we don’t want to get tired of it. Better if we parted ways after this, while we all still have pleasant memories of our time together. Much of what passes for criticism in movies [and in my own avocation, theatre] seems predicated on “I hate it; I’m above it all, if I’m not sneering I’m not doing my job”.  Even when you don’t care for a film, you are still trying to find good in it — and you have more class than to pander to that “general herd” tone in what you write. Thanks MaryAnn — I’m bursting at the seams to see this now, and regretting the chance I passed up this afternoon to do just that. Thanks for this review MaryAnn. I think a lot of people had the same fear, that it would feel more like a high school reunion or a comeback tour than a genuine Indy film, or simply a fear that this would be “the Phantom Menace of the Indy series”. Totally legitimate concerns of course, but I think the movie puts them soundly to rest. Obviously it’s not perfect, it doesn’t match Raiders, but then what can? To me it rests very comfortably alongside Temple of Doom and Last Crusade, which is just exactly where it belongs. Really the only part of the movie that put me off – trying to stay spoiler-free here – was Indy’s way of surviving an early threat in the film (alluded to in the review), with Indy and the object he uses to get out of his predicament being apparently invincible. I just didn’t buy it. But that’s hardly enough to drag the film down, and at least the payoff shot when it’s over is spectacular. I just saw the film tonight and having just read your review I agree with everything you said and also that analogy with Crystal Skull being a nod to 50’s sci fi movies makes so much sense to me.  I had these complaints with the film but after reading your review they well just went away.  Totally agree with you 100%. I just came back from seeing the movie again, and one of my gang of geeks said something similar. And I said to him, You mean, you’re okay with the, ahem, whole big shebang of an ending and what it says about the crystal skull people and how their story ends, but you’re bothered by a little convenient escape from doom? Lucas has said in interviews that it was an intentional nod to 50s SF movies (or he’d pack up his toys and go home), which, in a meta-commentary way is neat, but I have trepidation about mixing Indy and flying saucers.  Nervous excitement is part for Lucas projects these days.  Oh well, I will see.  I’m relieved others like it. It’s the sort of thing I try to do myself with my silly little Ashley Porter series of movies (see link on my name if you’re curious), and it’s fun to see Spielberg and Lucas doing that too! I can see that MaryAnne is a kindred spirit for whom movies are a drug, for ecapism & for highs that are not chemically induced.    We are all growing weary of the pompous,
unimaginative reviewers that demand realism & try to impose a movie-making blueprint that must be cast in stone. If they want something believable, they should sit on a park bench & watch ordinary people walk past for two hours whilst real film fans enjoy ‘Crystal Skull’ again & again.  ok..i’m going into this one with lowered expectations. i’ve seen the trailer and read the reviews, and i still can’t decide if it’s good or bad. but i’m going to go see it on one account: shia lebeouf. this kid is AWESOME. his two lines and ten seconds of screen time on charlie’s angels 2 were by far the best thing about that mess (“i’m fifteen and a half..” is THE line of the movie). then i saw holes and i was like…WOW. so i’m expecting big things from Shia – maybe, just maybe, he’ll steal the movie away from an aging harrison ford. 1) The first movie dealt with an Ark that contained the AWESOME POWER OF ALMIGHTY DOG!
2) The second movie dealt with eating monkey brains.  The less said the better.
3) The third movie dealt with Knights who say Ni! and Castle Anthrax and… wait, wrong Grail movie.  The third movie dealt with Indy’s dad being a retired Bond. Every movie, Indy’s dealing with the supernatural, things and powers that don’t exist in the real world (not to where there’s any reliable surviving witnesses).  So how can interdimensional beings (not from outer space, but hyperspatial realities like the 5th dimension and beyond) be any less believable? My biggest problem?  In Part III he tells us most archaeology is done from the library.  In Part IV he’s telling us to get out of the library.  Make up your mind, dude! At the risk of being called pompous I’ll voice a dissenting opinion.  I was 13 when I saw Raiders in the theater and it blew me away.  I had Indiana Jones posters on my bedroom wall.  I had an official Indiana Jones hat which I lost throwing it off the top of the pyramid at Chichen Itza whilst getting my Anthropology degree working on a dig in Belize.  I *Love* that film. The biggest problem I have with Indy4 is that they changed the character.  Sure, Harrison Ford can still get it done, but the writing is off.  We loved Indy because he’s a screwup – we can identify with him.  He’s always getting into real trouble and either getting lucky or doing something really smart or ballsy to get out of it.  He’s never really in trouble in this film, certainly never because he screwed up in some way.  He always has the situation pretty much in hand.  He goes toe to toe with the 7 foot Russian guy, trading punches!  He is never clever.  The writers lazily try to pass off reams of textbooky dialog as smarts, but he doesn’t do a single smart thing in this movie. And MaryAnn, I am kinda surprised you didn’t have anything to say about what they did to the Marion character.  She was tough and independent; drinking guys under the table and holding her own in a bar room brawl.  Now?  All she can do is make doe eyes at Indy? Another thing I loved about the previous films was the sense of place.  I loved going to the Middle East, to China, to Germany – it was all interesting.  Most of this movie takes place in generic CG jungle. And why did they make him a war hero?  It’s not dissimilar to making Greedo shoot first.  Indy was a scoundrel.  If I’d written that scene and the CIA goons were demanding “What did do in the war, what did you ever do against the Germans?”, I’d have simply gotten a sly knowing grin out of Indy and we’d all have shared a laugh.  He was always outside of the military. I’ve gone on too long.  John Hurt and Jim Broadbent are fantastic actors, underused.  The acting in general was good.  I liked the Nevada sequence (except for the gophers).  The ending felt like one long FX shot leading into another – I found it very tedious.  It also seemed like the Indy theme didn’t happen very much. Finally a question: Why did the alien become evil?  Why come here, teach us irrigation and whatnot and then become angry when someone returns your head?  I just didn’t understand what was going on there. Brook: I read somewhere that this was the first Indiana Jones movie entirely shot within the United States, which would account for the generic CGI jungles — they’ve replaced the actual foreign locations. (And animals. Oy, the animals.) The alien didn’t “become evil,” it was just pissed off at the Commies, who (and since it can presumably read minds, it *knows* this) were just after Power, not knowledge and enlightenment. Actually, Indy wasn’t “always outside of the military”. That scene was a wonderful recap of everything we’ve missed in the last 19 years. Of course Indy fought the Nazi’s in WWII. He was, after all, an intelligence officer of the Belgian army in WWI! And if you want to say, “That was the show, not the movies” (and why on earth would you do that?!), as soon as Indy mentions riding with a certain Mexican outlaw as a kid, it all gets tied together. 
And MaryAnn, I am kinda surprised you didn’t have anything to say about what they did to the Marion character. She was tough and independent; drinking guys under the table and holding her own in a bar room brawl. Now? All she can do is make doe eyes at Indy?
 How can you say that’s all she does?! Did you not notice that *amazing* bit of driving she does in the jungle? Marion still kicks plenty ass. Are you kidding me? This movie was terrible! Easily the biggest movie let down since SW Episodes 1-3. George Lucas needs to find a better way to make money than by corrupting great movies and stories that do not need retelling OR follow ups. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? More like Minnesota Smith and the House of Jar-Jar Binks. TERRIBLE! Minnesota Smith…that’s actually sort of an awesome character name, heh. Of course it helps that Minnesota is the coolest state in the Union…literally and figuratively. Regarding the jungles again: apparently the non-CGI portions were filmed in Hawaii, which may account for their seeming so generic, because we’re all so used to Hawaii’s jungles after several seasons of Lost. MaryAnn – I can accept liking this film, but when you say Marian “still kicks plenty ass” you have descended into blinders-wearing fanboydom.  Even if I suspend my disbelief to the point that she could have predicted the behaviour of the tree, that’s one drop in a bucket of cloying.  Her character is thin.  They all are. On a semi-related note – your review of Hitch a while back changed my opinion of the movie.  I came out of it thinking it was a harmless bit of poorly-made fluff, but you made a very convincing argument that it was much worse than that. Touche.  I’m not up on my Young Indy canon.  I keep meaning to buy those DVDs (I remember quite liking the show when I managed to catch it on tv).  Was he an intelligence officer for more than a day?  He seemed to stumble in and out of roles rather quickly. I would have preferred he not be in the military.  In fact that whole recap was just too easy (and helped take him from everyman to superhero which is my main complaint).  Of course he fought the Nazis – he hates those guys!  We’ve already seen him do it.  He was on board for fighting the Nazis well before the American government was.  I wish he’d done it on his own terms. You mean, precisely how the original films missed all the many opportunities they might conceivably have had to showcase all the deep archaeological findings and history in South America, China, India, the Middle East, and the Western United States? The point isn’t that she predicted how the tree would behave, but that she took a chance on flying off the cliff in the first place. How does that make her less than tough? And how does the life she clearly has lived in the meantime make her less than independent? I didn’t find her cloying at all. And if you think she’s as thin as the rest of them, then clearly the movie didn’t treat her any differently than it treated the other characters, and wouldn’t have merited special mention anyway. Not in any major way. I’m a little easier on *Starship Troopers* than I was initially. But I generally don’t have time to rewatch a lot of movies… certainly not ones that I didn’t like in the first place. And rewatching is essential if you’re going to change your opinion. Saw this yesterday and while I loved the first half, I was floored by the offensiveness, but racial and cinematic, by the second half of the film.  Now, I know ‘cinematic’ offensiveness, when applied to Tarzan antics, aliens, and ‘ant fights’ is totally subjective and it looks like enough people have already mentioned that. …that the technologies of a mysterious, non-white society are so advanced that they can only be explained by the presence of extraterrestials.  That indigenous people weren’t smart enough to have made such things on their own, they needed E.T. to show them how to build their temples, build their tools, invent language, etc. You probably remember the dialogue better than I do, but is there not a piece of dialogue that basically says “There’s no way these people could made this technology on their own.”? I had a similar problem with Alien Vs. Predator, where the plot twist is that the ancient indigenous civilizations build their pyramids to appease Predators having their coming of age ritual.  No, Crystal Skull wasn’t THAT bad, but it basically recycles the same lame plot point.  That if white people didn’t make it and it can’t be fully explained, it musta been aliens. I’m sure a lot of people will cry “IT’S ONLY A MOVIE, AN INDY MOVIE AT THAT!”, but I wonder how those people would feel if say, Stonehenge, the Renaissance, or any great benchmark of Western Civilization were written off in a film as the result of alien involvement… if it wouldn’t feel like a cheap and lazy plot twist. That all being said, I don’t think Lucas, Spielberg, and co. are out and out racists.  I just think, like happened with Temple of Doom, they overestimated the limits of saying “oh, it’s just a movie.” Um, well, Stonehenge is already the subject of its own alien conspiracy theories, and I don’t particularly find them offensive. But then I’m Irish, not English. Also, isn’t the line about the ancient Peruvians not having that technology about the crystal skull, which Indy then immediately notes is also true of modern-day technology? I have an Indy question–why is Temple of Doom so reviled? I’ve heard the phrase “it wasn’t as bad as Temple of Doom” a few times now about this movie, and it’s starting to annoy me. Granted TOD certainly upped the goofiness quotient, but it was still a great ride. I wish people would stop talking about it in hushed, shameful tones as if it were Arthur 2: On The Rocks.  Jigsy, I quite enjoy Temple of Doom also, though once Last Crusade came out it certainly became the odd one out in many people’s minds. 
Also, isn’t the line about the ancient Peruvians not having that technology about the crystal skull, which Indy then immediately notes is also true of modern-day technology?
 How the hell can you say this was a good flick in the least bit? I bet you think that the newer star wars flicks were good too huh? Listen i am a huge fan of the indy flicks but after watching the first three before having seen the new flick on opening day i found myself sad inside that another childhood memory was soiled by lucas. I liked the first half of Crystal Skull. Especially the nuke bit. Then it got all Lucasy. Meaning too much “humor” and a needlessly convoluted plot (I’m still not 100% clear on what anyone was after or why. Seriously George, you can’t write. Stop it.) What’s interesting is just how the timing of movies work. I hear all the time that the Last Crusade was the odd one out, but being only 24, it was the first one I saw, and continues to be my favorite. I can’t agree with the praise for the new one, and it makes me sad to do so. It just didn’t work for me, I kind of have to agree that it feels Lucasy. He should stick to management/tech and basic story generating, then hand the reins to someone else. It’s like he gets fidgety and tweaks too much, and he’s George Lucas, so who’s going to call him on it. C’mon guys! It’s Indy! Where’s your suspension of disbelief!? This is the same Indy that dangled from rope bridges and slid out from under rolling rocks! Of course the fridge scene is preposterous, but it’s SUPPOSED to be silly! For those of you who say Marion has no character, I disagree. She’s clearly spunky and independent, often disregarding opinions other than her own, as evidenced by the driving-a-jeep-off-a-cliff scene. Her rapport and dialogue with Indy is simply hilarious! And Cate Blanchett is acting up a storm, as usual, even though her villain is a little too Boris-and-Natasha cartoony. Sure, Indy villains are always cartoony, but she takes it to the extreme. She’s like those strict German or Russian babysitters in children’s cartoons. Crystal Skull was a lousy parody of the Indy movies. Not only did it fail to strike the balance between wild fancy and gritty suspense (it didn’t even come close, in fact), it centered on a story that was so inherently nonsensical and vapid, and dialog so witless and tone-deaf, that the entire mess was genuinely sad. And you can see George Lucas’ blundering thumbprints all over the damn thing. Someone needs to tell him, seriously, that he has no idea how to tell a story, or to view the world outside of the little box of an immature kid who has no sense of humor.  I can suspend disbelief with the best of them. And the Indy series, in the three original films, actually did a wonderful job of leading you to the place where it didn’t matter if some of it was just damn silly or over-the-top, or if the snake pit was filled with harmless rat snakes. But they didn’t ask to leave all of your expectations, common sense, and reason at the door. This one does. In spades. It’s all silly and stupid, and that just doesn’t cut it. I loved the first three films, even Temple of Doom (it was the first one I saw, so I guess that probably influences my opinion a little). Don’t get me wrong, I thought Crystal Skull was…okay. My biggest issue with it is that there is no mystery left at the end of the film (well, no mystery that isn’t a plot hole, anyway). In the first three films the artifacts were powerful, mysterious, magical things that could not be fully explained. Even the holy grail left you wondering – did Jesus really drink from that? Is God real? Crystal Skull just leaves you thinking…yes, God is real, and he’s an alien. Why is the crystal skull so powerful, mysterious and magical? Well, because it’s an alien skull. That’s just what they’re like. Aliens have super powers and that’s awesome! For me, the film would have been much more powerful if they’d just cut the alien shots and the massive spacecraft out and kept the rest relatively untouched. Then we could at least have wondered who these strange beings were and connected the alien dots ourselves.  I do understand that this should just be a ‘fun’ film, and I should view it as nothing more than a pulp adventure…but it certainly doesn’t stand up when compared to the first three. It felt kind of cheap for Lucas and Spielberg to slot aliens into the Indy franchise, especially considering that they’ve each previously covered the whole ‘alien’ angle to much greater effect. Indy 1-3 – the world is mysterious, and it contains magical forces – is this God?
Indy 4 – the world contains aliens. Aliens are defintely real. Yup. No mystery left. Anything weird is probably aliens. Actually, the truck stunt in *Raiders* was ripped off from a far older movie — can’t remember the name of it, but it was a Western from the 1950s, I think (the hero moved under a fast-moving stagecoach). Which Spielberg made no secret: he was totally upfront about the fact that *Raiders* was lovingly ripped off from *lots* of old movies. Dang, Clayj beat me too it, thoough I was going to say that God won’t just punish you, he’ll melt your face if you touch his stuff.",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2008"," It's been nearly two decades since the last time Indiana Jones donned a fedora, and in that time, several serial adventure franchises—Tomb Raider, The Mummy, and National Treasure among them—have served as de facto sequels, plundering the world's limitless booby-trapped archeological wonders. For Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, that's a mixed blessing: On one hand, there's nothing fresh about another wild goose chase slapped together from impenetrable hieroglyphs, secret passageways, and ancient extraterrestrial forces. On the other, nobody can orchestrate this robust silliness better than Steven Spielberg, who brings effortless visual panache to the proceedings, even when he can't entirely hide its mercenary nature. The biggest problem with Crystal Skull is one that's lately plagued Spielberg in otherwise excellent films like Munich and War Of The Worlds: He fails to stick the landing. And for an entertainment with nothing much on its mind, that hurts.  In his defense, the rollicking opening minutes set the bar awfully high, as one dazzling action setpiece snowballs into another and another and another. Cracking wise about his advanced age, Harrison Ford slips nimbly into the role of a wry archeological scholar and adventurer who gets ensnared in a plot involving the Red Scare, Area 51, the arms race, long-lost family connections, and treasures buried deep in an Amazonian rainforest. The elusive object of desire is the Crystal Skull Of Akator, a mythical find that holds the key to vast riches, as well as extraordinary psychic and extradimensional powers. Joined by a pompadoured Shia LaBeouf, a '50s-style rebel who's handy with a switchblade and a comb, Ford ventures to South America with an evil Ukrainian minx (Cate Blanchett) and her minions in hot pursuit.  Spielberg and producer George Lucas had been dragging their feet for years on a third Indiana Jones sequel, searching for the right script, and the one they've settled on feels like an overstuffed amalgam of rejected drafts. Though that's in keeping with the more-is-more spirit of the series, it also makes the film seem exhausted and labored in the middle section, as it adds on new developments in the form of Raiders Of The Lost Ark's Karen Allen and John Hurt as the half-mad Professor Oxley, but it buckles from the weight. Spielberg does his best to carry the franchise without breaking a sweat, but the fun dissipates markedly as the film goes along, leading to a finale that sinks into noisy supernatural hokum. The movie, like the series overall, goes from a bang to a whimper.",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2008",...exactly what you expect from a summer blockbuster: a thrilling amusement park ride.,POSITIVE
"May 22, 2008"," Even for a preview audience, jazzed on free popcorn and the chance to catch a summer blockbuster days early, the waves of cheering and the palpable sense of sheer jubilation that went up from the crowd once the mountain in its Paramount logo did its dissolve (this time to the lowly dirt-mound home of a prairie dog), was something to behold. It wasn’t quite the roar that one would have expected from those keyed-up to see a new Star Wars flick, but it was certainly a more intense outpouring of anticipation than one sees at such box-office-stoking events. There was something else going on there besides the return of a beloved film icon whom many of us had first seen before even exiting grammar school. Maybe they actually don’t make ’em like they used to. In any event, the audience’s pent-up thrill upon seeing Indiana Jones first appear on screen and put on that hat (in heroic shadow of course) is quickly compounded by a clutch of tightly shot and smartly fun sequences that come rocketing out of the screen one after another. With its 1950s setting allowing Harrison Ford to act his age, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull also wastes no time in digging into the era’s other obsessions: fast cars, aliens, nuclear war, rock and roll, and of course villainous Commies. It’s impressive enough that Spielberg manages to act as though it hadn’t been over a decade since he’d last directed an utter popcorn picture (The Lost World), but just as impressive is the fact that Ford coasts so comfortably through this performance it’s as though he’d barely gotten out of wardrobe from 1989’s Last Crusade. Consider this: when last we saw Indy, Harrison Ford still had Presumed Innocent, Air Force One, a couple Tom Clancy adaptations, and several late-period misfires ahead of him. But here he is, serving up haymakers to the bad guys, quipping with his smart-ass sidekick, and regularly getting the tar smacked out of him, as though not a day had passed. Of course, nothing great lasts forever in film these days, and so the energy began to leak out of the theater. By the time the last third of David Koepp’s strangely laborious screenplay creaked into place, all the frenetic chase scenes and swiftly accumulating guest performers (Jim Broadbent, Ray Winstone, John Hurt, to name a few) couldn’t erase the feeling of tedium; much the same as one experiences when watching, say, Temple of Doom, which  Kingdom of the Crystal Skull easily tops. When the film coasts into its all-too-pat finale, the applause is notedly muted, though still genuine. Some things about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are nearly irrefutable. First, Cate Blanchett does a fantastic Greta Garbo. Second, swarms of deadly ants are possibly scarier than tombs full of venomous asps. But most important is this: the audience opened their hearts and expectations to this film because “they” (Hollywood) in fact doesn’t make them like they used to. Maybe they never did. But with moviegoers facing a grim season of pallid CGI battle-toons like The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and Prince Caspian, even the problematic adventures of one Indiana Jones can feel like a rich banquet in comparison.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2008"," It's been 19 years since we last thrilled to the adventures of Indiana Jones, the globe-trotting, fedora-wearing, whip-wielding archaeologist who loves to solve mysteries about ancient cultures and track down faraway treasures. In this rousing drama directed by Steven Spielberg, the inimitable and cantankerous hero finds himself right in the middle of an attempted Soviet takeover of a Nevada nuclear testing base in 1957. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is searching for an object which she believes will give the Russians the power to read the minds of their enemies and control them completely. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) escapes her clutches and survives a nuclear blast as well. Not bad for a senior citizen whose ferocious energy disputes most signs of aging. Back at the university, Professor Jones is bothered and bewildered by FBI harassment, and he is forced to take a leave of absence. On his way out of town, he is stopped by Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a cocky young kid in a leather jacket on a motorcycle who has news that Professor Oxley (John Hurt), Indy's old colleague, has been kidnapped in Peru while searching for a legendary city of gold once sought by a Spanish conquistador. We soon get the point of all these Da Vinci Code-like mysteries: to bring Indiana Jones and this feisty kid together on a quest to Peru where multiple surprises await them both. Spielberg keeps the action at a fast pace but the real delight here is the lively and entertaining performances by Ford as the old man whose investigative and survival skills are still in top form, Shia LeBeouf as the high school dropout who learns a few tricks from his traveling companion (watch out for the sting of small scorpions), Cate Blanchett as a villain who gets high on parapychological possibilities, Ray Winstone as Indy's sidekick who has a bad case of greed, and Karen Allen as our hero's old romantic interest who has news that will rock his life. It is not the thrills or the chills of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that impresses but its ability to revive our fondness for this hero and his improvised way of handling all the dangers, challenges, and surprises that come his way. Special DVD features include ""The Return of a Legend""; a tribute to Indy, his-creators and the evolution of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; Pre-Production - from animatic sequences to sword fight lessons to reuniting the cast and crew; a production diary: the making of Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull; a go behind the scenes for a 12-part in-depth look at the creation of The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull; Pre-Visualization Sequences - see the work that goes into preparing three pivotal action-packed sequences; and galleries - from the jungle to mummies to crystal skulls and more, take a look at incredible behind-the-scenes photos.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2008","You could smack 'I want to believe' on the poster and it would sum up the theme nicely. Unfortunately, this is just an OK film with a few standout scenes and a terrific ending. It's not an instant classic by any stretch.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2008"," Although there's plenty of havoc (and even some double-crosses that endanger Indy), it all appears to be for the greater good. Ingenuity, teamwork, and trying to do the right thing are ultimately rewarded, although some of Indy's methods are iffy. Indy is brave, resourceful, loyal, and smart, and he's dedicated to preserving historical artifacts and protecting them from those who would misuse them. That said, you probably don't want your kids imitating him, especially given the violence he's forced to use. On the downside, enemies are portrayed one-dimensionally as purely evil, and there's lots of bickering between a few of the characters. Characters shoot at each other; there's lots of punching, kicking, and shoving; swords are pointed at enemies' throats; characters attack each other with guns and swords from moving cars in one extended scene. Minor characters are killed in various ways -- gunfire, falls, crashes, etc. One group goes out in flames when a powerful rocket ignites. A few parts may scare young kids -- especially a sequence in which a sea of killer ants engulfs victims, or an early scene in which Indy is nearly the victim of an atomic bomb test (scary images of mushroom clouds and exploding houses/mannequins). Lots of skulls and mummies and other spooky-for-young-children elements. Parents need to know that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn't live up to the best of the series, but Indy-loving kids will definitely want to see it. It bears the marks of classic Indy fare -- meaning lots of adventures, some of which (like a scene involving killer ants, or another involving an atomic bomb test) might be too spooky for younger kids. There's a supernatural and extra-terrestrial undercurrent and lots of punch-heavy good-guy-versus-bad-guy fights, which do have some blood (as well as plenty of weapons, including swords and guns). There's also a bit of light swearing (""s--t,"" ""son of a bitch,"" etc.) and innuendo, and enemies routinely hurl unpleasant threats at each other. But it's all handed with roguish, acerbic Indy wit, which makes it -- for the most part -- all in good, popcorn movie fun. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Indiana Jones is back with a vengeance in KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, the long-awaited fourth installment in George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's mega-hit franchise. It's 1957, and the Russians -- led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) -- have double-crossed their way into a military base in Nevada. Irina thinks the Soviets can win the Cold War by dominating the world with their minds -- but how? Find a mysterious, powerful crystal skull hidden in the South American jungle with the reluctant help of Professor Henry Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford), of course. Indy's friend Oxley (John Hurt) apparently found it once, but he's in enemy hands. Indy sets out on a rescue mission, aided and abetted by friends old and new, including motorcycle-loving, leather-jacketed punk Mutt (Shia LaBeouf). Decades have come and gone since our dear Dr. Jones' not-so-last crusade, and it's good to report that his return will entertain series fans. Sure, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's good vs. evil race to the finish is marked by twists and turns that require not just a suspension, but a complete removal, of disbelief. But that's only to be expected -- after all, the Indiana Jones mythology wasn't built on reality. It's the ride, not the details, that audiences are paying for. And what a ride: The suspense, the wisecracks, the gloomy caves to explore -- they're all there. When Indy first enters the frame, it's like seeing a dear old friend. The filmmakers didn't reinvent the wheel (so don't expect any innovations), but they didn't ruin it, either. And the newbies? When it comes to an iconic film series like this, passing the torch can be tricky. But diehard fans can relax: LaBeouf proves himself worthy enough to carry on the Indy tradition. He's prickly and adventurous, edgy and intelligent -- much like Indy himself. Though he's no Harrison Ford, LaBeouf could believably have been cut from the same cloth. As for the women, while Karen Allen's return to the series as feisty Marion is a delight, Blanchett's Russian accent is somewhat marred by plummy, Australian inflections when she says Indy's last name, which is often. And that's not the only jarring tone: While the first two-thirds of the film is classic Indy, the last act takes a hard swing that swerves into otherworldly territory. It's like Indiana Jones meets E.T. -- which is pretty iffy. The transgression's forgivable, but only just. Families can talk about what Indiana Jones stands for and how that becomes important in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . If he's a good guy, why does he break the rules? Is that OK? What separates him from the ""bad"" guys? Are real-life bad guys as thoroughly evil as the ones in movies? Why is Indy so popular? Why is it so hard for other movies to duplicate the Indy formula? Do you think the franchise needed another movie? Why or why not?

"May 21, 2008"," It’s been 19 years since we last saw Indiana Jones, the famed ark-finding, sacred-stone-returning, Hitler’s-autograph-collecting archeologist played by Harrison Ford in three 1980s films. A commensurate amount of time has passed in the new adventure, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” but Indy hasn’t lost his touch. Nor, it would seem, has Steven Spielberg, who directs “Crystal Skull” with the same boyish enthusiasm and love of a good story that he brought to the previous trilogy.  “Crystal Skull” follows the same beloved pattern as “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “The Last Crusade” (and, to a lesser extent, “Temple of Doom”). There are several spectacular action sequences, including a three-car chase through a jungle. Indy swings from ropes, gets punched a lot, and remains insouciant in the face of peril. The story revolves around an old mentor going missing while searching for an artifact, and it ends with bad guys being destroyed by their own greed and their insistence on meddling with powers they do not understand. There are snakes. There are also millions of something else creepy. This is every inch an Indiana Jones Movie.  The temptation would have been to cobble together a story full of weak imitations of the previous films and call it a day, but almost every familiar element here feels like it belongs, not like it was forced in out of obligation. Were it not for the 19-year gap and the noticeably grayer and craggier Dr. Jones, you’d assume “Crystal Skull” was made a few years after the last one, right on schedule, the next logical chapter in the saga.  But time has passed, of course. It’s 1957 now, and Cold War paranoia is at its peak. Indy’s enemies now are the Communists, for whom he holds nearly as much contempt as he did the Nazis. And the Soviets, for their part, are as interested in obtaining priceless artifacts for their own evil purposes as the Third Reich was.  The items in question this time are a collection of crystal skulls with unusual magnetic properties, believed to hold the key to yada-yada if you something-something. (I don’t want to spoil anything, and it doesn’t matter anyway.) The Russians want them, and whatever they plan to do with them, it can’t be good for America or Decency or Justice. The Soviets’ efforts are led by top Commie scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a severe-looking villainess whose dominatrix demeanor and over-the-top Russian accent practically guarantee her status as a new kitsch icon.  Indy gets involved thanks to Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle-riding greaser punk whose father figure and actual mother have been kidnapped by the Commies and are being forced to help find the skulls. This surrogate father is Professor Oxley (John Hurt), a former mentor of Indy’s; Mutt’s mother is named Marion, and Mutt says she used to know Indy. Indy says he knew a lot of Marions. I suspect he’s not thinking very hard. His surprise upon discovering that it’s Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), from “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” is his alone. The rest of us figured it out the minute Mutt said “Marion” (or, for that matter, the minute we saw Karen Allen’s name in the opening credits). And so it’s off to the Amazonian jungles for Indy and Mutt. The interaction between Ford and LaBeouf is breezy and comical and nicely played; Ford doesn’t seem outpaced by the kid 42 years his junior, and LaBeouf doesn’t freeze in the presence of a legendary actor the way some newbies would. Over the course of the film, Indy’s relationship with Mutt goes from wary adult supervisor to older brother to friendly uncle to father figure — and that’s a lot more progression than we’ve ever seen with any of Indy’s other relationships.  Later, when Marion Ravenwood appears, the interpersonal dynamics become even more fiery. I admire the way the screenplay — credited to David Koepp (“Jurassic Park,” “Spider-Man”), with elements from prior drafts by Jeff Nathanson and input from George Lucas — mixes the relationship bickering with the mechanics of the plot, so that the action never needs to stop just so people can talk about their feelings. In the world of Indiana Jones, ex-lovers can argue over who wronged whom 20 years ago even as both are sinking in quicksand.  Indy seems to have been born around the turn of the last century (he was about 14 in the 1912-set prologue in “Last Crusade”), which means he’s pushing 60 in “Crystal Skull.” The film wisely addresses his advancing age, deploys some humor to the situation — and then gleefully quits worrying about it. Indiana’s bones may be getting a little creakier, and he is slowly turning into his father (even using the elder Jones’ favorite exclamation — “Intolerable!” — to describe a predicament that Mutt has gotten them into), but he’s still the same Indy. He can perform impossible feats of derring-do one minute, then wince over his injuries the next. He’s always been that way, even when he was young. It’s part of what makes us like him so much: His adventures are the stuff of fantasy, his smart-aleck one-liners are clever, but his human fallibility makes him seem like a Regular Guy. And as a wise man once said, it’s not the years, honey, it’s the mileage.  More important, though, are the film’s intangibles. The look, the feel, the attitude, the mix of humor and adventure, it all lines up with the “Indiana Jones” aesthetic. George Lucas’ philosophy has been to move forward with technology — hence, his “Star Wars” prequels were mostly CGI and looked vastly different from the first trilogy. Steven Spielberg has embraced technology too (his “Jurassic Park” dinosaurs represented a giant leap forward), but he doesn’t do it just for the sake of doing it. He remembers that these films were conceived as a tribute to the cliffhanger serials of the 1940s, and that a slick, digitized film would be stylistically inappropriate. So CGI is kept to a minimum (less than you’d expect for a movie made in 2008, anyway) in favor of good old-fashioned rear-projection, stuntmen, and enormously constructed sets, just as in the other three films.  Going in, I was prepared to defend the finale’s supernatural elements by pointing out that the finales of this series have always ultimately relied on the paranormal (God melting the Nazis’ faces; rocks that light up when you collect them; the Holy Grail’s healing powers). And then I saw this film’s finale and thought: Yeah, that’s too much.  Another minor complaint: Things get a little crowded at times, what with Indy, Mutt, Marion, Oxley, and Indy’s old pal Mac (Ray Winstone) all dashing through the Peruvian jungles together. It feels more natural for Indy to have one or two companions on these excursions, not four, and the film can’t always find something useful for all of them to do.  Oh, but everything else makes me forgive the film’s slight defects. Those who say Spielberg is sleep-walking through this one are taking for granted how good a director he is. Even a halfhearted Spielberg effort will have more complicated shots, more mirthful sight gags, and more elaborate stunts than the best effort from nearly any other director currently working. And I don’t think this is a halfhearted effort anyway. To me, it feels as lively and buoyant, as effortlessly entertaining, as you could realistically want in an Indiana Jones flick.  Movie geeks who worship the original Indy films and are demanding that this one be a life-changing, soul-magnifying movie to surpass all other cinematic experiences will, of course, be disappointed, as they generally are in these situations. The rest of us can just sit back and enjoy. ",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2008"," When you have a franchise, 
		its real easy. You just keep making the same film over and over and 
		over again and people flock to see it. If the first was good, moviegoers 
		apparently dont pay much attention to the others, so long as they 
		resemble the first. Director Steven Spielberg has already made this 
		movie three times. His first, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) had 
		Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) try to find the fabled Ark of the Covenant 
		before the Nazis. Since the Ark of the Covenant is like the Holy Grail, 
		something that has been reputed to exist for millennia, and since the 
		Nazis really did exist, the story had some sort of basis in fact and 
		people could willingly believe what was going on. Spielberg's follow-ups were 
		smash hits, but on shakier ground as far as the stories were concerned. 
		This one is ludicrous, so I wont even try to synopsize the plot. The 
		scenery is beautiful, the special effects look wonderfully expensive, 
		and the quips are vintage Harrison Ford. But the plot is so ridiculous 
		that as it progressed my interest waned, up to the silly ending. Even 
		so, the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to tell a fatuous story 
		like this will probably result in close to $1 billion in gross revenue. In addition to the silly 
		story, there are far too many frantic, impossible chases, seemingly one 
		upon the other. Of course there are Stevens obligatory scenes of lots 
		of disgusting marauding creatures (this time, ants). Because the story 
		is so unchallengly low-intellect, this is just two hours of chases and 
		quips, updated from the first three. Oh, Indianas back. And so 
		is Karen Allen, who appeared in Raiders, as Indianas lost love 
		interest. Then there are Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), apparently a 
		budding young Indiana, a ditsy professor, Oxley (John Hurt, who gives 
		his usual exceptional performance), KGB Agent Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett,

"May 21, 2008","  The idea of being drawn to a movie and not knowing why is practically lost in the contemporary moviegoing experience, at least when it comes to mainstream Hollywood pictures. We're so conditioned to feel excitement over the new Spider-Man movie, the new Batman movie, the new Judd Apatow-produced movie, that the idea of walking up to an interesting-looking poster in a subway station and thinking, ""Now this might be something,"" is almost unthinkable.   It's completely unthinkable in the case of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" the fourth installment in Steven Spielberg's rabidly beloved adventure series, which has been building its own Temple of Hype for several years now. But the strange thing about Spielberg's latest is that, for me at least, it miraculously pulled off the effect of feeling like a surprise: The picture both fulfilled some vague, unexpressed hopes I didn't know I had and also left me with the sense that I'd just seen something I wasn't quite prepared for -- the kind of contradiction that great showmanship can bridge. In a movie climate that seeks to promise bigger, bolder thrills, ""Crystal Skull"" daringly offers less, in the sense that it gives us action sequences that rely on visual logic rather than lots of fast cutting; its computer-generated effects are used with relative judiciousness; and it features human faces that actually look human -- in other words, they belong to people who have aged, visibly, with the rest of us. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" made by a man who's amassed a great deal of money exploring the dreams and fears of childhood, and featuring a one-time action hero who's now in his 60s, is an adventure about the inevitability of adulthood -- but if you put that on a poster, almost nobody would come.   The ""Indiana Jones"" pictures, based on characters and stories created by George Lucas, were inspired by '30s movie serials that were old-fashioned even by the time of Spielberg's '50s boyhood, and the party line on the series is that it stems from Spielberg's unflagging obsession with lost childhood -- anyone's lost childhood. But even if ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,"" like its predecessors -- the most recent of which was ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" released 19 years ago -- harks back to a past that Spielberg didn't live firsthand, the nostalgia it's selling isn't the smug, self-satisfied sort, but a more melancholy variety: Now that we live in the future, there's nothing to look forward to -- even rocket ships have become passé. Why not resurrect a hero who spends his time delving into the earth for ancient -- and, in this case, otherworldly -- artifacts? For Spielberg, the only way to get back to the future is by digging into the past.   ""Crystal Skull"" is set in 1957, 19 years after the close of the last installment in the series, and Indiana Jones -- just like Harrison Ford, the actor who plays him -- is 60-ish and vaguely creaky. Indy's old enemies the Nazis, so reliably evil they'd become as comfortable as house slippers, have been effectively vanquished. But there are new enemies waiting to take their place, specifically a team of Soviet operatives led by a ball-buster in a Buster Brown haircut: Her name is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, in a marvelously purring, stylized performance) and she's keenly interested in a crateful of contents that the U.S. government has been keeping under top-secret wraps in a Nevada warehouse. Whatever's in this crate -- I won't tell you what it is -- is linked to the other, more important thing Irina and her countrymen are seeking, which happens to be the special crystal skull of the movie's title. Never mind that the thing, when we finally see it, looks like a coffee-table gewgaw stuffed with aluminum foil; it holds the secrets of the universe -- what Cold War hussy worth her weight in rubles could resist that?   Irina and her henchman collar Indy and his sidekick, Mac (Ray Winstone, in a sadly underdeveloped role), to help them find the mysterious wooden box they're after, which is just one of many similar containers stacked floor to ceiling in that Nevada warehouse. They finally get what they want, leaving behind a mess of debris and smashed crates -- one of which, in the movie's slyest visual joke, contains the Ark of the Covenant, the precious MacGuffin of the first movie, a gleaming gold treasure that's been cast aside as if it were yesterday's news, because, after all, it is.   Just as Indy is about to leave town, he's accosted by a greaser kid who glides into the picture on a motorcycle, à la Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" -- which makes no sense unless you accept that the cell walls of ""Crystal Skull"" are permeable, allowing the shadows of characters to wander from one movie to the next. The kid's name is Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), and he needs Indy's help in locating a man he considers a father figure (who turns out to be John Hurt in a rough cloth serape, but let's not get ahead of ourselves). That fellow also happens to be one of Indy's former colleagues, and so Indy agrees to help Mutt in his quest. The rest of ""Crystal Skull"" involves a trek to Peru in search of -- what else? -- a long-lost kingdom, as well as Indy's reunion with his old flame Marion (Karen Allen), from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" And Irina continues to slink through the picture like a leopard goddess.  Some have already proclaimed ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" a tired sequel; what's more remarkable to me is how unjaded it is. It's the most tender, warm-spirited and entertaining picture Spielberg has made in years, and I say that as someone who's regularly rejected the whatever-it-is that Spielberg is often trying to sell: There are Spielberg pictures that I love (""E.T.,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Schindler's List"") and others I despise, like his delusional work of sci-fi craftsmanship ""War of the Worlds,"" which I consider one of the ugliest, most mean-spirited pictures of the decade. Spielberg is an extraordinary craftsman, but he's not a great thinker, and when he tries to stuff big ideas into his movies -- as in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" or ""Munich"" -- his point of view is never quite clear, maybe because he doesn't really know what he thinks. His ideas tend to be blurted out in signposts along the lines of ""War is hell"" and ""Revenge gets you nowhere."" He knows, cannily, how to make movies work as you're watching them; but I've found that many of Spielberg's movies disintegrate in my mind not long afterward. They may be built to last, and still, they break down.   But at his best, Spielberg is certainly capable of tapping, to almost unnerving degree, collective moods and fears and longings, both emotional and cultural. I don't think of Spielberg as any sort of savior of contemporary cinema: He is, after all, an executive producer of the ""Transformer"" movies. But ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" -- its smart script is by David Koepp, and it was shot in muted, suedelike tones by Janusz Kaminski -- is so beautifully made, and so full of inventive, delightful touches, that it feels like a manifesto, as if Spielberg were taking a stand against the crap we're so often forced to sit through. At one point, Mutt and Irina engage in a sword fight atop parallel moving trucks -- this isn't a new idea, but Spielberg makes it look fresh and vital.   LaBeouf is appealing enough in ""Crystal Skull""; he sensibly keeps his performance as low-key as possible, which you need to do when you're acting with Harrison Ford. Ford has never been a particularly expressive actor, though he has often managed to give sturdy and nicely understated performances in spite of it. Now, more than ever, he has the face of a tiki god -- yet he seems more expressive rather than less, particularly in his first scene with Allen. When he sees her, his face shows what can only be described as pure delight, and it's little wonder: Allen, an actress of a certain age who isn't afraid to look like a real person, is radiant here. Her performance is like joy let out of a box.   ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" also contains one of the most grimly funny sequences I've seen in years. Indy has just escaped from the Russians, and he heads, with obvious relief, toward a small town, the kind of place where freshly washed sheets and towels, stretched out on clotheslines, flap in the breeze like friendly flags. He dashes into one house, looking for help, and finds a family parked in front of the TV set. (The show is ""Howdy Doody,"" with its sinister-cheerful theme music.) Only this isn't a real family -- its people are made out of plaster, like department-store dummies. Indy realizes he's stumbled into a fake town that's been set up by the government for a nuclear test, and he scrambles into the family refrigerator (comfortingly, the legend on its door reads ""lead lined""), hunkering down for the inevitable blast.   That refrigerator keeps Indy safe from radiation. But is he safe from his own country? Spielberg floats the question without ever attempting to answer it. He doesn't have to. The sequence suggests that even Spielberg knows the limits of nostalgia: Here, he literally explodes our collective fantasies about American family life in the '50s. Indiana Jones is a hero precisely because he's so skeptical of the perceived comforts of that life: He'd much rather travel the world, maybe alone or perhaps with a partner or two, digging up secrets. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a mainstream family blockbuster about the allure of the solitary, unconfined life. That's not a contradiction in terms. That's showmanship.

"May 21, 2008"," It seems like we’ve all been uttering the question “is this really necessary?” a lot lately with film, especially in terms of sequels. I freely admit this was my first response to the news that Director Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford would be collaborating for another Indiana Jones adventure – some nineteen years after the series’ last entry. Harrison Ford is pushing seventy, the story is completely shrouded in secrecy, and what else could there possibly be left to do with this franchise? Fortunately for us traditional adventure fans, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull delivers everything you could ask for in an Indy film. That same smile you had as a wide-eyed ten-year-old will be duplicated as you watch this joyous cinematic exercise that cynics may believe is outdated and stale. Fear not, electric filmmaking is electric filmmaking. Crystal Skull takes place after the proceedings of Last Crusade. This time around Indy finds himself right in the middle of a plot by the Russians, lead by Irina Spalko (Blanchett) to acquire a series of Crystal Skulls, whose powers are believed to equal that of world domination once arranged properly in an ancient temple. We have the KGB, aliens, and a host of world travel as Indy works to stop their grand plan. Along for the ride are Mutt Williams (LaBeouf), a “greaser” whose sense of adventure far outweighs his yearning for an education, Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Indy’s prospective true love, and Professor Oxley (Hurt), a colleague of Indy’s who has become entranced with the Crystal Skulls. Drenched in earth tones and a beautiful glow, Steven Spielberg has resurrected a cinematic world that we thought was lost. The story, by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson and scripted by David Koepp, is at times erratic, but Spielberg keeps the proceedings moving at a breathless pace. All of the action elements are in place: death-defying stunts, a sense of wonderment, and an elbow to the ribcage, reassuring us that the film knows how ridiculous it is. These are the touches that have made this series so successful, and they nicely take over for what is an overuse of CGI. Harrison Ford, now sixty-six years old, never misses a step. He’s in immaculate physical condition and he has transformed Indy perfectly to his own aging. Indy is wiser and smarter than ever. His comedic timing, while a bit forced at times, hits often. Cate Blanchett makes for a formidable villain who easily belongs in the ranks of previous Indy adversaries. Shia LaBeouf makes for an excellent foil, particularly in the scenes where he plays to any normal person’s fears – but Indy has seen it all. Karen Allen and John Hurt are both excellent as well, with a debate between Indy and Marion regarding their failed marriage being the dialogue highlight of the film. The hype machine was in overdrive for this project, and the film certainly had numerous reasons not to work. It’s not the best in the series by any means, but it delivers everything we, as Indy fans, could possibly want. The story is engaging in its playing up to conspiracy and lost worlds, and the action scenes are spectacular. The liberal use of CGI is a bit disheartening, but by no means a deal breaker. But most importantly, the film is a blast – and that’s why we go to the movies in the first place.",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2008"," The last time Indiana Jones was in action, he was riding off into the sunset, with a final quest behind him. It took 19 years to coax him back to the screen, but the archeology O.G. is back, and “Kingdom of Crystal Skull” doesn’t disappoint in the least. This is the high-flyin’, fingernail-chewing, stand-up-and-cheer summer experience as anticipated, yet it’s not exactly the same Dr. Jones as you might remember. The year is 1957, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has settled into a life alone, mourning the loss of his father, Henry Sr., and colleague Marcus Brody. Rustling him out of his routine are vicious Russian soldiers, led by psychic Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, a sublime heavy), who want Indy to uncover the location of a mysterious crystal skull, using clues left behind by his old friend, Oxley (John Hurt). Helping Indy out is Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a tough young greaser who needs Indy to save his mother, Marion (Karen Allen). Traveling to South America to find the lost Temple of Akator, Indy fights to slip out of Spalko’s tight grip while trying to uncover the skull’s purpose before the Russians can claim their ultimate, world-dominating prize. The familiar fingerprints of Indiana Jones are smudged all over “Kingdom:” director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas even dust off the old Paramount Pictures logo to help match the mood that was left hanging in 1989. It’s a commendable effort, keeping the audience comfy with what they’re seeing in 2008, but it’s a little misleading. “Kingdom” is an old-fashioned, no-frills Indy adventure, but it also shakes up the franchise wherever it can. No matter what the Beards tell the press, “Kingdom” is Indy 2.0, but in a very rewarding way. It steps forward, not back, approaching the character’s epic life from a fresh perspective. It’s a new world for Indiana Jones, who comes to “Kingdom” after his war-hero days in WWII, still feeling the sting of loved ones who have passed on. He’s older, wiser, and fully entrenched in his stuffy professorial ways; committed to education now more than ever, but still able and willing to throw a punch when needed. Of course, Ford plays the aging symphony like a maestro, never pushing too hard on the bitter old man routine, instead nicely sinking into Indy’s ripened ways. Sure, the screenplay by David Koepp likes to poke fun at Indy’s years with some clever gags, but Spielberg seems more enchanted with the character’s maturation into a team player, not using the age for a cheap punchline. In reality, the post-war mood is a delightful way to refresh Indy iconography, taking the audience into a darker world where targeting absolute evil is a more complicated process and American might is being swallowed by communist paranoia. The original films (1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” 1984’s “Temple of Doom,” and 1989’s “The Last Crusade”) all played into the gleeful 1930’s Saturday-matinee-serial mentality, marked by pristine colors (courtesy of ace cinematographer Douglas Slocombe), heavy detail, and sparkling outdoorsy escapades. The Cold War environment of “Kingdom” is more claustrophobic and agitated; Spielberg and his shooter Janusz Kaminski replicate the massively layered compositions of the earlier installments, but ease in a new color palette and enclosed sensation through the substantial usage of sets. That’s not to say the film is dreary; it’s anything but that, yet subtle changes are felt throughout the picture, emphasizing the polished technology Spielberg is working with now, not to mention his own growth behind the camera, after years of trying to strip away his “Mr. Blockbuster” reputation. “Kingdom” snuggles into the Indy goods easily, but it’s best to acknowledge that “Kingdom” is somewhat aesthetically different than the previous adventures, and that’s an outstanding achievement. While Spielberg is wrestling with vast sound stage spaces and easing into a CGI-led cinematic world, “Kingdom” doesn’t hesitate to reawaken the breakneck velocity the franchise is known for. The film opens with a literal bang, as Indy battles Spalko around the infinite warehouse location glimpsed at the end of “Raiders,” swinging around the joint with his trusty bullwhip and barely dodging Russian bullets. Right from the starter pistol, Ford reclaims the character’s bruiser physicality and Spielberg dusts off his old crack timing, bestowing audiences with a skillful opening reel that feels just like a visit from an old friend; at the same time, Spielberg updates the proceedings with a handsome 1950’s mood, using the sounds of Elvis and haunting atomic bomb testing ground locations to get viewers up to speed with the new era. It’s chase scenes galore from there, including a crackerjack motorcycle ride through Indy’s college campus with Mutt (hunted by Russian agents) and the film’s centerpiece: a gymnastic jungle chase sequence that mirrors the classic marathon desert brawl of “Raiders.” Here, the CG glaze is most readily apparent, but it never bothered me. With Spielberg staging the action in sweeping, dazzling widescreen movements (seemingly allergic to heavy editing), I’ll take the Lucas-mandated artificiality with a degree of patience. They don’t make movies quite like they used to in the ‘80s, but “Kingdom” shimmies awfully close to the mall-multiplex ecstasy of observing characters leaping around the frame with abandon, pummeling each other while the John Williams score blasts away triumphantly. When “Kingdom” rears back and delivers the goods, the result will reduce the average Indy fan to pudding.  Surprisingly, the titular MacGuffin is far more critical to the story than previous installments have dictated. There’s no fortune and glory lust about the crystal skull for Indy, and he takes possession of the spooky magnetized item early on in the film, leaving the rest of the action in protection mode rather than retrieval. To keep within the ‘50’s vibe, there are sci-fi overtones to the story, using the 1947 events in Roswell and the skull’s football-like shape to introduce otherworldly mystery to “Kingdom” in place of religious or supernatural focal points. The whole film is a good-natured homage to this era of filmmaking, with giant ant rampages, Soviet domination, and Mutt in full Brando, “Wild One” mode as a switchblade-carrying, leather-jacket-wearing, Harley-riding delinquent. Keeping that mindset of ‘50’s sci-fi will help to digest the conclusion of “Kingdom,” where Lucas’s fingers can be felt again in the film’s second generous helping of CG embellishment. Even if today’s filmmaking technology creeps up in “Kingdom,” the heart belongs to Ford. It’s a blissful performance that mixes Indy’s punch-drunk bewilderment with haggard acknowledgement of limitation, showing age not through fatigue but through a welcomed sense of family and educational responsibility. Ford plays the brief tributes to Sean Connery and Denholm Elliot with marvelous grace and dives into all the bloodied beatings, but the real energy of “Kingdom” comes from his encounters with LaBeouf and Allen, which crackle with traditional Indy magic and bring the absolute best out of the actor. Spielberg deserves a medal the way he suppresses LaBeouf’s annoying performance habits, turning the young star into a credible greaser and an unexpectedly vulnerable sidekick. LaBeouf is a revelation here and doesn’t stick out in the Indiana Jones world as much as expected. He supports Ford wonderfully, but once Allen shows up at the midway point, some old “Raiders” chemistry is rekindled to steal the movie away. Marion and Indy don’t receive the luxurious screen time they deserve in “Kingdom,” but the actors make the most of it, creating needed romantic sparks at the center of all the mayhem, lovingly comedic with their reunion and the unexpected revelations that come with it. It’s just a delight to see Ford and Allen back in character. “Kingdom” satisfies in a massive way, handing the faithful towering servings of action and archeological surprise, while inching the series into new artistic and visual directions that could conceivably open the door to further, and wholeheartedly welcome, adventures. There’s still plenty of fire in Indy’s belly to explore. It took nearly two decades to get the character back on the screen, but it was worth the wait: “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is an exquisitely crafted, lightning-paced thrill ride; a barnstorming blockbuster effort from Steven Spielberg, and a return to iconic action hero fortunes for Harrison Ford.

"May 21, 2008"," CANNES, France  “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a movie for boomers of all ages, though you can bet the bank that plenty of tots will be tagging along with Mom and Dad, Granny and Gramps. Like the 1981 blockbuster “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the first in a monster franchise that has spawned two previous movie sequels, a television series, comics, novels, video games and Disney theme-park attractions, this new one was directed by Steven Spielberg, cooked up and executive produced by George Lucas (with Kathleen Kennedy) and stars Harrison Ford as the archaeologist-adventurer-sexpot with the sardonic grin, rakish fedora and suggestive bullwhip.  This latest Indy escapade, which was shown out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival and will probably scoop up more money than the rest of the selections combined, serves as a reunion for the principal creative team. Almost two decades have lapsed since the third installment in the series, “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989). In the years since, Mr. Lucas  whose logo for Lucasfilm received the loudest applause at the press screening in Cannes  continued to build his special-effects empire and resurrected the “Star Wars” franchise while Mr. Spielberg has oscillated between serious-minded projects and financially instrumental entertainments. For his part, Mr. Ford rode the ups and downs of high-concept stardom, oscillating between roles that called for him to flash his customary wry grin or his equally familiar grumpy frown. He wears both in “The Crystal Skull,” though the busy story makes enormous effort to keep the mood happy and snappy and decidedly PG-13 friendly  P.C. friendly, too, as in politically correct, with fewer dark-skinned people popping their eyeballs. Not that Indy has gone soft or the natives have gone hard, mind you, only that Mr. Spielberg no longer seems as eager to cut down extras for a laugh.  Dressed in gray coveralls, her hair bobbed and Slavic accent slipping and sliding as far south as Australia, Ms. Blanchett takes to her role with brio, snapping her black gloves and all but clicking her black boots like one of those cartoon Nazis that traipse through earlier Indy films. She’s pretty much a hoot, the life of an otherwise drearily familiar party. Among the other invited guests are Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Shia LaBeouf, who plays Mutt, the young sidekick onboard to bring in those viewers whose parents were still in grade school when the first movie hit. Karen Allen, who played Indy’s love interest in “Raiders,” is here too, with a megawatt smile and a bit of the old spunk.  If only the filmmakers seemed as eager to see  and to please  the audience as Ms. Allen. There’s plenty of frantic energy here, lots of noise and money too, but what’s absent is any sense of rediscovery, the kind that’s necessary whenever a filmmaker dusts off an old formula or a genre standard. “Raiders of the Lost Ark” creaks with age now, but to look at it again is to see Mr. Spielberg actively engaging in an organic whole, taking a beloved template and repurposing it for the modern blockbuster age he helped create. By contrast, “The Crystal Skull” comes alive only in isolated segments, in a clever motorcycle chase that ends in a library and, best of all, in an eerie sequence at an atomic test site that wittily puts the nuclear in family.   The original Indiana Jones venture was inspired by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg’s love for 1930s serials, but you’d be hard pressed to find much inspiration in their latest collaboration. There’s plenty of perspiration, of course, what with the wall-to-wall chases  many tricked out with obvious computer-generated effects  that careen one into another like colliding big rigs. As expected, the high leaps and long jumps look impressive, even if it’s something of a bummer when one of the best directors working today (Mr. Spielberg) doesn’t seem to be working as hard as the stunt crew. Initially, I thought he was bored with the material (he wouldn’t be alone), but now I think he’s just grown out of this kind of sticky kids’ stuff. Creative ennui certainly might explain why he spends so much time riffing both on his own greatest hits  Indy and company have an encounter of a close, insipid kind  and on other movies. Some of these allusions amuse (a sea of red ants parting à la “The Ten Commandments”) while others are just painful (Mr. LaBeouf done up to resemble Marlon Brando in “The Wild One”). It’s odd to see Mr. Spielberg recycling plot points already chewed through by Roland Emmerich in “Stargate,” though Indy’s brief encounter with some ferociously feathered Indians who look right out of Mel Gibson’s “Apocalypto” was a tantalizingly sweet pip, a sequel in waiting (“Indiana Jones Meets Mad Max”) or maybe just a YouTube mash-up.

"May 21, 2008"," Roger Ebert’s thumb  loved it, but a New York Times critic said, “I was bored out of my mind.” Holy schizo! Now that the fourth chapter in the Indiana Jones series has opened and we can see beyond the box-office gold rush, the truth emerges between the extremes, you know, the place where disappointment eats at your expectations. Sure, I wanted Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be as classically adventurous as Raiders of the Lost Ark, which kicked off the Indy saga in 1981. It isn’t. Crystal Skull is hit-and-miss like the clunky 1984 sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. And instead of the elegiac tone that lifted 1989’s presumptive valedictory, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas have gotten sillier. The good news is that Harrison Ford can still rock a fedora and a bullwhip like nobody’s business as the globe-trotting archaeologist. The dark side is that after 19 years of wrangling between Spielberg and Lucas — in a mind-meld with writer David Koepp to craft just the right script for Indy 4 — they came up with this mess. Everything looks raided from the lost ark of the three previous Indy hits. What’s worse is that after a smashing opener involving Indy getting captured by Russians in Nevada, circa 1957, the film starts piling on atomic subplots. It’s a cliché overload. By midpoint, the movie starts to play like National Treasure meets The X-Files, with a touch of The Goonies, and I don’t mean any of these comparisons as a compliment. Ford, 65 and in fine, feisty fettle, has a ball mixing it up with Shia LaBeouf, who is terrific as Mutt, the biker kid who joins Indy on a mission to find the Crystal dildo, or whatever the hell it is. “What are you, like, 80?” asks Mutt, an insult he has to eat after a motorcycle chase that shows Gramps still has what it takes. I kept waiting for Indy to spark with Cate Blanchett as Russian military scientist Irina Spalko, but the great Cate is stuck in a one-note-villain role with an accent that conjures up Rocky and Bullwinkle more than the desired red menace. Indy’s hots are reserved for an old flame. It’s a kick seeing Karen Allen return as Marion Ravenwood, Mutt’s mom and Indy’s love in Raiders. Some have hinted that Mutt might be Indy’s son. Ya think? Total props go to the superior stunt work: Watch that three-tier waterfall! Catch that duel between Mutt and Irina on two speeding jeeps! And, oh, that army of man-eating ants! But I’d trade all the paranormal mumbo-jumbo and cutesy computer-generated prairie dogs for scenes that connected the characters on a human level. There was a chance here to show Indy getting smacked by time and the perils of intimacy and commitment. But those stunts leave real bruises. Audiences looking for emotional resonance in Indy 4 are doomed to the temple of disappointment. Spielberg and Lucas aren’t upping their creative game — they’re taking care of business.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2008"," 1) The Color Purple (In Theaters). This isn’t necessarily a remake of the 1985 Spielberg film, but rather a recreation of the Broadway musical which more closely followed the book by Alice Walker. Produced by Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones, the film delivers some of the best talent stage and screen has to offer with Fantasia (from the original 2005 Broadway run) as Celie, the beaten-down and broken young black woman whose children are stolen from her by her father only to be sold off to an abusive husband (Coleman Domingo) who only wants her cooking, cleaning and taking his crap. But when her stepson’s wife (Danielle Brooks) and her husband’s not-so-secret mistress (Taraji P. Henson) come into her life, she begins to transform into a more beautiful and powerful version of herself. The film is directed by relative newcomer Blitz Bazawule, a filmmaker from Ghana who won the job when he made the bold decision to suggest that the film should represent Celie’s imagination, her only escape from her dreaded world. This change in the film’s narrative makes the movie come to vibrant life, giving the popular story a new dimension and soul. The story’s larger theme of searching for God in the presence of the evil in the world leads to a transformation of both the characters and the film, and by the end the audience is treated to a true religious experience. 2) Oppenheimer (Available on paid streaming). One of the most fun Hollywood moments this year came from the marketing of one of the biggest box office events in recent memory: Barbenheimer, where Barbie and Oppenheimer both opened on the same weekend, leaving most audiences no choice but to see both amazing films. While Barbie led the box office while still getting amazing reviews, Oppenheimer became the critical darling, giving filmmaker Christopher Nolan the edge when it comes to Oscar Odds. With a stellar cast and a fantastically written story and directing style, the movie gave us an aggressive narrative around the man responsible for the nuclear bomb. 3) The Creator (Streaming on Hulu). This is where I differ from many of my colleagues. Panned by many critics and thus ignored by audiences, this magnificent sci-fi film by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) tells the story set in the near future where AI has been held responsible for mass destruction, and thus selected for extermination by the U.S. military. When a former special forces agent (John David Washington) is hired to kill a new AI weapon largely thought to take down the U.S. government, he turns from assassin to protector when he discovers that the weapon is an AI child with the power to end the war. Big and bold, the film is as exciting as it is thought-provoking. I hope that now that it has reached streaming, it will get the audience it deserves. 4) Saltburn (Streaming on Amazon Prime). Filmmaker Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman) brings us this twisted and intriguing tale of a young Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who is invited to spend the summer at his family’s sprawling estate by his friend and secret crush (Jacob Elordi). Having grown up poor, he is thrust into a world of excess and eccentricity like he’s never seen, giving him an intoxicating power over his new Uber-wealthy so-called friends. Starting out, you don’t really know what to think of the story, as it feels somewhat familiar, and possibly like a modern Jane Austen tale. But that familiarity quickly dissipates as you follow the hero’s journey into the depths of the wealthy depravity. And just when you think tragedy will lead to a depressing narrative, you are suddenly proven very wrong. Sure to be a divisive hit, I can’t wait to have deeper discussions around this one. 5) Killers of the Flower Moon (Available on paid streaming). Soon to be streaming on Apple TV+). Having grown up in Oklahoma, I was still completely unaware of some of the well-covered up atrocities relatively recently committed there in the early 1900’s. First, HBO’s Watchmen exposed us to the Tulsa Race Massacre where what was known as Black Wall Street in Tulsa was decimated in a raid by white supremacists and the government. Here, Martin Scorsese tells us the story of another horrible event in our past, taking place at almost the same time, where white men went into the Osage nation to systematically kill off the native population in order to lay claim to their rich oil land given to them when their tribe was displaced to their new land. The story itself is masterfully told with a heartbreaking script by Scorsese and Eric Roth (Forest Gump, Munich). Filming in Oklahoma gives the movie a real authenticity, with the help of a solid A-list cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemmons and newcomer Lily Gladstone, who is sure to be a favorite contender during awards season this year. Not only is this a great film, but it proves to be a really important one as well. 6) Poor Things (In Theaters). Writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite, The Lobster) gives us this sci-fi sexual fantasy starring Emma Stone as a young women who is pieced back together by a mad surgeon/scientist after she attempts suicide. Given the brain of a baby, the Frankenstein-like beauty quickly develops in movement and intellect, but becomes fixated with a new obsession when she discovers sexual pleasure. Told in a crazy, visually-stunning style, the movie manages to entertain with a dazzling look and gut-busting comedy, all wrapped up in an enthralling journey. It took me two viewings to fully appreciate the film, but it keeps growing on me day-by-day. 7) The Holdovers (Streaming on Peacock on December 29). Paul Giamatti re-teams with filmmaker Alexander Payne (Sideways) for this severely good dramady about a much-disliked boarding school teacher who is asked to stay over the holiday to watch the one kid (Dominic Sessa) left behind by his parents during the Christmas break. Beginning with authoritarian tension, the two quickly warm to each other as they get to know one another better. As you would expect from a Payne film, the movie is both hilarious and moving, with some of the best performances of the year from Giamatti, Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph, the woman left behind to cook for the three of them. 8) Maestro (Streaming on Netflix). In this long-in-the-works project, Bradley Cooper writes, directs and stars in this biopic about the legendary composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. I knew his music well, but knew relatively nothing about the man before this story unfolded. Masterfully executed, Cooper proves to be impressive under all his hats on display here, giving us a beautiful, although sometimes painful story. The film is wonderfully cast, but it is Carey Mulligan, who plays his wife, Felicia Montealegre, whose commanding presence gives gravity to the film while simultaneously breaking our hearts. 9) Wonka (In Theaters). The charming and talented Timothée Chalamet stars as the infamous chocolate-maker in this musical prequel to the 1971 classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The story follows Wonka on his journey to create his chocolate empire as a poor dreamer who is oppressed by the town’s chocolate mafia: three businessmen determined to not allow any newbies to compete for their business. Playful and genuinely funny, the film is a joy to witness and has the potential to become as iconic as the original. 10) John Wick 4 (Available on Paid Streaming and Starz). While there were some excellent films competing for the last spot on my list, I couldn’t help but include this guilty pleasure, which puts an end to the story of the former assassin trying to survive after claiming revenge for the death of his dog. This nearly three-hour finale pits Wick against an old friend (martial arts master Donnie Yen) who has been hired to take out the man who just can’t seem to die. Thrilling from the first minute to the last, the movie is about as entertaining as a film can get, and a fitting tribute to the character we have grown to love over the last decade. 1) Haunted Mansion. Disney, once again, attempts to give a story to a ride, with resounding failure. It’s a shame there were so many great actors willing to bury their reputations in this graveyard. 2) Ghosted. This romantic action thriller from Apple TV+ about a goofy guy (Chris Evans) who falls for a secret agent (Ana de Armas) is as unbelievable as it is disappointing. After two hours watching, you kinda wish there had been an internet outage earlier in the day. 3) Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Disney has been having a really bad year, releasing lousy film after lousy film from franchises that should be able to deliver. By the end, you wish the movie had gotten so small that no one could actually see it. 4) The Marvels. Disney’s need to take successful franchises and turn them into women-driven flicks flops again with this unnecessary and confusing project with little saving grace. 5) Creed 3. Dropping Stallone and adding in now Hollywood Pariah Jonathan Majors proved to be a losing match for director and star Michael B. Jordan, who isn’t quite up to the challenge at hand here.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2008"," The big question going into ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was whether 60-something star Harrison Ford would be spry enough to reprise his physically demanding role as an adventurer. On the whole, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a mostly fun, nostalgic action-adventurer. While it may not hit the dizzying heights of 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which is by far the best of this film series, it definitely betters the worst of them, 1984's ""The Temple of Doom."" Set during the height of the Cold War, ""Crystal Skull"" propels Indy into yet another mystery — that is, once he escapes from Russian captivity and survives a nuclear blast. It turns out some mummified remains hidden in the U.S. Army's top-secret Area 51 facility may somehow be tied to the El Dorado legends, as well as possible extraterrestrial visitations. Indy gets some help from Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle-riding, switchblade-toting youth who reminds Indy a little bit of himself when he was younger. Hmmm. ... Together, they hope to solve the mystery and help free another archaeologist (John Hurt), as well as Mutt's mother — who just happens to be Indy's former flame, Marion (Karen Allen). Double-hmmm. ... Surprisingly, LaBeouf turns out to be one of the film's real assets. He's certainly not as irritating as at least one of the earlier Indy sidekicks (Short Round, anyone?) and is convincing in the action sequences, especially an exciting sword duel with Cate Blanchett's villainous Russian. And it's nice that the film doesn't take itself too seriously. There are winking nods to the earlier movies, as well as explanations for the absences of both Sean Connery and the late Denholm Elliott. But again, it's fun and doesn't require too much thought. And unlike at least one bloated summer film (""Speed Racer""), this movie knows when to shut up.  ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is rated PG-13 for strong scenes of violent action (gunplay and fisticuffs, vehicular and explosive mayhem, scenes of peril and violence against women), scattered profanity, derogatory language and other slurs, a couple of brief, vulgar references, and brief drug content (poisonous darts). Running time: 122 minutes. ",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2008"," Film pick of the weekend comes early this week, because when weekends go long, the movies open sooner. And we all know what you're going to go see at midnight tonight. (Don't tell me that “crystal ass” makes no sense. If Echo and the Bunnymen can sing about shattering your crystal heart, I can move the metaphor to other regions of the body.) [EDIT: A friend posing as an anonymous reader informed me via my personal blog that the Echo and the Bunnymen lyric I'm thinking of actually says “brittle heart.” He's right, and I've been singing it wrong for over 20 years, it seems.] First, a warning: If you're one of those people who gets all huffy the instant you suspect anything onscreen might be computer-generated — don't go. If you're one of those people, yet you liked SPEED RACER…you're either a hypocrite or an inveterate George Lucas-basher. And don't get me wrong, Lucas deserves some of the bashing he's taken, especially as regards changing his older movies with CG that doesn't fit. But as far as I'm concerned, he and Steven Spielberg have earned back a lot of goodwill with this one. It's the only Spielberg movie in over a decade that actually ends when it's supposed to. In a sly wink at those who may overhype the movie in their minds and thus be disappointed, the movie's traditional dissolving of the Paramount logo almost literally makes a molehill out of a mountain. And then the soundtrack cranks up an Elvis tune — now that it's age-appropriate for Indiana Jones to be set in the '50s, you get to have rock and roll (music, as opposed to actual rocks that roll, which have always been a constant for Dr. Jones). The action begins at “Hangar 51” — located in the middle of a desert populated by the ancestors of the CADDYSHACK gopher –which turns out to be home to the big warehouse at the end of RAIDERS, though the Ark isn't the goal of the evil Commies who infiltrate, dragging along a kidnapped Henry “Indiana” Jones Junior (Harrison Ford, like you didn't know) and his dubious partner Mac (Ray Winstone). Instead, they're looking for a crate from Roswell, New Mexico, and presumably I need say no more on that subject. Lamenting that the days when “we were younger” and “we had guns” are gone, Indy nonetheless escapes the clutches of crazy psychic Russian bitch Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), and manages to survive a nuclear bomb at nearly ground zero, thanks to a lead-lined refrigerator. One has to assume that drinking from the Holy Grail somehow gave him an immunity to radiation, for even though the blast wave throws the fridge clear, he gets out of it immediately, as a huge mushroom cloud looms in the distance and radioactive ash falls from the sky. But hey, he gets scrubbed down in the shower afterwards (for a cheap laugh at the expense of his old body), and all seems medically okay. In reality, lead may shield you from radiation, but at that close to ground zero, there's the slight problem of it vaporizing. Nonetheless, the image of Indiana in front of a mushroom cloud serves several symbolic purposes: it establishes that the world has changed, pays tribute to atomic age sci-fi, and yes, lets the audience know that, yes, fuck off, there will be CG in this movie so leave now if you're gonna be a baby about it. Indy hasn't been living the quiet life of an academic since last we saw him — he mentions “years we spent spying on the reds” as well as some kind of Berlin escapades. It seems he's a Republican; asked at one point if he has any last words, he responds “I like Ike.” (He also says “nucular.”) Dad (Sean Connery, seen in a photo) is dead and gone, so the Holy Grail doesn't provide immunity from everything, obviously (just nukes). Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) is gone too, but there's a nice moment during an action sequence that pays tribute to him. In their place is Jim Broadbent in an Elliott-esque role as a bumbling academic, and Shia La Boeuf as the self-named “Mutt” Williams, a bad boy poseur who's been told by his mom to come find Indiana Jones so he can rescue her and his old college pal Professor Oxley (John Hurt). Much mockery has been had at Shia's expense, and I grant that sometimes the kid is way-miscast (CONSTANTINE and I, ROBOT come to mind), but he nails it here. Yes, there is that rather silly shot of him decked out like Brando in THE WILD ONE, but here's the thing: in the context of the film, it is indeed supposed to be silly, the signifier of a kid who's a total fake badass but will eventually learn what it takes to be the actual kind. As for who is mom is, well, the movie poster pretty much gives that away. We won't go into who his dad is, but I'm sure you won't be shocked. As for Oxley, he's in South America, held by those same Commie bastards from the beginning (incidentally, that makes it the only beginning sequence in any Indy movie to actually set the main plot in motion). They're looking for the crystal skull, which it takes Indy forever to figure out the origins of, despite the references to Roswell, the fact that it's made from a magnetic form of crystal unlike anything ever seen on Earth, and oh yeah…just looking at it, it's kinda obvious it's meant to be an alien. And that would just seems so implausible to the guy who's seen angels melt people's faces, hung out with a 500-year-old crusader, and been a victim of voodoo and the Black Sleep of Kali. From there: Capoiera, grave-robbery, giant temple traps, crazy natives, big car chases, lots of monkeys, big ants, and tributes to other Spielberg/Lucas productions, including a crib from YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES (which itself borrowed heavily from Indiana Jones, so fair's fair) and a line of dialogue that references another famous Ford role, and gives us, if only for a second, a quick taste of what could have been if only George Lucas weren't so obsessed with prequels. As a kid, I remember thinking that RAIDERS felt like non-stop action, but revisiting it recently, I was surprised by how slow it seemed in an era that's jaded us on thrill overload. CRYSTAL SKULL, I'm happy to say, has the old Indy charm matched with action sequences that should satisfy today's big action fans as well — the motorcycle chase you've seen glimpses of in the trailers is the best motorcycle chase I've ever seen, and there's an extended car chase in the jungle that's almost Buster Keaton-like in its inspiration. In addition to losing Denholm Elliott, the world recently dealt with the death of Pat Roach, eternally cast as “Huge Dude who kicks Indy's ass,” but Igor Jijikene amply fills in as the super-Soviet Col. Dovchenko. As for Blanchett, her accent is hilarious, but I'm fairly sure it's supposed to be, Eastern European with the occasional upper-class English vowel enunciation. I'd like to have seen her beat Indy up a little more, but maybe that's just my twisted fantasy. Now, about those special effects. There is some obvious CG, as well as some matting issues. If those ruin the movie for you, you probably weren't that into it anyway. I mean, look, even at age 6 I knew the face-melting bit involved a wax dummy, and the plane crash in TEMPLE OF DOOM is quite clearly fake. I think the ending here could have used a bit more time, and it's likely to be the most controversial part of the movie ('tis the only way it could have ended, though). But the final coda gives the fans some nice character-based closure bits.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2008"," As summer time-wasters go, the latest Indiana Jones will go in record time, if you ask me. Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the first chapter in the series since 1989, is a four-star yawn. Harrison Ford started this fairy-tale franchise 27 years ago. At 65, he looks pretty darn trim, but why doesn’t he stop dyeing his hair? Sometimes it’s a rugged, manly silver. In the next scene it looks like he’s wearing a champagne rinse from Elizabeth Arden. Finally it turns orange as a Sunkist popsicle. Whatever else we expect from Indiana Jones, we don’t want him to look like Lucille Ball. The movie itself makes no sense, but what escapist summer movie does? It’s now 1957 in a secret military base in either Nevada or New Mexico (the movie is not too clear on the subject of details), closed for atomic weapons testing. An Air Force hangar is captured by Communist agents, led by Cate Blanchett as Stalin’s favorite Russian scientist in Buster Brown bangs. Out of a trunk in a deserted warehouse comes Indy, who stages a noisy, knuckle-cracking fight that sets off a nuclear reactor and blows up everything except his trademark brown fedora. It’s one close call too many, so Indy retires from cracking whips and battling pits of hissing cobras, and goes to work as a college professor teaching a course in archaeology. Now called Colonel Jones by the dean (Jim Broadbent), he learns that his recent activities exterminating Russians have led the U.S. government to suspect him of treason (aiding K.G.B. agents on American soil, or something like that), and the college is forced to fire him. Falsely accused, hopping mad and heading out of town, the disgraced Indy runs into a brash young hotshot in motorcycle leather named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, who looks alarmingly like Bobby Darin). Mutt’s got a proposition: Hire me and I’ll lead you to a mythical lost city in the Amazon built entirely of gold, with scientific architecture that will not be discovered for 5,000 years! There’s a secret, see, about 13 crystal skulls protected by the living dead, one of which was stolen around the time Moses either parted the Red Sea or Charlton Heston made his screen debut, whichever came first. The kid’s mother, who disappeared in the jungle, has sent him a letter written in an ancient alphabet only Indy can decode. Find the temple and he’ll find his missing Mom! Find the missing skull and Indy will make archaeological history! Of course, Ms. Blanchett, the archfiend with the bad accent, who miraculously survived the nuclear blast in Nevada (which is now referred to as New Mexico), wants Indy to translate for the Soviets, so she can discover the power of spiritual energy and control the universe. Huh? Best not to ask questions.  To make a long and very boring story short, the trail leads from a campus malt shop all the way to Peru and the burial place of the conquistador who escaped with the crystal skull—a place that may have been built by aliens that look exactly like E.T. Mr. Spielberg is smart. Never throws away his old props, puppets, or storyboards. Never know when he might need them again.  Of course, Mutt’s mother turns out to be—are you sitting down?—Indy’s long-lost girlfriend Marion (welcome back, Karen Allen). Incredulously, Mutt himself turns out to be—are you lying down?—but never mind. The script isn’t very careful about logic or coherence. The important thing is the stunts, which are a long time arriving, and all seem to have been recycled from previous (and better) Indiana Jones movies. There’s a sword fight on two separate vehicles speeding through the jungle, an attack by natives with poison darts, three death-defying crashes over waterfalls in a Jeep, a plague of man-eating red ants and a rescue by monkeys who teach Mutt to swing on vines like Bomba the Jungle Boy. Nobody suffers any wound more serious than a razor burn, and Indy always finds his fedora. It’s as contrived and convoluted as all the other Indiana Jones movies, but not as much fun.  I finally left when E.T., Ms. Blanchett in her Buster Brown bangs, and the 13 crystal skulls disappeared not only into space, but “the space between spaces.” Even when he’s dishing up corn, the director of directors usually spreads it coherently. Not this time. George Lucas’ story line is impossible to follow, and I don’t know what to make of the abysmal script by David Koepp, who once wrote dazzling, original and imaginative screenplays (Apartment Zero remains one of my favorite movies of all time) before he discovered Jurassic Park, Spider-Man, Mission: Impossible and money. This movie appears to have been written in hieroglyphics. Long on rhetoric and short on thrills, it’s an Indiana Jones adventure they all seemed to be making up as they went along.

"May 21, 2008"," What more do we want from our summer movies, really, than to break the chains that hold us fast to the workaday and liberate us, if only for a little while, from the mundane, anxious, increasingly wild world that lies beyond the exit sign? It's not too much to ask, certainly, and I'm delighted to report that the fourth installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' cliff-hanging archaeological-adventure franchise does just that. Much has changed in both the real world and the reel world in the 27 years since Dr. Indiana Jones (Ford, in fine fettle) first bullwhipped his way into the then fairly recent development of the ""summer movie season."" (And lest you forget, we have both Spielberg and Bruce the Shark to thank â or revile, depending on the height of your brow: 1975's Jaws was the first ""must-see-and-see-again"" smash that set the warm-weather moviegoing template for everything from Bruckheimer to Bay since then, almost as if Spielberg had decreed, ""You're gonna need a bigger box-office boat."") That said, â¦ Crystal Skull is a fine, rollicking, lightning-paced return to form for all involved, overflowing with outlandishly entertaining action set-pieces that may fall short of eliciting the ""holy cow!"" monogram-matinee panache of Raiders of the Lost Ark but which still manage more honest, white-knuckle emotion than Rolling Thunder's entire output thus far. Booted from his tenured position as professor of archaeological studies at Yale in a McCarthy-esque twist, Dr. Jones is soon back in the thick of it, teaming up with a Harley-riding Dean/Brando teen rebel named Mutt (LaBeouf) to track down a missing colleague and the crystalline cranium of the title. The Allies have trounced the Nazis in the interim, leaving Indy up against some equally wily Russians led by a black-bobbed, psychic-Commie Cate Blanchett. Nearly as much fun as seeing that battered fedora is the reappearance of Indy's long-ago love and drinking partner, Marion Ravenwood (Allen, who appears positively giddy to be back, and who can blame her?). Beneath all the derring-do and Indy's patented wry understatement (""this can't be good,"" he notes on more than one occasion, echoing Han Solo's ""I've got a bad feeling about this"") runs a smart if somewhat overcrowded script by David Koepp, which makes allowances for both Ford and his character's advancing maturity while sacrificing none of the series' innate innocence. Quite a feat, that, considering that before the plot even really begins, we're treated to alien beings, a nuclear explosion in the Nevada badlands, and squirrelly, HUAC-style federal agents with pinkos on the brain. My only real complaints lie with Spielberg's tendency to overburnish his film with a CGI wash. It casts a particularly grating sheen over the first third of the film and makes you pine for the dusty, analog imperfections of the Indiana Jones of yore. But that's a relatively minor quibble for a bedrock adventure yarn that includes swarms of queasily realistic giant Amazonian ants (a nod to the mid-Fifties Charlton Heston potboiler The Naked Jungle) and a vine-swinging sequence that goofily riffs on both Tarzan and Aguirre, Wrath of God. To be sure, nothing can ever replace Raiders in the rarified Valhalla (or El Dorado) of our Saturday afternoon childhoods. But Ford's Indy, who doesn't quite hang up his fedora at film's end, is still the only cinematic smartass-cum-bullwhipping scholar of antiquities I'd want by my side when push comes to shove comes to Nazis (""I hate these guys""), Russkies, or, for that matter, al Qaeda. Go get 'em, Indy, and cue the John Williams while you're at it.

Gambling sites featured on canoe.ca use tempting bonuses to acquire new members and encourage continued play. You have access to multiple promotion types, each with distinct advantages and pitfalls. We outline key offerings so players can evaluate the best options. When you first join a casino, they’ll likely greet you with a flashy 200% deposit match deal plus free spins or something like “deposit $100, play with $300!” While exciting, look deeper at critical things like how much you need to playthrough before withdrawing win money and timeframes before the offer expires. On top of welcome deals, some casinos give you more bang for your buck, even on your 2nd or 3rd deposits. These 50-100% reload matches work similarly to welcome offers but tend to let you cash out bonus funds faster once you hit lower playthrough requirements. Who doesn’t like some complimentary action? Free spin releases let you preview new slots risk-free upon launch while retaining associated wins. But confirm the number of rounds and title eligibility before playing. More VIP-focused cashback bonuses act like rebate rewards that refund small chunks of what you lost over a week or month. So, if you notice your play history showing a lot of entries in the “negative” column, cashback puts a few coins back by refunding maybe 15-25%. Of course, continued play is mandatory. Scoring free betting credit or spins just for signup sounds too good to be true. That’s because these rare deals impose nearly impossible playthrough rules relative to tiny gifts. VIP schemes provide personalized promotions, prizes, event access and more for high-volume players. Rating levels dictate cashback rates and unlock additional reward potential over time. Moving money conveniently while upholding security remains vital for enjoyable online gambling. Below, canoe.ca experts outline the most globally supported banking channels accepted by regulated gambling sites. Amid thousands of gaming options online, determining trustworthy sites that will treat customers fairly elicits warranted caution. While no singular factor guarantees outcomes, familiar markers signal vetted processes. Reputable sites prominently display credentials like eCOGRA certification, United Kingdom, Kahnawake, Malta, Curacao, or other licensing numbers. These indicate compliance with heavy operational rules and auditing procedures imposed by renowned gambling oversight agencies. Actively scanning for the SSL “padlock” icon confirms betting portal connections utilize modern data encryption. This shields exchanged information from external surveillance or hacking vulnerabilities. While casino gaming and sports betting offer recreational enjoyment, establishing play time limits and budget caps and using available self-exclusion tools remains important.

"May 21, 2008"," ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" feels like an old romance re-kindled. The pleasure is still there, informed by nostalgia, but that pleasure is also complicated. Messier. On balance, the first new ""Indiana Jones"" movie in 19 years is perfectly amusing. There are sections -- particularly in the film's first third -- that recapture the magic of the most beloved adventure series in movie history. Back in the hat and cracking the whip, Harrison Ford is brighter-eyed than he's been in a movie in a long time. The paranormal mystery is fairly compelling, even if it loses some juice by swapping religious significance for sci-fi significance. The funny moments, striking villains and a couple of clever, easy-to-follow action set pieces remind you just how good Spielberg can be at this sort of thing. But there are also disappointments. Not ""Phantom Menace""-level epic failures, but disappointments. 
The film juggles way too many underdeveloped characters. There are silly, tension-undermining jokes involving monkeys and prairie dogs. There are too many shout-outs to previous films in the series. The script sets up big-deal relationships -- even bringing back Indy's one true love, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) -- but doesn't do much with those relationships during its all-running, all-riddle-decoding final third. Is ""Crystal Skull"" a flawless resurrection? No. Is it a lame reminder of our own mortality, revealing director Steven Spielberg to be an old duffer who's lost his touch? Absolutely not. Like every ""Indiana Jones"" sequel, it has its problems. It's a little cluttered, frankly. But it's also too diverting to call it a failure. After the goofiest Paramount-logo-to-real-object transition of the entire series (it owes more than a little to ""Caddyshack""), the movie gets off to a surprisingly strong start. It's 1957. Dr. Jones has been captured by a team of Cold War Russians led by agent Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), an alleged psychic with a jet-black bob, a sword and a spotless gray jumpsuit. The Commies take Indy to a warehouse familiar to any ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" fan, then force him to locate a magnetized box. It sets up an intriguing tension that the rest of the movie never fully explores. It's the age of malt shops and bobby-soxers and the nuclear family, and Indiana Jones' glory days are behind him. His exploits are slowly being lost to history. Even the federal government he helped in World War II, now caught up in the Red Scare, is beginning to forget and distrust him. Just as Jones looks ready to resign from teaching and slip into obscurity, a surly young greaser named Mutt (Shia LeBeouf) turns up needing help -- and gives Jones a chance to revisit his legacy. Spoiling the details of the rest of the adventure would be unfair. Let's just say it's fun, but it's also never as good as that opening scene. It crudely stitches together all the exciting parts of several prior screenplay drafts producer George Lucas commissioned during the past two decades. And it presses, or tries to press, all the pleasure buttons of an Indiana Jones movie. Everything a fan might want is here, executed with varying degrees of success. There's a spooky artifact with vaguely defined power. There are creepy-crawlies (though they're now computer-generated). There are animated lines on maps. There's a brutal fight with a big, ugly henchman. There's a reunion with Marion that's more bickering than romantic. There's a long, long chase with trucks and sword fighting, punching, jumping and (alas) vine-swinging and monkeys. Yes, monkeys. Codes are decrypted. John Williams makes a lot of lushly orchestrated martial noise on the soundtrack. The cinematography is old-school. And the ending is huge, or at least took up a great deal of hard-drive space. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" had terrible dialogue and screechy sidekicks. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" had dull villains and a jokey lack of tension. ""Crystal Skull"" simply has too much of everything -- too many effects, too many characters, too long a middle, too many explanations and too many set pieces stretching too much credulity. Much of ""Skull's"" final third is a frenzied chase, and a great deal of promising character stuff gets lost in the shuffle -- leaving you feeling at arm's length from the story. In the film's single biggest disappointment, poor Karen Allen gets to do little more than yell, smile, drive a truck and change her mind completely about Indy in the space of a single sentence. John Hurt and Ray Winstone don't get much of a chance to register as messed-up sidekicks. And LeBeouf's cranky relationship with Indy all but disappears just as it was starting to echo Ford's cranky relationship with Sean Connery in ""Last Crusade."" In short, the final third feels less like a Spielberg ""Indiana Jones"" film and more like a better-made mix of ""The Mummy"" and (forgive me) ""National Treasure"" -- full of computer-generated special effects and puzzle-solving and generic running around, but without the deeper sense of dread or wonder that marks a classic Indy adventure.

 “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” promises primo gee-whizzery with an early scene in which Indy, accompanied by a young adventurer played by Shia LaBeouf, hops from vehicle to vehicle as he races through a sleepy college town.  The “Indy” movies are as much about speed as “Speed Racer” is, and that breathless sequence thrills us with the daring precision of real stuntmen and of real Harrison Ford, who slides gracefully into the fedora he last doffed 19 years ago. Real-time kicks are what the initial “Indy” trilogy was all about. Sure, there were special effects, but the films were exciting because they dazzled us with variations on the same can’t-believe-your-eyes tricks that movies have used since Thomas Edison walked the Earth. Ford, in collaboration with director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas, is clear on the appeal of the learned, unflappable Jones, who flaps only if there’s a snake in his vicinity. “Crystal Kingdom” recaptures his appeal right off the bat (cleverly, we see his hat and hear his instantly recognizable musical theme before we see him). Indy is still the hero who can clean the clocks of four bad guys while also driving a jeep, translating some hieroglyphics and diffidently smooching a spunky heroine. As in that campus chase scene, “Crystal Kingdom” is most entertaining when its thrills happen in front of our eyes instead of in a computer. The effects are state of the art (there’s a dandy one with some computer-generated man-eating ants), but they don’t always ring true because that early chase scene, which looks so real, has trained us to be skeptical of scenes that aren’t as convincing. Later on, for instance, a climactic swordfight between LaBeouf and a Russian villainess (Cate Blanchett) reminds us of the earlier scene. The two hop between speeding vehicles that are moving even faster, but you can spot the digital effects that are making it possible, so the scene isn’t as dangerous or thrilling as the earlier, simpler one. While I’m splitting hairs, let’s also talk about Blanchett, whose blunt-cut bob is perfect but whose character is underwhelming in her dastardliness. Blanchett is a witty actress, but there isn’t enough of her, and her role — a Russian looking for extrasensory methods to help her country win the Cold War — isn’t the evil fun it could be. (The film’s other potential villain, Ray Winstone as a guy who keeps switching sides, isn’t much fun, either, because not enough is made of his double-, triple-, sextuple-crossing). But back to the good stuff: The appealingly earnest LaBeouf, who makes his entrance in a fetishwear get-up lifted from Brando in “The Wild Ones,” suggests he’s ready if this series decides to shift him into the valiant fedora and Indy into a special-guest-hero role. The script’s understated humor consistently hits its mark. And the film, which is set in the late ’50s, is bathed in a golden glow that instantly transports us to another era, an era when the movies thrilled us with the daring exploits of human beings, not binary codes.

"May 21, 2008","Indy 4 is a nicely satisfying continuation of the franchise, and will please most Indy fans.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2008"," Here’s your hat, Indy, but, really, what’s your hurry? Because 19 years after the Last Crusade that clearly wasn’t, and 15 years after the old man joined Young Indiana Jones on the small screen to recount his glory days blowing horns with Sidney Bechet, it’s almost unfathomable that this hoary mishmash is the best that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg could cough up. Have we learned nothing about disturbing dusty relics and mussing with primordial remains? These only lead to trouble—melted faces, some crazy dude sticking his fist in your chest, and, well, more melting faces. This time, though, an even worse fate lies ahead for trampling trespassers: National Treasure by way of The X-Files, only not as pleasurable as so dreadful a coupling would suggest. Bury thyself, Dr. Jones, and pray no one disturbs the corpse in this or any other millennium. From humdrum start to shrugging finish, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull bears almost no resemblance to its three predecessors: It’s absent the spark and spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the grown-up menace and slapdash comedy of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the loose-limbed effervescence and emotional jolts of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It’s hard to tell whether Spielberg and Lucas are trying too hard or trying at all—the thing’s such a mess, such an unmitigated disaster, that damned is the scholar stuck with the unfortunate task of deciphering this cynical, clinical gibberish in decades to come. Much has been made of Lucas and Spielberg, and a cadre of screenwriters (including the solely credited David Koepp), pushing the franchise into the late 1950s—away from the Nazis and biblical collectors’ items and toward the Russians and ETs. Early word suggested a film verging on summer camp, as creaky ol’ Indy (Harrison Ford, looking not a day over 62) donned fedora and whip and Cate Blanchett slipped into dominatrix bob-cut bangs and borscht-scented accent for some outer-space trip flavored with the era’s grade-Z conventions, just as the first films proffered yellowed pulp cliffhangers and widescreen smirks. But Crystal Skull is no fun at all—not for a single second, not even accidentally. Not even with Shia LaBeouf terribly miscast as Marlon Brando as the Wild One. (The Mild One? Sure, fine.) The dialogue’s drab when not absolutely dumb; the actors seem lost if not outright listless; the scant action sequences appear to have been filmed entirely in front of green screens, suggesting a movie shot during breaks from lunch catered in a studio boss’s office. (Is anyone sure producer Lucas didn’t actually direct?) And the storyline’s a bunch of convoluted mumbo and pointless jumbo having to do with Russians and mind control and the mythical golden South American city of El Dorado, which, according to The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, may have been constructed by “visitors” who taught the locals how to, um, farm. Twenty years between offerings, and this is all that the A-team could come up with? Close Encounters of the Turd Kind? “I’m making this up as I go,” said Indiana Jones 27 long years ago, and Raiders possessed the kineticism of the improvised sprawled across myriad continents. Temple of Doom was more precise, from its beautifully choreographed opening sequence to its roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft—best sequence in the series, hands (and heads!) down. And for all its flaws as a Raiders rehash, at least Last Crusade allowed plenty of room in which Ford and Sean Connery could play a rousing game of comedic tag. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is as joyless as its predecessors were blissful: Its sole intention seems to be the launching of a new franchise with LaBeouf’s Mutt as heir to his father’s fedora. And no, it spoils nothing to give away that LaBeouf is the son of Indiana Jones and Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, who appears late in the film and serves little function other than to grin like a schoolgirl at the professor who got away. There is one rather brilliant sequence, set in a model suburbia that serves as an Army testing ground for nuclear bombs. We’re reminded, in a blinding flash, that the Indiana Jones who bested the Nazis is no match for the atomic age. But random asides aside (including a few mentions of government witch-hunts), the movie has no interest in exploring the morality of 1950s America or the mortality of Indiana Jones. It’s just an exercise in creating instant nostalgia for boxed sets on sale at a Big Box near you. There are even references to episodes of Young Indiana Jones, about as close as the film gets to clever. (One sight gag, involving a familiar relic, didn’t even elicit a chuckle amongst an amped-up preview audience last weekend.) Still, Indy lumbers forward, surviving not only the copious attacks on his age—”What’re you, like, 80?” asks a sneering Mutt upon introduction—but also one more chase in a hijacked truck carrying the key to global domination. This being a George Lucas movie, the dangers are almost entirely computer-generated now; the climactic pursuit through a South American jungle looks like it was shot on the forest moon of Endor, complete with ferocious CG monkeys. The monkeys, however, fare better than Blanchett, who has absolutely no idea what to do with her role: She’s equal parts evil and incompetent, and she’s the least dangerous villain Indiana Jones has ever faced. Turns out that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are far more threatening foes.",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2008"," You cannot always teach an old dog new tricks, but sometimes it's good to show the new dogs how good the old tricks can be. Starting with Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981), the unbelievably successful Indiana Jones films have always had, amidst all the derring-do and supernatural shenanigans, a strong element of nostalgia at their core. Much like its titular hero, an archaeologist who digs up ancient treasures from long-forgotten ruins, this franchise looked back not only to the black-and-white morality of the fight against the Nazis, but also to the serial adventures that George Lucas so loved when he was a boy – and by the time of the Last Crusade (1989), age and the generation gap became themes in themselves as Indy was joined on the quest by his crusty (but no less adventurous) father, and there were even flashbacks to Indy's own boyhood. Of course nostalgia has a double edge, reminding us as much of where we are now as where we came from. To watch Harrison Ford in his fourth outing, now himself looking as leathery as the old hat and whip he is still wearing, is also to realise how much older we ourselves are – and Indy's advancing years, far from being glossed over, are endlessly topicalised here. Like Rocky, like John McClane, like Rambo, Ford's Indy has now become a dinosaur of his times twice over – a hero who was old-fashioned from the very outset, but who now seems as antiquated as any of the cobweb-covered relics he pursues. As each of the Indiana Jones films has demonstrated, however, iconic talismans from the past can still conceal an awesome power - and so it is also with Indy himself, still able to whip up a box office frenzy even when his last field trip took place an extraordinary 18 years ago. This older Indy, however is not having to find his way through the moral quagmire of our own postmodern times, but rather through the Cold War politics of 1957, offering ample opportunities for yet more nostalgia. The film opens with young joyriders tearing down the highway to the tune of Elvis' Hound Dog, in a scene that could have come straight out of Lucas' earlier American Graffiti (1973) – which was even in its own time a nostalgia piece. After Indy has a run-in at Hangar 51 with a group of murderous KGB agents led by paranormal expert Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), and ends up in a nuclear test village at just the wrong moment in history, he is approached by a young juvenile delinquent named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who is first glimpsed in leathers on a motorcycle looking the spitting image of Marlon Brando in The Wild One (1953). Mutt's patron Professor Oxley (John Hurt), whom Indy knows from way back, has been kidnapped by the KGB after finding a crystal skull in Peru, as has Mutt's mother Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), also once an intimate of Indy's – and so the aging adventurer and his young ward set off together to raid some old tombs, remake some old acquaintances, and solve an ancient mystery. They face all manner of jungle perils – scorpions, quicksand, man-eating ants, ravines, waterfalls, unfriendly natives, and of course a snake – while also kicking bad-guy butt aplenty, but while director Steven Spielberg may be looking back to the lost adventures of Tarzan (here expressly signalled by the sequence in which Mutt is shown swinging from tree to tree with an army of monkeys), he is also, it turns out, dusting off some of his earlier ideas from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977). Remember that moment in Star Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge Of The Sith (2005) when Anakin Skywalker is at last seen donning Vader's mask for the first time and at last heard drawing that first metallic breath? It was a moment that almost made the many inanities of the second Star Wars trilogy seem worthwhile - a moment of pure cinematic nostalgia, where the circle between a long time ago and an even longer time ago was finally closed. Well, this new Indy film feels like an extended compilation of such moments, as Lucas and Spielberg show their profound understanding of the value of nostalgia, and milk every piece of Indy iconography for what it is worth. If you're a fanboy, this film will make you only too happy to keep up with the Joneses. Just as well, really, because there is not much else to The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Cate Blanchett makes a wonderful villainess, but even she cannot elevate her character beyond the cartoonish. The set-pieces (and they are wall-to-wall) are shot with all the accomplishment that one expects from Spielberg, but they are merely ends in themselves, never actually taking the viewer to a place any more interesting than the next set-piece. The plot is gleefully, unapologetically ridiculous, in a film that never really seems to be about anything (although the part played in education by hands-on experience forms something of a recurrent motif). And despite its Cold War setting, A-bomb anxieties and Soviet antagonists, the film studiously avoids any reflections on the politics of today. It is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Perhaps, though, that is precisely the point. For although you may well leave Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull astonished at its lack of substance, as long as it is still playing out in the cinema, you will be transported back to a different world and a better-seeming time, where there is no room for today's concerns. So take this nostalgic ""pathway to another dimension"", and for two hours your mind, like Oxley's, will be blissfully empty.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2008","Spielberg proves he still knows how to generate high-style thrills, and Ford affirms that he can yet deliver both a punch and a wry punchline.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2008"," Morphing Paramount’s old-school mountain logo into a live-action molehill is an early chuckle in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It’s also a sufficiently reversed metaphor for enjoying the film: Temper those too-towering expectations for a sequel 19 years in the making. Indiana Jones, that dashing and wily idolized hero of old, is now … old. That doesn’t mean Indy is any less entertaining in the hands of Harrison Ford (finally with a pulse after 11 years of flatline work) and Steven Spielberg (working in a wheelhouse of hurly-burly homage, action and humor). OK, George Lucas is involved, too. But he’s the likely perp behind Peruvian pygmies protecting a cemetery who suddenly disappear and a scene when co-star Shia LaBeouf dangles from a vine and … well, you’ll just have to see it for yourself. (Those who bristled at Temple of Doom’s raft escape will have as much to groan about here.) Yes, Indy still is an engaging everyman. For much of Skull, Spielberg balances frenetic energy with his aged hero’s slowdown. It’s a wise move, considering a component of the film’s audience probably hasn’t been to the movies in years and will turn out just for this. Indy’s the same, only creakier, a tad less agile and at an age “where life stops giving us things and starts taking them.” It’s a blockbuster affectionately aimed as much at the AARP crowd as those who grew up with Indy. The problem is everybody has knocked this stuff off since CGI killed matte effects. Spielberg crafts three terrific action sequences and the film’s crisp look is gangbusters. But working from a story by Lucas and Jeff Nathanson, Spielberg’s favorite-son writer David Koepp can’t come up with anything better than a zoned-out, stand-around ending that easily could be National Treasure 3. Skull is set in 1957, 19 years after Indy’s now next-to-last crusade, and opens with a prototypically explosive prologue. Here, Indy must escape evil Russians — led by ice-eyed Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) — who’ve kidnapped and dragged him to a New Mexico hangar. Spalko is a daffy mentalist who talks like Natasha Fatale and wields a blade, but the Oscar winning Blanchett has nothing on Doom’s Mola Ram. Yanking beating hearts from chests trumps mind reading. Indy’s flight involves gunplay, car chases, whip-work, a rocket sled and even an atomic blast, with more quick thinking than brute-force escape. And it’s some of the most organically orchestrated action ever shot, with smooth camerawork that instills confidence in its choreography. Indy makes it, but betrayal by sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone, swarthy, sweaty and scummy) sparks a Communist-sympathy misunderstanding that gets him canned from his college position. (Jim Broadbent has a small, but effective, role, as Indy’s sympathetic dean.) And not even Indy’s sterling World War II record — he spent it fighting the Nazis, naturally — can speak for itself. It’s just a red-scare cap to a rough couple of years. Dad is gone, as is pal Marcus Brody. The moments of melancholy in the movie are handled just right, and Brody is eulogized in two moments with respect to both the late Denholm Elliott’s work as well as this film’s generation gap. That’s where Mutt Williams (LaBeouf) comes in, a hot-tempered greaser interrupting Indy just as he’s ready to spend his twilight overseas. LaBeouf rides in on his motorcycle like a spitting image of Marlon Brando in The Wild One. LaBeouf’s far from ready for that mantle yet, but he’s convincing in what should be the final gestation period for his grooming as a bonafide star. Harold Oxley (John Hurt) is Mutt’s mentor and Indy’s peer and has gone missing after pursuing crystal skulls of ancient Peruvian importance. Dispatched by his mom to seek Indy’s help, Mutt uses stubborn resourcefulness to help them both evade KGB agents (another great sequence). Soon enough, Mutt and Indy are packing for Peru. There, they’ll tussle with Spalko (hoping to infiltrate America through mind control), reunite with Indy’s greatest love, Marion (Karen Allen, as mouthy a firebrand as 27 years ago), and encounter something more out of this world than in any of Indy’s previous exploits. Spielberg runs free in this Amazonian playground, particularly with a three-jeep chase on a precarious Cliffside road. It’s a scene that’s ludicrous fun even while it’s blowing its gasket while paying tribute to both Errol Flynn and Johnny Weissmuller in a matter of moments. Watching Spielberg and Co. take the story in otherworldly direction isn’t the surprise. It’s the downer lack of enthusiasm in doing so. But salvageable even from its dizzy mish-mash ending are several examples of just how joyfully jaw-dropping it is to see Indiana Jones back after so long. Ford’s performance is perfect, reminiscent of how he rightfully ascended to stardom in the first place. It’s a laundry list of great moments: unnerved comedy over the snakes he hates; umpteen emotions behind the giddy schoolboy smile he flashes at Marion when they meet again; and, especially, a terse romantic phrase to Marion that’s enough to make even the manliest men swoon. Skull also is filled with beautiful shots of composition that Spielberg can add to his canon, whether it’s the Southwest’s Fiestaware colors or haunting silhouettes on sackcloth deep in the Amazon. Yet the film’s climactic effects shot, odd as its content is, has a resonating vantage point. One character looks out on a washed-away legacy and realizes a different sort of knowledge is a different sort of treasure. Just know that Skull isn’t going to be anything like its predecessors, and you’ll find it mostly impressive on its own terms.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2008"," With that different question come different expectations, as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull seems to realize from its opening shot. Once again the Paramount logo mountain peak dissolves to a roughly similar shape, but one considerably smaller than any of the previous pinnacles in the earlier films. This shouldn’t necessarily be taken to suggest that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the least consequential of Dr. Jones’s adventures (Temple of Doom retains that dubious distinction); but perhaps it is the most aware that it will never rival the original.  Or perhaps it’s simply we who are aware of it. Raiders of the Lost Ark is such a tour de force homage to the serial adventures of yesteryear that viewers who know nothing of those old cliffhangers are swept up in its nostalgia. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an homage to homage, playing to nostalgia for the earlier Indiana Jones films. In that capacity, it delivers more or less what one would expect: a reunion with a few old friends amid disposable popcorn entertainment, not a lot different from countless Raiders imitators. Enjoy it for what it is, but don’t hope for more.  Like John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard, Indy can’t pretend to be the man he once was, and George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have allowed Indy to age into the Eisenhower era. Russians, obviously, are the new Nazis, but it’s more than that. Indy’s roots are in 1930s pulp fiction; the pulp fiction of the 1950s had different concerns, from science fiction to spy stories. If Die Hard 4 made the point that McClane has become “an analog cop in a digital world,” perhaps Indy has become a combustion-engine hero in a space-age world, or even a gunpower hero in an atomic-age world.  Well, yes — to an extent. The iconography of 1950s Americana is here, from the startling image at the end of the bravura first act to the sense-overloading special-effects extravaganza of the finale. The soundtrack includes Elvis and the Everly Brothers, and hot-rodding, anti-Red demonstrations and references to espionage and McCarthyism all put in appearances. Indy’s youthful sidekick (another Die Hard 4 connection), played by Shia LaBeouf and oddly called Mutt Williams, is a leather-jacketed biker overtly, if entirely superficially, recalling Brando in The Wild One.  At the same time, the title is enough to tell you that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is still a 1930s Republic serial at heart, with some 1950s window dressing. Ancient temples and deathtraps, vehicular fight scenes, lost cities, creepy-crawly vermin and literal cliffhanging remain very much the order of the day. The title, alas, is also an indication of the film’s key weakness, signaling that the mystical artifact du jour and the cultural context it represents — like the sankara stones in Temple of Doom — don’t ring any bells for the average moviegoer.  Raiders and Last Crusade were both set in a Judeo-Christian context, lending them an aura of importance, even spiritual significance. With Raiders, they had us at “Lost Ark”; and of course the Holy Grail is, well, the Holy Grail. Where do you go after that? Perhaps almost anything would have been anticlimactic, but surely they could have done better than going back to mystic stone artifacts from some tribal culture.  On the other hand, at least Crystal Skull basically avoids the potential pitfalls of New Age gooeyness lurking on all sides of the subject matter. Crystal skulls really exist, though they don’t look anything like the ones in the film, and enthusiasts tout them as pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts, exceeding the capacity of premodern craftsmanship and possessing psychic or healing powers — claims connected with New Age beliefs in ancient visitors from the stars, premodern super-technology, and the paranormal properties of crystals. (Experts believe that crystal skulls are of modern origin.) “Oh, I believe, sweetheart,” Indy shoots back, but the “belief” he has in mind seems limited to the notion that his adventures tend to end in paranormal pyrotechnics, and it’s best to stay out of the way of that sort of thing. Unfortunately, as my friend and fellow critic Peter Chattaway has pointed out, by the time we get there we still have almost no idea what “that sort of thing” is — what we're looking at and why, not to mention what got the whole ball rolling, so to speak. At times Kingdom of the Crystal Skull seems more reminiscent of various Raiders imitators than of the original. In particular, certain plot points and devices — a lost Mesoamerican city of gold, a scavenger-hunt trail of coded messages, heroes balancing on a giant rock platform — compare, not necessarily favorably, to National Treasure: Book of Secrets. One way Crystal Skull actually does hearken back to Raiders is the welcome return of Karen Allen as Indy’s one true love, Marion Ravenwood. The rapport of their scenes together, even when they’re bickering, underscores all that was lacking in the earlier sequels, with Temple of Doom’s shrilly unpleasant Willie Scott and Last Crusade’s one-dimensional femme fatale Elsa Schneider.  In other ways, though, the film continues the trajectory of the sequels, which got progressively sillier and more over-the-top. Part of the appeal of Raiders is the vulnerability of its mortal action hero; in the sequels, he’s increasingly become an invulnerable super hero. Crystal Skull does have some rollicking action scenes, but without the restraint and minimal sop to realism that make for real excitement. Ironically, the more they ramp up the action, the less exciting it is. If a movie wants to sell me on characters driving off a 300-foot cliff, breaking their fall on a tree, falling into a river and surviving, I might be willing to buy it. What I can’t buy is a character serenely driving off the cliff on purpose with the intention of breaking the fall on the tree and landing in the river. Then there’s a ridiculous Tarzan vine-swinging bit, and Indy’s extended mano-a-mano with a much younger Russian officer, in which Indy actually seems tougher than he did against the German in Raiders. As usual, Lucas is so full of hot air one wonders what keeps him tethered to the ground. Does he really think that the climactic stunt at the end of the opening act in the Nevada desert is less preposterous than F‑14s flying under freeways? Granted, even the earlier Indy sequels went beyond the comparative restraint of Raiders; perhaps the previous high-water mark was the absurd early stunt in Temple of Doom in which the heroes leap from a crashing plane with an inflatable life raft, toboggan down a snowcapped mountain peak, then skid off a cliff and fall 300 feet into a river. The Nevada desert climax is even less survivable, though in fairness it’s so brilliant that plausibility is moot. Still, what could have been an opportunity to acknowledge Indy’s mortality, the way Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan did for Captain Kirk, simply passes as Indy climbs to his feet, barely stunned by what should have killed him. As good as this scene is, many of the film’s best moments are more low-key. I love the sequence with Indy and Marion sinking into a pit of sand, which makes the scene about the characters rather than the crisis. And a brief exchange between Indy and Mutt about the latter’s dropout status allows Indy to be a real person with opinions, values and an outlook on life, not just a swashbuckling grandpa.  Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ends on a nostalgic, fan-pleasing note, and for a moment playfully flirts with the notion of the fedora passing to Shia’s character. But the movie is smart enough to know that there will never be another Indy — and, even in his 60s, Indy has too much panache to pass the torch to some wet-behind-the-ears wanna-be. The fedora belongs to him, now and forever.  Exactly right. And we can enjoy it because the self-referential aspect is much more acceptable here than it is, say, in At World’s End. What we wanted there was a satisfying conclusion to what had been begun only a year before in Dead Man’s Chest; what we got was something prematurely ’mythology-bound’ (as you put it). Here we’re not looking for the resolution of a crisis, but for something that makes us feel we’re in the world of the Indiana Jones that we came to know all those years ago. And on that level, it works. It’s still disappointing, though, that the aliens/lost-civilization plot, which is the vehicle for the action and interaction, is so silly and so easy not to care about! But then we took it for granted that the aliens would give Spalko her deserts; what we really cared about in the ending was [spoiler alert] seeing Indy and Marion finally get married. And your comment about the fedora is again spot on.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2008"," The greatest gift that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull gives to audiences is Indy himself. Fans can stop fretting. He's back. Dispelling all fears about age and ability, Harrison Ford puts on that legendary fedora and becomes Henry Jones Jr. exactly as we remember him. That smoldering glower. The snappy wisecracks. Those gutsy stunts. The capacity to survive punches that would knock out a prizefighter. That familiar enthusiasm for riddles, buried treasure, and dead languages. It's all here. There's never been a better actor/character match than Ford as Jones, and he seems giddy as a schoolboy to be cracking that bullwhip again. In fact, all through this, the fourth Jones film, there's a sense that the whole Indiana Jones team is bursting with enthusiasm at the chance to ride with Jones again. That probably accounts for the film's strengths and, alas, its considerable problems. Their enthusiasm gets the better of them. Back in 1981, the storytellers of Raiders of the Lost Ark took Indy's world somewhat seriously, making outlandish adventures seem almost convincing. But these days, while the James Bond series is leaving behind campy cartoon action for a dustier, grittier ""realism,"" Indy is speeding in the opposite direction, headlong into Looney Toons absurdity. Crystal Skull makes all previous Jones adventures seem modest—even plausible—by comparison. After we watch a man walk away from an atomic blast with barely a scratch in the opening act, what could possibly inspire a sense of suspense or dread? And we still have to suspend our disbelief while a motorcycle speeds through a crowded university library; a hero swings on jungle vines fast enough to chase down speeding trucks; an army of angry monkeys attacks the Communists; an ocean of deadly insects discerns good guys from bad guys; and Indy takes a waterfall plunge that makes Ford's famous Fugitive stunt look easy. Viewers will either mock the excess, or surrender like a wide-eyed eight-year-old to these tidal waves of cliffhanger nostalgia. Story credit for this episode goes to series originator George Lucas and co-writer Jeff Nathanson, but there were five different scripts written for this movie, and screenwriter David Koepp (Jurassic Park) clearly stitched together ideas from many disparate sources. It's a bumpy ride. The first half of the film—the better half—sets the stage. We join Jones in mid-adventure. This is the 1950s, and some things have changed: Indy's become fond of the phrase ""I like Ike!"" But some things have stayed the same: He'll fight the Cold War the old fashioned way—with his whip and his pistol in hand. Indy's been kidnapped by a troop of Russian spies, led by an ice-cold officer from the Ukraine. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) looks like a female Terminator, and she has an unnerving habit of flexing her gloved hands like a surgeon about to do some invasive work. Spalko's a decorated Soviet agent, she explains, ""because I know things. I know them before anyone else. And what I do not know, I find out."" Blanchett relishes this, the most cartoonish role of her career. Driven by that thirst for knowledge, Spalko uses Indy's know-how to find some buried treasure in a warehouse full of government secrets. She wants the ""mummified remains"" from the wreckage of those famous UFO crash sites in Roswell, New Mexico. She believes those bones will give her access to tremendous psychic power that will help the Reds win the Cold War.  In an acrobatic escape from a very big bang, Indy proves he's still got the moves. But when he gets back to the comforts of his classroom at Marshall University, we learn that the years have cost him plenty after all. ""We've reached the age when life stops giving us things and starts taking them away,"" says Indy's friend Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent). Stanforth, the new dean of students, is referring to his predecessor, the late Marcus Brody, and other kindred spirits that he and Jones have lost. And there's plenty more to lose: McCarthyism is at its peak, and our hero has been targeted as a suspect ""of great interest"" for allegedly aiding KGB agents on American soil. Stanforth instructs Jones to take a leave of absence. Hat in hand, Indy walks away to measure his options. Before he can go looking for a new job in Leipzig, he's interrupted by a young punk who looks like Marlon Brando in The Wild One. Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is a Harley-riding, tough-talking kid with a Jones-like jones for adventure. His action figure accessories? A comb and a switchblade. Fans complained when LaBeouf appeared in this film's previews, but they should drop their protests. He lives up to the challenge, and would be an asset to any future episode. After the film's best chase scene—a high-speed pursuit around (and through!) the university campus—Mutt informs Indy that a colleague, Harold Oxley (John Hurt), has been kidnapped while seeking the legendary Crystal Skull of Akator in Peru. And we're off on an airplane that trails a bright red line across the map, straight to South America, where Indy hopes to bring Oxley some help. He gets more than he bargained for, and we get exactly what we paid ten bucks to see: ancient tombs, obstacle courses rigged with booby traps, and savage, blowgun wielding natives. (It's enough to make one miss Satipo and Belloq.) As they dig deep, they explore questions surrounding the mysteries of the crystal skulls. Do the skulls exist? Do they belong to the gods of ancient cultures, or to ""saucer men from Mars""? Are they powerful? What would happen if they were all brought back to their place of origin? Mutt gets spooked by Indy's stories about the Mayans who distorted the shape of their childrens' skulls to resemble the elongated craniums of their gods. ""No,"" Mutt objects. ""God's head is not like that."" Indy smiles. ""Depends on who your god is."" And yet, Indy never bothers to ask for help from the God who has saved him so many times before—especially in Raiders and The Last Crusade. He seems to have cast aside all lessons learned from the Almighty. Perhaps that's why he and Mutt end up captured by the Communists, hostages in good company. Very good company, in fact: A standing ovation, please, for Marion Ravenwood, the greatest leading lady an action hero ever kissed. Karen Allen's return as Marion is a short-lived delight, and her sharp exchanges with Ford are the stuff that moviegoer dreams are made of. But there's precious little time for dialogue or character development. We still have to make room for an encounter with a snake, a barrel of monkeys, the most outrageous truck chase of the series, and—of course—grisly comeuppances. (Be warned: If you don't like bugs, you're going to have nightmares.) In the last act, the world goes to pieces in scenes of unprecedented devastation. Indy's just a bystander while loose plot threads and nagging questions are buried in the rubble. (What happened to the FBI's suspicion that Jones was a Communist? How could Indy have survived ""twenty or thirty"" top-secret missions with Mac, the sidekick played by Ray Winstone, who seems like a fickle buffoon? Why would the government keep a warehouse full of secrets next to a nuclear testing site?) In Raiders and Last Crusade, climaxes carried some measure of mystery. The skulls, unlike the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, don't enrich the story with meaning. Sure, we learn where they come from, and who they belong to. But their various powers are baffling—not only do they have hypnotic, telepathic power, but they also serve as a great deterrent against jungle predators. And in the end, they teach the same lesson that Raiders taught: when knowledge is pursued at all costs, it leads to destruction. And that destruction stirs up so much sound and fury that one of Indy's most powerful collaborators—composer John Williams—is prevented from enjoying any time in the spotlight. Remember the scene in the Map Room in Raiders? Indy spoke not a word while Williams' music soared, evoking a sense of wonder that this film desperately needs. Still, for all of the cacophonous spectacle and nonsense, Crystal Skull is a blast of old-fashioned matinee fun. While it doesn't hold a candle to that first and greatest chapter, thank goodness it resembles Last Crusade more than the gruesome, wearying Temple of Doom. And there's comfort to be found in the film's conclusions. Spielberg is not the action-adventure director he once was, but he has matured in his convictions. He once celebrated individualistic dreamers, men and boys who abandoned their families for adventure. More recently, he's been guiding his adventurers home, teaching them to shoulder their responsibility and discover the rewards of relationship. After so many years of recklessness, perhaps that aging archaeologist will find some room for family and fidelity under that old fedora. His treasure ""belongs in a museum.""

"May 20, 2008"," Although the title of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is imposingly big, producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg’s first installment in the adventure saga since 1989’s The Last Crusade is, in many respects, disappointingly diminutive. That smallness is most pronounced with regard to imagination, which is in short supply throughout this yarn involving Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford), here tasked with investigating an alien-ish crystal skull and its connection to the lost Mayan city of gold, El Dorado, in 1957. Nineteen years after finding the Holy Grail, the famed archaeologist and “part-time” professor is older but, frustratingly, virtually no different from the gallant man who rode off into the sunset at last film’s conclusion, save for the fact that, just as Ford’s irresistible on-screen charm has, during the past two decades, given way to humorless grumpiness, so too has Jones’s cocky rakishness been crushed under the weight of grouchy-faced wrinkles. First seen as a prisoner of communist Ruskies who want him to locate a mysterious object hidden in an Area 51 warehouse, Indy quips that escaping won’t be “as easy as it used to be.” Unfortunately, he’s full of it, as verified by his subsequent derring-do, accomplished with such cartoonish painlessness that one wonders if steroids have become the hero’s primary nutritional supplement. This isn’t to argue that a 65-year-old Indy should be frail and feeble, but rather to demand that Ford’s advanced age—which has long made the sensibility of this sequel debatable—be addressed in more than half-hearted ways. That Indy hasn’t lost a step is an increasingly prominent facet of Crystal Skull, typified by a sequence in which he leaps into a car full of Russian soldiers and easily cold-cocks them all, though this vision of herculean strength has far less impact than a preceding image of a more vulnerable Indy jumping from a speeding car onto the back of a motorcycle and almost disastrously missing the mark. Nonetheless, whereas Indy still boasts the physicality of a 30-year-old, he now has the demeanor of a crotchety grandpa. What happened to the contagious intellectual curiosity and boyish enthusiasm that propelled his globe-spanning quests for mythological artifacts? In screenwriter David Koepp’s Cold War story, Jones—assisted, and then betrayed, by Ray Winstone’s bland sidekick Mac, and later accompanied by John Hurt’s wacko Professor Oxley—travels from America to the jungles of Peru in search of the titular item wearing the same furrowed brow and grimace, nearly all the self-deprecating humor and joy and diversity of emotion that made him a compelling spelunker replaced by sourpuss crankiness. Crystal Skull combines the supernatural elements of Temple of Doom with the familial dynamics of The Last Crusade, and Lucas and Spielberg work hard trying to recapture the giddy, pulpy magic that defined their prior Jones escapades. Alas, there’s more zip found in Temple of Doom’s Shanghai nightclub opening than in this film’s entirety, as it struggles mightily to generate high-flying verve from scenarios that vacillate between moderately rollicking and derivative. This latter quality is particularly depressing—did Spielberg really think it inspired to stage a fencing-match variation of the car-straddling stunt from Footloose?—and is amplified by the fact that, instead of developing character relationships or concocting ingenious feats for Indy to perform, the director piles on allusions to the franchise’s previous entries. From the participation of Karen Allen as Raiders of the Lost Ark’s feisty Marion, to Indy quoting himself (“I think you just brought a knife to a gunfight”), to the sight of the Ark of the Covenant and hands pulling levers in cave holes, to the ooga-booga natives and Indy’s plummet over waterfalls, freak-out over snakes and wistful glances at pictures of dearly departed Dad, the filmmakers often reduce the entire affair to a “remember that?” trifle which places a premium on nostalgia over invention. At times, Crystal Skull proves that it can classically rock, and an automotive chase through and around the Yale campus has some especially ecstatic get-up-and-go. As with Live Free or Die Hard, however, computerized spectacle undercuts one of the series’s basic pleasures: the woundable humanity of its protagonist. CG allows Spielberg unfettered creative freedom to stage whatever he pleases, but the result is that Indy is occasionally thrust into situations so outlandishly dangerous that his eventual survival becomes a joke. FX-aided craziness transforms him from a man into a superman, which means that it turns him into just another indestructible comic-book character—and that, in the end, isn’t much at all. Indy takes his fair share of punches, notably during a bout of fisticuffs while surrounded by giant carnivorous ants, but there’s no inkling that, even with the extra mileage under his hood, he’s anything less than unbreakable, or his success is in doubt. A predetermined happy ending is, of course, inherent to countless heroic stories like this. Still, Crystal Skull never comes up with a show-stopping moment—such as, say, Indy being trapped on a rope bridge over a grand canyon—that’s jaw-droppingly awesome enough to obscure the absence of genuine, the-bad-guys-might-win tension. As it focuses on Indy’s partnership with a young Brando-wannabe greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), who, unsurprisingly, turns out to be his offspring, Crystal Skull stands as the latest Spielberg tale interested in fathers and sons. More crucial, though, is that it’s his most meager meditation on that topic to date, both narratively—Koepp’s script hardly tries to hide the kinship between its two main characters, and then barely exploits it—and visually. The director employs an inordinate amount of tight close-ups and medium shots that fail to provide the action with adequate breathing room, and the lasting impression is that Spielberg is attempting to mask the reality that large chunks of the movie have been filmed on blatantly phony-looking sets (the most egregious being a spooky cemetery) or on green screens. Whereas its predecessors conveyed expansive wonder and excitement, these proceedings feel constricted and, consequently, undersized. When Spielberg does sporadically aim for larger-than-life iconography, he triumphs—an intro silhouette of Indy donning his trademark fedora is fantastic, as is a panorama of the character gazing at a nuclear mushroom cloud. However, just as CG frequently renders set pieces rubbery and insubstantial, so too does the artificiality of many locations hinder any sense of sweeping, epic scale. While Temple of Doom has long been derided (even by Spielberg himself) for its over-the-top fantasticality and hellish darkness, the film’s willingness to throw caution to the wind was enlivening. That admirable impulse sporadically pops up in Crystal Skull, but its manifestation is usually more embarrassing than thrilling, never more so than when, after becoming entangled in jungle vines, Mutt—embodied by LaBeouf with winning impertinence and pluckiness—gazes into the eyes of a monkey with a similar greaser hairstyle, then swings through the trees like a video game Tarzan, and then commands his new primate pals, apparently telepathically, to attack Russian villains. Psychic abilities certainly figure into the plans of dominatrix-ish villainess Irina Spalko (a pleasurably campy, if one-note, Cate Blanchett), who believes the skull will grant Mother Russia the power Americans fear most from communism: the ability to infiltrate both body and mind. Yet while this balancing of the supernatural and the historical is shrewd, equilibrium is a condition all too rarely achieved by the bloated Crystal Skull, which eventually sacrifices charming interpersonal drama—whether concerning contentious Indy and Mutt, or bickering Indy and Marion—at the altar of Lucas-style childishness (see: recurring animal reaction shots) and, worse, hackneyed science fiction that plays like Close Encounters of the Third Kind via Alien vs. Predator.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2008"," In an early scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" Indy remarks that trouncing the villains isn't going to be as easy as it used to be, an obvious poke at the prospect of 65-year-old Harrison Ford still slugging it out with the bad guys. But he may as well be speaking of the anxieties of his dual patriarchs, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It's been 27 years since Indiana Jones first cracked his whip onscreen in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and nearly two decades since the last installment of the franchise, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The first three Indiana Jones movies came out in a pre-""Spider Man,"" pre-""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" pre-""Iron Man"" world. Today the serialized blockbuster rules the box office, with each entry outdoing the last in terms of hype, special effects and pure bombast. The stakes are much higher now, and audiences, whether new to the franchise or aglow with warm memories of the old films, will be expecting much more. Shrewdly, Lucas and Spielberg (Lucas executive-produced and Spielberg directed, but both filmmakers' consciousnesses are clearly at work) meet those expectations by strictly hewing to the established structure of the earlier movies and not attempting to outdo either their previous efforts or their contemporary competition. That there is an outer-space theme to ""The Crystal Skull"" seems fitting, as the movie confirms the idea that Indiana Jones exists in its own, alternate universe, impervious to the passage of time or box office trends, with its own unique logic and rules. Indy World is a place you can visit again and again, where nothing ever really changes, and, as this latest tour affirms, after two hours you'll be quite ready to go home. All the familiar signposts are here: the retro, B-movie opening set piece; the old-timey graphic of a map charting Indy's travels; the winking references to past films. Ever since the second installment (""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") the movies have been doubly referential, harking both to the pulpy action-adventure, spy and horror films of the 1930s and '40s, and to their own source material. From our first glimpse of Indy (Harrison Ford) in ""The Crystal Skull,"" seen as a larger-than-life shadow wearing that now-iconic hat, the filmmakers miss no opportunity to put us in an Indiana state of mind, hitting the familiar notes (the whip, a quip, even the snake phobia) early and hard. This time Lucas and Spielberg add additional tips of the fedoras to their own greatest hits. The opening sequence, with 1950s teenagers drag-racing in the Nevada desert, recalls Lucas's ""American Graffiti."" Later Indy says ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" echoing the ""Star Wars"" series, and the film's denouement heavy-handedly mimics ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Coherent plots have always been secondary to the action in the series. That said, this one feels particularly unnecessarily hokey and complex. As in past installments, the back story is explained by Jones in passages of leaden exposition that slow the action to a halt. In ""The Crystal Skull"" the characters stop, the good professor mouths some mystic mumbo jumbo about ancient civilizations and purloined antiquities, everyone nods, and then they're off again to battle Soviet bad guys or contend with a swarm of flesh-eating ants. The story line concerns Indy's attempts to locate the skull of the title, which allegedly contains supernatural powers, before a band of villainous cold war Soviets gets it, and return it to its rightful home deep in a South American jungle. (It's interesting to trace the films' treatment of the civic-minded archaeologist's handling of antiquities. In the earlier films he insisted the looted artifacts belong in museums, but here, perhaps in response to recent controversies about real-world museums' ill-gotten collections, the emphasis is on returning the pieces to their native lands.) A certain political correctness pervades this story on the whole; the xenophobia so rampant in the past movies (especially ""Temple of Doom,"" with its monkey-brain-eating Indians) has been considerably toned down (though there are still too many grunting natives), and the anti-Orientalism of the first two films, in which almost every villain had a turban and a thick, generic Middle Eastern accent, has been completely jettisoned. But the West Is Best jingoism remains; Indiana taunts the Soviet evildoers by sneering ""I like Ike."" Cate Blanchett, as icily evil villainess Irina Spalko, is largely wasted in a severe black bob and unflattering khaki jumpsuit, but the female roles in general are the biggest improvement over the previous films. Karen Allen, as Indy's long-ago love interest Marion Ravenswood, had a nicely tart tongue in ""Raiders"" but spent much of that film screaming for Indy to save her (as did her successors). Here she is actually competent, if rather subdued, expertly steering a tank through the jungle and keeping the shrieking to a minimum. Shia LaBeouf acquits himself, without making a huge impression, as Indy's son Mutt. (No young actor will measure up to River Phoenix as young Indy in ""The Last Crusade."") Ford does nothing to embarrass himself (though an unfortunate scene where he bickers with Allen over what went wrong in their relationship is cringe-worthy). If all the participants seem at a slight ironic remove from the material, it's just another way the film stays true to the original. The serial has always been entirely straightforward about its slick shallowness and its reliance on archetype and cliché. Spielberg is an efficient, consummately competent director, and the action sequences deliver exactly what's promised, if nothing more. If there are no gasp-worthy moments of suspense or derring-do, there is an economy of bloodshed and gunfire that speaks to the filmmakers' inventiveness. In other words, the flesh-eating ants are just gross enough. It's hard to say which audience will be better suited to this latest installment. Established Indy fans may find nostalgia clouding their ability to accurately judge ""The Crystal Skull"" in the context of the first films, but young viewers who are unfamiliar with the first three will miss a lot of the jokes and may wonder what the fuss is about, especially compared to more sophisticated fare. Like Norma Desmond in ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Indy is still big; it's just that, in the new world of movie franchises, ""The Crystal Skull"" feels smaller.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2008"," INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL has been a long time in coming and, as it turns out, more than worth the wait. This return to the old-fashioned action/adventure/fantasy genre is more than an homage to those implausible but irresistible serials of yore, it’s more than a superb revisiting of the homage lobbed by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg back in the 1980s, it’s one of the most exhilarating films of the summer, possibly the year. Don’t let the fluff fool you, it may be strictly for fun, but it’s done with wit, charm, and enough wry irascibility to make it a two-hour thrill-ride that never lets up and never lets its audience down. It’s everything it needs to be for the sake of continuity with what came before, everything the audience wants it to be for the sake of wish-fulfillment, but it still manages deliver the unexpected in almost every frame of film. As for instance, expectations about the major surprises that aren’t in the new character of Mutt, played with sleek, pompadoured, anti-establishment attitude by Shia LeBeouf. Fans of the series will have figured out what he’s doing there from a plethora of cues, including his nickname and one of the ladies in the cast. Wisely, all concerned have seen the wisdom and necessity of letting Indy age as gracefully as Harrison Ford, the actor who embodies him, has over the last 19 years. He may grayer, he may be a bit slower, but this tenured professor of archeology is also still out there on the trail of exotic artifacts and even more exotic adventure. It includes the new sidekick, an old girlfriend, a dashing colleague with uncertain alliances (Ray Winstone), and another, stuffier colleague (John Hurt) whose encounter with the crystal skull has caused him to go over the deep end then some, though Indy prefers to see it as making him interesting for the first time in his life. Screen introductions are serious business here. Indy’s first appearance is presaged by the hat, then the shadowy outline, and then there’s the man himself, just removed from the trunk of a car by a phalanx of Commies but still wisecracking his disdain with his preternatural sense of confidence in his own ability to save the day. Obviously snakes aren’t involved here, but Area 51 is, and so are a troop of crack KGB agents on the trail of something with which to control the world (of course). They’re led by Col. Spalko (Cate Blanchett), the Soviet psychic apparat-chick in charge of the operation. She may be minx-like in looks, sporting a Louise Brooks bob and serious eye makeup, but she’s also tough enough to keep up with Indy without breaking a sweat through the deepest darkest reaches of the Amazon basin, tracking him and the eponymous crystal skull that is the key to both world domination and the story at hand. LeBeouf’s first entrance is equally memorable, with him throttling onscreen riding a motorcycle and channeling Marlon Brando in THE WILD ONE with such precision that the audacity of it all is simply breathtaking. Reedy where Brando was lithe, LeBeouf nonetheless has channeled Brando’s essence of rebellion and transmuted it into his own. It’s not the only call-out to classic cinema, all of which are done with equal aplomb. The first scenes of a military convey in the desert being buzzed by a convertible full of kids, for example, evokes AMERICAN GRAFFITI without straining the reference to fit as Elvis rocks and prarie dogs, which may or may not be a reference to Ewoks, scamper. No Indy film is complete without a dazzling array of special effects to add their own special dimension. The ones here don’t disappoint. They’re fiendishly clever, not relying on the mere spectacle of mountaintops that reinvent themselves. There are also things like the door to a long-lost chamber that doesn’t so much open as disassemble itself with a nifty mechanical precision. Ditto no Indy film complete without whopping action sequences, and these don’t disappoint either, with chases building to ever more dizzying stakes and convoluted situations. The action never lets up as Indy does battle with the ci-mentioned Soviets, an atom bomb (as well as the indignities of the post-blast scrub-down), the FBI, the paranoia of the Cold War, and a snake. There has to be at least one involved just for the sheer enjoyment of watching a man who can save the day no matter what show off that one chink in his otherwise impeccable armor. There’s a light touch to all this popcorn-chomping, adrenalin-pumping fun, but if one wanted to, one could note the parallels to today as guilt-by-association and questions of patriotism become just so much fodder for what one character terms the charged political climate, the one that costs Indy his university job early on. It’s that dash of reality injected into all the fantasy that is the touchstone giving an nice extra dimension to the fantasy. Indy is no superhero. He is bold, reckless, and really, really smart, but far from perfect. Sure, he’ll save the day eventually, but probably not with his first try or even the second, and therein lies the suspense. That and some particularly nasty South American ants, as well as running into that old flame who isn’t so much carrying a torch for Indy as a metaphorical club to take him down several pegs. As for the villain of the piece, she’s not merely pure evil, she’s got a thirst for knowledge that is of Faustian proportions, hence, and unlike our man Indy, she is willing to sell her soul and anyone else’s for it, no matter what the price. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is a formula film, there is no getting around it, but a formula film refined to a brilliant quintessence, reminding one and all why the formula was written to begin with.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2008"," Indy’s back! After nearly two decades, he dons his famous fedora, snaps his bullwhip and delivers punches that still pack enough of a wallop to clinch this summer’s biggest blockbuster.
The fantasy-adventure begins in 1957 in the New Mexico desert, where Indy and his pal Mac (Ray Winstone) are pursued by villainous Soviet agents led by contemptuous parapsychologist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). After surviving an atomic bomb, Indy discovers he’s lost his teaching position at Marshall College (filmed on the Yale campus in New Haven) because he’s ‘under government suspicion.’ That’s when he meets motorcycle-riding, switchblade-toting Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf, channeling Marlon Brando/James Dean), who carries a message imploring the adventurous archeologist to search for the legendary Crystal Skull of Akator, which the Russians also covet. In the Peruvian jungle, along with the mysterious Mayan Skull, Indy finds his “Raiders of the Lost Ark” flame, irrepressible Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), whom he’d jilted at the altar. Plot-wise, that’s all you need to know. Let the surprises unfold.
Conceived by George Lucas, written by David Koepp, directed by Steven Spielberg, and punctuated by John Williams’ music, it’s far-fetched, fast-paced fun. Middle-aged Harrison Ford is a bit mellower but he’s still an intrepid, quick-with-a-quip leading man. All the stylistic Indy touches are there: the map with a moving red line indicating his travels and his inevitable encounter with a snake (a giant Olive Python), plus spectacular swordfights, ravenous red ants, subterranean caverns filled with gold, perilous plunges over waterfalls and lots of monkeys.
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a terrific 10, an awesome, thrill-filled roller-coaster ride that you don’t ever want to stop.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2008","Spielberg hasn't gained more skills as a director, and series creator George Lucas is a shell of the writer he once was, but Kingdom is still an old-fashioned, two-fisted romp through archaeology, the Cold War, pseudo-science and film history.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2008"," “This doesn’t look good,” Harrison Ford says more than once, as he dons his fedora and grabs his bullwhip again to play intrepid archeologist Indiana Jones. “This doesn’t look good,” Harrison Ford says more than once, as he dons his fedora and grabs his bullwhip again to play intrepid archeologist Indiana Jones. Bad guys beware: Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) still packs a punch and so does Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It opens on May 22, 2008. “This doesn’t look good,” Harrison Ford says more than once, as he dons his fedora and grabs his bullwhip again to play intrepid archeologist Indiana Jones. You can hardly blame the guy: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull presents him with everything from carnivorous ants to an atomic bomb – and worst of all, there’s a pesky snake to wrangle. But Indy is wrong this time. In the grander scheme of things, speaking about the movie as a whole, everything looks very good, or mostly so. Expectations have been running high for the belated fourth instalment of this beloved adventure franchise, Indy IV for short, which arrives 19 years after Jones literally rode off into the sunset at the end of Indy III. Moviegoers who count their blessings rather than quibble over details will find their expectations met and possibly exceeded. Indy IV is great fun without necessarily being great cinema. It’s a solid summer blockbuster, in other words. All involved are at the top of their game: director Steven Spielberg, series mastermind George Lucas, screenwriters David Koepp (Spider-Man, Jurassic Park) and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), plus actors both familiar (Ford, Karen Allen) and new to the series (Cate Blanchett, Shia LaBeouf, Ray Winstone and John Hurt). Think of Indy IV as a toy crafted by expert jewellers and you won’t be far off the mark, even if its theme is, on the face of it, anything but child’s play. The story is set in 1957, post-World War II and in the thick of paranoia over the Cold War and “Red Menace,” atomic aggression, McCarthyite witchhunts and celestial visitations from little grey men. Add to this some heavy mythology about supernatural crystal skulls in a temple deep within the South American jungle, and you have a very convoluted plot, one that might leave children (and series newcomers) scratching their non-crystal noggins. But what a joy it is to watch all this talent at work and play. Rather than pretend Indy hasn’t aged a day since he rode off into the sunset at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the story capitalizes on the good humour of Ford, 65, and Allen, 56, reuniting as older and not necessarily wiser versions of the squabbling romancers they played in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the 1981 series debut. They both look great – better than most people their age – and the movie is also a triumph of old-school artistry: Spielberg insisted that most of the heroics be done for real, using stuntmen rather than CGI, so Indy IV retains the same feel as movies made in the pre-digital age. So does the familiar Indiana Jones theme by John Williams, which you will undoubtedly be whistling as you exit the theatre. Yet the film introduces some welcome new faces. LaBeouf, Hollywood’s hot It Boy, is terrific as Mutt, the motorbike-riding and switchblade-snapping greaser who teams with Jones in twin quests for lost friends and family, and also for the meaning of the crystal skulls. LaBeouf would make an excellent successor to Ford, should the Indiana Jones series continue without the original man in the fedora. Blanchett, the lady of a thousand faces and voices, follows her stellar Bob Dylan impersonation of I’m Not There with her sexy sword-swishing portrayal of Russian KGB villainess Irina Spalko, for whom obtaining the crystal skulls is both a matter of career advancement and intellectual curiosity. British journeymen Ray Winstone and John Hurt are good fun in their respective roles of George (Mac) McHale and Professor (Ox) Oxley, old Indy accomplices who get their pal into and out of trouble. The whip doesn’t always snap sharply. As nice as it is to see Allen reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood, who loves both Indy and adventure, her screen time is brief (she doesn’t show up until near the one-hour mark) and her role is awkward and underwritten. There’s also a feeling of déjà vu about the story, partly because it’s the fourth time around for Indy, partly because the best gags have already been used for the trailer and partly because so many similar movie adventurers have followed in Indy’s wake. The second half of Indy IV seems a lot like the second half of the recent National Treasure sequel, and the movie also has some of the campy tone of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. There’s even a nod to Caddyshack in a running gag about curious gophers. But the two previous sequels, Temple of Doom and Last Crusade also seemed less fresh than the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was intended as an homage to 1930s movie serials. For those keeping score at home, I’d rank Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a tie for second place in the series: on a par with Last Crusade and above Temple of Doom, while falling a respectable distance short of the high mark set by Raiders. In short, Indy IV may not be the total triumph that everyone had hoped for, but it’s still great to see a good old friend come around again.

"May 19, 2008","  From the daan-dadaduun-tuun-duun opening notes of its famous John Williams musical score, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" announces itself as a matinee serial cliffhanger-inspired sequel that's built like a brick smokehouse where audiences will be spoon-fed with infectious exuberance.  An amalgamation of ""American Graffiti,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""E.T."" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and nearly every successful adventure movie franchise of the '30s, '40s, and '50s, the movie is dotted with immediately recognizable nostalgic elements that play to the kid in everyone.  Teens drag race their convertible roadster with U.S. Army personnel on a Nevada rural route, circa 1957, before we discover that the military officers and soldiers are actually a team of wily Cold War Russians taking Jones and his intermittently double-crossing sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone) to the Government's notoriously secret Hangar 51 to find the contents of a certain crate. Cate Blanchett channels Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS, as a black-bob-haired Ukrainian commandant named Irina Spalko who chews her vowels like licorice-coated borscht. With a smirk and his whip, Indy turns the giant hangar into a carnival of set piece action before escaping the enclosure to its dubious outer limits. The mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb test explosion tests Indy's survival skills inside a mannequin-populated suburban housing mock-up, and sets up the cartoon action sequences that escalate exponentially. Back in the relatively safe confines of the college he teaches, Jones is fired as a result of an FBI investigation into his loyalty to homeland America. It's not just the Cold War that's breathing down Indy's neck, but McCarthyism to boot. A malt shop meeting with a ""Wild One"" era Brando-inspired motorcycle ""greaser"" named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), convinces Indy that a trip to the jungles of Peru to look for an archeological object of desire, the Crystal Skull of Akator, is in order.  Once there, the newly-bonded duo of Indy and Mutt rescue one very insane Professor Oxley (well played in a squandered supporting role by John Hurt) and obtain the Crystal Skull, which resembles an elongated cranium of the creature from the ""Alien"" movies. Irina and her troops catch scent of the skull that the too desire and offer hot pursuit that fuels a long-running series of eye-popping slapstick chase sequences involving giant ants, a hoard of monkeys, and the dramatic use of one very long snake for rescuing a certain snake-hating hero. With Oxley and the Crystal Skull in tow, our daring trio become four when Mutt's mother Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") is delivered into the story like a romantic reward for Jones, for whom it's clear she is the only woman. Any film school professor will tell you that the easiest way to entertain a film audience is to create a chase scene-they exist in one form or another in almost every movie, regardless of genre. Steven Spielberg's mastery of the chase form layers elements of small and grand scale spectacle in an orchestrated way so that every uptick in speed and obstacle is matched with humor and foreshadowing of things to come. The slaps and tickles arrive with undeniably entertaining sword fights and jumping or falling stunts that delight in a magical way that adventure cinema should.  The filmmaking on display here is so far ahead of quest movies like ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" that it's embarrassing to even mention them in the same breath. The Indiana Jones ensemble of actors, crew, special effects teams, designers and the rest, understand Spielberg's way of reaching into iconic physical elements like a city of gold, or a series of gigantic waterfalls for example, to extract cinematic joy deeply rooted in childish dreams and fantasy.  David Koepp's script may not be a perfect example of balanced exposition and dramaturgy, but it doesn't matter because the message is clear. We love to be taken with our surrogate family of heroes on pretend adventures to unbelievably beautiful and dangerous places where anything is possible, and where the surprises are beyond our wildest imaginations.

"May 19, 2008","On a satisfaction scale, it lands squarely between The Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2008"," You see the hat before the hero - that famous fedora, the one that stays put through every tricky situation, or at least at arm's length for a hasty getaway. And of course he still has the whip, the paralyzing fear of snakes and the catchy John Williams theme song that will surely gnaw at your brain for hours afterward.  Yes, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" dives headfirst into the iconography of the franchise, which will bring a smile to your face and warm you with nostalgia. It's admittedly a pleasure to see Harrison Ford back in the role. Once you get past the initial reintroduction, though, it's obvious that this fourth film in the Indy series really has no idea where to go. Except for the opening - which literally starts the film off with a bang - and a couple of dazzling chase sequences, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is about as unfocused and meandering as the title itself. It's been 19 years since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (which, apparently, was the second-to-last crusade) and 27 years since Steven Spielberg introduced us to the intrepid, quick-with-a-quip archaeologist Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones. He's grizzled and lined and he knows it, and he knows we know it - at 65, Ford is old enough to pay the senior citizen price for a ticket to his own summer blockbuster - but he certainly seems up for the challenge. Or at least his stunt double does. Instead of the breathless action of previous films, though, this one gets draggy and repetitive in the middle, with Indy and Co. traipsing through various tombs, searching by torchlight for clues to the origin of the mysterious and powerful Crystal Skull of Akator. (What the thing is, or what it does, doesn't really matter. It is the MacGuffin, as they say. But it does look eerily like Larry King.) The fear that fanboys have long held is justified: that technology unavailable during the first three Indy movies would make this one look slick and fake. That's especially true during the protracted, messy climax. But even before that, everything feels so glossy and detached that there's never reason to believe the peril is real - it all lacks the tactile feel of, say, a giant ball bearing down, a wobbly rope bridge groaning over a chasm or horseback chase through a dusty canyon. Spielberg fashioned part one, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" as a fun and funny, rough-and-tumble homage to action-adventure pictures of the 1930s and '40s. It's still a classic that holds up beautifully today, and is far and away the best of the franchise. ""Crystal Skull"" (someone's gotta shorten that title) feels like an homage to Spielberg himself: sort of a prequel to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" with a dash of ""Duel"" and the daddy issues that have permeated most of his movies. (Spielberg directs from a script by David Koepp and a story by Jeff Nathanson and old friend George Lucas, who's also an executive producer.) There are other not-so-subtle film references, like when Shia LaBeouf enters on a motorcycle, decked out in leather and an off-kilter hat to look exactly like Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" Cate Blanchett, meanwhile, plays a villainous Soviet agent with the thick accent of Natasha from the old ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" cartoons. Both allusions are time-appropriate, though. ""Crystal Skull"" begins in 1957 Nevada, with Indy and his partner Mac (Ray Winstone) trying to escape from the Soviets who've kidnapped them. Blanchett's fearsome Irina Spalko wants them to locate the crystal skull within Area 51 for some kind of nefarious mind-control plan involving alien intelligence (a long-standing Spielberg subject). A former colleague of Indy's, Professor Oxley (John Hurt), also was after the skull - and went missing in pursuit of it. LaBeouf's young tough Mutt Williams tracks Indy down and pleads with him to help find their mutual friend, which sends the two on a quest to determine the purpose behind the mystical artifact and keep it out of the wrong hands. Mutt's significance, though, will be immediately obvious to everyone but Indy, especially when Karen Allen shows up as sharp-tongued old flame Marion Ravenwood from ""Raiders."" LaBeouf, a Spielberg favorite, does just fine opposite Ford in a physically demanding role and is clearly and deservedly being groomed for great things; meanwhile, seasoned actors like Blanchett, Hurt and Winstone go to waste in one-note parts. But the film's interpersonal relationships and revelations should matter - they should give the film heart and weight as they did with Sean Connery's lovably goofy presence as Jones' father in ""Last Crusade."" Here, they feel like a given, a blip, a speed bump on the way to bigger and more spectacular set pieces involving waterfalls or machine-gun fire or giant ants in the Peruvian jungle. And if there's not much in the way of emotional investment, there's even less humor. The cheekiness that made Indy so charming - the swagger and the sarcasm - are long since gone. Much of what made the character so compelling, beyond the adventures he took us on, was the fact that he seemed like an entertaining guy to hang out with, or at least one who would be consistently unpredictable.

"May 19, 2008"," Indiana Jones was born on a beach; quite literally, he was the result of a need to escape for his producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg. A new kind of hero who was the old kind of hero, and just as their instincts had proven right on films as different as Star Wars and Jaws, so Indiana Jones came to be a huge hit; a wry, warm antidote to the dark anti-heroes of the ’70s. After the relatively quick one-two-three of the original trilogy, there then came the massive hiatus that brings us, after 19 long years, to the latest. The delay caused trepidation among the fans but, though there'll be those who disagree, the finished, and most likely final, instalment in the Indy saga is a minor triumph plucked from the jaws of disappointment. Indy is older, the old chemistry takes some time to reconfigure fully, and the thrill of where Indy might take us in a globe made smaller by the worldwide web and cheap airline travel has diminished. But Spielberg hasn't diluted the integrity of his keynote character. Indy IV preserves Jones' core credentials, celebrating his intelligence, his urbanity and his stubborn, scholarly kick-arse cool. The story, too, cleaves close to the usual format: 1) the pulse-racing opening scenario, 2) the back-to-Marshall-College pause for breath, 3) the accidental treasure trail – because Indy is never so vulgar as to go looking for riches on purpose – and 4) the jackpot final highway, an exciting 45-minute rollercoaster that may test your credulity but never your attention span. The difference, though, is that – as promised – Spielberg has changed his palette, taking Indy from 1938 to 1957 in real time and switching the gaudy, Republic serial-inspired glow of the original movies for a beautiful, pastel-hued ’50s look. Cast-wise, it's impeccable, but here's where the debits creep in. Though it seems on page to be an ensemble piece, Indy 4 is a crowded place where Jones comes first and everyone else follows. The upside of this is that Cate Blanchett and the excellent LaBeouf have a fantastic opportunity to play villain and sidekick respectively. The downside is that great character actors such as Ray Winstone and John Hurt don't have anything to play except hamstrung expositional roles. And similarly, with such great actors, it's a shame that the added effects don't always match what's actually there: as Peter Jackson proved with the wayward dinosaur chase in King Kong, CG spectacle can detract if there's no valid danger, and though there are squirmy scenes, Indy 4 struggles to find its peril level. But the question is whether this is a real Indy movie, and the answer is a resounding yes. At 65, Harrison Ford isn't the whippersnapper he was, and maybe the opening athletic chase scene is a little too much to expect from him, but when he's punching big, bad Russkies on the nose, Ford hits the spot in more ways than one. He may be a little off on some of his comic timing, and the rekindled-romance subplot won't work for younger viewers – and, hey, neither will the “I like Ike” gag – but this is Indy as back in our world as he'll ever be. It's hard to conceive of another contemporary film that would please so many people today, but that's what Indiana Jones movies always did and what this one does right now. It won't change your life but, if you're in the right frame of mind, it will change your mood: you might wince, you might groan, you might beg to differ on the big, silly climax, but you'll never stop smiling. Think of Indy as an escape, which is all he was ever meant to be, and all he was ever really meant to help us do.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2008"," It has been closing in on twenty years since our hero, Indy (Harrison Ford), thwarted the diabolical Nazi plot to steal the Ark of the Lost Covenant. It is now 1955 and the Commies have replaced Hitler’s henchmen as the world’s bad guys. The Soviets are searching for a mysterious artifact that will give them world domination and it is up to our hero and a few good friends to save the day in “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Nineteen years after his last adventure, the bullwhipping archeological professor is kidnapped by Russian Officer Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") who needs his top secret knowledge to progress her paranormal research. Indy's old colleague Mac (Ray Winstone, ""The Departed,"" ""Fool's Gold"") warns the Russkies 'You don't know him!' and sure enough, Spalko's interference throws together ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" This long awaited followup is perhaps the most highly anticipated movie of the summer, but although it certainly produces the goods it also suffers from one of director Steven Spielberg's most common flaws - not knowing when to quit. Harrison Ford's age was anticipated to be the weak point here but he's more than up to bringing back an older but still spry and wry Indy and the forth installment has been lovingly crafted to resemble the old serial films it was based on (albeit given a 1957 polish), but some of the action sequences go on so long they become repetitive and Indy's reunion with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), which should be the heart of the film, has all the depth of a comic book. Spielberg lets us know right off the bat that we're not in the forties anymore, beginning with a group of teenagers racing down a desert road in a convertible, Elvis's ""Hound Dog"" blaring on the radio. They engage a U.S. military vehicle, with some suspiciously non-American looking soldiers, in a drag race, before that vehicle and its convoy turn off towards a remote Army barracks. Guards are gunned down, a trunk opened and an iconic hat hits the pavement. Indy's ordered to locate a crate of specific dimensions in an iconic warehouse with sliding doors labeled '51.' This leads to some nifty business where Indy employees gunpowder and bullets for their magnetic effects to locate the shrouded corpse of a certain famous alien before a terrifically staged escape sequence that features a glimpse of *the* Ark, an experimental vehicle that jet propels into the desert and an ill-timed entrance into a nuclear test site. If only the rest of the film lived up to its opening. Returning to University, Indy learns he's been put on indefinite leave by Dean Stanforth (Jim Broadbent, ""Moulin Rouge!,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" Denholm Elliot's successor) because of F.B.I. suspicions of collusion with the Commies. Bitter, Indy's about to leave the country when he's stopped by Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, ""Disturbia,"" ""Transformers""), a young man who fashions himself after Marlon Brando in ""The Wild Ones,"" who says his mother, Mary, sent him for help. Seems he's the ward of Indy's old colleague Professor 'Ox' Oxley (John Hurt, ""The Skeleton Key,"" ""V for Vendetta"") who has sent a mysterious missive which may or may not indicate he's lost his mind. This, is, of course, a puzzle pointing towards the titular crystal skull and its kingdom, so after a soda fountain fight staged for its era and a motorcycle chase through the school, Indy and Mutt are off to Peru (signalled with signature plane flying over map, route animated in red). After some typical spider-webby, hidden wall, live skeleton scenarios, the duo run back into the Russians and are brought to meet Ox where Indy also discovers that Mutt's mother Mary is really Marion and that Mutt is, of course, his son. Screenwriter David Koepp (""Jurassic Park,"" ""The War of the Worlds""), working from the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson (""The Terminal,"" ""Rush Hour 3"") hits all the signature marks. There's a beaut of a sequence where Indy and Mutt fight the Russians for possession of the skull straddling vehicles racing through the rain forest and Mutt earns his stripes by getting hung up in vines only to rejoin the fight Tarzan style. He also turns in his switchblade for a fencing sword (Mutt's bullwhip? The film's final sequence literally passes the hat.) But there's also the bit where Marion drives their WWII amphibious truck duck over a cliff and they survive not one, but three massive waterfalls with nary a scratch nor any real feeling of danger. The final adventure sequence is well staged with some nice special effects and homage to ""Raiders"" end, but the film's ending is all wrong, the final capper to the Indy-Marion reunion that's played too broadly, in part due to an over-caffeinated performance from Allen. Ford, on the other hand, is terrific, every bit the Indy of yore. He gets off more than his share of crackling line readings (I just about spit with his retort to Spalko's request to name her origin). Blanchett is also terrific as the film's villainess, a femme fatale in a Louise Brooks bob whose every eyelash is lovingly lighted by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""The Terminal,"" ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly""). Also good is Spielberg protege LaBeouf, a nice rebellious foil for Harrison who obviously has more than a bit of dear old dad in his genes. Even so, as likable as the lad is in the role, I'd no more look forward to a continuation of the series centered on Mutt than I'd want a Henry Jones Sr./Sean Connery spinoff. Broadbent provides warm collegial support, but both Winstone and Hurt are saddled with pretty stock characters. The best thing about this forth installment is its emphasis on education. There's a running joke about Mutt's having dropped out of school which Indy supports until he learns he's the lad's father and it turns out that the Mayan word for 'Gold' has another, richer meaning. In short, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" may not be the film that ""Ark"" was, but its (few) disappointments are overridden by the sheer joy of seeing Indy in action once again. It may have been less than 20 years for Indy but it is 27 years for us since we were first roused by John Williams now famous score and the action-packed antics of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., bullwhip and revolver in hand. Is the world ready for an older, though not much gentler, Indiana, as he sets out to stop the nefarious Commie plot and restore the titular object to its rightful place? It sure is! Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, George Lucas and all pony up to the bar once again with a new Indy adventure that pushes all the appropriate buttons and delivers all the elements that made us love the first film (but not so much “IJ 2&3”). Just like the first, action is the key in this fourth installment of the lucrative franchise with a tremendously complex and thrilling chase through the Amazon jungles as the film’s set piece. Homage, such as the expected snake, is well paid to “Indy 1.” Jonesd is joined by a whole bunch of new faces to the series and one from the original. Karen Allen returns as tough and resourceful Marion Ravenwood whom Henry has not seen for nearly two decades. This time, she has some information that she has kept from Indy all these years ­ he’s a daddy. Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is, like his mom, tough, resourceful and is skilled with using a switchblade. Together, they must thwart Russian Dr. Irana Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and her heavily armed followers as they seek the secret of the fabulous crystal skull that could give the baddies unlimited power. Wry humor, kitchy dialogue, fast-paced action, seamless special F/X, solid acting and homage to its original are all good reasons to see “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”. I rate it the best of the sequels ­ kind of like “Rocky Balboa.""",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2008"," While it definitely had its moments and plenty of nods to the fans, there was also more ridiculousness than we've ever seen in an Indiana Jones film.  Reviewing the first Indiana Jones movie to be released in 20 years and directed by Steven Spielberg is not something I take lightly. It's no secret that I haven't exactly been fired up for this film or a big cheerleader for it (our writer Niall has taken that upon himself here at Screen Rant), but I truly hoped it would be great even if I didn't think it would be.   From the start it seemed like they were doing things right with the opening credits matching the style of the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, and with the Paramount logo fading into a similarly styled mound of dirt. However I actually cringed when the writers credit appeared and one of the two names was George Lucas.   It opened up on a scene out in the Nevada desert that established right away the time period of the film with a bunch of 1950's teenagers out racing their 32 Ford painted with flames. They come upon a military convoy and a bit of a race ensues that although the movie has just started, seems weirdly out of place. Shortly thereafter the tone changes to classic Indiana Jones and I'll admit that I got a bit of a rush from seeing the scene in the trailer where Harrison first picks up his hat in its full context.   This time the villains are Communist Russians instead of Nazis, and they too are after some artifact that will give them ultimate power. We end up at a very familiar storage facility the first test of whether Harrison Ford can still pull off the role kicks off.   As a matter of fact he portrays the character quite well and with more confidence than Jones displayed in the previous three films. It works because it seems he's been ""adventuring"" for the entire time that has passed since we've last seen him.   Despite his age, the sequences are almost believable and at the end of the scene we get to see just how ""buff"" Ford is in the film, making it a bit easier to suspend our disbelief.   From there however it gets pretty decent again as we meet Shia Lebouf's ""young tough"" character, who seeks out Dr. Jones in order to save his mother and older family friend. Shia does a very decent job in the film and is enjoyable to watch. They were wise to not write him as a wide-eyed ""Indy Jr."" in training.   One of the enjoyable things about the film are the many ""hat tips"" to the earlier films that real fans of the first three films will notice. I'm pretty sure that repeat viewings will expose more that the viewer may miss the first time around. In once scene we see a familiar artifact, and in another there's a funny role reversal regarding Indy's and ""Mutt's"" (yes, that's the name of Shia's character) escape from some bad guys which compares to a scene between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.   It was also great to see Karen Allen back in the familiar role. Of course she's much older now but she still had that familiar sparkle. It's too bad they didn't make better use of her in the film.   There were a few moments that will charge you up, mainly due to the familiar John Williams music and the unique sound effects attached to anyone getting punched and the good old whip. But then there are other things that are laughable, and I don't mean in a way that they intended to make you laugh. One of them involves Shia in the jungle (I won't spoil it) and a big one is just who the mystery is about.   So in the end, will audiences like this? Yeah, I'm pretty sure they will. Should they have left well enough alone and not milked the franchise for another film? That's a tougher question - I can see how it could have been really great and I would LOVE to know what the original screenplay for this was like. If they make another one and bring the action and story a bit more down to earth it might actually turn out even better than this one.

"May 18, 2008"," That's the sound of Indiana Jones engaging in fisticuffs with the villains in his first new adventure in nineteen years and while some blows hit their target there's no knock-out, killer WOW punch. To be sure, there are scenes galore of derring-do and, let's be clear, no special effect is better than Harrison Ford (lookin' fit and able at the bus pass age of 65) as Indy, when he whips out his bull-whip. But we don't see enough of that iconic glint in Indy's eye. Not enough jokes, and while the stunts are clever there's a sense that we've seen a lot of them before, probably in all the movies that copied the original Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark. While there's fun to be had at this new film, there were moments when I thought, like some of Indy's archaeological finds, it probably should have remained as a museum piece. And I say that as a huge fan of the the original Raiders film, and as someone who moved at break-neck speed down the Croisette in Cannes, where the film was having it's first public screening anywhere in the world yesterday afternoon and a gala premiere last night, to make certain I got a good seat in the 1500 seater Palais de Festival auditorium. There's some amusing stuff early on in the film, set in the Cold war age of the late 1950s, when Indy, or Dr Henry Jones Jr, if you will, confronts soviet agent Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko at a US desert base in Nevada. There's a good bit of banter between Indy, Spalko and Ray Winstone's conniving double agent in the first half an hour and then we meet the reigning young heart-throb (if we're to believe the results an an Orange Bafta most popular young movie star poll) Shia LaBeouf who arrives on a motorbike looking like the most obvious homage to Marlon Brando and James Dean. I guess the marketing chiefs at Paramount Pictures (it is they who make most artistic and commercial decisions) felt some youth appeal was needed to draw in younger movie-goers. Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in 1981 and the last Indy movie, The Last Crusade hit screens 19 years ago, so there's a whole generation of kids who never saw the movies on the big screen and know about Indy through videos and DVDs. Those kids go and see movies where action moves at warp speed. I can't deny there's a certain old-fashioned appeal in seeing a lean and mean action star burst back onto the screen as a much beloved movie character but you'd have thought that 19 years was enough time to come up with a top-of-the-line script that absolutely demanded our attention for two hours. A couple of the set pieces are fabulous - a sword fight on speeding trucks between LaBeouf's Mutt and Blanchett's Spalko plus there's an edge of your seat moment involving killer red ants. I remember being very excited by Karen Allen's no-nonsense heroine Marion Ravenwood in Raiders and she's back with a tale to tell about a secret she's been carrying these past twenty odd years and I suspect all of you movie geeks out there know what the secret is but I'm not going to spoil it for those who don't.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2008"," 
Nineteen years is a long time to wait, a long time in which expectations can be fertilized and grow. The biggest challenges faced by Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull have less to do with entertaining an audience than competing with the ghosts of movies past and expanding the mythology of a character who has been out of the limelight for two decades. Perhaps it is too much to hope that this new movie, coming so long after its predecessors, might recapture the magic that infused Raiders of the Lost Ark and sporadically sputtered to the surface in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The latest effort is the most lifeless of the series, and feels more like an overplotted, confused reunion than a legitimate action/adventure outing. It would be a failure even without the impressive pedigree - Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull simply isn't a very good motion picture.
 
Still, good or bad, everyone will see it. But the film doesn't work on the most basic level where even The Temple of Doom succeeded: getting viewers on the edges of their seats. That's not to say the film is without action; it features a number of such sequences. But a key element is missing: excitement. There's no suspense and not a lot of energy. We never believe that Indy or a member of his entourage is in danger. There's never any sense of ""How's he going to get out of this?"" The cliffhangers are easily shrugged off. The reason to see The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not to rediscover the joy and thrills of the Indiana Jones of old but to connect with familiar friends. This movie is comfortable, and that's the problem. It's too comfortable. For George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Harrison Ford, it's a matter of putting on well-worn slippers and bathrobes. The result is a sloppily made opportunity to spend a few more hours with a character who has put on a lot more years and miles since the last time we encountered him in a darkened theater.
 
The curtain rises in 1957 Nevada, where a captive Indy (Ford) and his latest sidekick, Mac (Ray Winstone), have been taken by a Soviet squad led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). She leads them into a huge warehouse where all the American military secret artifacts are stored (including, as we see in a ""cameo,"" the Lost Ark from Raiders). There's something she wants and Indy is expected to locate it for her. An escape later, Dr. Jones is back in class teaching about the wonders of archeology to his students. That's when Dean Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) informs him that he's being given a mandatory leave of absence. Before he can get out of Dodge, however, he is cornered by a twenty-something guy named ""Mutt"" (Shia LeBeouf). The leather-jacketed Guys and Dolls reject needs Indy's help to find Professor Oxley (John Hurt), who has gotten mixed up in a treasure hunt involving crystal skulls and the Lost City of Gold. Soon, Indy and Mutt are on their way to South America, where their paths cross with Spalko and her Soviet comrades and a figure from Indy's past - the irrepressible Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).
 
In bringing back Marion, at least The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull does one thing right. She and Ford exhibit a little of the same chemistry, although the sexual element is toned down significantly now that they're old enough to be grandparents. The screenplay also makes frequent and pointed references to Indy's age. There's never any pretence that this guy isn't ready to start collecting Social Security, and the character of Mutt is added as a way by which the series can continue. Although numerous ""old friends"" are missing, each has an analog of sorts. Marcus Brody, portrayed by the late Denholm Elliott, is no longer around, so Jim Broadbent's Dean Stanforth fills his place. Sallah, who helped Indy in Chapters One and Three, is left off the screen (reportedly due to ""unreasonable"" salary demands by John Rhys-Davies), so enter Ray Winstone's Mac. Finally, with Sean Connery electing not to come out of retirement, there's no way to bring back Henry Jones Sr., but John Hurt's Oxley functions in a similar capacity. Everything old is new again, or something like that.
 
Every Indiana Jones adventure has a central action sequence, a ""tent pole"" around which everything else is constructed. In Raiders, it was the segment where Indy hijacks the vehicle in the convoy containing the Ark. In Temple, it was the mine cart ride. In Crusade, it was the tank encounter. There's one in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, as well - a multi-vehicle chase through the jungle that ends with a lot of red ants and an amphibious landing. Unfortunately, not only is the level of tension at an all-time low but the choreography is dubious. The film can't keep track of all the characters so one car disappears for half the chase only to reappear at a critical juncture near the end. The movie contains its share of other action scenes that, while less lavish or extensive, are no more thrilling.
 
As was true of the previous films, this one attempts to balance light comedy with action. The jokiness that occasionally damaged The Last Crusade is more pronounced here with one-liners punctuating the dialogue. There are some clever ones, to be sure, but most are perfunctory. And there are times when things get silly, even for the comic book-inspired calisthenics of Dr. Jones. For an example of this, consider the scene in which Mutt makes like Tarzan and swings from vine to vine on the way to a monkey-accompanied rescue. The movie's decision to add aliens to the mix isn't a problem, especially considering the supernatural underpinnings of the previous installments, but the resultant anticlimax is. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shoots its feeble wad early and stumbles to the finish line with a lot of effects, none of which are special.
 
Still, even considering the poor focus of the screenplay and the lackluster nature of Spielberg's normally sure-handed direction, it's as tough to dislike this movie as it is to champion it. That's because, while nearly everything around him has changed, Ford has no trouble sliding back into the costume and character. His performance sells this as an Indiana Jones movie no matter how much nearly every other aspect of the production cries out ""imitation."" The pleasures to be had from the film, meager though they are at times, are almost all delivered by Ford, and his scenes with Karen Allen bring a long-desired closure to the relationship they initiated nearly 30 years ago. Shia LeBoeuf doesn't show that he has what it takes to fill Ford's shoes but, as a sidekick, he's effective. Mutt could easily have been annoying but he stays in his place.
 
In the end, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull can't be seen as anything other than a very minor chapter in the adventures of one of cinema's most beloved action heroes and a disappointment for those who have waited patiently for his return. George Lucas knows a thing of two about disappointing fans when resurrecting long-dormant franchises, but what he does here is a far worse crime than he perpetrated with Star Wars. In that saga, there was still a story to tell. The episodic nature of this trilogy meant no follow-up was needed. And, if this is the best the filmmakers could come up with, the wisest course would have been to leave movie-goers with their memories.

"May 18, 2008"," ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Say it aloud. The very title causes the pulse to quicken, if you, like me, are a lover of pulp fiction. What I want is goofy action--lots of it. I want man-eating ants, swordfights between two people balanced on the backs of speeding jeeps, subterranean caverns of gold, vicious femme fatales, plunges down three waterfalls in a row, and the explanation for flying saucers. And throw in lots of monkeys. The Indiana Jones movies were directed by Steven Spielberg and written by George Lucas and a small army of screenwriters, but they exist in a universe of their own. Hell, they created it. All you can do is compare one to the other three. And even then, what will it get you? If you eat four pounds of sausage, how do you choose which pound tasted the best? Well, the first one, of course, and then there's a steady drop-off of interest. That's why no Indy adventure can match ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). But if ""Crystal Skull"" (or ""Temple of Doom"" from 1984 or ""Last Crusade"" from, 1989) had come first in the series, who knows how much fresher it might have seemed? True, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stands alone as an action masterpiece, but after that the series is  compelled  to be, in the words of Indiana himself, ""same old same old."" Yes, but that's what I want  it to be. ""Crystal Skull"" even dusts off the Russians, so severely under-exploited in recent years, as the bad guys. Up against them, Indiana Jones is once again played by Harrison Ford, who is now 65 but looks a lot like he did at 55 or 46, which is how old he was when he made ""Last Crusade."" He has one of those Robert Mitchum faces that doesn't age, it only frowns more. He and his sidekick Mac McHale (Ray Winstone) are taken by the cool, contemptuous Soviet uber-villainess Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) to a cavernous warehouse to seek out a crate he saw there years ago. The contents of the crate are hyper-magnetic (lord, I love this stuff) and betray themselves when Indy throws a handful of gunpowder into the air. In ways too labyrinthine to describe, the crate leads Indy, Mac, Irina and the Russians far up the Amazon. Along the way they've gathered Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy's girlfriend from the first film, and a young biker named Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf), who is always combing his ducktail haircut. They also acquire Professor Oxley (John Hurt), elderly colleague from the University of Chicago, whose function is to read all the necessary languages, know all the necessary background, and explain everything. What happens in South America is explained by the need to create (1) sensational chase sequences, and (2) awe-inspiring spectacles. We get such sights as two dueling Jeep-like vehicles racing down parallel roads. Not many of the audience members will be as logical as I am, and wonder who went to the trouble of building  parallel roads in a rain forest. Most of the major characters eventually find themselves at the wheels of both vehicles; they leap or are thrown from one to another, and the vehicles occasionally leap right over one another. And that Irina, she's something. Her Russian backups are mostly just atmosphere, useful for pointing their rifles at Indy, but she can fight shoot, fence, drive, leap and kick, and keep on all night. All leads to the discovery of a subterranean chamber beneath an ancient pyramid, where they find an ancient city made of gold and containing...but wait, I forgot to tell you they found a crystal skull in a crypt. Well sir, it's one of 13 crystal skulls, and the other 12 are in that chamber. When the set is complete, amazing events take place. Prof. Oxley carries the 13th skull for most of the time, and finds it repels man-eating ants. It also represents one-thirteenth of all knowledge about everything, leading Irina to utter the orgasmic words, ""I want...to  know!""  In appearance, the skull is a cross between the aliens of the Special Edition of Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the hood ornaments of 1950s Pontiacs. What is the function of the chamber? ""It's a portal--to another dimension!"" Oxley says. Indy is sensible: ""I don't think we wanna go that way."" It is astonishing that the protagonists aren't all killed 20 or 30 times, although Irnia will become The Women Who Knew Too Much. At his advanced age, Prof.Oxley tirelessly jumps between vehicles, survives fire and flood and falling from great heights, and would win on ""American Gladiator."" Relationships between certain other characters are of interest, since (a) the odds against them finding themselves together are astronomical, and (b) the odds against them  not  finding themselves together in this film are incalculable. Now what else can I tell you, apart from mentioning the blinking red digital countdown, and the moving red line tracing a journey on a map? I can say that if you liked the other Indiana Jones movies, you will like this one, and that if you did not, there is no talking to you. And I can also say that a critic trying to place it into a hierarchy with the others would probably keep a straight face while recommending the second pound of sausage. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2008"," In promoting Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, executive producer and story man George Lucas adopted a new mantra: ""It's only a movie, it's only a movie, it's only a movie."" And he's right. It'll certainly do for a Friday night. But to Indiana Jones fans, the 1980s films are more than movies—they are sacred texts of action cinema blessed with one of the most beloved heroes in American culture. In other words, those who agree with the latter statement should moderate their expectations. For director Steven Spielberg, Lucas' concept of Indiana Jones was the fulfillment of a personal ambition to direct the American equivalent of the James Bond series, with a patriotic hero proving he's ""the man"" (though often an error-prone one) on globetrotting, action-packed adventures. And Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull resembles nothing so much as a long-in-the-tooth James Bond sequel: a must-see and entertaining almost by default in its action mechanics, but low in inspiration and high on nostalgia. (In one scene, Indy gets shackled into metal-chair Bondage for a mind-threatening procedure.) The latest entry opens with a burst of energy in the desert prairie of 1957 Nevada. Here, where what you see is real, and a reminder of Spielberg's phenomenal skill with camera and geography. With Elvis' ""Hound Dog"" blaring on the soundtrack, rubber meets the road: the director strongly conveys movement with fast vehicles, crane shots and the like. Indiana Jones movies always have a lot of impressive stunts, but this stunt is pure Spielberg, because nothing to speak of happens during this title sequence. Nothing, that is, except the effective priming of the audience, which is enough. When Spielberg later applies similar techniques to a motorcycle chase and even a computer-assisted jungle chase, the picture leaps to life. As a caravan of military vehicles reaches its destination, we reacquaint ourselves with Dr. Jones, meet his British sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone), and learn what's in the fabled Hangar 51. What's there is of vital interest to Russian agent Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), an ice queen once known as ""Stalin's fair-haired girl"" despite her jet-black bob. Soon, the chase is on, with Indy running for his life from the Russians and worse, the wages of the atomic age. A sequence that evokes the mushroom-cloud fears of the 1950s incorporates a mocking mock-up of suburbia in Technicolor pastels out of a Douglas Sirk picture (could it be a preemptive visual pun about the threat of Jones settling into a ""nuclear family""?). And though years have passed since McCarthy's Senate censure, Indy gets debriefed by FBI agents who wonder openly if he's true blue or Red. As Indy's college dean (Jim Broadbent) points out, ""I barely recognize this country anymore."" Broadbent's Charles Stanforth—heir to Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody—is mostly on hand to deliver the key line ""We seem to have reached the age when life stops giving us things and starts taking them away."" Naturally, that depressive anti-sentiment turns out to be 180 degrees from the truth: despite the ravages of age and the passage of important people from his life, Indy will discover how much he has to gain as his twilight years approach. For a start, Dr. Jones once more gets news that calls for packing away his bespectacled professor persona and donning fedora, leather jacket, and whip. Like it or not, he gets a new partner in a motorcycle punk named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) and a new quest for an ancient relic of supposed supernatural provenance: a Crystal Skull. In terms of tone, the picture is a hybrid of the comic-book exaggeration of Temple of Doom and the comic domestic squabbling of The Last Crusade. Ironically, the picture least resembles Raiders of the Lost Ark, though Marion (Karen Allen) returns to get Jones' engine running with argumentative ardor. The whole picture feels just a bit out of step with the previous films, a problem felt as well in Ford's performance. Hit-and-miss screenwriter David Koepp (Spider-Man, War of the Worlds) has Indy preoccupied with sadness over what he's lost one minute, reconnecting with his growly anger the next, and inorganically wisecracking through it all (story credit goes to Lucas and Jeff Nathanson). Ford and the picture hit their stride when Indy takes to the jungle with Marion, Mutt, and loony Professor Oxley (John Hurt) in a series of scenes that sends Indy aggressively off-balance with personal fears, personal reckoning, and, for good measure, fights performed on speeding vehicles. The archaeological mysteries have never been more convoluted (in this way, Koepp's script is too smart for its own good), and like so many sequels before it, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull suffers from pacing that renders a surfeit of characters unknowable through screenwriting shorthand. Winstone plays a plot device, not a character, and his tendency to holler ""Jonesy!"" becomes nearly as annoying as Jar Jar Binks; Blanchett's character never sparks, either. Allen and LaBeouf fare much better, though they both feel underserved as characters. The idea of belief is a core theme, though it's paid off in hackneyed fashion, as is the now-tired Indy theme of artifact-grubbing greed (and still no acknowledgement that Indy's committing the worst archeological crimes this side of Heinrich Schliemann). As for the thrust of the plot, built on the Crystal Skull MacGuffin, it trips past the line so winningly toed in the previous three films—part and parcel, I suppose, of a post-CGI Indiana Jones picture. Despite assurances to the contrary in promotional interviews, the fourth Indy film sports an awful lot of digital paint work. Yes, the stunt work is typically great, and yes, you'll be asking yourself, ""How'd they do that?"" at some of the composites that allow the actors to appear to defy death (the answer's in the reported $185 million budget, spent largely in the halls of ILM), but the CGI helps to send Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to the back of the line of Indy films. That said, this is an Indiana Jones picture. Starring Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. And that LaBeouf kid ain't bad either—good enough, in fact, to inspire lots of sequel rumors that look yet more plausible after seeing the film. Whether with Ford, LaBeouf, or someone else decades down the line, the aging Indy franchise is likely to keep on giving things rather than taking them away—it's the nature of Hollywood business in the 21st century. As for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, yes, it's only a movie, but I hear people like movies. Just remember: it's not the second coming, but the fourth. Paramount and Lucasfilm give the fans what they want in a spectacular 2-Disc Blu-ray edition of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (mirrored in a 2-Disc DVD set). The Blu-ray shines with a picture-perfect transfer. Perhaps a little too perfect: the film's extensive post-production scrubbing, toning, and effects work result in an image that never seems very natural or film-like (grain is absent), but the Blu-ray provides a sharp rendering of the film that matches my memory of how it looked in theaters. The reference quality Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround track likewise does the original material justice with a thrilling, discrete balance of effects, dialogue, and John Williams' signature music. The extensive bonus features, all in glorious HD, kick off with Disc One's Production, History and Story Timelines. Easy to navigate and full of interesting details, these timelines include explanatory text for each entry and embedded video for selected entries (my fave: a vintage ""I Like Ike"" TV spot). The head-scratcher here is that the Story ""Timeline"" includes no dates at all, so plot points are listed in chronological order, but without even an approximation of the year an event takes place in the series' continuity. I suppose this gives the filmmakers leeway should a future project revisit these areas... Disc One also hosts the first of several features produced by Laurent Bouzereau: ""The Return of a Legend"" (17:34), an overview of the franchise's revival that includes comments from Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, George Lucas, producer Frank Marshall, screenwriter David Koepp, executive producer Kathleen Kennedy, Karen Allen and Shia LaBeouf. A featurette focused on ""Pre-Production"" (11:44) adds the insights of pre-visualization supervisor Daniel D. Gregoire, DP Janusz Kaminski, and Ford's costume designer Bernie Pollack. Disc One wraps up with ""Theatrical Trailer 2"" (1:52) and ""Theatrical Trailer 3"" (1:55)--was ""Theatrical Trailer 1"" never released? Disc Two's centerpiece is the feature-length ""Production Diary: Making of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (1:20:52). This detailed step-by-step record of the production includes the chapters ""Shooting Begins: New Mexico,"" ""Back to School: New Haven, Connecticut,"" ""Welcome to the Jungle: Hilo, Hawaii,"" ""On-Set Action,"" ""Exploring Akator,"" and ""Wrapping Up!"" Joining the ranks of interviewees are the balance of the cast, the rest of the design team, and a significant representation of the crew, fro snake handlers to makeup artists. Six additional featurettes further highlight the top-to-bottom contributions of the crew. ""Warrior Makeup"" (5:34) explains the intricate makeup design and application process for the native warriors. ""The Crystal Skulls"" (10:10) regards the myth, historical provenance, and production design element that is the Crystal Skull. ""Iconic Props"" allows prop master Doug Harlocker to give us a tour of the latest additions to the Lucasfilm archives. ""The Effects of Indy"" (22:42) and ""Adventures in Post-Production"" (12:44) are fairly self-explanatory, though the latter includes among its subjects a few living legends: editor Michael Kahn, sound designer Ben Burtt, and composer John Williams. ""Closing: Team Indy"" (3:41) has Spielberg introduce a montage salute to crew and cast. The pre-vis glimpsed in the featurettes gets its closeup in three Pre-Visualization Sequences: ""Area 51 Escape"" (3:51), ""Jungle Chase"" (5:47), and ""Ants Attack"" (4:29). Last up are multiple Galleries for The Art Department and Stan Winston Studio, as well as galleries of Production Photographs and Behind-the-Scenes Photographs. Indy fans will not be able to resist this lovingly assembled, beautifully presented Blu-ray set.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2008",A triumphant return to form.,POSITIVE
"May 18, 2008"," 
	George Lucas failed miserably when he tried to revive his Star Wars series in 1999, so I was a little worried when I heard he was doing the same with the Indiana Jones franchise. My fear was a little soothed by the thought that with Indiana Jones, Stephen Spielberg would again be directing. Now after seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I can safely say, my fears were groundless. Seeing this latest installment is like meeting a long lost friend and discovering that they haven't lost any of their charm. Spielberg, Lucas and Ford have managed to recapture the magic and brought adventure back to the movies. 
	One of the best decisions made when making this movie was that instead of trying to hide the number of years that have passed since the last one, the plot embraces the passage of time and makes it integral to the story. The movie is set in 1957, nearly 20 years after the last one and Indiana Jones is still up to his old tricks, and even though there's a lot more grey in his hair, he still manages to put up a good fight and swing a mean bull-whip. Mention is made in passing as to what Indy has been up to over the intervening years. During the war it seems that he worked as a spy for the allies, but has since returned to teaching and adventuring. His father and his old friend Brody are both mentioned as well. 
	Where the first three movies were based loosely on the adventure serials of the 1930s, this one bears some traces of a 1950s Sci-Fi B-movie. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but the story is basically a race between Indy and a group of Russians to find a crystal skull that the Russians believe is a weapon of enormous power. The quest for the skull takes Indy from the desert of the Southwest to deep into the Amazon Rain Forest. His sidekick for this movie is Mutt (LaBouf), the son of Indy's old flame, Marion Ravenwood (who's also along for the ride). Mutt, very much a product of the 1950s with his switch blade, pompadour and motor cycle (including an entrance that is a tribute to Brando's The Wild One) helps bring some youth to the proceedings. 
	The movie's only weakness is that the action is over-the-top at times. Indiana is completely indestructible and you never feel that he is ever in any real danger. This is in tune with the mood of the last Indiana Jones' movie, but a far cry from the darker, more realistic first film. I blame CGI for the over-the-top action scenes. There are scenes that wouldn't have been possible to film when the movies first came out that they are able to film now with the help of computers. Indy's trip in a refrigerator (you'll know what I mean when you see it) and when Mutt does his Tarzan impression are two scenes that leap to mind. 
	As in the earlier films, the best thing about this movie is the character of Indiana Jones. Ford is great again as one of filmdom's most iconic heroes. You first see Indy in silhouette and the shape of him in the hat, accompanied by that theme music is enough to give chills to any fan of the series. He's lost little over the intervening years. He stills bumbles through his adventures, making it up as he goes along, and getting beaten up as often as he beats up. 
	Lucas might have failed with the Star Wars sequels, but with the help of Spielberg and Ford, he makes up for it here. Once again, Adventure has a name and that name is Indiana Jones. 
	Indiana Jones is back and it is great to see him in action.  He is older and the setting, 1957, seems better brought to life than the 1930's of the previous films. The movie opens with a roadster tearing down the street wanting to drag race. It is a bit reminiscent of the Lucas directed American Graffiti. Later, Indiana and Mutt talk in a corner soda shop that looks quite similar to the one in the Spielberg produced Back to the Future. The only thing that established the era of the previous films was the presence of Nazis. 
	Indiana's reunion with Marion is one of the movie's bright spots. Of all the women featured in the series, she was the one who suited him best. She is tough and independent. They had the best chemistry and the only true love story, that did not seem forced. Their meeting in the jungle should have, and could have, been played up a bit more romantically. Think Bogart's and Bergman's reunion scene in Casablanca. It would have added some emotional weight to a script that occasionally becomes very light. 
	The new cast members hold their own. LaBeouf plays the biker Mutt, like a natural. He first addresses Indiana as, ""Old man!"" His best action scenes are when he is on his motorcycle. The Tarzan act is a bit much but it hardly ruins anything as it is short and part of a much larger action sequence. The series could definitely continue with Mutt taking over the lead. Blanchett does another accent with comfortable aplomb. Indiana makes a joke about it when they first meet. 
	The big glaring issue with this installment is the ending when we learn the secret of the crystal skull.  It contradicts everything that has come before in the series and takes Jones into a new direction and reality that never existed before.  If you can forgive Lucas's and Spielberg's huge misstep there is still fun to be found.  
	Even though Lucas and Spielberg messed up the movie series, Indiana Jones remains the greatest action/adventure movie character of all time. This may be the last time we see Ford wear that Fedora, but it is an image that will last as long as Humphrey Bogart and his trench coat, Charlie Chaplin and his cane, John Wayne in his cowboy hat and Marilyn Monroe in her white dress. Indiana Jones is immortal. 
	Although I agree with most of what my brothers have written I take exception to a few things. Scott, not everyone thinks Lucas “failed miserably” with the new Star Wars movies. Many of the young people I work with enjoy them much more than “those old ones” as they put it. As for me, I like the original trilogy better too but can appreciate the newer ones as well. Eric, I think the earlier Indiana Jones movies successfully “brought to life” the time period of the 1930s, especially in the opening nightclub scene in Temple of Doom. 
	Apart from those minor quibbles I think my brothers are spot on. Watching this movie is like visiting an old friend. Like all of us Jones is now 20 years older.  He still retains his charm and taste for adventure (although his reflexes with the bull-whip are a bit slower). LaBeouf is a good addition to the franchise. He’s a chip off the old block and shares a nice camaraderie with Ford. 
	Eric is right about the jungle reunion between Indiana and Marion. It should have been played up more romantically. She is, after all, the love of his life and (I think it’s OK to give this away now) the mother of his child. Yet the scene is filmed like a throw-away moment. 
	Scott is right about the over-the-top CGI action. Jones surviving a nuclear blast by climbing inside a refrigerator has to be the worst stunt in any of the movies. Mutt swinging nimbly through the trees and catching up to a speeding vehicle is a bit much. And these Russian Comrades make Storm Troopers look like expert marksmen by comparison.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2008","  CANNES, France -- Jim Jarmusch received an award called the Carrosse d'Or late on Saturday night here, and if it's not one of Cannes' big-name prizes it's a coveted one among film directors. It's given by the French directors' guild during the Directors' Fortnight sidebar festival, and it's a lifetime achievement award given to a non-French filmmaker of world renown. (Previous winners have included David Cronenberg, Clint Eastwood and Ousmane Sembène.) During his potent speech about the power and limits of cinema, Jarmusch reminded us that Sunday would mark 40 years to the day since the student uprising of May 1968 invaded the Festival de Cannes, bringing that year's edition to an early and abrupt conclusion.   So how did Cannes celebrate the anniversary of that near-revolution, which had such a profound effect on French culture and French history? With ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" bien sûr! Hey, isn't it the Frenchies who have some saying about how the more things change, the more they stay the same? Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' long, long, long awaited fourth chapter in their big-budget-imitating-low-budget, self-consciously old-fashioned boys' adventure serial screened here for the first time before an audience on Sunday afternoon, and it was far and away the biggest and craziest media circus I've seen in three years at Cannes. Spielberg, Lucas and Harrison Ford (at a collective age of 190) will see your Brangelina hubbub and double it.   Part of me thinks that some flea-bitten Parisian radicals should come and close this shit down right now. And part of me thinks: You know what? Cannes needs Indy. We've had five days here of earnest and serious filmmaking, ranging from mediocre to outstanding, but nothing that feels like a movie that will rock the world. (And the locals will get their chance to revisit '68 when French counterculture hero Philippe Garrel shows up with his first-ever competition film.) Couple that with the unseasonably dreary weather on the Riviera, and the pent-up demand for celebutainment and sunshine was becoming unmanageable.   No one doubts that those hundreds of people on the sidewalk in Cannes represent untold millions of others around the world eager to see this movie. But if you want to know whether Ford, Spielberg and Lucas can recapture their mojo almost 20 years after ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" the only answers I can provide are frustrating ones, like kind of and maybe and it depends what you mean. The joy of the original Indiana Jones series lay in its discovery or rediscovery of the audience's love of cinema as pure adventure, unadorned with social issues or character psychology. In other words, they were meant to take you back to childhood, and perhaps not even your own childhood but your parents' or grandparents' childhood, or America's childhood.   Can that kind of rediscovery keep happening over and over again? And should it? Yes, it's rude to bring this up, but Ford, Lucas and Spielberg are all a lot older than they once were, and so are the rest of us. Furthermore, when Lucas and Spielberg launched this series in 1981, they were pioneers. Adventure movies had been left behind by the self-serious American cinema of the '70s, and they were the guys who were bringing them back. In the years since then, the world's filmgoers have gorged themselves on adventure movies, cheap ones and mind-blowingly expensive ones and every gradation in between. Asking the audience to remember how delighted they were by a swashbuckler made 27 years ago is like asking a diabetic to remember an awesome piece of chocolate cake he ate in high school.   My colleague Stephanie Zacharek will write a full review of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Crystal Skull"" before its worldwide opening on May 22, so I'll limit myself to a few general comments. If you're profoundly allergic to any plot info, check out now, but I won't give anything away that isn't glaringly obvious from the trailer or the first half-hour. As all fans know by now, Spielberg and Lucas have aged Indy in ""real time,"" so it's now 1957 in their universe. In the film's first few minutes, they channel the Red Scare, Elvis Presley, the alleged 1947 flying saucer crash in Roswell, N.M., the secret Nevada military test site known as Area 51, and the A-bomb.   Cate Blanchett is hilarious in a grossly underwritten role as a feline Soviet officer-scientist, basically a Bond villainess who wears the pants (and keeps them on). Spielberg is always a fine director of people and things in motion, and the first half-hour is terrific fun. But by the time Blanchett and her Commie minions have stolen a priceless artifact with strange powers (can you guess what it is?) from a super-secure United States military installation and Indy has survived a nuclear test by hiding in a lead-lined '50s refrigerator (and become an object of McCarthyite suspicion), you may begin to wonder whether the story's got anything left, beyond repeating its chase sequences and pseudo-mystical interludes over and over again in different settings. I think you know the answer.   In addition to a crystal skull, possible alien and Commie invasions and an evil Ukrainian with a hot haircut, the story involves several kinds of mummies, flesh-eating ants, the living dead, a previously unknown pictographic writing system, John Hurt in one of his demented-guy roles and the lost Amazonian city of El Dorado, so eagerly sought by Spanish conquistadors and so not-found. (At one point Jones refers to ""15th century"" conquistadors in South America. Might want to check the math on that, Steve and George.) I don't object to any of the fantastical or fanciful elements whatsoever, but Jesus, why do Spielberg and Lucas have to persist in depicting a supposedly respectable archaeologist raiding, destroying and looting the artifacts of ancient civilizations? Sure, a lot of them did that back in the day, but by '57 things were changing, and shouldn't manly-but-sensitive Indy be a little ahead of the cultural curve?   When Shia LaBeouf turns up as a nothing character called Mutt -- who rides a Harley and dresses like Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" -- to drag Indy out of academia and into the Amazon jungle, I felt actively embarrassed for this movie and its creators. First of all, Mr. LaBeouf, I have seen movies with Marlon Brando in them, and you, sir, are no Marlon Brando. Second of all, I can imagine the meeting where Spielberg and Lucas sat around with their casting agents and stuck pictures of young male stars up on the wall: ""The teenyboppers! They love him!"" Third of all, you'll never, never in a million years, imagine whose son LaBeouf's character turns out to be. Where the heck did George Lucas come up with that one?   Which brings us to the nostalgic element of ""IJKCS"" that no one will wish to resist, not even hardhearted me. As advertised, Karen Allen, purged from the series after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" is back as Indy's one-time paramour Marion Ravenwood, and if she's nearly a decade younger than Harrison Ford, that still makes her the most age-appropriate screen companion he's had in many moons. It's enough to make you forgive a great deal of this film's dumbness and appreciate it as meaningless, goodhearted and mostly non-obnoxious entertainment.   It's hard to do justice to Ford's masterful delivery of innocuous phrases in print, but this is more or less how it went: ""That was the most important moment of my career [pause] doing 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' [Pause, head shake.] So reuniting with these guys [gesture at Lucas and Spielberg] and getting back together with Karen [long pause] and all these talented actors [vague wave at LeBeouf, John Hurt, Ray Winstone and Jim Broadbent] was wonderful. [Long, long pause.] Really, really wonderful."" Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC. Reproduction of material from any Salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.

"May 18, 2008"," The world can rest easy - the old magic still works in Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. It may take some breathless, helter-skelter action to redeem the opening hour’s clunky storytelling, but the first Indy adventure in almost twenty years is like a fond reunion with an old friend and will not disappoint diehard fans or deter a new generation from embracing it as a summer blockbuster adventure ride. This is money in the bank as far as exhibitors are concerned, but the relief of some critical support will do no harm to what is destined to stand as one of the year’s top moneymakers. Crystal Skull may be set in 1957 and embrace an America paranoid about alien invaders and reds under the bed but Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have wisely stuck to a winning formula. Pesky Ruskies replace the threat of pesky Nazis, a mysterious crystal skull with the promise of great powers replaces the Ark of the Covenant, and this is very much business as usual in every respect. There is such a knowing adherence to the winning formula that you fear teeam Spielberg may not be able to pull it off. A flat opening fails to match the sheer adrenaline rush that has become a signature of the three previous entries in the series. A showdown at a hush-hush installation in the Nevada desert introduces Cate Blanchett as Soviet baddie Irina Spalko. Her Louise Brooks bob, Greta Garbo accent and steely manner couldn’t be more of a cliche and it starts to look as if a fourth Indy epic wasn’t such a good idea after all. It takes the dropping of an atomic bomb and Indy’s daredevil escape in a lead-lined fridge to suggest that all is not lost. The triumph of the Indiana Jones series was always in the breathtaking action sequences and the ability to reinvent the feel of a cliffhanging Saturday morning serial for a more sophisticated age. The flaws in Crystal Skull reside in a script where the dialogue rarely sparkles and a basic story that gives little sense of requiring almost twenty years to devise. Like all previous entries in the series it improves enormously once the treasure hunt has begun, the chase is afoot and the reckless escapes from the jaws of certain death start piling up. The object of the chase this time is the Crystal Skull of Akator and it’s young greaser Mutt (La Beouf) who makes Indy an offer he cannot refuse. Soon the duo are rushing towards Peru, intent on rescuing Mutt’s mother who proves to be Indy’s lost love Marion Ravenwood (Allen) - as feisty and adorable as ever. Naturally, the Soviets are on their tail, there’s some double-dealing to uncover and a few secrets to come tumbling from the family closet. Overburdened with clunky exposition in the first half, Crystal Skull really reaches top gear during a long chase sequence involving everything from a fencing duel conducted between rival vehicles to a skull that changes hands countless times. It is exactly the kind of crowd-pleasing spectacle that the film needed to deliver in order to prove that Indy can still cut the mustard in the age of Bond and Bourne. A nimble Ford wears his role like a comfortable old suit. La Beouf makes Mutt a real chip of the old block and Allen’s re-appearance is the icing on the cake, giving the human element to balance all the action and providing the happy ending that allows the whole series to bow out in a satisfying style.

"May 18, 2008"," 
	CANNES — What do you know, the film billed as a return of Indiana Jones turns out instead to be a sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. 
	In the first 22 minutes, old Indy survives a kidnapping, shoot-outs, auto crashes inside a mysterious warehouse, a ride in a desert rocket and an A-bomb detonation. Spielberg is only getting warmed up. 
	The film never pauses to let these characters enjoy a drink or take each other’s measure. Indy’s original flame, Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, also makes a welcome return; she even has a surprise for Indiana — yet this moment is lost in the forward momentum. 
	Losing his job during the Red Scare of the ’50s, Indy is persuaded by young Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) — who keeps those iconic ’50s images flowing by arriving on a motorbike like Brando in The Wild One — to take off on a vague adventure in South America to save his mother and retrieve the Crystal Skull of Akator. 
	Once the group possesses the Crystal Skull — it does keep changing hands between Indy and the Soviet army — no one seems to know quite what to do with it. But it has its uses: At different times, it opens doors, triggers cave machinery, wards off giant red ants and scares hostile natives. For all anyone knows, it might pay the bill at a fancy restaurant. 
	After about an hour, the film abandons any pretense of story for a rush through fights, chases, machine gun fire, scorpions, quicksand, monkeys, huge snakes and finally a secret city — part Mayan, part Aztec, certain to become both a video game and amusement park attraction. 
	At no time does any of Indy’s gang seem in real jeopardy. Bullets splash all around, but not even the brim of his fedora gets nicked. Waterfalls are mere dips in the water, collapsing ruins an excuse for free-exercise tumbles and the villains mere annoyances.",NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2008"," It’s the summer’s most anticipated film, the latest in a beloved series that’s earned $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Add in a premiere at the most prestigious of international film festivals, and the wonder of “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is that it avoids being an anticlimax and is entertaining in its own right. Though the film stars a relaxed and capable Harrison Ford as everyone’s favorite intrepid archaeologist and boasts supporting players ranging from Cate Blanchett as a superb villainess to Shia LaBeouf as the inevitable youngster, the real heroes of this film are director Steven Spielberg and the veritable army of superb technicians who turn the film’s numerous stunts and special effects into trains that insist on running on time. Trains are in fact not a bad metaphor for the director’s motivations for this fourth Indy effort, the first in 19 years. Just like a model-train hobbyist who enjoys getting more and more expensive equipment as his income level rises, Spielberg clearly got enormous pleasure employing a lifetime’s worth of skill and turning out wave after wave of smartly done stunts and effects set pieces. Certainly “Crystal Skull,” which hits theaters in the U.S. this Thursday, couldn’t have had a more eager, not to say rabid, audience anywhere in the world than the one at the Cannes Film Festival for its pair of Sunday screenings. The chaos at the press entrance was remarkable at the first screening, with frantic cinephiles pushing, shoving, attempting to jump over barriers and engaging in fierce shouting matches with the guards. And inside the normally decorous Grand Theatre Lumiere, where the festival’s closing ceremony is held, there was unprecedented cheering as the opening credits rolled. Getting sole screenplay credit (with story credit going to series originator George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson) was the veteran David Koepp, the latest and most successful of the close to a dozen people who took a crack at this project over 15 years, according to an article in the WGA’s Written By magazine. The result may not be as iconic as “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but it’s a perfectly agreeable outline on which to hang what, with a budget estimated at $185 million, must be the most expensive Saturday matinee film ever made. Koepp’s script also had to get the approval of Harrison Ford, who probably enjoyed getting to play his own age in a story set at the height of the Red scare in 1957, when Marshall College’s Professor Jones, believe it or not, runs afoul of the FBI and has his patriotism questioned. Though perhaps ambivalent at one time about Indy typecasting, Ford has made his peace with one of his most iconic roles and seeing him at his ease here is like meeting an old friend after years away. If Ford is a known Indy quantity, newcomer Blanchett is a great treat as Colonel Professor Irina Spalko, three-time winner of the Order of Lenin and “Stalin’s fair-haired girl” despite a jet-black hairdo a la Louise Brooks. The Colonel Professor and a crack team of Russians manage to force their way into a secret U.S. Army base in Nevada as the film begins. They bring the kidnapped Jones with them and force him at gunpoint to help them find some mummified remains from a plane crash that are stored in a giant government warehouse, the same one, incidentally, that was featured in the ending of “Raiders.” (Here it’s built for real; in the original it was a special effect). The mummified remains have a connection to the crystal skull of the title, and both deeply interest the C.P., who is a believer in paranormal research as “a new frontier in psychic warfare.” She feels if she can find where the skull came from, great knowledge will be hers. If the opening Nevada segment, which quite literally ends with a bang, complete with realistic mushroom cloud, is one of the film’s strengths, the exposition-heavy middle section is something of a drag. That’s partially because Indy’s sidekicks, including Ray Winstone as George “Mac” MacHale and John Hurt as Professor “Ox” Oxley (you may detect a pattern here) are no better than serviceable. That is true as well for LaBeouf as youth interest Mutt Williams. Introduced as a total copy of Marlon Brando on a motorcycle in “The Wild One,” LaBeouf doesn’t seem completely comfortable in his disaffected teen role, a part that does not play to the innate likability that is one of his strengths. And though it is exceptionally pleasant to see Karen Allen returning as Indy flame Marion Ravenwood, the film is too intent on spending the first part of their reunion having them strenuously argue with each other. It’s so unpleasant, even one of the atheist Russians is forced to plead, “For love of God, shut the hell up.” The film’s final section, however, with everyone hell-bent for the temple and the secret of that eggplant-shaped crystal skull, makes up for lost time. It offers lots of animal action (monkeys and hordes of red ants, primarily) as well as great stunts both CGI (“Look out for those falls!”) and physical, as the Colonel Professor and Mutt draw swords and make like Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in “Captain Blood.” When you think about it, all the pre-release concern about just how good the new “Indy” was going to be, though understandable, is not completely rational. After all, given its Saturday matinee genre nature and the fact that star Ford, creator Lucas, director Spielberg, composer John Williams and editor Michael Kahn, among others, have all returned, it was inevitable that this film was going to fall within a very narrow range in terms of quality. It was either going to be a worse- or better-than-average Indiana Jones film. “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” MPAA rated: PG-13 for adventure violence and scary images. Running time: 2 hours and 3 minutes. In wide release starting Thursday.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2008"," A spontaneous cheer went up when Indiana Jones was pulled out of the boot of a car in the Nevada desert. Nineteen long years have done nothing for his dress sense, and nor have they withered his appetite for trouble. This fantastic Steven Spielberg adventure is a marvellous return to form for Professor Henry Jones Jr. There are Mayan riddles to solve, KGB agents to biff, and one of the greatest - and longest - action chases through the Amazon jungle in the history of cinema.

"May 18, 2008"," Nobody cracks the whip for grey power like Professor Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr, legendary lost-temple-discoverer, baddie-foiler and boulder-evader, in which iconic role the increasingly grizzled Harrison Ford returns in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's a title that no one here in Cannes can quite remember off the top of their heads, preferring to say simply ""IJ4"" - and generally adding a whoop of excitement. It's no exaggeration to say that Cannes has gone Indy crazy, with delegates queueing for hours to get in before the show began at lunchtime. Many threw their cinephile dignity to the winds, attempting to vault the barriers and rush in for the best seats, and having to be hauled back by one of the grey-suited entry police after an undignified scramble. An appearance by Steven Spielberg at the back of the packed auditorium, accompanied by festival director Thierry Frémaux, caused among us a veritable Mexican wave of head-turning and neck-craning. There's plenty going on in this movie, with one or two tremendous stunts and some very nasty giant ants. It also steers clear of the dusky-foreigner stereotypes that got the second Indiana Jones picture into hot water. But despite the genuine excitement, and one blinding flash of the old genius, this new Indy film looks like it's going through the motions. The third film was called Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, after all; perhaps, like the first Star Wars film, that will need a change of title, with the word ""penultimate"" added to all new DVDs. Unlike the calamitous Star Wars prequel trilogy, this film doesn't trash our treasured memories, but it doesn't add anything either. In fact, it seems like a very, very long extra ending, like the six or seven Peter Jackson tacked on to his The Return of the King. The idea is that Indy is now plying his trade in the cold war of the 1950s. After discovering a Soviet plot to infiltrate an Area 51-style US military base, with a highly classified alien corpse, he witnesses a nuclear test and is then confronted with the Russian villainness Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett looking like a very, very attractive and taller version of Rosa Klebb. She wants to get her nasty Commie hands on the mythical crystal skull of a pre-Mayan civilisation, and return it to its legendary tomb deep in the South American jungle, created by Erich Von Daniken-style space invaders - and this will give the USSR supreme mystical powers over the free world. But not if Indy gets there first, and he's accompanied by his unreliable Brit pal Mac (Ray Winstone), addled academic Professer Oxley (John Hurt), new young sidekick Mutt (Shia Labeouf) and it's nice to see a return from Indy's first and feistiest love, Marion (Karen Allen). Like it or not, however, since Indy disappeared in 1989, plenty of movies have been ripping off his act: National Treasure, Sahara - even the dreaded The Da Vinci Code. So when Harrison Ford now returns to discover more tombs, more stone walls that grind apart at the touch of a lever, more waterfalls of sand - well, the thrill is gone. As Indiana says grimly at one point: ""Same old, same old."" We were promised an eldorado, and I was hoping for a giant gold city. It turns out the gold is a metaphor for knowledge. There is one moment of authentic Spielberg genius: Indy blunders onto a nuclear test site in the desert ten seconds before detonation. Desperately, he breaks into a nearby house and begs for help, but the house only has creepy mannequins instead of people. It is an entire fake town, constructed to assess the effect of a nuclear blast on civilians. Convulsed with horror, Indiana scrambles to find shelter from the blast. It really is chilling, and Indiana Jones's bewildering predicament at the very epicentre of modernity gives a flash of the old Spielberg; the Spielberg of Jaws and Close Encounters. Everything else is a retread from the VHS age. There are some nice moments, and everything is good-natured enough. But this is a moment for Harrison Ford to hang up the hat.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2008"," One of the most eagerly and long-awaited series follow-ups in screen history delivers the goods — not those of the still first-rate original, 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but those of its uneven two successors. “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” begins with an actual big bang, then gradually slides toward a ho-hum midsection before literally taking off for an uplifting finish. Nineteen years after their last adventure, director Steven Spielberg and star Harrison Ford have no trouble getting back in the groove with a story and style very much in keeping with what has made the series so perennially popular. Few films have ever had such a high mass audience must-see factor, spelling giant May 22 openings worldwide and a rambunctious B.O. life all the way into the eventual “Indiana Jones” DVD four-pack. As has been well chronicled, Spielberg and exec producer George Lucas went through no end of writers and story concepts before plausibly updating the action precisely the same number of years as have elapsed since “Last Crusade,” to 1957, smack dab in the middle of the Cold War. U.S. versus USSR dynamic spurs the dynamite opening action sequence, in which a convoy of Russian soldiers camouflaged in American army vehicles rolls into a remote desert nuclear testing base in search of a coveted object. Helping them in this effort will be their prisoner, Indiana Jones. With an energy and enthusiasm bespeaking years of pent-up desire to get back to this sort of fun filmmaking, Spielberg sets the period spirit with a rock ‘n’ roll-fueled drag race and, with the characters’ entry into the legendary Hangar 51, intimations of an other-worldly presence. As the aging issue is tossed off with a joke or two, the sixtysomething hero quickly proves that the passage of time will not be an inhibiting factor all these years later, as Indy trades smart remarks with the formidable Soviet officer Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) before jumping into action the equal of any of the great setpieces the entire series has previously offered. In Spalko, the film has a villain worthy not just of Indiana Jones but of a James Bond film, one who’s madly intelligent as well as appreciative of an opponent she views as a near-equal. With her trim gray uniform, silver rapier, Louise Brooks haircut and piercing blue eyes, Blanchett provides a major treat whenever she’s around.  The 20 nonstop opening minutes include a striking variation on the many cookie-cutter middle-class housing tracts featured in Spielberg films, this one populated exclusively by plastic figurines enacting a cliche of a ‘50s Yank lifestyle while awaiting the nuclear test to come, one Indy must quickly figure out how to survive. Even that’s not the end of the scene, which runs the length of the sort of Saturday matinee adventure serial that inspired the series in the first place. Like the bravura opening sequence of “Saving Private Ryan,” this smashing launch sets a standard the rest of the film has some trouble living up to. When Professor Jones returns to his university, he’s informed by his dean (Jim Broadbent, replacing the late Denholm Elliott) that he’s being suspended due to FBI doubt over his loyalty. Indiana Jones suspected of commie sympathies? And this after he’s already told Spalko that “I like Ike.” Another iconic aspect of the decade rolls in with a kid named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a leather-jacketed biker who travels with comb and switchblade. Between a contrived fistfight and extended motorized chase around the leafy college campus, Mutt sets the grand adventure in motion by offering evidence of the possible location of the Crystal Skull of Akator, an object of great archeological and, possibly, psychic and other-dimensional fascination. In a nostalgia-producing air travel montage like those in previous series entries, Indy and Mutt make their way to Peru, where the action relaxes in some rather rote creepy-crawly cave shenanigans before the guys lay their hands on the crystal skull itself, an oddly shaped clear cranium that all agree is not of human origin. But it’s shortly snatched by Spalko, who believes the skull possesses psychic power that would prove decisive in mind warfare, no doubt ending the Cold War then and there. All this gibberish is merely designed to justify the battle of wits and weapons, which continues apace as the Russians collect two further prisoners, Indy’s old cohort and crystal skull expert, the now insane Professor Oxley (John Hurt), and Mutt’s mom, none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy’s flame from “Raiders” and clearly the woman he was always meant to be with.  Coming at pic’s midway point, it’s a welcome reunion, although written to escalate too quickly into intense bickering; a few more initial beats of mutual recognition, to permit the resonance of their relationship to seep back into the characterizations, would have give the rematch more heft. But it’s off and running again, with a race through the jungle as the good guys and bad guys jump between vehicles, duel with fists, sabers and machine guns, are assaulted by monkeys and ravenous giant ants and, in an undoubted preview of a forthcoming theme-park ride, plummet down three imposing waterfalls. For pure action thrills, this sequence rates close to the first one, yet there’s one more to come, a mixed-bag wrap-up that transports the Indiana Jones series into a realm it’s never occupied before but is well familiar to Spielberg and Lucas. For all the verbiage expended just to keep the story cranking forward, David Koepp’s script accomplishes the two essentials: It keeps the structure on the straight and narrow, and is true to the character of Indiana Jones himself. Thanks to this and Ford’s full-bodied performance, Indy comes through just as viewers remember him: crafty, capable, impatient, manly and red-blooded American. He looks great for his age, although it’s never pretended he’s younger than he is, and Mutt pays him the ultimate compliment when he says, “For an old man, you ain’t bad in a fight.” Allen also looks real good and radiates the same winning smile and tomboyish enthusiasm that made her “Raiders” characterization so critical to the film’s complete success; her Marion is perhaps the greatest Hawksian female performance in anything other than a Howard Hawks film. LaBeouf eventually earns his stripes after a somewhat forced beginning, and Ray Winstone, along with fellow Brits Hurt and Broadbent, fills out the roster of newcomers as a duplicitous mercenary who switches sides with each change of fortune. Technically, film is every bit as accomplished as one expects from Spielberg and the series. Of the director’s key original collaborators, editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams return in full form. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas provides some striking creations, particularly the ancient circular chamber that houses the climax. First three series were lensed by the great British d.p. Douglas Slocombe in bold, clean images, and while Spielberg’s now-regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski has mostly succeeded in reproducing this look, which is very different from his usual style, he still can’t prevent himself from letting in some characteristic flared light and hazy backgrounds.

"May 18, 2008"," Cannes Film Fest 2008 (World Premiere Out of Competition)—“Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” the fourth chapter of the Indiana Jones adventure, a successful franchise that began in 1981, is not a good picture by any standard, but it delivers the basic goods, offering old-fashioned fun in both the positive and negative senses of this term. “Indy Jones 4,” easily the most anticipated movie event of the year and one of the few pictures that's truly critics-proof, world-premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Fest out of competition. Paramount will release the DreamWorks production day and date on May 22, and if my reading is valid, the picture should be bonanza at the global box-office, easily surpassing the records achieved by the previous segments.  Artistically, the fourth installment is not as good as the first, “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” in 1981, or the second, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” in 1984, but it's superior to the last one, “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” in 1989.  In 24 years of attending the Cannes Film Fest, I have not seen such buzz-driven press screening– not even for Tarantino's “Pulp Fiction,” in 1994. Critics and journalists began to line up a full hour before the show, and were placed quietly in their seats in a fully packed house, the Grand Palais, at least half an hour before the movie began.  The eagerly awaited segment, that took 19 years make due to the lack of an acceptable script, could be described as Spielberg's spectacle for the masses, by which I mean that the movie belongs to the old Spielberg movies of the 1970s and 1980s. Indeed, blurring and/or mixing (depends on your perspective) conventions of all the genres that the maestro has worked with-action, sci-fi, and even horror-“Indy Jones 4” at once benefits from and is inhibited by the three-way collaboration of visionary producer George Lucas, who created the concept, brilliant storyteller Spielberg, who directed all four pictures, and star Harrison Ford, reprising the most iconic role of his career.  “Indy Jones 4” is also a “mass market” creation in both the positive and negative senses of the word. The creators have been well aware that there are high expectations and limits as to what the hardcore fans would and would not accept. As Spielberg said in a recent interview: “We created Indiana Jones, but it belongs to the world, and now we're just the custodians.” Precisely.  All along, the goal was to create an experience that would transport audiences into an all-new adventure, set in a familiar world. Producer Lucas has explicitly stated that they wanted “the style to be the same, the humor to be the same, and everything else to be the same.” Whether this is a plus or a minus would depend on your personal perspective.  Watching the action-adventure, you realize what a fine line the movie walks between being “the same,” just like the 1980s chapters, but also being “slightly different and new.” The novel elements have to do with the setting and the introduction of some new characters and new relationships, some of which built on those of the former episodes, while others appear for the first time, but linked to the familiar persona in either biological or professional way.  Let me begin with the star: All fears and doubts that Ford is too old (he'll turn 66 in July) to play again the world's bets-known archeologist, should put to rest as he gives a commanding performance that holds the necessarily episodic picture together. Ford not only look good for his age, but acts better than ever, and moves with the agility of a man half his age. Just the sight of Ford, as the whip-toting, punch-packing, snake-hating, globe-trotting archeologist wearing his signature fedora hat brought a huge applause; it's like visiting an old friend of the 1980s.  From its first appearance, 27 years ago, Indiana Jones has become one of the most beloved heroes of the screen. Moreover, after the release of the second chapter, “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” in 1984, and especially, after the third one, “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” in 1989, audiences all over the world have expressed their collective desire for another adventure. We all knew it's a matter of time, but no one could have guessed it would nearly take two decades.  It's no secret that various scribes have offered ideas and screenplays for the fourth chapter, among them Frank Darabont (“The Shawshank Redemption”). It's also no secret that producer Lucas and helmer Spielberg have debated (and disagreed) over the direction in which the saga and its characters should follow.  Shrewdly, screenwriter David Koepp, with assistance from Lucas and Jeff Nathanson (who get story credit) has penned a multi-generational saga that reunites Ford with his old squeeze (Karen Allen, also looking good, at 56), and has arranged for him to have a younger companion, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a rebellious youth sporting a black leather jacket, who may or may not be his biological son.  You may recall that when we last saw Indiana Jones, it was 1938, and the world stood on the brink of war, with our hero chasing down evil-doers to find the Holy Grail. This time around, the saga is set in the Southwest desert-Nevada to be specific–in 1957, during the height of the Cold War and Senator McCarthy's communist witch-hunting.  Paralleling screen history, 19 years later, the saga finds our Dr. Jones facing again a world at a precipice, this time caused by the specter of nuclear annihilation. Similarly, in the new movie, Dr. Jones is once again struggling to ensure that a precious, mysterious object (which explains the title) remains safe from those bent on destroying humanity–who else but the Soviets–even if his task takes him to Peru, among several exciting sites.  Setting the picture in the 1950s is a perfect fit for Spielberg, who has visited that crucial decade in pop culture in the film he directed as well as those he produced (“Back to the Future”). With meticulous attention to detail, we see hot rods, girls wearing letter sweaters, ponytails, and saddle shoes.  The picture begins on a high, exciting note, with a chase scene in the desert. On the road, there is a convertible, loaded with beautiful girls who are teasing the soldiers, while the soundtrack plays Elvis Presley's tunes. The mid-to-late 1950s were emblematic of music, of the beginning of rock 'n roll, of Technicolor, of suburban dreams by bright young faces that Norman Rockwell immortalized in his paintings. (Spielberg grew up in the 1950s, and I will not be surprised if it's still his favorite decade as far as Americana and pop culture are concerned).  A convoy of Soviet military camouflaged in American army vehicles drives into a remote nuclear testing base, desperately looking for some object. Held prisoner, Dr. Jones helps them with his knowledge and skills. Few minutes later, Indiana and his sidekick George “Mac” McHale (Brit Ray Winstone, excellent as usual) barely escape a close scrape with nefarious Soviet agents on the distance, secretive airfield.  Professor Jones returns home to Marshall College, only to find things have gone bad. The dean of the college and close friend (Jim Broadbent) explains that Indy's recent activities have made him the object of suspicion and that the government and the FBI have put pressure on him to fire Indyalbeit with full salary and benefits.  On his way out of town, Indy bumps into Mutt (LaBeouf), a youth whose physical appearance pays tribute to Marlon Brando's iconic role in “The Wild One” (1954), wearing a white t-shirt, sexy leather jacket and jeans, and riding a motorcycle. Proudly introducing himself as a dropout, Mutt describes his family background, revealing anger, grudge, and dissatisfaction. But he also makes an alluring proposition for the adventurous Indy: If he'll help Mutt on a mission with deeply personal stakes, Indy could make one of the most archeological finds in historythe Crystal Skull of Akator, a mysterious, legendary object that holds fascination, superstition, and fear.  In short order, Indy and Mutt set out for the most remote corner of Peru, a land of ancient tombs, forgotten explorers, and rumored city of gold. As expected, the odd couple soon realizes that they are not the only ones in search of the treasure. The Soviet agents are also hot on the trail of the Crystal Skull.  Chief among them is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, sporting a Louise Brooks hairstyle and heavy Russian accent), the icily cold but devastatingly beautiful commissar who was introduced in the very first act, during a search of a military warehouse. Like Indy, Irina and her elite military squad is scouring the globe for the eerie Crystal Skull, which they believe can help the Soviets dominate the world through brains-washing, or control of the human mind. The “only” problem is how to locate it, and once found, how to unlock its ancient secrets.  The saga's running theme is rather simple: Indy and Mutt, later joined by Mary, must find ways to evade the ruthless Soviets. The two groups follow seemingly impenetrable trails of mysteries, grapple with human enemies (primitive tribes that look as if they were taken out of Mel Gibson's “Apocalypto”) and friends of questionable motives, and Nature itself, in the form of monkeys, ants, water falls, and so on.  To that extent, the narrative is structured as a series of chases, encounters, separations, and reencounters between Indy and his group, which also includes Mac (a man with at least two or three identities) and Oxley (John Hurt), a somehow damaged and bruised man who knows more than given credit.  Some critics may have issues with this adventure's old-fashioned nature, but I think it was consciously done to fit into the general pattern of the three previous chapters that were made in 1981, 1984, and 1989 respectively.  Inevitably, “Indy Jones 4” is self-conscious, self-reflexive, and self-referential. How could it not be You'll smile when you see again the map, the old vehicles, the plane. I got a kick out of watching the red line, which in Hollywood movies of the past was used to show viewers that the hero is hop-scotching across the globe.  With the exception of some state-of-the-arts special effects, technically speaking, the art design, costume, and the staging of the various action scenes have the feel of late 1980s pictures.  The 1950s setting almost calls for references to Cold War pictures, and in moments, particularly those featuring Cate Blanchett, you're fondly sent back to the early James Bond flicks, such as “Dr. No” and “From Russia With Love,” in which the villains were communist spies.  A good deal of the humor derives from the banter between Indiana Jones and former lover Marion Ravenhood. We learn that he broke off his promise to marry her, that in his view, she married a man not worthy of her.  The tale's second part revolves around a newly formed group, headed by Jones, Marion, and Mutt, and also including Mac, who keeps changing identities and loyalties, and Professor Oxley, the most bizarre character, made even more bizarre by John Hurt's eccentric performance. Jones and Oxley were colleagues, who went to school together until their paths separated. (I can't reveal more than that). Just watch Hurt's expression when he finally recognizes his peer and exclaims, Dr. Jones Junior (emphasis on junior), which of course immediately signals Jones' troubled (and Freudian) relationship with his own domineering father, played by Sean Connery; at one point, Jones sits at his desk and looks at Connery's photo. For younger viewers, sections of the film–around the middle of the saga–might feel too verbose, with long speeches and explanations of the origins of the mysterious object and its powers.  But then comes the last, most thrilling reel, which, again, may be too desperate to entertain, disregarding coherence and genre conventions in the name of exciting fights and special and sound effects that include attacks by monkeys, lethal ants, scary water falls, and a long sword play between Irina and Mutt, positioned on parallel cars, that would make swashbuckling heroes like Errol Flynn proud. Most of the film's visual motifs borrow from (and pay tribute to) to seminal mythic adventures that both Lucas and Spielberg have made, in such films as “Star Wars” (the first series), “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (1977), “E.T.” (1981), and of course, the “Indiana Jones” series that began in 1981 with “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the first and (for me) still the best of the four chapters.  Spielberg has never been very good with endings, and this picture is no exception. The very last scene depicts a wedding ceremony (I won't tell who are the newly wed), attended by the friendly protags, and with Indy's notorious and magical fedora flying into the church and landing where it belongs.
