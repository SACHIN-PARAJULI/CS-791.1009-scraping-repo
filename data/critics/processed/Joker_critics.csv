"Jan 27, 2024"," Ha llegado el estreno comercial de Guasón (Joker, 2019), una de las películas más esperadas del año cargada de expectativas tanto en el ámbito del cine como de los fans de las historietas de super-héroes. Recordemos que la primera aparición del Guasón fue en 1940 dentro de la historieta de Batman, en la cual se establecía una clara rivalidad entre ambos a través de la tradicional dicotomía entre buenos y malos, caracterizando al Guasón como su “archienemigo”.  Esta transposición dirigida por Todd Phillips (Viaje Censurado, Starsky & Hutch, ¿Qué pasó ayer?, Amigos de armas) y co-escrita con Scott Silver(8 Mile, The Fighter) se centra únicamente en el personaje del “villano” en cuestión, quien es el único protagonista del relato. Guasón (Joker, 2019) a diferencia de la mayoría de las películas sobre comics, tiene una profundidad emocional distinta alejándose de los elencos corales y efectos especiales a los que el género tiene acostumbrado a sus fanáticos. Por esa misma razón a diferencia de las películas del genero de los últimos años, Guasón no está dirigida únicamente a los fans, sino que puede resultar atractiva para toda clase de público y es sin dudas lo más interesante en la filmografía de Phillips mostrando un gran crecimiento.  Guasón nos presenta una “Ciudad Gótica” ambientada entre 1970-1980 cuya arquitectura y urbanismo son muy similares a la New York de aquellos años. Esto se debe a que como ha mencionado el director en varias entrevistas aquellos años fueron de inspiración para el ambiente que se deseaba crear como entorno del personaje, pero aún más porque la intención (sin dudas lograda) de Phillips era reproducir el contexto de producción de películas estrenadas entre 1970-1980, no solo en cuanto a la estética de la película sino a las condiciones de realización de los mismos. Es por ello que directores como Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, 1976; King of comedy, 1982), Sidney Lumet (Dog day afternoon,1975; Network,1976) y Arthur Penn (Penn & Teller Get Killed, 1989) fueron inspiradoras en este proceso y poseen relaciones intertextuales con Guasón, al igual que más distanciadamente otros largometrajes del periodo mencionado anteriormente como por ejemplo The Warriors (1979) y One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). En un entorno que como dice el protagonista es cada vez peor, Arthur Fleck se convertirá en el Guasón/Joker. El espectador podrá ser testigo cercano de ello mediante una excelente dosificación de la información y de la acción que construirán una narración en crescendo al igual que el proceso de autoconocimiento del personaje. Mediante la risa tan peculiar del Guasón, interpretado mediante una composición precisa y maravillosa de Joaquin Phoenix, entenderemos fácilmente que el no poder controlarla o el que se produzca de forma adversa a lo esperado socialmente, que Arthur siempre se sale de la “norma”, pues en términos freudianos el chiste es una expresión del inconsciente y como tal resulta satisfactoria. El filme es entonces, un retrato, un estudio de un hombre ignorado y marginado por la sociedad cuyo sueño de ser comediante no sólo no puede llevarse a cabo, sino que además es violentado en el intento. En dicho sentido hay una evidente relación intertextual con El rey de la comedia (King of comedy, 1982) la cual era protagonizada por Robert De Niro, también un aspirante a comediante quien con el afán de salir en un masivo programa de televisión es capaz de cualquier cosa. Lo interesante es que en Guasón, Robert De Niro interpreta a Murray Franklin un anfitrión de un programa televisivo con una larga trayectoria y a quien Arthur siempre ha admirado. En este sentido, al igual que varias películas de los ´70 y ´80, se expresa la importancia y alcance de los medios masivos de comunicación en la vida cotidiana. El personaje interpretado por De Niro en El rey de la comedia, Rupert Pupkin, decía al final de la misma: “Mejor ser rey por un día que un schmuck toda la vida” vistiendo un traje color rojo, al igual que el Joker en cuestión. Por último, a través de la búsqueda de identidad de Arthur/Guasón se construye un “villano” mucho más humano que en otras adaptaciones, sin embargo, con el acierto de no generar necesariamente empatía con el espectador sino representándolo como una víctima del cruel sistema posmoderno. Es importante recalcar que, si bien la película en general tiene un gran nivel narrativo y estético, y que sin ánimos de realizar un spoiler las alucinaciones producto de la patología del personaje están muy bien utilizadas y debido a la dosificación de la información que se mencionó anteriormente son formalmente ingeniosas. Sin embargo, la explicación de las mismas puede objetarse es un desacierto ya que se subestima la inteligencia del espectador o clausura su sentido y lectura sobre las mismas, aunque por otro lado es porque hay una clara intención del filme de caracterizar al guasón y su enfermedad psiquiátrica y sus problemas hereditarios. Mientras que el Guasón interpretado por Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight, 2008) buscaba voluntariamente la anarquía, el Guasón encarnado por Joaquin Phoenix la producirá de forma inicialmente involuntaria, en una sociedad en donde “la violencia genera más violencia”. En dicho sentido, además de las relaciones intertextuales que poseen vínculos temáticos y por sobre todo que componen la estética de una época, en medio del relato se explicitan referencias mediante proyecciones públicas que resulta pertinente destacar porque poseen un significado con respecto a la trama. En principio, la inicial manifestación pública de la clase popular con máscaras de payasos, transcurre frente a un evento de la clase alta en el cual se proyecta Tiempos modernos (1936), lo cual no es casual porque en ella Chaplin expresaba las consecuencias del sistema capitalista y realizaba una fuerte crítica al sistema de producción en serie industrial. La segunda, tiene que ver más bien con una característica principal del comic de Batman y el brutal asesinato de sus padres, cuando Bruce Wayne es un niño. Este acontecimiento es narrado en Guasón a la salida de una sala de cine, y la película allí proyectada parece ser Zorro: The gay blade (1981) cuyo protagonista es igual que Batman otro héroe enmascarado de negro. En conclusión, la idea central que parece regir toda la película es la subjetividad de dicotomías tan antiguas como la humanidad misma, el bien y el mal, y la comedia y la tragedia. A través del personaje del Guasón y de la utilización de su rostro como máscara, intentará deconstruir las dicotomías y valores establecidos por la norma. Por todas estas razones se celebra la propuesta de Guasón dentro del popular universo cinematográfico de los comics, porque también nos recuerda que, aunque la producción y transposiciones de las historietas de super-héroes estén en ascenso o sean masivas en el público, no justifica la superficialidad de la psicología de los personajes, ni la baja calidad narrativa en sus producciones.

"Jan 8, 2024"," Todd Phillips’ Joker offers a decent account of how the loner clown came to be the agent of mayhem and Batman’s nemesis. The film begins with the sounds of the radio seeping in over a black screen, describing the filth of Gotham City before Arthur Fleck fills the frame, painting his face white. He’s a clown-for-hire, trying to bring joy into the world but more often than not relegated to demeaning jobs like being a sign-spinner for local collapsing businesses. After he is beaten by street kids and has one such sign stolen and destroyed, the (anti) hero is a broken shell of a man, the water leaking from his gag boutonnière onto the cold pavement below. The screen is stamped with large, gritty type: JOKER. This is the kind of movie we’re looking at. It’s a villain origin story, nothing more, nothing less. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver already have the luxury of working with a known comic book property, complete with a chaotic evil protagonist template. Visually, Joker is a triumph. Production designer Mark Friedberg puts in the work to build a Gotham City that lives up to the declaration of Jack Nicholson’s Joker: “This town needs an enema.” Throuh the lens of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, a washed-out palette of muted gem tones adds to the lifeless grime aesthetic, with color saturation getting warmer and more vibrant as Arthur slips further into the void. It’s a far cry from the clean lines, bold hues and ominous shadowplay of the cinematic Joker predecessor to beat, The Dark Knight Rises. Staging often positions Fleck as fractured or at odds with his own reflection, an especially uncanny bit of photography to a previous Phoenix slow brew: Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here. When Joker’s trailer dropped, concerns rose over the film’s potential appeal to white supremacists, particularly with regards to the POC characters that seemingly antagonize the sad clown. To a degree, Joker is insensitive to race, but not in the manner expected. Arthur encounters plenty of brown-skinned characters throughout the film (a social worker, a medical staffer, hoodlum children) that either don’t give him what he wants or actively hurt him, but these people are almost part of Joker’s color palette; more presence than character. Despite limited screen time, Zazie Beetz turns in a solid performance as Arthur’s neighbor down the hall (and the object of his fantasy), Sophie Dumond. Still, the single mother just trying to get through her day exists only in service of Fleck’s arc. Frances Conroy is especially heartbreaking as Penny Fleck, Arthur’s ailing mother and roommate, and her place is largely on the sidelines as well. Gender-wise, that’s forgivable, considering that Joker chronicles Arthur’s warped journey as changing perceptions of each woman add to his transformation. Race-wise, the film draws a class distinction that declares all creeds and colors to be united under a collective discarded status. As Arthur sits across from his social worker, a black woman (Sharon Washington’s character is simply listed as “social worker”), she is given the task of breaking the news that her department will be shutting down due to budget cuts. When he asks where to go for his myriad of anti-depressants, she sighs and says (and I’m paraphrasing here), “They don’t give a shit about you. They don’t give a shit about me, either.” The city’s only hope is placed in a billionaire out of touch with the real problems plaguing the city, and the animosity towards the one percent can be felt throughout the entire runtime. “I imagine that some people who are angered by the film will say that it advocates violence as a cure for frustration. But to acknowledge that when a psychopath’s blood boils over he may cool down is not the same as justifying the eruption.” Depiction is not the same as endorsement, and the pearl-clutching insistence that it is puts the overwhelmingly liberal decriers of Joker at a discomforting alignment with the Tipper Gores and the Mary Whitehouses of the censor-happy politicians that they hate so viciously. Any critic with a modicum of film history in their arsenal should be well aware that the same exact hand-wringing has been going on since Bonnie and Clyde were riddled with bullets on the big screen in 1968. Sure, copycat crimes occurred after the release of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. But the British youths that assaulted their fellow citizens were already violent; now they simply had a Droog costume to put on while they beat people up. It’s like the co-killer says in Wes Craven’s Scream: “Movies don’t create psychos, movies make psychos more creative.” So while there is a place in discourse to dissect the effect art has on culture, this particular noise is no louder than the din of outrage that has occured for decades, through the Death Wish films, to the Video Nasties, to Natural Born Killers to now. That being said, what Joker says about the phoniness of the upper crust, Joe (1971) says better. What it says about mental illness and the way we fail those who need help, Christine (2016) has in spades. What Phillips says about loneliness, Hal Ashby’s entire filmography says better. Joker is a comic book film putting on a clean collared shirt and dressing up as Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver for the high school reunion. The references are egregious, from the finger-gun-to-the-temple gesture to the (unnecessary, in this case) bird’s-eye-view rotation pan. The departure from Scorsese’s film is felt the hardest in Arthur’s ticking time-bomb arc. While he is pushed ever-closer to the brim of tolerance, the violent outburst is abrupt, first in self-defense and then predatory. He shoots some folks that were kicking him, feels empowered, then it’s off to the races. Joker wants to emulate Scorsese’s work (and it proudly does), but Arthur Fleck lacks Travis Bickle’s internal running (simmering) meter, and thus the journey from outcast to agent of destruction doesn’t quite achieve such heights. It does, however, fit well into the villain origin formula, albeit routinely. Phillips and Silver tick the genre boxes without redefining anything, but it’s enough to satisfy as comfort food does. Outside of the script, Phoenix’s performance as the Joker is a phenomenal one. It’s not just the weight loss: he fully understands the difference between likability and empathy, leaning hard into the ethos of the anti-hero: not only must his surroundings be perceived as worse than he, the outcast has to connect with the audience somehow. Arthur’s tortured existence emphasizes both his loneliness and the fact that he’s just doing his best from day to day. The human connection is simple, but the lead actor sticks the landing. Phoenix puts on a pained funhouse cackle with all of the frustrated fragility that I have when resisting an oncoming but unstoppable anxiety attack. He also shows restraint in the clownery, understanding that he’s at his most intimidating when quietly whispering, “All I have are negative thoughts.” The pendulum swing from subdued to hysterical is applied with purpose from scene to scene, allowing Arthur and Joker more tangibility than the pages he’s written on would allow. Arthur’s nihilism is harvested in the unforgiving streets of the fictional Gotham City, fermented in the musty office space where he is at the mercy of a callous administrator’s whims and matured on the upending of every comforting truth he held dear. Joker’s spite is a constant, with the only variable being the type of pressure applied to him. The only repreive from such pressure comes in the form of fantasy and violence. Arthur’s social estrangement and economic abandonment is so desperate that he conjures up scenarios in which he is accepted, celebrated and loved for who he is. After unloading a bullet or a slash of the blade, the clown falls into a post-orgasmic state of bliss, involving either a balletic interprative dance or an exhausted comedown in a pool of blood. Throughout, Phoenix’s physicality is jaw-dropping, a gargoyle threatening to burst forth from Charlie Chaplin’s Tramp prototype like an H.R. Giger chestburster. Concerns about Phillips’ ability to avoid glorifying such a character are slightly validated with the second-most baffling needle drop of 2019 (just behind the “Angel of the Morning” head-scratcher in It Chapter Two), a Jock Jams fist-pumper played as Arthur heads out to execute his twisted plan. But it’s more odd than foreboding; a missed opportunity to further showcase Hildur Guðnadóttir’s memorable score. Missteps such as this pepper the film and prevent it from becoming as powerful as it strives to be. What Joker does accomplish is a beautifully bleak usage of the anti-hero’s journey as a call to consider our world differently. According to Phillips, the real problem isn’t Joker, it’s the unfeeling society that creates a Joker and then recoils when he responds in kind to the world that spawned him. No solutions, just a call-out of the hypocrisy, which is very Joker-esque in itself. All said, Joker is what so many controversial films turn out to be: it’s fine — neither masterpiece nor trash fire, well-executed in some parts and poorly thought out in others. In the end, it was just a movie. Anya Stanley (@BookishPlinko) is a horror-centric columnist and film critic.

"Oct 13, 2023"," What the film wants to say — about mental illness or class divisions in society — is not as interesting as what it accidentally says about whiteness.  Before “Joker” opened last weekend, much was being made of how its tale of a murderous villain echoed news stories of mass shooters and incel threats, and how the film might encourage unbalanced viewers to commit acts of violence. As it turned out, it mainly inspired audiences to open their wallets for the biggest October opening ever.   After watching the film, I could understand the concerns: Directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix as the deranged clown Arthur Fleck, the title character, “Joker” is simultaneously a well-made film in its own right and a blatant mash-up of “The King of Comedy” and “Taxi Driver.” It nods at classism and winks at the Bruce Wayne family mythos, but at its core the movie is about a mentally ill loner.  Still, what struck me most is that what the film wants to say — about mental illness or class divisions in American society — is not as interesting as what it accidentally says about whiteness. For it is essentially a depiction of what happens when white supremacy is left unchecked. It shows the delusions that many white men have about their place in society and the brutality that can result when that place is denied.   The fact that the Joker is a white man is central to the film’s plot. A black man in Gotham City (really, New York) in 1981 suffering from the same mysterious mental illnesses as Fleck would be homeless and invisible. He wouldn’t be turned into a public figure who could incite an entire city to rise up against the wealthy. Black men dealing with Fleck’s conditions are often cast aside by society, ending up on the streets or in jail, as studies have shown.   And though Fleck says he often feels invisible, had he been black, he truly would have been — except, of course, when he came into contact with the police. They’d be sure to see him.

"Aug 28, 2023"," Joaquin Phoenix shines as Joker in an origin story that is drenched in emotion. The most anticipated movie at the 2019 Venice Film Festival might just be the best film of the year. Todd Phillips’ Joker is everything we hoped it would be, and more. From the very first moment Joaquin Phoenix appears, the beloved DC villain does nothing but surprise us, inspire us, move us and make us feel an impressive range of emotions. We fall in love with a side of his personality we recognise in ourselves, we feel for him for all the injustices he’s had to endure for his whole life and we can’t help but empathise with a villain who is broken, ill, alone and, first and foremost, a victim. Arthur Fleck is a complex man, and one who is constantly wearing a mask. And I’m not just talking of the clown costume he has to wear at work: his real mask is an invisible wall of sadness, loneliness and rage that barely enables him to survive all the bullying and teasing he is subject to everyday. Gotham’s streets are merciless, and its cruel, insensitive citizens are unable to feel any sympathy for a man who’s burdened with a neurological condition that he can’t control.  It took Phoenix a long time to master the Joker’s unique laughter, but, when he did, he absolutely nailed it. Phillips described it to him as “something that’s almost painful“, and that’s exactly what it is. It’s a kind of laughter that is also profoundly sad and, at the same time, somewhat disturbing. It’s overwhelming enough to choke him, and relentless enough to prevent him from telling everyone around him about his syndrome. As Phoenix himself put it, “there’s that part of him that’s trying to emerge”, and watching him struggle with his own, broken self is both absolutely heart-wrenching and incredibly moving. Arthur’s uncontrollable outbursts of laughter come at the most inappropriate times, and there’s nothing he can do to prevent them from happening. All he can do is hand over a card to better explain his syndrome to whoever happens to be there to witness it, but, in a world that is unable to feel any empathy, he is only ever met with diffidence, mistrust and sometimes even hatred and violence.  At home, he lives with a mentally fragile mother who has never really been there for him, and who burdened him with the responsibility to be as “Happy” as the nickname she gave him. In Gotham’s streets, he is teased, ridiculed and alienated from a world he never belonged to. And so he hides all his frustration in his own body and mind, and clings to any glimmer of warmth he can find, in his desperate search for love and connection. Todd Phillips’ Joker is a carefully constructed, highly emotional, incredibly fascinating psychological thriller that offers an original standpoint on one of the most captivating villains that have ever been written, but it’s also so much more than that. Both edge-of-your-seat suspenseful and deeply emotional, it’s a bittersweet drama that is also a gritty thriller and an entertaining comedy with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. And that is because Joker is also superbly written, excellently acted and, most of all, technically flawless.  The film’s cinematography is exceptional from the very start, and Hildur Guðnadóttir‘s (HBO’s Chernobyl) multilayered, melodic, string-based score flawlessly merges with a main character who is as melancholic as he is childlike. Music and sound have been planned to perfection to give us a mix of incredibly suspenseful scenes, shockingly violent sequences and energetic “rock n’ roll” moments that make you want to stand up and dance. There are immensely quotable dialogues, memorable scenes and plenty of references to 1970s classics, from One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.  It’s a tribute to Martin Scorsese and a love song to a specific time in cinema history we often remember with a smile and a teary eye.  It’s an engaging story that approaches the complex theme of mental health in a believable way, and that makes us root for a “madman” whose logical thoughts make a lot of sense, after all.  Which is exactly why it’s so easy for us to embrace Arthur’s transformation into the Joker. This villain is nothing but a victim who has been abandoned by every single person in his life, and whose desperate need to be loved and accepted led him to make a series of bad choices. So much that, when he finally becomes the iconic DC character he was meant to be, he does it as a hero. When Arthur finally takes off the mask and fully embraces himself as the Joker, it’s pure cinematic delight. It’s the moment we had all been waiting for, and not only is it epic and liberating, but it’s absolutely effortless.  This story’s underdog becomes the “hero”, and he is finally in his comfort zone. And, if Arthur was always struggling to keep his emotions at bay, the Joker is calculating, clever, brave. He finally knows how to start living: he takes the world as the biggest farce of all and everything becomes even more absurd, but in all the right ways. His dark humour is contagious, his spontaneity is childlike and his energy is so infectious that, as he takes his revenge on an all-too-familiar society, we are with him all the way. But the best joke of all is the one he shares with all of us – that is, that he is capable of anything.  “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? ” The Joker’s most insightful reflection perfectly sums up what Phillips’s poignant drama is all about. It’s about a victim of neglect who finally learns how to embrace his own madness and does it in the most liberating possible way. It’s an epic story that looks at mental illness in a realistic way, thanks to an extremely relatable character that demands our attention for the entire duration of the movie.  Joker is one of those stories that delicately draw you into an incredibly appealing world and keep on surprising with shocking twists and unexpected references. It’s a clever gem of a movie that approaches its complex themes with extreme simplicity. It’s Joaquin Phoenix’s best performance to date, and an impressive film whose well-written screenplay and breathtaking photography match the quality of every single aspect of its production. Most of all, it’s a powerful drama about human connection that is absolutely drenched in emotion.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023"," This piece was published during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn't exist. Todd Phillips' film The Joker about the Batman's arch-nemesis has received ecstatic accolades. It's also been accused of glorifying white male rage. This praise and this criticism aren't opposed; they're two sides of the same smile. Assessments of quality in film are closely tied to preconceptions about gender. Movies that embrace a male perspective or male concerns are often seen as important, edgy, real, and profound. The Joker demonstrates that a certain kind of toxic masculinity ensures high art cred. The movie features Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who lives with his mother, works as a clown-for-hire and longs to be a stand-up comic. Over the course of the film Arthur endures escalating indignities. He's robbed and beaten by kids, loses his job, loses access to his therapist, is rejected by his maybe father billionaire Thomas Wayne, and discovers that his mother was institutionalized for neglecting him as a child. In response to these slights and traumas, he becomes increasingly violent, murdering three wealthy jerks who harass him on the train, and killing comedian Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) live on air. These acts of violence, done in clown make-up, inspire a violent populist movement, and the film ends with Arthur in (still in that make-up)Tje  dancing happily amidst a burning city. The Joker, set in a filthy, seedy metropolis meant to evoke New York of the 70s and early 80s, is obviously indebted to Taxi Driver. But Arthur isn't just Travis Bickle. He's also that other DeNiro character Jake LeMotta of Raging Bull, Walter White of Breaking Bad, Tony Soprano of the Sopranos, and all the other complicated, dangerous, violent, but sympathetic white men who populate prestige film and television. Phoenix's mercurial method performance—laughing uncontrollably, veering between vulnerability and hyperbolic violence—registers as visceral and meaningful in part because white men behaving badly is a trope for visceral meaningfulness. The key to unlocking that meaningfulness is ambiguity. The viewer should empathize with the Complicated White Man, without fully condoning his acts. Perhaps even more importantly, the movie has to capitalize on the fact that the complicated hero is a white man, without acknowledging that the way that violent fantasies are linked to racism and sexism. So for example Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver shaves his head like a radicalized skinhead, but without an explicit white supremacist ideology. The Joker is a masterclass in this kind of cowardly but validating dogwhistle. Arthur is first beaten up by a group of teens of color. He gets his revenge on the cruel, chaotic city via a Bernard Goetz like shooting on a subway. But the movie carefully makes sure the victims there are wealthy white men, even if they evoke Arthur's non-white tormentors. Similarly Arthur's resentment of the two black women who serve as his therapists doesn't escalate to violence (or if it does, it's presented very elliptically.) He stalks another black woman in his building, but again he doesn't actually harm her. He murders his mother, but without the explicit bloodiness of his other kills, and only after it's established that she was complicit in his childhood abuse. A little person is mocked and humiliated, to make Arthur seem more powerful and tougher in comparison—but Arthur doesn't actually kill him. Arthur rants about how the city has become crueler and ruder, but the MAGA implications about changing demographics and the encroachments of non-white people are rigorously blurred out.  Arthur's anger is identifiably white and male, which makes it important and profound. But it's not too identifiably white and male, which would make him a white nationalist terrorist. His resentment is, we're assured, is not anti-woman or anti-black, but anti-elitist. It's directed especially at Thomas Wayne, the man who should be Arthur's father, but has rejected him, denying him the wealth and power to which he is entitled. Racism and misogyny are painted over with the familiar clown make-up of economic anxiety. The Joker is celebrated for its white male antihero—and even moreso because of its obsessive, unitary focus on that antihero. Except for a very brief detour at the end of the film to reprise Batman's origin story, Phoenix is ""at the dark heart of every scene"" as critic Owen Gleiberman enthuses.  If he's not there for a dramatic moment—like his mother's stroke—then that moment is left off-screen, unfilmed. You're so deep in Arthur's head that it takes most of the movie before you realize that his romantic relationship with a woman he meets on the elevator (Zazie Beetz) is a delusion. The singular, claustrophobic attention on Arthur is meant to convey intensity and auteurish concentration. As Laura Mulvey explained in her famous essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"", classic Hollywood cinema is ""structur[ed]…around a main controlling figure with whom the spectator can identify.""  Mulvey adds that the viewer identifies with the male lead as he moves the action forward, creating a ""satisfying sense of omnipotence."" Arthur, initially disempowered, bullied, and despised, picks up the gun and by the end of the film is giggling and chortling as he shoots down his enemies. One of the films more striking images is of his clown face looming in a television camera, filling the screen and taking control entirely of what you see and what is filmed. Arthur's assertion of control and power is also director Phillips' assertion of ownership; a demand that the viewer recognize the (male) artistry on display. And this assertion of male control connects the film to the classic validating history of Hollywood cinema. It's not an accident that the movie ends with an evocation of Psycho's final scenes.  Arthur, shut up in an asylum, breaks into uncontrollable laughter, just as Norman Bates, locked in the police station, breaks into an eerie smile.  The implication is that Arthur and Norman are in on the same joke. The joke in both cases is that the director both gets to disavow white male murderousness and claim credit for it. The clichéd antihero, the disingenuous dogwhistles, the ostentatious erasure of other perspectives, the references to other white guy protagonists, all make The Joker read as an important film to many cultural arbiters. In a patriarchal society, masculinity is celebrated, and that means that toxic masculinity is seen as profound, serious, controversial, gritty, real, and cool. The Joker shows that no matter how tired the act, critics will look at even the most clownish white guy, and take him seriously.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Synopsis: Joker centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen. Todd Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham's fractured society. A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night...but finds the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. Obviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time. I'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight. In conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show… He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level. Throughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). ""The world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile. It's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfectly. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward nor give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just… there. A Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on their way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative. Regarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film's messages is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?! Nowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. In the same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true? All in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant! PS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?” That’s the question asked by the titular character of Joker, a film that luxuriates in giving us the answer. By now, anyone with a pulse knows that Joker is the origin story of Batman’s arch nemesis. But non-superhero fans should be undeterred because the film barely references the DC Comics universe. The sparse Batman tie-ins feel more like a cynical ploy to guarantee profitability as opposed to essential elements of the story. At its core, Joker is a character study of a man struggling with, and then succumbing to, mental illness. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck – a fleck of a man, as his name implies. Aspiring to become a stand-up comic, Fleck works a soul-sapping job, lives with his mom, and visits an apathetic social worker to keep from going insane. Fleck’s life is presented as a series of tragic encounters within the confines of Gotham City, circa 1981, made all the more disturbing by his uncontrollable fits of inappropriate laughter. Gotham is a soulless metropolis in the midst of a garbage strike. News reports of Super Rats invading the city provide an amusing wink-wink, nudge-nudge. Thomas Wayne, a Trump-like narcissist running for Mayor, refers to those beneath him as clowns. Wayne even throws a fundraiser at a movie theater where rich people laugh at a poor person vis-à-vis Charlie Chaplin. And of all the Little Tramp movies that could have been inserted into the narrative, it’s probably not a coincidence it’s Modern Times, drawing a subtle line between Fleck’s world and ours. After Fleck goes full Charles Bronson on several threatening Wall Streeters, he inadvertently triggers a down-with-the-rich counterculture movement of which he becomes the de facto figurehead. It also marks the start of his downward decent into homicidal madness. Joker’s raison d`être is Jaoquin Phoenix’s attempt at filling some very big clown shoes previously occupied by such master thespians as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. The result is revelatory. The way Phoenix talks, laughs, and contorts his emaciated body is simultaneously unsettling and enthralling. He elicits pity as his character struggles to maintain his sanity, and then spine chills as he turns into a cold-blooded murderer who thinks his victims are getting exactly what they deserve. Among film critics, Joker has been somewhat divisive. But at the time of this review, a quarter of a million votes cast by audience members has placed it at the number ten spot on IMDb’s list of Top Rated Movies, just below Pulp Fiction and Once Upon a Time in the West. Such a strong public reception makes it a film to be reckoned with. At this year’s Venice Film Festival, where Joker won the top prize, Todd Phillips, the director and co-writer, said it’s not a political film. That seems patently disingenuous considering what he puts on display, including wealth disparity, healthcare issues, and a simmering rage among the general population that’s on the verge of boiling over. Then there’s this: Arthur Fleck is an unreliable narrator, and the concluding scene calls into question everything previously shown. In other words, the dysfunctional society that so resembles our own could be nothing more than the manifestations of the Joker’s crazed mind. It’s hard to imagine a more sobering indictment of our current reality. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz.

"Apr 25, 2023"," It happens every year. All of us cinephiles look forward to the Oscars the same way most sports fans look forward to the Super Bowl. The Academy Award nominations fill each of us with eager anticipation to see if our favorite films will be nominated for Best Picture. We’ve seen the films, we’ve made predictions after following awards’ season, we’ve argued hotly on Twitter. Now- it’s the moment of truth. Usually- we have been correct in our predictions of what is nominated. What I enjoy most, though, is the outrage we feel when a movie we absolutely love has been snubbed, when at least one, far unworthier film has made the cut. This series will look at that one undeserving film of each year. The film that for that year, and several years after, has film lovers thinking, “On what planet was this movie nominated?” I will present the WORST nominee of each year, and present, in its place, a film I feel is far more deserving of a Best Picture nomination. The year is 2020. There is a global pandemic. It’s an election year. Civil unrest burns across our country. In entertainment, we lose Max Von Sydow, Carl Reiner, Jerry Stiller, and Olivia DeHavilland.  To say this year can best be described as bleak is an understatement. However, there is one brief, bright, glorious moment that unites all of film twitter and gives us hope.  That moment is at the 2020 Academy Awards when Parasite becomes the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture. The films of 2019 gave us other cinematic gifts as well, including films from master film-makers such as Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. Greta Gerwig reimagined and breathed new life into Little Women. On a more personal note, Joker becomes the first movie based on comic books that I actually enjoy. The nominees for Best Picture this past year are almost an embarrassment of riches. There is one film that was nominated, however, that did not deserve the multitude of accolades it received. I am sure many of you are assuming that I am speaking of Joker, but I am not. The movie that did not deserve to be nominated was Sam Mendes’s World War One film, 1917. 1917 is a story of a soldier who is tasked with delivering a message.  On his way to delivering the message, mayhem ensues.  1917 was a frontrunner up until the night of the ceremony. Everyone knew the best film of the year was Parasite but assumed that, like Roma the previous year, it had no chance of winning, as no foreign-language film has ever won Best Picture. Sam Mendes swept the Best Director category throughout awards season, and by Oscar night, his win, as well as 1917 for Best Picture, seemed inevitable. Not only is it not even close to being in the top 10 films that deal with war, it definitely did not deserve its Best Picture nomination. There are several films about war that have won Best Picture. All Quiet on the Western Front, The Best Years of Our Lives, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Bridge Over the River Kwai all present a look at the psychological effects of war. These classics go far beyond the technical skills of the film-makers.  All provides a new and fresh perspective. They also have complex characters changing throughout the film. All Quiet on the Western Front remains profoundly moving, even though it’s one of the earliest Best Picture winners. The film begins with young men filled with high patriotism and idealism. This idealism becomes shattered upon experiencing the horrors of trench warfare. The Best Years of Our Lives shows the devastation and depression that occurs when trying to return to “normal life” upon returning home when the war is over.  The David Lean films (Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia) give us two of the most significant, most nuanced characters in film history.  TE Lawrence, a brash scholar who unites Arab tribes to defeat the Turks during World War One.  We see him change from an ambitious soldier to a bloodthirsty warrior. The Bridge Over the River Kwai gives us Col. Nicholson, the perfect model of how a British Officer should be.  Yet, throughout the film, he starts completely losing his vision of what his original mission and enemy should be. The last ten minutes of that film, where he realizes what he has become, in addition to the tension built up by master film-maker Sir David Lean, one of the greatest and most satisfying endings in all film history.  All of the films present a unique vision of war. Each of these films deserved the title of Best Picture. I love Sam Mendes. I’m one of the few people who will still admit to loving American Beauty. I saw his production of Cabaret on Broadway, and it blew my mind.  Mendes deserved every accolade for both. These works are technical perfection but also cut to the core of the soul.  They have interesting, well developed, and incredibly flawed characters. In addition, they had original stories and plot development. 1917, however, can best be described as a mediocre war film. Yes, Roger Deakins worked his usual magic with cinematography, and all of the battles were very realistic. The idea to make the film appear like one, long tracking shot added a level of depth that allows audiences to feel that they are on the journey with the main character. This film deserved the technical achievement awards it received. George McKay did an adequate job as the soldier sent on a difficult mission.  Sadly, we know very little about his character, and the film does not allow him to grow or change in any significant ways. He spends most of the film running with his gun and trying not to get killed. I was shocked that there are people that felt he deserved a Best Actor nomination.  This is the year that Robert DeNiro paired up again with Martin Scorsese in The Irishman, gave a performance of a tormented man, and HE wasn’t nominated. As stated before, McKay has a great deal of talent, as seen in his other films (especially Captian Fantastic), but in this, he seems more focused on hitting his marks to make the shot, rather than giving his character any, well, characteristics. But, the worst crime of this film is it contains every single war trope seen in all war films. Battle scenes where things get blown up? Check. The main character going on some “impossible mission”? Check. A scene where a character we’ve come to know and love (usually one that provides comic relief) dies and gives his buddy a letter to send home to mom? Check. This film adds absolutely nothing new to the genre of war films. If you are craving for a movie about war, please check out other Academy Award Best Picture films that I have previously mentioned. One film that was unlike any other movie made last year, that deserved a nomination for Best Picture, is the Safdie Brothers’ fast-paced Uncut Gems. At first glance, the film doesn’t seem complicated. New York jeweler Howard Ratner (an excellent performance by Adam Sandler) is relying on an uncut opal from Ethiopia to be the solution to all of his problems. He plans to sell it at auction for a sum he believes is already agreed on. However, to win favor with a basketball star (Kevin Garnett doing an excellent job playing himself), he lends the treasure to the athlete, who feels an immediate connection with it upon holding it. For the next 2 hours and 15 minutes, this rock is passed from character to character, each needing it to complete his life.  Throughout the film, Ratner is continuously on the go, ravaged by desperation. He is a degenerate gambler that constantly needs the adrenalin rush of winning. He takes the money he wins that he should be using to pay his debt to a set of gangsters, and rather than paying his debts; he uses the winnings to place higher and higher bets. Tension builds from the opening shot, and the rest of the film literally makes you feel like you are having an anxiety attack. There is a frenetic pacing in this film that I have never experienced.  Uncut Gems is unlike any movie I’ve ever seen before, and more people definitely need to see it. It’s an ugly look at the horror of gambling addiction. These factors contribute to why Uncut Gems deserved a Best Picture nomination over the safe and traditional 1917.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2023"," The theatrical trailer for Joker — tight, controlled, and intriguing — suggested the best movie Martin Scorsese never made. The actual movie is a shallow and sophomoric effort that isn’t about a raging bull as much as it’s merely raging bullshit. Nevertheless, the Scorsese connection is there, with two titles particularly coming into play. Like 1976’s Taxi Driver, Joker is the study of a disturbed individual who eventually finds his catharsis through violence, and, like 1982’s The King of Comedy, it’s a look at a man who desperately wants to become a famous comedian, complete with all the attendant trappings. This all takes place in a movie that at once exists within the comic-book milieu while also simultaneously wanting to remain apart from it. Set in the Gotham City of 1981 (we know this because a movie theater is showing Blow Out and Zorro: The Gay Blade), this stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, who’s been beaten down by life — and beaten up by everyone around him — from Day One. Desperately wanting to become a beloved comedian like his idol, talk-show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, cast because of his Scorsese connection but, at the end of the day, badly miscast), he toils as a clown-for-hire while waiting for his big break. But nothing is easy for him, as he’s irritated by his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), mocked by co-workers, assaulted by a gang of street kids, insulted by Murray on live television, and harassed by three Wall Street slugs. It’s that last act that pushes him over the edge, as he turns into 1984-vintage Bernhard Goetz and shoots all of them. Their deaths turn Fleck into a hero — finally, someone sticking it to the rich bastards! — and from here, he only becomes more unhinged. In all of his previous incarnations — in comics, on TV, in movies — I’ve never thought of the Joker as a cowardly person, yet that’s not the case here. He’s clearly a coward — and so is the movie that shelters him. Writer-director Todd Phillips, the Road Trip / The Hangover guru who’s clearly out of his league here, and co-scripter Scott Silver huff and puff and try to blow all sociopolitical issues into the filmic conversation, but the movie is all surface and ultimately doesn’t even have the power of its supposed convictions. Heath Ledger’s Joker, Jack Nicholson’s Joker, and even Jared Leto’s Joker (if memory serves, as I won’t be revisiting Suicide Squad at any point in this lifetime) all had no problem hurting innocent people — ditto another psycho who lived with his invalid “mother,” Norman Bates. But that’s not the case here. Arthur Fleck takes care to spare the few decent people in his life — an attractive neighbor (Zazie Beetz), a diminutive co-worker (Leigh Gill) — while reserving all his ire for the bad people. This includes Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), little Bat-Bruce’s dad and such a repellent character that you can’t wait for him to get shot in that alley (faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth, always the spark of humanity in Batman projects, also registers as a jerk). It’s a bald attempt by Phillips to make Arthur Fleck sympathetic, but that proves to be a major blunder. Even while protecting Jodie Foster’s child prostitute, Taxi Driver‘s Travis Bickle was never sympathetic — his craziness and creepiness always remained front and center. But Phillips doesn’t want to alienate large segments of his audience — specifically, the white males who feel picked on by women, minorities, and well-to-dos, and who won’t be happy until they can bask in their self-entitlement — so he eases the brakes on Fleck’s otherwise all-encompassing derangement. Fleck is a terrible stand-up comic, but the movie still suggests that he deserves success regardless. Hey, I’ve long wanted to be a star wide receiver in the NFL, but that doesn’t mean I automatically deserve a spot on the Rams or Cowboys roster. Phoenix delivers an overall strong performance as Fleck/Joker, even if his actorly tics and Method mannerisms are often on full display. What’s missing from his portrayal — admittedly as much of a fault with the script as with his emoting — is any glimmer of intelligence behind those eyes. The character of the Joker works best as a brilliant counterpoint to the Dark Knight, someone whose brain is always working at Mach speed. Ledger conveyed this perfectly, and even Nicholson’s Joker, initially a mob flunky, was an expert on human nature, able to read, understand and act upon the flaws and frailties of other people. By contrast, Phoenix’s Joker seems rather dim-witted, hardly the stuff of supervillain legend. Joker is exceedingly well-crafted, but the impressive technical achievements count for little in a movie that’s aimless and unfocused in its trendy nihilism. Like Fight Club, it will serve as a rallying cry for a certain subset of self-pitying males. But Fight Club is a movie that has been misdiagnosed and misinterpreted by those who champion it the most. Joker, on the other hand, clearly lays out its cards and tells these easily triggered jokers exactly what they want to hear. It offers sympathy for the devil — the one that dances in the pale moonlight. I agree with some of your criticisms. The Joker is not brilliant here and it makes the “birth of a legendary character” aspect of the movie significantly weaker. That being said, I don’t understand why the movie is not allowed to empathize with “white males who feel picked on by women, minorities, and well-to-dos”. This movie gave me a better understanding of what it’s like to be so ridiculously unlucky that not only do you have an awful disease, SPOILERS a history of abuse and neglect, and no purpose whatsoever, but also that the fulfillment of your sexual desires is so outside the realm of possibility that the only solution is to create a complex fantasy involving a girl you’ve hardly spoken to. END SPOILERS These men you refer to are on the cusp of mental illness. Regardless of how you feel about what factors they might ascribe to the genesis of their pain (lack of attention from women being the main offender) these people, for after all they do have a deeper status as “people” beyond their group identity as “men”, are in immense pain. And thus they deserve our sympathy. I give this movie a lot of credit for putting us in the shoes of these men, and maybe by understanding these people better, we can reduce the amount of school shooters and nihilistic violence being committed by this group. Hi, Edward. Thanks so much for your thoughtful comments. Obviously, those who need help with mental issues should receive it, and it’s a shame our society — specifically, our government — doesn’t do more to help them. But these aren’t the people I meant in my sentence; these are not the ones that Todd Phillips is targeting. The operative words in my sentence fragment “specifically, the white males who feel picked on by women, minorities, and well-to-dos, and who won’t be happy until they can bask in their self-entitlement” are “feel” and “self-entitlement.” I’m referring not to those with serious mental problems but the run-of-the-mill trolls who usually identify themselves as MRAs, incels, white supremacists, etc. These people aren’t mentally ill; they’re just racist, sexist, xenophobic, and/or homophobic twits who employ Internet anonymity as their weapon of choice. The ones who attacked the recent ANNIE solely because the little girl was black; the ones who lambasted the GHOSTBUSTERS reboot solely because the leads were women; the ones who slammed BLACK PANTHER solely because it was about a black superhero; the ones who targeted CAPTAIN MARVEL solely because it was about a female superhero and Brie Larsen further triggered them with her not-unreasonable comments. Head to many of the negative reviews of JOKER that have been up for a few days, and you’ll see this ilk blasting the critics with all manner of vitriol — naturally, they save their greatest fury for the female critics, who have had to deal with being called everything from “cows” to “cunts.” These are the people to whom I refer, and these are the people who deserve no sympathy or respect. The lack of showing intelligence could be a product of his psychological state rather than innate intelligence. Think of people who regress in “psychological age” due to severe trauma—this seems to be a sufficient explanation for the criticism.  Even after certain events occur in the movie, it is evident that Joker’s behavior changes compared to where he was earlier in the film. Sorry, but us white men are the true victims these days , not the ladies or the minorities or the Mexicans. “Joker” is our movie. I agree with everything said about Joker, but I think you’re misremembering Nicholson’s Joker from the 1989 Batman film. In Batman, the Joker is described (in his police file) as “highly intelligent with aptitude’s in science, chemistry, and art”. As Joker he devises a brilliant scheme to taint household beauty products with chemicals which are alone innocuous, but when use in combination create a deadly neurotoxin. His plan can’t be figured out by the police, and is only uncovered by Batman, because Batman in the 1989 film is an even greater detective. Before he becomes Joker he is shown to be a highly competent criminal whose ambitions are only thwarted because of his compulsive desire to murder people that he doesn’t need to, and because he’s caught having an affair with his boss’ girlfriend. Thanks for writing, Ken, and for the additional info. I did indeed forget about that police file description, which I guess makes my case against the new Joker even stronger. Pretty sure that is not true. It is heavily implied that Arthur killed Beetz’s character – a scene that is also mirrored in the Asylum at the end. Thanks for writing, stranger. I’ve definitely seen tons of articles debating the issue, with the split about 50/50 on whether or not he did kill her (Pajiba interestingly has its two writers offer both “yes” and “no” theories). I personally don’t think he does because, as I noted elsewhere, the movie pulls most of its punches and wants audiences to like Joker to an extent. If he murdered Sophie (and possibly her child), viewers would lose all sympathy for him. Since he spared Gary, it follows that he would also spare Sophie. The people that you’re talking about, the ones that you made this movie for, they’re not mentally sound people.  You say that they’re JUST all the -ists and all the -phobes, you dismiss them as JUST trolls, but trolling is a type of behaviour and it has a cause. First things first – I’m not saying that the incel/white supremacist types aren’t in the wrong.  They do cause trouble for others, they do have a sense of entitlement, and their entire system of thinking is deeply flawed.  The problem is that they feel as if they are victims of a failing society as well.  They are people who cannot cope with the world as it exists and so they lash out.  They are overgrown children, but they don’t choose to be overgrown children.  It’s easy to have no sympathy with such a repugnant lot, but they’re still people. Society’s reaction to these people is to label them bad things and tell them that they’re terrible people.  This only furthers their delusions of victimhood.  They are not mentally fit people.  It’s not like they could just stop being awful at any time, but that’s exactly how they’re treated, as if they could just choose not to be unwell and are simply too stubborn to.  They are deficient and need help in coming to the conclusion that there is no world in which their behaviour is acceptable. This is really at the heart of the culture war.  Everyone goes on assuming that the other side all know they’re the bad guys but refuse to admit it, or that they revel in the evil they cause.  Such people are statistically very, very rare.  They are called psychopaths.  Sociopaths sometimes behave like this, but not all sociopaths are born such, and not all of them remain such their entire life.  Their brains are not fundamentally hardwired different than ours, as is the case with psychopaths. Condemning any group of people, be they incels or TERFs, shows a lack of compassion.  Every human behaves the way they do for a reason.  It’s not wrong to punish people who know what they’re doing is wrong and choose to do it anyway.  These are people who have become convinced that what they’re doing is right.  The only real solution to this problem is to divest them of that thought. So as long as they think they’re right and before we divest them of these thoughts, we should show compassion for a Klansman who kills a black man or a misogynist who rapes a woman? Give me a break. I agree with your synopsis. I found the movie strangely lacking something. Cunning? Phoenix lost too much weight, he came across as weak. I wasn’t terrified of him. I felt sorry for him. How is he later able to rally all the insane asylum folks? How is he to become a preacher to the disenfranchised? Most self proclaimed murderous, narcissistic profits have a certain amount of charisma.  I feel like they rinsed out Joachin’s natural ruggedness and made him this pathetic caricature. He did the best with the script he had. The laughing was unbelievable. It felt practiced and rehearsed. The dancing was creepy and just weird. There are many movies where the main character loses weight, and does not lose brain cells. The Machinest comes to mind. While perhaps these themes would be well served in a different movie — they didn’t seem to fit the Joker character we’ve come to know from other movies, comics, cartoons, etc.  Unless he makes some kind of radical transformation inside Arkham asylum, i find it hard to believe the Fleck character from his movie rises up to become the criminal mastermind that successfully battles Batman and the Gotham PD the way he is does in every other story out there..  Fleck’s criminal and psychotic behavior shown in this movie was killing people he though “deserved” it — and it did not negatively affect him.. But he was shown to want to hold down a job, feel “normal” with the help of medication, take care of his mother, and date a woman.. Kind of normal things!  But aside from the makeup — this origin story seems to be for someone different than the criminal that becomes Batman’s arch nemesis.. That part is just not believable, in my opinion..  And oh yeah, Robert DeNiro is a tremendous actor, of course.. But his character didn’t seem to have the fun and engaging personality that all late night talk show hosts portray onscreen.. definitely miscast as you said.. Thanks! When I saw that DeNiro was in the movie I thought immediately it was a king of comedy remake and that it would probably suck.  Little did I know that they would also make it as boring as Taxi Driver and as repulsive as the Machinist with a touch of the Master thrown in.  The movie actually would have been good if they had cut out about 45 minutes and three packs of cigarettes. I thought the movie really was best at bringing home what it is like to have a real mental condition Thank God most people dont know what it’s like, but it really hit close to home for me.  I liked the the plot twists and the abrupt violence reminded me of Animal Kingdom from Australia. But Jesus Christ how many cigarettes does he have to smoke, just because of one panel in one 1980’s graphic novel, and what the hell is wrong with his shoulder blade and why did they have to keep repeating themselves? I actually thought alot of the plot was very clever, and the mother son dynamic was very interesting. Anyhow the real villain was the editor who got too enamoured with all the beautiful footage and forgot to keep the movie within the range of the human bladder RIP Hitchcock.  Now this is what we get.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 22, 2022"," As often as we’ve seen how Batman’s parents died, we’ve seen just as many incarnations of the Joker character. In the simply titled Joker, we get yet another version and this one is probably the most toxic of them all and not in a satisfying way. There’s a lot of drama in playing the character of Joker. He’s the arch-nemesis of Batman and is a certifiable psychopath. In his various incarnations, he’s always been played with a manic flair, but the evolution of the character has been an increasingly bleak prospect. Cesar Romero was the least psychotic of the incarnations in the 1960s television series. Jack Nicholson took him to a bit more crazy lengths in 1989’s Batman, but he was still a relatively comical villain. Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning performance in The Dark Knight was about as unhinged as one can get while still being a cold-blooded, calculating lunatic. Then there’s Joaquin Phoenix here in Joker. For their re-invention of the character, director and co-writer Todd Phillips, along with writing partner Scott Silver, have made him an unlikeable person who suffers from psychological impairment for reasons eventually explained near the film’s conclusion. Rather than being a criminal mastermind like he is in the comics, Phillips and Silver try to make him an empathetic figure, a mentally unbalanced man beaten and mistreated for so long than he lashes out with violence. It’s an interesting attempt to explain his psychoses, but it’s done in such a predictable way, the audience is left to wonder why they should actually feel bad for him, which they shouldn’t. The film makes the case for him being a semi-sympathetic figure, but in reality, his actions are little more than inappropriate responses to admittedly terrible incidents that pushed him over the edge. Phoenix plays up these elements quite well and it’s a transformational performance, but compared to Ledger and Nicholson in the roles, his feels like an utterly inferior version of the character. This is a very difficult film to review. It isn’t that the film is bad. It is generally well made. The problem is that the first hour is a slog, an unrelentingly bleak slog. Joker isn’t simply the byproduct of bad situations as the film suggests. Rather, he’s given over to allowing his darker instincts to thrive. He’s a villain who’s created by an unjust system, but he’s also a character who takes the path of least resistance, refuses to repent for his actions, and ultimately the audience is told that they must feel some measure of pity for him and support his attempts to lash out at those around him. All the film really does is make the case for him to have his meds adjusted. He’s not a reformer and shouldn’t be an inspiration. It’s a fine line that Joker tries to walk between justifying the character’s abhorrent acts and celebrating them when we should not be asked to identify with him. We should not be trying to find reasons to understand him. Strength of character is about not giving into your baser instincts and hurting others even when you’ve been harmed. His isn’t a figure to idolize even though there will be some who will. Be very concerned about anyone who would.",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2022"," The concept of the new “Joker” movie should have been enough to excite me from the start. A dark, psychological, and unflinching dig into the mentally fractured life of the most iconic DC Comics villain? Right up my alley. And then you top it off by casting the insanely intense and always committed Joaquin Phoenix. All the ingredients are there yet since the very first trailer I found myself more cautious than enthusiastic. Three concerns kept my expectations in check. 1) The film is from Todd Phillips whose movies I generally struggle with and who has never done anything quite like this. Could he pull it off? 2) Phillips came out early saying “people are gonna be mad“. Did that mean he was straying completely away from the source material and simply milking the Joker name for attention and publicity? 3) Lastly, much of what makes Joker so unsettling comes from the mysteries of who he is and where he comes from. Would lifting that veil strip the character of his signature menace? The quick answers to those questions: Yes, No, and No. More pointedly, what Phillips has made is pretty spectacular – a relentlessly grim character study of a madman on the edge and a stinging rebuke of the morally bankrupt society that pushes him over it. Furthermore, no one can say “Joker” is politically agnostic, but its societal critique is far from one-sided and the film features more narrative and critical depth than I ever expected. Oh, and it’s also one cracking setup for one of pop culture’s most sinister villains. “Joker” is a comic book movie similar to “Logan” in that it was let off the studio leash and allowed to make its own rules. It isn’t bound by any genre convention or expectation and it has no direct tie to any previous DC movie. This gave Phillips and company a ton of freedom and obviously they ran with it. Most surprising to me (a long-time fan of the Clown Prince) is how Phillips impressively balances having an original vision with capturing the essence of such an established character. The movie’s bleakness begins with its introduction to Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) who lives with his sickly mother (Frances Conroy) on the impoverished outskirts of Gotham City. Arthur is an ambitious but unstable man who works for a rag-tag clown-for-hire agency but dreams of one day being a stand-up comedian. From the very beginning we know the deck is stacked against him and that’s a big part of Phillips’ message. You could say Arthur represents society’s fringe, the dismissed and disenfranchised. They are vividly contrasted with the powerful upper-class elites embodied in billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). The concept of the ‘haves’ vs. ‘have-nots’ is a central premise and it’s often quite potent. Other times it can be glaringly on-the-nose. But it does feed the idea that Gotham is a powder keg where crime and poverty grows in one community while the other seems oblivious to it. But it’s not as though Arthur finds compassion among the hardened lower-class. Even there he is considered an outcast. The lone exception is a sweet single mom (Zazie Beetz) who lives in the apartment down the hall. But even she can’t keep Arthur from cracking. Soon his fragile optimism gives way to angst and bitterness revealing something much darker curdling within him. In a way he begins to mirror Gotham City – a ticking time-bomb inevitably bound to explode. This leads the story deeper into the depths of human depravity as Arthur inadvertently triggers an equally vile side of humanity masquerading as an uprising. All of those story beats are important but the real genius of “Joker” is in how it puts us in Arthur’s head. The entire story is told from his point of view. It’s a critical use of perspective that drives the movie and infuses it with some unexpected psychological layers. Arthur is our narrator, our guide through a madman’s mind as his derangement festers. But how reliable is he and how much of what we see can we believe? This fact vs. fiction dynamic is key. There lies the wickedly effective trick Phillips and his co-screenwriter Scott Silver pull off smashingly. And it’s one that has provoked a bevy of different interpretations. Take the controversies that have sprung up since the film’s enthusiastic debut at the Venice Film Festival. Accusations that it incites and/or condones violence comes from very strict and literal readings of a few provocative scenes. But nothing about the story or its structure encourages a strict, literal reading. I don’t want to completely dismiss the criticisms simply because I can’t speak to how it may effect someone in a troubled head-space. And while the film doesn’t aim to be a comprehensive examination of mental illness, some could find it’s tough-minded and unwavering portrayal of its subject matter to be problematic. Despite that, neither the movie’s message nor its intent is the promotion or acceptance of violence. In fact, its convictions are far more judgmental and damning. Perhaps most important is how the script allows plenty of room for Joaquin Phoenix to let loose. His performance is raw, intense and hypnotic. You simply can’t take your eyes off of him. Whether it’s his jarring physical transformation (rumor has it he lost over 50 lbs for the role) or the chilling gaze of his cold, empty eyes. Phoenix brings an astonishing amount of ‘new’ to a character that’s been done many times before. I can’t see a scenario where he doesn’t get his fourth Oscar nomination. Other standout reasons for the film’s success: Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir creates what is easily one of my favorite scores of the year. Her music is haunting and unsettling yet never intrusive. And so often it’s pivotal in developing and managing the film’s edgy tone. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher shoots both Arthur and Gotham with the same gritty, arresting visual aesthetic and several of his images are still etched in my mind. And I haven’t even mentioned Robert De Niro. He plays Gotham City’s Johnny Carson, a late night talk show host named Murray Franklin. Think Rupert Pupkin if he had made it big. He is who Arthur dreams of one day becoming. As “Joker” slow-walks us towards its eventual maelstrom of iniquity it never spells out how we should feel about its titular character. It burrows under our skin and plays with our perceptions, but ultimately it’s up to us to sort it all out and reach our own conclusions. Considering the controversies maybe that has backfired a bit. But a more thoughtful evaluation reveals an audacious film that isn’t cavalier towards its violence nor numb to its effects. I saw it as a terrifying warning and an indictment of a society that not only creates monsters but often lifts them up. Then again, maybe that’s all in my head. I’m going to see this maybe this coming weekend as I wanted to stay home for a bit.  I am intrigued about this though I admit that Todd Phillips is hit/miss while I’m wondering why this film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival among so many others? I’m with you on Phillips. In fact I’m probably a bit more critical than you of his past films. But as you can tell I’m really high on “Joker”. If you get a chance definitely see it on the big screen. I was amazed at this film. I thought a lot about The Joker in Batman the Dark Knight and drew comparisons from how both actors had great performances. This movie was really good and even though there was no hero in it. I agree. I knew I liked it but the more I thought about it the more I loved it. It’s certainly a provocative movie but not in a way that deserves to be branded ‘controversial’. Seeing it again this week. Haven’t seen it, kinda monitoring the critical response to it without quite reading the reviews, as much as that’s possible.   Initially was going to skip it, but your review (I only looked at the rating you gave it, don’t want to know too much) and a few other reactions are pushing me towards seeing it now.  I’ll just say some of the other responses to it are kind of curious. Oh I think you definitely should give it a go. It such a surprisingly clever movie that’s also very well made. It’s relentlessly grim but it makes sense to be. And Phoenix – wow! It’s 100% worth your time. Have read a lot about this, Jay over at Assholes did a cracking piece on it, the newspaper critics are a bit off though. Fab review and I definitely want to see this. Yep, newspapers seem all over the map. They started strong but this controversy popped up and many of them have (unfortunately) leaned heavily into it. It’s a shame. I’ll just say this, there is still a big amount of mystery which was an unexpected surprise. A lot of it is due to the film’s use of perspective. Definitely give it a shot. I’d love to hear your thoughts. It’s crazy, but I think the film’s structure managed to personify the character and what we know him to be. And by the end, do we really know the story? YES! That’s it exactly! The structure really toys with our minds and leaves us questioning pretty much everything we have seen. Will you be doing a review for it? Excellent review, Keith! I appreciate your points about the political dimension (something I wrestled with) and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score. I adored how the score emphasised Arthur’s emptiness and sense of isolation from society. Thanks. It’s politics are interesting. To me Phillips doesn’t let anyone off the hook and I really appreciated that. I love that this movie is doing so well. I just hate that the controversies have clouded so many media opinions. There is far more to this movie than many people are giving it credit for. Those are some great points. I look forward to further considering the political aspects when I see the film for a second time. I’m glad that the movie is doing well too. I hope Hollywood can take the right lessons from the success of the movie. 100% agree. I’m probably (fingers crossed) going to watch it again tonight. I’m anxious to see if it verifies any of the many theories I now have in my head. I’m also eager to see if a second viewing confirms my central theory. (Spoilers) In those closing moments, when Joker thinks of Bruce Wayne alone in that ally, the whole film could be read as Joker imagining a situation in which he is indirectly responsible for creating Batman (hence why he says to his therapist that his joke is not funny). The joke is only funny to him because he knows who that little boy grows up to be.  This flips the tradition of the Caped Crusader being responsible for creating the villains he puts away. At that moment, Joker finds that one tragedy of Bruce Wayne seeing his parents die as an amusing silver lining in his embellished early life. There’s also a small throwaway moment when Thomas Wayne refers to people in masks as cowards, a possible funny little joke on Joker’s part to say- hey Batsy, your Daddy would not like who you grew up to be. That’s interesting. I will say that my second viewing did make several other things come to mind. (SPOILERS) It gave more credibility to the idea that the entire movie may be Arthur’s warped recollection of the events. In his telling of them he sees himself as the hero and despite being apolitical (as he told Murray) he believes he is the one who inspired the uprising and he is proud of it. But I believe it’s Thomas Wayne who first makes the comment referring to the disenfranchised as “clowns”. So the reality is Wayne is the one who inspired the clown motif, not Arthur. That would give more credibility to the idea that this is Arthur’s version of the story and is far from a credible narrator. Does any of that make sense? LOL. That does indeed make sense! I’m glad you got more out of it a second time. I think the film is so fractured in its point of view that the reveal (SPOILERS) of Thomas Wayne not being Arthur’s father could be false.  If we take this as truth, then the end scene with Joker thinking of Bruce Wayne is even more twisted as he finds the idea of his stepbrother in pain, funny.  It goes beyond the Batman reading.  I’ve just gotten back from it. It’s incredible in IMAX, particuarly for spotting small details and emphasing Arthur’s meaningless within the  Gotham at large. I will be writing another post on the film because there’s so much more to discuss.  Nice! Glad you enjoyed it too. Phoenix really does a tremendous job. It will be interesting to see if he gets an Oscar nomination considering the silly “controversies” that popped up. For the most part, I groan whenever a “controversy” arises over a movie.  Whether its considered racist, blasphemous, or something else entirely, I usually find it to be nothing of the sort.  (I just recently finally sat down and watched the Harry Potter movies, for example, and thoroughly enjoyed them.) Sadly many of them are driven by other motivations or ideologies. It really is a shame and it seems to be tossed about so much more these days. Nice review Keith.  Unfortunately I had a very different reaction to Joker.  As opposed to Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy, Joker really does seem to romanticize its protagonist.  While Scorsese portrays both Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin as lonely, almost pathetic egomaniacs whose narcissism leads them to violence and sadism, Todd Phillips seems to really believe in Arthur Fleck’s manifesto, that he’s a man out for vengeance against all of those who wronged him (and unlike TB or RP, all of Arthur’s victims are portrayed to have deserved their fate). That’s interesting. We definitely read it differently. (SPOILERS) For me, it didn’t romanticize him at all. In fact, I found the ending to be terrifying. I think Phillips has something strong to say about those who would lift up such a person as their hero. But I also think that scene is all in Arthur’s head so….And I wouldn’t say all of his victims deserved it. Personally I think he killed his neighbor and her daughter. Also all indications are that he killed the nurse in Arkham. And then you have to ask did the others really deserve to murdered? And if we say ‘yes’, what does that say about us? I found those things fascinating. I do think that Todd Phillips believes Arthur’s victims deserved it (the Wall Street victims for bullying him, Randall for causing him to lose his job, and De Niro’s talk show host for mocking him on air).  In Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle never had this sort of first person interaction or familiarity with his victims (preventing us from emphasizing with his killings), while Jerry Langford in The King of Comedy is not a toxic, mean-spirited comic like Murray is, making him a more relatable figure. Good point about the neighbor and daughter.  However, I do think that if Todd Phillips did show their (presumed) deaths onscreen, audiences would turn on the Arthur Fleck character.  Because there’s no definite answer of whether the neighbors, Phillips never really challenges viewers to consider Arthur to be completely unheroic.  Plus Arthur’s decision to leave Gary alive but not Randall demonstrates that Arthur only kills those who wronged him. As for the the nurse, I think she’s another bully for Arthur to take down.  I believe at the end Todd Phillips uses her as a personification for the bureaucracy preventing Arthur’s individuality (that Phillips has cited One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Next as an inspiration only further illustrates this point, though I’d probably need to rewatch both that film and Joker again to make a more direct comparison). But again, just because Arthur (a most unreliable guide/narrator) sees the nurse as representing bureaucracy doesn’t make it so and it doesn’t make her worthy of being killed. Same with Randall. He didn’t cause Arthur to lose his job. Carrying the pistol to a children’s hospital (regardless of who gave it to him) was the cause. Again I think Phillips poses an interesting question: even if they did do these things to Arthur does that justify brutally murdering them? And perhaps our answers to those questions says more about us than it does Arthur. As for the Langford/Murray comparison, I actually liked it. Murray is certainly more mean-spirited but he also a reflection of Gotham City (and even us to a degree). Things are definitely more toxic now which makes his representation effective to me. I don’t know, it’s such an interesting conversation to have. I’m scheduled to see it again tonight and I’m anxious to see where I land on these issues afterwards. That’s a fair point about the nurse, though I do recall Randall lying about where Arthur getting the gun to save his own skin, which does play a role in him getting fired. The thing is though I’m not sure if Todd Phillips is really making a movie that critiques violence in a realistic or serious manner.  A lot of his pictures strike me as juvenile and mean-spirited, and he does not strike me as a filmmaker interested in challenging the role commercial cinema plays in aestheticizing violence.  That being said, I’d be interested in seeing this movie again to see if I would change my mind. 100% agree. I LOVE talking about movies and how messages resonates with different people. And I especially love the thoughts from respected voices like yours. And to be perfectly honest, I LOVE challenging my reading of a movie. And the best way to do that is to listen to people with other points of view.  I loved it. How someone can make this and Hangover 3 is one of the funny things about life.  The way it builds and builds. So many great quotes. And the music! I said this to you with Ad Astra but I have to say it again. Music was incredible. But Joaquin. He has to win!!!!!!!!! I share your enthusiasm! And yes, it’s mind-blowing that this and HO3 came from the same guy. And I’m with you on the music. It’s soooo good and such a fundamental part of the film. Seeing this again in a couple of hours. Can’t wait. I know. I wasn’t expecting to get so blown by the music but once again it’s incredible. And Joaquin is perfect. A slight head up. Expect a slight surprise for my post tomorrow.  Incredible review! Very well-written. I have been hearing about this film nonstop and wasn’t very interested in seeing it. After reading this though and hearing about Phoenix’s Oscar-worthy performance I might check it out. Joker has never been one of my faves but I definitely understand now why the character has been able to live on for so long. Thank you! I’m REALLY high on this movie especially after a second viewing. But it’s not an easy movie to watch. As I wrote it is relentlessly grim and since it’s a Joker origin story of sorts you know it isn’t going to end well. But it has so many cool layers to it and its commentary really gets you thinking. Toss in that incredible Phoenix performance, one of the year’s best scores, and lights out cinematography…whew…. Ace review Keith, I liked “Joker” quite a bit – in terms of filmmaking and performance (this really would not have worked at all without Joaquin Phoenix) it’s quite remarkable. But…I don’t see myself wanting to see this over and over again, it was a bit of a hard watch at times, and in all honestly I prefer the Joker in the context of a Batman film (if that makes sense?).  I get this was never meant to be such a film but it doesn’t grab me in the same way that The Dark Knight does…but, again, I get that Joker is a totally different thing. I do understand what your saying. I think I brought the Batman connections subconsciously. The idea that it was still an origin story of Batman’s chief villain was in the back of my mind. But you’re right, it’s definitely not your normal Joker inside Batman’s world. Fantastic write-up on this movie, Keith. I too believe that this movie was more of a societal warning of what it can create if they don’t care for those who need the help they seek. I’m glad such a movie was released and hope it won’t keep directors and companies from producing such beautiful movies! Thank you. There is so much depth to this movie and it really surprises me when I see reviews calling it “empty” and as “having nothing to say”. I see it so differently. As for all the notions about emotionally stable people somehow seeing this film and deciding ‘I want to be just like him!’, I can’t help but find them incredibly illogical. Is what I mentioned the problem these far-lefties have? If not, what?! I honest don’t understand what in this movie could create copycat behaviour, no more than maybe a third of recent films. It all strikes me as rather silly. I’m with you on the soundtrack. What is it about those Icelandics eh? First Johhansson (RIP) now this artist, I must find some other work by her/him (I never checked the gender haha, not like it matters). One cracking set up for my favourite (and really the only comic book character I have ever liked due to the Batman games) I agree, sir! I totally forgot to realise the similarities to Logan! You are spot on (again! :P) and its no surprise these are the only two films I’ve liked out of all this superhero/villain malarkey. God I could write so much more but you raid all of my ramblings, though it was long and I wouldn’t blame you for skipping sections. I need to take a leaf out of your book and try to say what I want without writing nearly 1,900 bloody words! One thing though…. I’m not sure if it was a fantasy or some sort of flashback, but I recall him meeting Bruce Wayne as a child. Which would make him some 30+ years older than the boy who became Batman? Am I missing something here?? Anyways, top-notch review as I have really come to appreciate recently. I must remember to keep up with your site more often than I do, I’m always missing quality stuff.
BTW I loved ‘Hostiles’ having finally seen it. Do you know anything more about the release of this ‘Antlers’ film?? I don’t think I did a good job on that paragraph about it’s effect on emotionally unstable people. I think some MAY be able to take it that way but I have a hard time putting any blame on the movie. The film is in no way promoting, advocating, and forgiving violence. Accusations saying it does are misguided. And the exact same paper-thin allegations could be made towards MANY other movies. Glad you had a chance to see “Hostiles”. It’s such an underappreciated movie. Sadly, no news on Antlers yet. I still have my eyes open for it. Haha, once again you summed up my exact thoughts in a tenth of the words I used 😛  Damn I need to be more efficient with my writing. But yeah we obviously are on the exact same page regarding this, especially that similar accusations could be thrown at other flicks. Like many other things in life, its the person, not the movie. Its all rather absurd really. Also I’m posting my thoughts on Ad Astra in the next few hours if ur interested. I don’t think I LOVED it as much as you but I certainly liked it a LOT. YES! This and “Ad Adstra” are my only 5 star reviews. I was blown away by this and still can’t get it out of my head. And that’s after seeing it three times! LOVE hearing your enthusiasm too. I know. Probably overkill but it couldn’t pass up on the chance. And it says something that I could watch it again tonight if I could. Just now getting to this review.  You did an erudite review of the film and I love it as much as you do.  It’s a movie that would be great for a psych class to watch and then do a biopsychosocial assessment and diagnosis on him.  He’s been driven over the edge.  What strikes me is how a person could go through all of that and not turn into a maniac.  I don’t want to give any spoilers away for those who haven’t seen it, but you could see the big break inevitable when a certain knowledge came to him.  It was heartbreaking watching him struggle and you make a good point about the cruelty coming from people in all walks of life.  Do you think they will/should make a sequel?  I would love to see what next with Joaquin’s Joker. Thanks so much! A part of me doesn’t want a sequel. This seems like a perfect start and finish. But then I think if the script is right and Phoenix and Phillips are onboard, I would be all up for the next chapter in his life. And over $1 billion at the box office is hard for a studio not to think about. Anyway I finally saw Joker recently and there was no intention to nitpick. As with any movie, I prefer to just let it unfold. to let it happen without analysis. so my score for Joker is 2.5/5. I liked the acting, musical score, and cinematography a lot. Unfortunately, the screenplay did not satisfy.  The narrative just seemed too ‘Designed’ , if I can try to use that word. Its also too Direct in trying to make Arthur’s life as painful as possible. 2)why does Arthur’s boss not want to believe him at all about anything? about the missing sign in the beginning  or about getting jumped by kids, for example. he just immediately rejects Arthur’s reasons. Is there such a boss in any world? 3) why does Arthurs coworker care for him at first(gives gun), and then later, doesn’t care about him at all when the boss begins asking questions about it. the character just doesn’t seem consistent. Anyway, will stop there. I know this movie was right up your alley, comic book characters. but I just saw it mainly as about a man and his transformation. ps. the only Deception I think was Arthur’s friendship with the neighbor. Everything else happened, I believe. Otherwise if it was all fantasy, then we would not see or know about the dangerous capability of the Joker, as he in the Batman world. 1. She was actually a government social worker. I think she cared but she too was weighted under the pressures of her job. As she said later, “they don’t give a crap about me either.” I think she was simply limited on what she could do for Arthur. 2. I hate to say it, but there are indeed bosses like that unfortunately. I took it as this being one of several complaints he had had about Arthur. It sounded like a culmination of things. But he was also pretty jaded and fed up himself. 3. I don’t think he necessarily cared for him in a truly compassionate way. Because once it look like he was about to get in trouble he immediately turned on Arthur. He was a selfish guy which is why Arthur responded with violence. Anyway, Who knows. Those are my thoughts on it. I just mainly love having conversations about it. And I’m really glad you gave it a watch. your character explanations are fair. i guess I just personally preferred that the movie provide a bit more explanation behind their behaviors. With all that said, I was never bored in its duration.  And you’re not wrong. They aren’t really fleshed out. And you aren’t alone on the movie as a whole. I know there are many who couldn’t quite get onboard with it. I haven’t seen Joker yet, and to be honest, I’m not sure if I really want to. Not because of how violent and disturbing it apparently is, but because of the fact that I’ve heard a lot of people saying it looted way too much from the Martin Scorsese films “Taxi Driver” (which I haven’t seen yet) and “The King of Comedy” (which I have seen, and absolutely loved). And if there’s one thing I don’t want to see, it’s a major movie studio ripping off one of the greatest directors of all time just so they can pretend their film is “new” and “daring”. In my opinion there is a huge difference in ripping off material and being inspired but it or paying homage to it. I love both “King” and “Taxi Driver”. And I see the influence of those films on “Joker”. But I’ve seen it four times and never once felt it was ripping off those movies. I absolutely love the dark, moody story, the lead performance, and the incredible score and cinematography. I can’t recommend it enough. I really loved this film, and found myself sympathizing for his struggles.  He really did have it rough 😦  I especially connected with his need for knowing and meeting his father, a personal topic in my own life. I think the criticism of the film was… promotional.  I read “Trust Me, I’m Lying” by Ryan Holiday and it kind of ruined my view of this, because some movies (such as “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell”) did faux outrage just for publicity. Anyway, I enjoyed your assessment of the movie and agree in many ways!  I hope they keep making more adult comic book movies like this one and Logan (another one I loved!). Thanks so much for the comments and it’s great to hear from someone else who really appreciated “Joker”. It’s a film that has only gotten better with each new viewing. The outrage thing is interesting. I personally don’t think all of the outrage was promotional mainly because a lot of it came from critics who (for some frustrating reason) had an active interest in dissuading people from going to see the movie. I read so many negative reviews making some pretty unfair claims. Then when it was nominated for 11 Oscars a second wave of hyper-criticism erupted. Thankfully most of their disdain fell on deaf ears and the movie made tons of well-deserved money.",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2022"," Most stand-up comics are sick bastards if you think about it. I mean, I would be a bit more comforted if Anthony Jeselnik turned out to be a serial killer than if it turned out he actually was born with a redeemable soul. The field has hundreds of stories filled with drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and even suicide of failed and successful comedians. All were trying to find that happy place to make people laugh often and that means you have to look at things that most people won’t lock eyes with to get there. The Joker is not Mrs. Maisel and you wouldn’t think the toe-sucking Road Trip director Todd Phillips would be the person that comes to mind to direct a film on a “woke” culture that begins to stand up to capitalist pigs and social injustice; come to think of it, he might the right choice for the job entirely. Joaquin Phoenix is the next man up as The Red Hood, which was last played by Jared Leto. This isn’t your Cesar Romero Joker your grandparents (or, by now, great grandparents) grew up with. Phoenix’s take is grounded, even more so than Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning take from The Dark Knight, while even giving Fleck’s stand-up routine an Andy Kaufman quality. It’s not quite a tumble down the rabbit hole into madness as he has already hit rock bottom, now the leader of the bottom-feeders has come out from hibernating, and has found some friends. His performance has been described as magnetic, which is accurate. It’s almost all sensual really. That’s combined with a performance that has an unusual amount of ascetic discipline as he stays in his lane of emotional incontinence; you simply can’t take your eyes off him, even when your first instinct is to turn away. Essentially, Joker isn’t so much a rip off Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy as it’s a repurposing of that classic film and fitted for a storyboard from a comic book. Phillips’s vision isn’t a colorful box of cereal; in fact, its mood is drab, dull, dark, just like the Gotham many grew up with that always seemed to lay under an unlimited sheen of rain and nighttime skies. Even the Joker’s signature colors are toned down, which may be by design since the only time you seem to get a splash of color is when the Joker turns savage, and blood is splattered everywhere like a Jackson Pollack. Many will find Joker disturbing. I find it one of the more deliberate, grounded, and disciplined comic book takes since Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy (without the action set pieces). The script is actually very predictable, even telegraphed, but the film is done so well the result is still a satisfying one. If anything, after the Zack Snyder decade of failures when it comes to the DC-Universe, I hope Warner Brothers takes future offerings in this direction, where villains and heroes were born from our social consciousness, and the only superpower needed is the will to do what the other man or woman won’t (and unlimited possibilities that inheriting a couple of billion dollars from your parents provides). If this is a one-off for Phoenix, that would be a shame. He might be the anti-hero people have been craving for in a film trilogy that television has mastered in recent years. Many might not want to hear that or see it on the screen, but it’s there, and not just in your theatre; It’s all over CNN at the moment. Phillips’ Joker is violent, raw, and hits closer to home than many are willing to admit. Marc Miller (also known as M.N.

I loathe clowns. Not coulrophobia. I'm not afraid of clowns, despite what a good job Andy Muscietti did with the second chapter of Stephen King's It - still playing in some cinemas. No, I hate them.  What gets sold as comedy and flash, I see as sadness and desperation. It makes me a bad date at a circus, but strangely, it makes me wildly over-identify with Todd Phillips' dystopic origin story for Batman's arch nemesis. For all the violence, the encyclopaedia of darker mental illnesses, the despairingly familiar landscape of a civilisation in decline, this is a twistedly gobstopping film, and I could not get enough. It comes from the DC Comics world of characters - this is the same Joker that Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger played - but most upsetting to many comic book die-hards is that writer-director Todd Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver have conceived a new beginning for the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a children's party clown absolutely in the wrong business considering his chronic depressions, his court-appointed psychiatric sessions, and a Tourette's-like condition that sees him wildly laughing in inappropriate moments. His mother (Frances Conroy) has shaped his fragile inauthentic belief in his ability to make others laugh, but as Arthur comes to understand her belief may not be based in reality, the cracks in his foundations become apparent. Life has stomped all over Arthur and in the scene that drastically changes the film's tone, so do a bunch of American Psycho-throwback Wall Street types. When city fat-cat Thomas Wayne, employer of the slain Wall Street frat-boys, makes some emotive statements about the lower classes being ""clowns"", the seams of a city that had been descending slowly towards unruliness and anarchy start to pull apart. Dark Knight fans won't like the depiction of Batman's dad here. Thomas Wayne is a blow-hard buffoon, possibly a bit of a contemporary political caricature. The Gotham of the Tim Burton films was supposed to look dystopian thanks to the artful placement of scrunched newspaper and neon, while under the engineering of Wes Anderson's sometime production designer, Mark Friedberg, this Gotham - set some time in the early '80s - feels believably familiar, parts post-GFC Detroit, pre-gentrified Harlem, and beautiful downtown Damascus. Who would have thought a film this rich in things to both look at and ponder would come from the team behind The Hangover, Phillips and Silver (and their Hangover star Bradley Cooper, with a producer credit here)?  They honour their references - one of my favourites harks back to Michelle Pfeiffer's ""Hell Here"" moment from Batman Returns - while the film's third act draws from Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Last year the National Film and Sound Archive hosted an exhibition curated from the personal effects of actor Heath Ledger, one of the prized items being Ledger's ""Joker Diary"".  In the book he used to help construct his Joker, the role that would win him a posthumous best supporting actor Oscar, he began writing in the character's voice, becoming ever darker in tone. Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, too, carries around with him a diary - in theory the comic observations that might help him make his fortune as a stand-up comedian. ",POSITIVE

"Feb 23, 2022"," Miserable and nihilistic, Joker rethinks the iconic Batman villain in terms of a darkly realistic origin story of a murderer. Director Todd Phillips constructs a new version of the Joker whose emergence is preceded by textbook warning signs, including child abuse, an unstable family life, antisocial behavior, and various neuroses. It’s an unusual approach for a character whose chaotic behavior often proves entertaining only because Batman’s order balances it. The character, named Arthur Fleck and played in an uncanny performance by Joaquin Phoenix, lives in a seedier, punishing version of Gotham City, where he feels persecuted by society at large. Following the trajectory of another cinematic psycho, Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976), Arthur finally lashes out at the world that has ignored and abused him, becoming a more disturbed and lower-stakes version of the legendary DC Comics villain. The film might be a wreckless and angry statement about the world today, capable, although not intentionally so, of inciting incels to violence. It might be nothing more than a bleak character study in the footsteps of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, commanded by an impressive performance and incredible formal craftsmanship, in which case it’s a bold piece of studio filmmaking. But Joker’s desperate need for subversiveness results in a confused portrait of a deranged bad guy, even as it strives for ambiguity. The film leaves the audience to question whether they should cheer for or feel disturbed by its central character. But it’s less a genuinely transgressive approach than one closely modeled on the work of Martin Scorsese, and thus more an exercise in homage than rebellion. Even so, that won’t stop people from aggrandizing it. Late in the film, the camera glances up at a movie theater marquee—one of the few not showcasing a porno with the name of a Billy Wilder film—advertising Brian De Palma’s Blow Out and Peter Medak’s Zorro: The Gay Blade, dating the film to 1981. The setting is Gotham, whose real-life counterpart has always been New York, which in that same year had a garbage strike, over 2,000 homicides, and over 5,000 rapes. Accordingly, Gotham’s streets are littered with garbage, rampant crime, and newscasters warn of an increasing “super rat” problem (don’t bother inquiring because the film never explains). “Is it just me,” Arthur says, “or is it getting crazier out there?” Cinephiles will recognize the milieu, the urban sprawl of Scorsese’s elusive Taxi Driver, where human scum festers and the only source of brightness exists in the delusions of the protagonist. Along with several nods and even lines of dialogue pulled from The King of Comedy (1983), Phillips draws from Scorsese’s wellspring of New York stories about psychopaths who, upon being rejected by the world and those they admire, lash out in criminal ways that gain them the attention they need. But unlike De Palma, whose Blow Out paid homage by advancing the cinematic language developed by Alfred Hitchcock, Phillips’ brand of reverence uses his inspiration like carbon paper instead of a launchpad. Joker copies Scorsese’s aesthetic and themes, but it does not progress them.  Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck lives in a grungy apartment with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who he cares for and dotes upon. He works a thankless job as a clown, aspires to become a stand-up comedian, and occasionally stalks his neighbor (Zazie Beetz), with whom he’s infatuated. But the world has nothing except a long coil of excrement to pinch off on Arthur’s face. Within the first half-hour of Joker, Arthur receives not one but two violent beatings, loses his job, and endures no end of insults and rejections. The second beating, which takes place after a coworker has given him a firearm, results in Arthur shooting down three rich assholes employed by Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Curiously enough, Arthur’s mother often refers to her glory days long ago as an employee of Gotham’s wealthiest patron, who is also a mayoral candidate. “Those of us who have made something of our lives,” Wayne says on live television, “will always look at those who haven’t and see nothing but clowns.” It’s a remark that incites outrage among the lower classes and builds Arthur, the anonymous clown killer, into a figurehead. After Arthur commits murder (in a sequence recalling The French Connection, again demonstrating Phillips’ affection for New York cinema of the 1970s), an act for which he has no regret, he inadvertently incites a movement, wherein the rich become targets for the repressed and dejected masses—all of whom don clown masks in honor of their perceived liberator.  The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver leaves a meandering breadcrumb trail to Arthur’s mental state. He was institutionalized and now sees a social worker (Sharon Washington) about his mental health. He takes seven prescriptions to keep himself sane. He has a neurological disorder that causes him to laugh-cry when under pressure, resulting in pained cackles and burps that announce themselves like Tourette’s syndrome tics. The specifics of Arthur’s mental condition prove less significant than how they are portrayed. If Joker has little to say outside of reactionary social politics and Scorsese-brand aesthetics, it’s an astounding vehicle for Phoenix’s talent. The actor somehow makes the film urgently compelling, and his body is so wincingly skinny—a quality that Phillips seems to savor in those shots where Phoenix raises his arms to reveal a sunken stomach, protruding ribs, and virtually no muscle mass. The transformation is incredible, and Phoenix’s ability to inhabit a character gives way to scenes of scary, internalized emotion on Arthur’s face—a lightning storm of conflicting expressions, from tears to riotous laughter, all about to burst from the inside of Arthur’s skeletal frame.  As the film carries on, Arthur’s history and psyche become more critical to the plot, which relies on a series of eye-rolling twists to propel Arthur over sanity’s edge. In a clumsy, Fight Club-esque moment, one character is revealed to be a figment of Arthur’s imagination, and therein, a sign of his growing insanity. He later discovers that his lineage is not what he thought it to be. Catalyst after wretched catalyst builds until, with about 20 minutes left in its two-hour runtime, Joker turns what has become a miserablist experience into a revenge story propelled by insanity. After all, Arthur’s few moments of violence have earned him media attention and followers, including crowds of clown-masked devotees willing to overwhelm, and presumably kill, a cop (Shea Whigham) who accidentally shoots a civilian. Finally, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the host of a late-night talk show and Arthur’s idol, invites Arthur onto his program to be humiliated—after some video of Arthur’s embarrassing stand-up footage turns him into a laughing stock. It’s the last-ditch moment for Arthur to become Joker, and it’s the most ill-conceived scene in the film.  Watching Joker, one cannot help but think of Rob Zombie’s take on Halloween from 2007, a horror film that sought to unmask Michael Myers by constructing an elaborate backstory filled with child abuse and tortured animals. Thus, the mythological “Shape” from John Carpenter’s 1979 slasher became nothing more than another in a long line of Zombie’s serial-killer-obsessed gorefests. Something similar happens in Joker, where Phillips seeks to fill in the blanks of the character’s storied history. Famously, Heath Ledger’s rendition of the character spun a unique origin story for everyone he met, which left his past a mystery and rendered his version an unknowable force of energy. Phillips provides an alternative approach, as every fiber of Arthur’s being takes him further down the spiral toward the moment when he becomes that familiar face from Batman comics, cartoons, and movies. And yet, Phoenix’s take on the character never feels like someone who will develop into the Clown Prince of Crime; he’s not a criminal mastermind nor even particularly bright. Arthur makes impulsive decisions and spends most of the film getting abused and humiliated, and then having a violent reaction. In other words, there’s little evidence to suggest Arthur Fleck will ever concoct an elaborate plan that puts him five steps ahead of Batman. It’s more likely that he’ll just stab or shoot someone he resents.  In a way, Joker being modeled after a crazed mass murderer is scarier because it follows the logic of a school shooter or someone with a sniper rifle in a bell tower. In another way, it’s lazier, as though Phillips couldn’t conceive of an intelligent person who transforms into an unhinged supervillain. Instead, Arthur behaves like a disgruntled, lonely person who tells an obvious window-into-my-soul joke: “What do you get when you cross a crazy person with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?” The punchline is an act of public violence, a moment that, when seen by the deserted and unhinged, will feel cathartic. Dramatically, Phillips has engineered our empathy for Arthur. We find him at once worthy of our pity and yet his actions are detestable, making his final outburst an insane, murderous victory over those who wronged him. It’s a moment that is exhilarating and maybe even irresponsible. At the same time, the material leaves illogical leaps between the character as Phillips has made him and the requirements of a major motion picture about a famous intellectual property. Why, for instance, would a crowd of hundreds suddenly don masks and praise a madman who performs a violent act? A few handfuls of disturbed individuals devoted to a cult leader, that is believable. But hundreds of masked people suddenly driven to worship Joker like a god? It might seem implausible, except when you consider that people today worship a man with an orange mask and absurd hair despite his crimes (and so perhaps it’s not so unreasonable). ",POSITIVE
"Feb 12, 2022"," Every decade has that one transcendent film that, as time progresses, ultimately becomes a classic for cinephiles. When films such as Taxi Driver, The Shining, Psycho, and Fight Club were first released, they were not hailed as classics the way we view them today. As the 2010s decade comes to a close, the one film that will undoubtedly age like a fine wine is Todd Phillip’s masterpiece, Joker. As a fan of the character and the opposition that he and Batman have shared on the page and the big screen, this concept of an origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime was something I was hesitant about at first. But as soon as I watched the film, my reservations disappeared. I’m calling it now – it’s one of the decade’s best films.  On its surface, Joker tells the story of Arthur Fleck, a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who has difficulties establishing relationships. He lives at home with his ailing mother and after many beat downs by the society he lives in, he decides to take matters into his own hands, eventually transitioning into his Joker persona.  Joker is more than a simple origin story of the greatest villain in comic book history. No, Joker is a film that touches on subjects people should be talking about with respect to today’s society – those suffering from mental illness, those lacking health insurance or support services because of financial cuts and means, and those overall from lower social classes. The best films are always those that dare to hold up a mirror to the audience and challenge the status quo of the day. Joker and Todd Phillips do just that.  One of the biggest takeaways from this film is the subject of mental health. From the film’s opening, we first meet Arthur in a meeting with his social worker discussing how things are going for him. Rather than being shown sympathy by his counselor, Arthur is treated as just another case in a 9-5 job. It’s incredibly unnerving how little care is given by his social worker, and it is evident that Arthur feels the same way as he scribbles in his notebook early on. In the film, Arthur goes on to say that “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” summing up feelings anyone can relate to in today’s world. We see this truth play out over and over again, especially during Arthur’s interactions with the other characters throughout the film. There are also moments throughout Joker that Arthur has no choice but to attempt to fit in with society, but doesn’t quite know how to. One of those moments is while Arthur is taking notes during a comedian’s stand-up routine. He doesn’t quite know when to laugh at the punchlines. A condition he suffers from, later revealed to us, doesn’t allow him to follow cues either.  Arthur’s descent into madness is aided by one of the decade’s best performances by Joaquin Phoenix. Eleven years ago, Heath Ledger gave cinephiles the most significant portrayal of the Joker and one of the best performances of all time in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, Ledger passed away before he could receive his acclaim in person. Ultimately, he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor posthumously.  Phoenix’s portrayal, while different from Ledger’s, is nothing short of masterful. His commitment to the role is on full display, especially through his significant weight loss and deliberate mannerisms to show Arthur’s mental difference and social awkwardness in every scene. By the time the film concludes, Arthur Fleck is dead, and the Joker is alive and well. This performance should go a long way this awards season and hopefully garners Phoenix his first Academy Award. I’ve said in numerous reviews over the past few years when the cinematography turns a city into a character is when a film is at its best. Lawrence Sher‘s work in Joker is nothing short of spectacular. Most of Gotham City is a cesspool; however, Sher’s gorgeous shot overlooking a train riding into the heart of the city shows that there may be a light at the end of the gritty tunnel, similarly to when Dorothy and her crew walk towards Oz.  Hildur Guðnadóttir should also receive acclaim for her haunting score. The score of Joker may fall in line as one of my favorite scores of the past decade. Guðnadóttir’s score highlights Arthur’s downward spiral and truly captures Arthur’s feelings throughout the entire film. An Oscar nomination should undoubtedly be in her future. In regards to the film’s controversy and the backlash it has received over the past few months, I find it comical that films like John Wick unleash a slew of constant, unrelenting violence are praised for its high-level action sequences and killing. Still, Joker is deemed dangerous by critics for its minute violent sequences. I’ve also seen criticism that Joker glorifies Arthur. Without delving into spoilers, I’ll offer a counter to that ideology with Taxi Driver. At the end of the film, Travis Bickle is hailed an anti-hero for the massacre at the prostitution house. In the long run, Joker is more critical than it is dangerous. It’s a vital film that everyone should watch – Joker and Arthur are more than just a madman. Anyone suffering from an illness or beaten up by society and everyday life could turn into Arthur. As time progresses, the importance of the film will rise as it shows us the value of treating others well despite our differences and to stop any judgment and give real support to those suffering from mental illnesses.  This film, outside of easter eggs referencing Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke, moves away from attempting to be just another comic book film. Thirty years ago, Batman (1989) became the most influential comic book film of all time. It showed studios the prospects of marketing a comic book genre the correct way. Fast forward to Joker and it ultimately has the same importance in terms of taking the comic book genre more seriously than just one of capes and cowls.",POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2022"," One of the hottest premiere tickets of TIFF 2019 was Joker, fresh off the heels of its Golden Lion prize at the Venice International Film Festival. Shedding any preconceived expectations, I went into the film ready to experience something that was outside of the norm of the DC cinematic universe, and boy, did Joker deliver something way out there! Joker is a one-dimensional, dark, and menacing look at the tragic life of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and his impending and complicated rise to becoming the sociopathic supervillain, Joker. With a heartbreakingly terrifying performance from its star, Joker leaves you wondering why there were any other characters featured in this one man’s tale. Told strictly from his vantage point and at the sometimes-harrowing expense of the other characters, we are made to know Arthur, feel for Arthur and then fear Arthur himself.  Arthur Fleck is a hired clown performer by day and an aspiring stand-up comedian by night, struggling to keep the lights on and roof over his and his ailing mother’s heads. A self-proclaimed loner, he suffers from a disorder caused by severe head trauma that triggers him to laugh uncontrollably at the most inopportune moments. Essentially, when he is hurting, upset, and/or wants to cry, he laughs. This inability to control his emotions in a socially acceptable way often leads to him being scrutinized and attacked.  Generally minding his own business and working hard during Gotham’s severe economic downturn, Arthur is so badly mistreated, that he is given a gun for protection. Initially hesitant, he eventually caves and accepts the gun, knowing that navigating his mental health in a city rot with crime, corruption, and poverty, means taking extra measures for self-preservation.  Arthur doesn’t tell anyone about the gun, not even his mother and arguably only friend, Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). With limited time left to live, she hardly notices the full scope of what’s going on with Arthur and is obsessively preoccupied with contacting former employer Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) to incessantly ask for financial assistance. Wayne, of course, could not care less about Penny or the working class, which is in line with the sentiment of the wealthy during Gotham’s financial hardships.  So, when Arthur is ambushed yet again, events escalate and Arthur finally defends himself. This flips a switch for Arthur and rather than feel remorse for his actions, he doesn’t feel anything. It is this event that spurs a political engagement for folks like Thomas Wayne. The deaths also empower Gotham’s working class to rise up. Throughout the film, Arthur encounters more people, twists and turns on his rise to becoming the infamous Joker. He finds out more complicated family secrets and spirals deeper and deeper into own personal delusions. Along the way, while in his building, Arthur meets Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beatz) and her daughter. He is immediately infatuated with her and her presence. While Beatz isn’t as utilized in this film as I had hoped, she does give an endearing performance in a pivotal scene and you will wish that you had gotten more, not just Arthur’s perspective.  Sophie isn’t the only black woman in Arthur’s atmosphere, which feels oddly purposeful but also lacking. Why are some of the women in this film strategically placed — almost like props — instead of fully flushed characters that help bolster and build Arthur’s arc in a seamless and more meaningful way? As the film reaches its pinnacle with the arrival of Joker and the Gotham that we all know from Bruce Wayne’s perspective, one thing I found myself wondering was why were there other characters? Why didn’t the writers create a better arc for Sophie Dumond? Why wasn’t Penny’s backstory and her present-day interactions with Arthur more aligned? Why didn’t we get to see more come to head with this deeply complex familial relationship? Is there more to Brian Tyree Henry’s character?  By the time you finally come to in your own reality while watching Joker, you may ask yourself why many of the film’s poignant revelations didn’t happen sooner; you may also ask, “where was the payoff?” While Phoenix gives a captivating performance with an oddly sincere and diabolical laugh meant to make you empathize for him, it is very much singular and enveloping, and not enough to fill in the various holes along the way.  As committed as I was to Phoenix’s performance, I found myself walking out of the theater wondering, why did we need to tell this deeply violent and triggering story now? Where does DC go from here and this standalone film? Why didn’t we get more from the dynamic actresses that were involved? And, quite frankly, do we need another Joker film? You be the judge when Joker hits theaters on October 4th.  I plan to see this (not on opening day, but I’ll see it). I could do without the fanboy campaigning for this to receive a best picture Oscar nomination, a campaign that started months before the movie even premiered. The Joker hoopla seems to be the latest version of those “Zap! Pow! Comics Aren’t Just For Kids Anymore” articles that have been around since at least the ’80s.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 10, 2021"," The film opens with a devastated Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) painting his face, attempting a smile but having to resort to physically pulling his mouth into a gruesome grimace while a single tear rolls down his cheek. Arthur is a man that society has abandoned, who people actively choose not to see — to ignore and to forget. Arthur is the punchline to every joke, unfortunate from birth and all the more tragic for suffering from an injury that leads him to laugh uncontrollably when under stress. The film also stars Robert DeNiro as Murray Franklin, Zazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond and Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck.  Arthur will eventually become Joker, Gotham City’s most notorious super villain, one who breeds chaos and breathes anarchy. But how does one go from an unfortunate man, a sad human, to a murderous clown prince of crime? Todd Phillips is dying to answer this and map the route from point A to point B, but unfortunately gets lost in the way. There is a good film — a great film — in here somewhere, but unfortunately Phillips hasn’t been the right person to draw it out. The biggest issue “Joker” has is its depiction of mental health. Once again, Hollywood is drawing a parallel between mental health problems and violence. And not just violence, but cruelty. Arthur becomes more and more sadistic in his actions, more and more unhinged, but the framing of the story makes some crucial mistakes that the film can’t recover from. We’re asked to understand and to empathize with Arthur, to see where he’s coming from when he executes people. The film has a lot to say about the world we live in, how individuals fall through the cracks. Some of it is powerful and correct, and it’s a noble purpose, but the film simply doesn’t pull it off in a satisfying manner. A villain can be at least equally, if not more interesting, than a hero, and Joker is surely one of the most fascinating baddies of pop culture. But this is a story that makes a point about being timely and relevant. It may not incite violence or be as edgy as it clearly wants to be, but it never condemns Joker’s actions. He is celebrated; he is provided context and history. The end result should have been more tragic and thought-provoking, but it only ends up being problematic. If Phillips handled the script with more nuance, “Joker” would be a much better film. There’s so much good here, but these qualities are drowned out by the bad stuff. All the female characters in the film are weak, flawed and somehow to blame for Arthur’s decline and Joker’s rise. It’s an unnecessarily cruel film that presents violence as an outlet, as something that’ll free you and give you power. By committing violent acts and shedding blood, Arthur is able to gain power, momentum and finally do something for himself. He becomes more outspoken, more comfortable in his own skin, by pulling the trigger to right some wrongs in his life. It’s a troubling thing to witness and the film does nothing to make Joker a warning or an example. Whether or not you’re willing to believe that “Joker,” as a film (or any film for that matter), is problematic or dangerous is subjective and up for discussion. It’s a matter well worth discussing; should we worry about films like “Joker”? Or any film with violence? Or video games? It’s not so much the fear of violence that makes me worried about the movie’s impact, but the fact that Phillips is so willing to infuse the character with so many familiar and troublesome qualities, and then presents Arthur with no other choice but the destructive path he goes down, as if he could never be helped. He victimizes Arthur, who then turns to violence as the answer, but Phillips yet again victimizes him, implying Arthur had no choice; he had been forced by the society we live in to become the monster he is. The ending of “Joker” is tragic, but in all the wrong ways. The film rides on Joaquin Phoenix’s remarkable performance. He embodies Arthur with such gusto and terrifying ease that the line between Phoenix and Arthur almost completely disappears. The scenes where Arthur dances expressively, completely free of the shackles that bind him, are the film’s highlight and, in all honesty, I would have loved to see more of them. It’s Phoenix’s commitment that saves “Joker” from being completely rotten. In the end, “Joker” might be the most divisive film of 2019. It’s not the best the film industry has to offer — we should have already moved past these archaic stereotypes Phillips holds on to so tightly. It’s a disappointing film only because it could have been so much better. Hopefully, this villain will one day see a better adaptation hit the silver screen.  “Joker” is now playing in theaters.

"Jul 30, 2021"," The reason why a perpetually crushed ego is unable to develop mature emotions is because all the psychic energy a person can tap into is used to restore the defiled dignity. This does not mean that the pain is not real, it only means that’s all there is. Hence the narcissistic wound appears as a joke to others, and molten lava to the one that carries it within. I’m still not sure if I should give this film one star or five for its gut-punch, but anything in between would be meaningless. It’s equally repulsive and fascinating. There is something corpse-like about it. You cannot unsee it. In essence, Todd Phillips‘s Joker (2019) is Antonin Artaud‘s wet dream set in DC’s Gotham City, an origins story, intellectually dangerous cinema, at the same time telling the truth, and lighting a match. It’s a manifesto of sorts,  and the only way to view it healthily is to treat it as a type of a public service – giving us a step-by-step trajectory of oppression engendering humiliation, turning into violence, turning into a philosophy. It’s too potent as art to ignore or dismiss, and highly flammable politically to treat lightly. This is because the medium and the message are in conflict, so we get pure 21st century existentialism fueled by low-grade nihilist comic book testosterone. The opening scene is set on October 15th, a shout-out to Nietzsche – it’s his birthday, maybe as an open homage or a dog-whistle for history nerds (apparently, me). And if this is a coincidence – then I must have seen a completely different film than I thought I did. Which I doubt, muchly. Everything within it is entirely deliberate. It’s perhaps its only real fault – that perfectionist attitude revealing an undercurrent of anxiety in the filmmaking itself, as if the director’s hand is trembling from the enormity of the task he sets himself up for. Which is mostly allowing Joaquin Pheonix‘s performances to unfold, while he burns like he were an archangel on heroin, a contorted otherworldly presence that under a different constellation of stars would have ended up a saint. As it happens, he goes for the demonic, discovering within it that creative spark he searched for all his life spent as a non-entity. And the pressure-cooker of poverty, neglected mental illness, and consistent emotional deprivation makes this choice somewhat easier. This is troubling. And it should be troubling. Because it has a distinct ring of reality to it in this superhero universe, which immediately ceases to be a superhero universe, melding as quicksilver into a type of villainology, ultra-reality and urban folk hero mythology, combined. Rioting mobs masked as clowns, and Batman’s origins, indeed. To all calling out Joker‘s grimness/pretension, almost a sign of the crucifix to the why so serious? tagline, think about this: if it were not for Nietzsche, how would we know of the superman? The complete concept was born in that original individualist nihilist mind – a siren call of the fallen genius to the disenfranchised to rise to the occasion of their existence – one that was so catastrophically misinterpreted, so philosophically mangled, so politically defiled, that perhaps it might have been better for it to never have existed at all. Which is exactly what a nihilist would seek, as what is more exhilarating to anyone of the mindset, than a death of an idea? The point is, the Joker is fundamentally an individualist anarchist narrative that could easily go collectivist alt-right, that much the critics almost united in their nervous disdain got accurately. However, the audiences are either walking out or giving the film post-screening ovations (of which I witnessed one). That’s pretty inconvenient. It means something, culturally. The film’s moral ambivalence in taking bottom-line sides makes the entire phenomenon even more problematic, in the political sense, but not in an artistic or humanist one. Discussing Joker becomes a precious social experiment in intellectual courage, watching it – a purgatory in emotional honesty. The fact is that many budding jokers exist out there, alt-right incels or just lonely souls living in poverty, battling mental issues, which is what this antihero really is. They won’t go away if we look away. On the contrary. The more they feel shunned, belittled and ignored, the more they will be driven to meltdown. That’s how it works in human nature. And that’s what this film nails, fully. Will they be influenced by the film, as per concerns raised upon release? Highly unlikely, as art generally inspires catharsis, not mayhem, or at least – we hope not. But they’ll inevitably find inspiration somewhere else, if they are looking for it. And censoring art because it tells the truth in a dangerous way plays into the worst impulses of the liberal left, and the deepest desires of the extreme right. We also forget at our own peril that fascist movements throughout history had working-class roots, and grew strong by addressing actual exploitation, while secretly aligning their strategy with corporate interests. Watching the end of Joker gave me a bad feeling I could not shake for hours afterwards. Arthur Fleck, the man behind the mask, is a tragic apolitical loner, alienated from his deceptively caring mother, a sweetly sinister Frances Conroy (all cinema mothers turn out to be the culprits when there is psychosis involved), a kind but profoundly romantically disinterested neighbour (Zazie Beetz),  and generally derisive ex-colleagues (bar one notable exception) – who finally finds affection and adulation he sought all his life in his way more socially organised brethren. In the end. This is how all monsters are born, the bloody credits set amidst an asylum escape seem to say.  And I thank the filmmakers for reminding us of it. If you manage to look at the film without a subjective lens, and that is a tall order – what you will see is simply a dire warning of what the enormous disparity in wealth across the globe is slowly building up to, and how this divide is potentially impacting the most vulnerable in society. Or you’ll just see an unorthodox, cunning supervillan studio movie, featuring a virtuoso smarmy Robert De Niro playing a stand-up mentor/torturer, essentially a Jerry Langford character, in a meta-plot to derail an aspiring comic/psychotic Travis Bickle Phoenix into an inadvertent laugh. For shallow kicks and a lot of monies. No matter. Nowadays, the access to the lives of the small percent living the good life is just a click away from the vast ocean of the ones that are devastatingly dispossessed. Facing life at the edge of dignity becomes that more heartbreaking. And some hearts break with greater damage. A few, forever. It’s not a “nice” film; it’s uncomfortable at every turn. J Phoenix is remarkably surreal in his portrayal of the Joker. I read a lot of Batman comics in 1980-90s and he’s not the nice, quintessential, vigilante. He’s dark, troubled and seriously nasty … like the Joker! While I can’t say I “liked” the movie; it was representative of the darkness/disfunction of Gotham City and many 21st century cities … we (humanity) have to do better!",POSITIVE
"Jun 24, 2021"," Joker, directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover) and starring Joaquin Phoenix (Signs, Gladiator), positions itself as both an origin story and a grounded character study for the Clown Prince of Crime. While the movie has been the subject of much controversy, including a debate over whether or not the film will incite mass violence, ultimately it all amounts to very little since the end result is not all that violent, and frankly a bit shallow. Joker follows the life of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), who works as a clown-for-hire and supports his frail, elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy). Life always seems to grind him down as he’s assaulted by a group of teens outside the furniture store where he works and he feels like he cannot communicate with his social worker. The only things that bring Arthur joy are his interactions with single mother Sophie (Zazie Beetz), who lives down the hall, and watching talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), who inspires him to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian. When an altercation with three employees of Wayne Enterprises on the subway turns violent, Arthur slowly starts to slip into madness. The reports of the “Clown Killer” spark riots in the streets, mostly aimed at tearing down the image of billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) as a helping hand to the city. Phoenix’s performance as Fleck is equal parts haunting and compelling. To prepare for the role, Phoenix lost over fifty pounds and the result sees him hunched over in several scenes, his body contorting with inhuman grace and bones jutting out from his skin. Fleck also suffers from a condition that causes him to break out into laughter at inappropriate times. His cackles mix with sobs as he tries to control himself. As the film progresses, he stops trying to conceal these behaviors and embraces them, using them to form his Joker persona. It’s a gradual, gripping transformation and Phoenix sells you on every moment of it. The cinematography is the secondary star of the film, thanks to the guiding hand of Lawrence Sher (The Hangover, Due Date). Contrast is key to the events of the film, especially where Fleck is concerned. A key visual involves a flight of stairs early in the movie. Fleck trudges up said stairs, head downcast as he is obscured in shadow. Toward the end of the film, he engages in a joyful dance in his full Joker regalia, the sun shining down upon him. Sher also pulls the camera toward Fleck in key moments when his psychosis is unleashed creating an unsettling effect. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is underserved by limited screen time and paper-thin characterizations, particularly Beetz. De Niro, to his credit, makes a meal out of the morsels he’s given and lets his character’s boisterous personality speak for itself. The script, co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, has several lines of dialogue that would sound utterly ridiculous coming out of anyone other than Phoenix’s mouth. A scene toward the end where Fleck rants about “society” failing him comes off less like fiery judgment and more like the Twitter rant of a furious gamer. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Joker is that for all the hype around Philips making a “grounded character study featuring the Joker,” it doesn’t settle on a clear theme. Is it about how society fails the mentally ill? How the one percent lives versus the rest of us? I was expecting a Joker movie to at least tackle the former, given that demonization of the mentally ill is a very real problem, but those themes were tackled far better in Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, the films which reportedly inspired Phillips while making Joker.  Ultimately, Joker is neither deserving of the controversy it’s stirred up nor some of the praise it’s received. Phoenix’s performance is the highlight of what is ultimately a relatively tame film.

"Jun 14, 2021"," The camera crawls slowly towards a figure perched in front of a large, luminescent mirror. It sits on the Joker bearing a full face of his inimitable makeup, a single black tear trickling down his cheek. He pops a thumb into each corner of his mouth to extend a craggy, malevolent smile.  “I just hope my death makes more sense than my life,” the embattled pre-Joker, Arthur Fleck confesses via a scribble in his tattered old journal. With an inscrutable gaze, his social worker looks on having just witnessed Fleck laugh over nothing in particular for the past sixty seconds or so. Prescribed with seven different meds to temper his psychosis, he is a man on the brink.  Arthur works low-end jobs holding commercial signs on busy thoroughfares. He gurns and gesticulates for the amusement of sick children dressed as a clown. He looks after his housebound mother, helping her to wash. Together they watch their TV show staple: Tonight with Murray Franklin – Fleck drifting into fanciful fantasies of being onstage with Murray, applause bouncing off the studio walls.  The presence of Robert De Niro in the role of charismatic talk show host Murray Franklin is quietly vital to the movie’s credibility, offering a tacit admission of the similitude with the Scorsese/De Niro 1982 vehicle The King of Comedy.  In many ways, Arthur Fleck is that film’s Rupert Pupkin. Much like Pupkin, Fleck wants to be a stand-up comedian. He wants to bring joy to the world. He wants to make people smile. He wants to be loved and give love in return. Fleck quickly discovers that the world is not so welcoming. It is a vicious, dog-eat-dog place where people are quick to ridicule, alienate, denigrate and isolate.  The role of the Joker is delicious for any actor, enabling them to roll up their sleeves and get all wacky and outlandish. They can ham it up and hammer it home. But considering the iconic turn of the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, the shoes to fill are large, requiring a heavyweight actor bringing nothing less than their A-game.  Joaquin Phoenix, however, likes a challenge. Be it taking his method acting to an unwitting Late Show with David Letterman as a fictional hip-hop artist for I’m Still Here or having his jaw wired shut on one side by a dentist for his role in The Master. For this turn, he lost 40 pounds of weight by consuming little more than an apple a day.  The sacrifice has been worth it. The appearance is one thing, but the all-round delivery is a tour-de-force. He pulls off the difficult trick of delivering an anti-hero whom connects with the viewer even though they may deplore his decisions and abhor his actions. Phoenix translates this discombobulating sensation out of the screen and into your senses. The Academy might as well give Phoenix the Oscar now. By paring it all down, in the first of what is to be known as ‘DC Black’, a series of films away from the DC Extended Universe, the company have made a picture destined to challenge Marvel’s dominance. It should also help restore faith in the ailing DC brand too. If there is one criticism to levy at Joker, it is that one of the climactic scenes is extended past the point in which belief can be suspended considering its very ‘real world’ context. To say anything less cryptic would spoil the surprise though. Anyway, that alone isn’t enough to derail the power of this instant classic. Yup, instant classic. Bold words. Bold proclamation. It is said without fear of plausible recrimination. Todd Phillips’ isn’t clowning around. This is edge-of-your-seat stuff. This is outstanding.",POSITIVE

"Feb 17, 2021","  The Joker character has had two iconic performances in Batman film adaptations in the past 30 years — Jack Nicholson in 1989’s Batman and Heath Ledger in 2008’s The Dark Knight. However, both were in service of a story revolving around the superhero. The DC Universe, still trying to find its footing overall, continues its exploration of its villains with the origin story Joker.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a man who has a brain condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate moments. He works as a clown — perhaps in an attempt to mask his condition, lives at home with his ill mother (Frances Conroy), and pines over his neighbor, Sophie (Zazie Beetz).  Arthur is about as big of a social outcast as you could be, and a variety of people take advantage of his vulnerability, including late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), who mocks one of Arthur’s stand-up comedy bits on air. Arthur eventually hits his breaking point, resulting in violent outbursts that inspire others in all the wrong ways.  If you didn’t know that Joker had comic book origins, you might mistake the movie as a cautionary real-world tale. And maybe it still is, as writer/director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver seem to be commenting on a variety of social issues, including the lack of care for people with a mental illness. The painful sincerity of many of the scenes makes it almost impossible to detach and view it as “just a movie.”  Even though Batman, in the form of Bruce Wayne as a child, makes an appearance, the tone of the film is not comic book at all. Arthur is not some megalomaniac bent on ruling the criminal underworld; he’s a scared, lonely man who never really grew up and doesn’t know how to fit in. He’s not a hero, villain, or even anti-hero; he’s a person to be pitied and reviled in almost equal measure. With the presence of De Niro, there’s an easy comparison to be made with his role as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, but Arthur is even more pathetic than that.  Phoenix’s performance is sure to be divisive. He certainly commits to the role, dropping weight to appear gaunt and using a laugh that’s gratingly effective. But the act wears thin the more the movie goes along, and the lack of sympathetic qualities in the character makes him extremely difficult to watch, much less support.  What you think of Phoenix will likely be what you think of the movie as a whole, as he is in literally every scene. This is somewhat to the detriment of well-known supporting actors like De Niro, Brian Tyree Henry, and Marc Maron, the latter two of whom show up in bit roles not equal to their talents. Beetz gets more play, but her character has almost nothing to do.  Although it has some of the hallmarks of a mainstream movie, there’s little that’s entertaining about Joker. Phoenix’s version of the character is uncomfortable, to say the least, and his off-putting nature will likely not inspire many repeat viewings. 1.

"Jan 31, 2021"," 
	We will never know what Cesar Romero, the first actor to wear the Joker’s scary clown make up, would think about his old alter ego as interpreted by Joaquin Phoenix in “Joker,” but one thing is for sure, he wouldn’t recognize the nihilistic new take on the character. 
	Set in a rat-infested Gotham City, the story sees Arthur Fleck, an unstable man doing the best he can with state sponsored therapy and medication. By day he performs as a clown, dancing at children’s hospitals or holding “Going Out of Business” signs on Gotham’s mean streets. At night, when not day dreaming of becoming a stand-up comic, he’s tending to his infirm mother (Frances Conroy). Late at night they cozy up and watch their favorite TV show, a talk show hosted by Merv Griffin wannabe Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Sometimes Arthur even daydreams that Murray is a warm and loving father figure. 
	In the real-world things have a grimmer shade. Arthur is constantly harassed by co-workers and, worse, abused by complete strangers. On the day he is fired from his job he fights back, shooting and killing three businessmen who tried to beat him on his subway ride home. When news of the Clown Killer circulates, he becomes the anonymous figurehead of a populist resistance movement. Protesters riot in the streets, wearing clown masks and with signs emblazoned with slogans like ""We are all clowns"" and ""Down with money."" 
	Not that Arthur notices. “I’m not political,” he says. With no job, and, after his therapy program is cancelled, no medication, his extreme behavior escalates. “I’ve got nothing to lose,” he says. “Nothing can hurt me anymore.” 
	Although ripe with elements from older movies like “Death Wish,” the God’s lonely man favorites “Mean Streets” and Taxi Driver” and echoes from real-life forgotten names like Bernard Goetz, “Joker” is no period piece. It’s as timely as yesterday’s headlines. A study of everything from alienation and disappointment to the failure of social safety nets and access to weapons, it’s a character study not just of the Joker but of a troubled time. “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society who abandoned him?” Joker asks. “You get what you deserve.” 
	This isn’t a superhero film, there are links and connections to the Batman and Joker stories that came before but this is a horror movie, a look into what happens when the chaos in Arthur’s head becomes manifest. “For my whole life I didn’t know if I existed,” he says, “but now I know I do and people are noticing.” He’s the result of a broken system that turns their back on the mentally ill and underprivileged. 
	Phoenix, who dropped fifty-two pounds to play the role, displays not just a wasted body, but also spirit in a haunting performance that reinvents the character for a new generation. His take on Arthur finds its roots in marginalized people. It is a harrowing performance, not always easy to watch, that almost generates sympathy for a broken man who becomes an agent of chaos and one of the DC Comics’ greatest villains. 
	“Joker” drags in its middle section, unpleasantly luxuriating in Arthur’s grim collapse into anarchy, but is held afloat by Phoenix. It may not be a deep or realistic study of mental illness but it showcases Arthur’s weariness at being treated as the cigarette butt under society’s heel. 
	The message of finding control through vigilante violence is a disturbing one, but IRL it’s one that plays out on the news with disturbing frequency. “Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?” Arthur asks. 
	Adapted from Frank Cottrell Boyce's short story, ""Triple Word Score,"" the film sees Nighy play Alan, a widowed tailor with a fractured family. He has a strained relationship with his ice cream van painter son Peter (Riley) stemming from an incident decades before when his son Michael disappeared after an argument over a game of Scrabble. Alan is still a Scrabble fanatic—he’s a walking dictionary of obscure, high-scoring words like scopone and muzhik—but these days he mostly plays online. It’s there he comes across a competitor whose word choice and style of play reminds him of his AWOL son. Could it be Michael? “The only thing I am scared of is ding before I sort this thing out,” he says. 
	There’s more. Alan cheats a couple out of £200 bending the rules to his favor, and hips his grandson to the joys of Scrabble over first-person-shooter games but the heart of the movie has little to do with the word game. It’s a father and son story about a tormented man who is a master of words but could never find the right thing to say to either of his sons. 
	“Sometimes Always Never” plays on director Carl Hunter’s background in graphic design—he has designed record sleeves for The Clash and his own band, The Farm—to create the movie’s stylized, quirky look. Visual echoes of Aki Kaurismaki and Wes Anderson resonate throughout, lending a kind of magic realism to a story that is grounded in basic humanity—a search for the missing piece of the family’s puzzle. 
	This is another of Nighy’s gently eccentric characters, a man touched with sadness but hopeful enough to pursue an answer to the mystery that has plagued him for years. Nighy is always immensely watchable but here he brings an easy, elegant charm to Alan, despite the character’s emotional handicap. 
	“Sometimes Always Never” is a small film about big topics that balances an overarching feel of sorrow with heavy doses of whimsy. Eloquent both visually and emotionally, it speaks volumes about heartbreak even when the characters can’t quite find the words to do so themselves. 
	Just because the movie has a generic title doesn’t mean it has a run-of-the-mill story. “Robbery,” a new crime film starring Jeremy Ferdman and Art Hindle, is, indeed, the story of a theft, but not just of goods. It’s also about how dementia robbed a man of his memories. 
	Ferdman plays Richie, a small-time crook with big-time debt to a hard-nosed casino owner (Jennifer Dale). She means business. “Your sticky fingers,” she says to the thief, “I need to take them.” To raise the cash Richie needs to stop knocking off convenience stores and step up his game. To pull off the robberies he needs the help of his father Frank (Hindle) to teach him the ins-and-outs of a large-scale criminal operation. Frank spent five decades on the wrong side of the law but the clock is ticking. Frank has been diagnosed with dementia. Soon his years of underworld knowledge will disappear and with them Richie’s chances of getting out of the hole. 
	Writer and director Corey Stanton takes the been-there-done-that premise of a young thief and mentor pulling off a job to avert some very dire consequences and breathes new life into it by adding in unexpected twists and turns along with characters that, while flawed, are compelling. The finale amps up the melodrama but until then Stanton does a great job of laying out the puzzle pieces, building tension with good pacing and layers of tricky plotting. Most importantly Frank’s illness is never used as a gimmick or plot point. His dementia is part of the overarching plot devices used to fuel the narrative engine, and it pays off thematically and dramatically. 
	Stanton is aided by his actors. Ferdman and the supporting actors, including McArthur and Tara Spencer-Nairn, make the most of characters who live on the edge and yet bring humanity and interest to each of them. For my money, however, this is Hindle’s show. He has terrific chemistry with Ferdman and convincingly flip-flops between hardened criminal and bewildered older man. If you don’t buy into the character of Frank you won’t buy into the movie but Hindle gives him dimension and even garners our sympathy. 
	“Robbery” has more heart than most heist films and more intrigue than most family dramas. It’s a tightrope walk but Stanton and his cast pull it off nicely. 
	Based on “Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite” by Jake Bernstein, “The Laundromat” chronicles the rot that festers on the corrupt body of our financial institutions. 
	Divided into chapters with names like “Secret Number One: The Meek Are Screwed,” “The Laundromat” is a funny, star-studded portmanteau of thematically linked stories involving tax loopholes, exploitation and financial malfeasance. “All these stories are about money,” says Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas), “the secret lives of money.” Like “The Big Short” it takes the spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down approach to telling a story so dripping with bile you have to laugh to stop from crying. 
	Meryl Streep is at the helm of this cinematic op-ed playing Ellen Martin, a steely woman whose husband’s death leads her by the nose into the world of fake insurance policies and a shady Panama City law firm run by slicksters Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Fonseca. The flamboyant represent “drug lords, sex traffickers and destroyers of the planet” and also colourfully narrate the action. “Tax avoidance and tax evasion,” says Mossack. “The line between them is as thin as a jailhouse wall.” They’re more interested in the shell companies they control that help line the pockets of their very wealthy clients than the regular Joes affected by their actions. “Bad is such a big word for such a small word.” 
	As the story splinters into chapters, cameos from Jeffrey Wright (as a secretive insurance broker), Nonso Anozie (as a billionaire who tries to buy his way out of trouble) and David Schwimmer (as a business person screwed by his insurance company) pile up, revealing personal aspects of the dirty business of money laundering. The story wanders here and there but Streep stays on course, lending this ragged movie a strong emotional core. 
	“The Laundromat” features lively performances—I’m looking at you Oldman and Banderas—timely commentary about whistleblowers and fraud and a rousing fourth wall breaking ending and yet, feels like less than the sum of its parts. Director Steven Soderbergh provides some well-crafted big moments but the stories are too far flung and too brief to inspire any real interest in the characters. They come and go with little development (save for Martin), often representing ideas rather than fully formed characters. 
	Streep plays a double role, an ill-advised choice that feels like a stunt and doesn’t lend much to the telling of the tale, but wraps things up with a wake-up call, asking basic questions—Who is accountable? Where and how do you get justice?—that put a period on this story but should be a starting point for more discussion and thought.",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2021"," Todd Phillips is the consummate hype man. Situated to take perfect advantage of the maelstrom of handwringing that has permeated the public consciousness ever since it won the Golden Lion at Venice, Joker has seized the cinematic zeitgeist in a way that no other film has in quite some time. Amidst a toxic fandom whose stubborn ferocity is matched only by its unwavering myopia, a growing concern for Arthur Fleck inspired incel violence, and Phillips’ own take on “woke” culture, the discourse surrounding Joker is deafening and inescapable. Admirably enough, the director of The Hangover trilogy has crafted a chameleon of a canvas rife for rampant projection: Many can and will hail Joker as a masterpiece, while others will condemn it as a reprobate enabler of white loner violence. It is however - in the spirit of measured reflection - important to divorce the fevered fist-waving from the actual film and its messaging, which unfortunately, don’t amount to much. In the end, it is a film worthy of neither blind exaltation nor watchdog fear-mongering - it simply isn’t significant enough to warrant it. Joker wears its influences from the likes of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy on its rust-orange sleeve, but where Martin Scorsese constructs cinematic monuments, Phillips is stuck with Duplo blocks, fiddling with a delusion of self-importance. Joker centers around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely and damaged individual that works as a freelance clown. Living alone in a graying apartment with his sick mother (Frances Conroy), Fleck endures a litany of iniquities that seemingly never ceases: He’s chased down and beaten by a gang of hooligans, seen as a freak and outcast by the community, and eventually fired from his job. Suffering from a tic that might be the result of childhood abuse, Arthur laughs uncontrollably, often at the most inopportune of times. When a confrontation with some Wayne Enterprises finance bros on the subway leads to an inevitable act of harrowing violence, it sends him unraveling, inadvertently turning him into an anonymous figurehead for a deteriorating Gotham City’s “eat the rich” movement.  There’s no doubt that there’s a sinister power behind Joaquin Phoenix’s immersive performance: a wiry transformation on the level of Christian Bale’s Trevor Reznik in The Machinist. A contortionist and an angular bag of bones, Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck is visually iconic and emotionally raw, but Joker’s shallow script holds him back. Typically a masterful shapeshifter who disappears into his roles, Phoenix is saddled with on-the-nose dialogue that cheapens the narrative. “I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it’s a fucking comedy,” Fleck states at one point. It’s a clunker of a line, made palatable only through the seasoned actor’s sheer force of will. And later - as if Todd Phillips’ and screenwriter Scott Silver’s punchline needed an extra sledgehammer to execute its coup-de-grace - we get: “What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? I’ll tell you what you get! You get what you fucking deserve!” The film wants to say something about mental illness, but there’s nothing underneath, no matter how much research went into Fleck’s pseudobulbar affect. The actor who so skillfully evaporated into gems like Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master and Lynne Ramsay’s equally violent but vastly more profound You Were Never Really Here still exists in Joker, he just has to wade through a stilted narrative to show his expressive face. The film’s purported meditation on class and the state of society is equally muddled. Phillips obviously intends for Arthur’s isolation and turn to violence to stem from a laundry list of injustices - including the class divide, the implosion of modern civility, bureaucratic corruption, and a bevy of other reasons - but Joker doesn’t have the narrative economy to tackle even one of these ideas, let alone all of them. Arthur, who is supposedly the symbol of Gotham’s so-called revolution, doesn’t even share the movement’s nascent ideology until late in the game, and even then, he only shruggingly accepts the mantle out of convenience. In addition, Joker’s threadbare ties to the Batman mythos is at most an afterthought, which only serves to undermine the film’s comic book roots. Thomas and Martha Wayne, little Bruce, and Alfred Pennyworth all make appearances, but only as fleeting reconfigurations into effigies of the oppressive elite. Todd Phillips, with Joker, has proven himself to be capable of much more than the juvenile bacchanals of The Hangover, Due Date, and War Dogs, but his interpretation of the Clown Prince of Crime is a misguided one. With gorgeous cinematography, a resounding soundtrack, and an attention-grabbing performance from Joaquin Phoenix, the film props up a veneer of depth and gravitas, but in the end is just a shallow imitation of its influences. One could even argue that Joker is a misnomer, a film fully severed from its main character’s foundation. It’s fully understandable that Phillips wants Arthur Fleck to be his own man, but without Heath Ledger’s anarchy, Mark Hamill’s theatricality, Jack Nicholson’s sadism, or Cesar Romero’s camp, there’s no identity for this clown to cling to other than another man with a loaded gun, lashing out at the society around him.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 29, 2021"," When Heath Ledger posthumously took home the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the annual ceremony in 2009, it wasn’t just a pity win. His take as the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” was revolutionary, cementing his place in Hollywood history as the only actor to win an Oscar for acting in a superhero film. That isn’t to say he was the first person to play the Joker. Who can forget Jack Nicholson and his face prosthetics in Tim Burton’s “Batman”? Or Jared Leto’s “we get it, you’re so method” whack at the iconic green-haired villain in “Suicide Squad”? Even Luke Skywalker himself has lent his voice to an animated iteration. And while I didn’t think anyone would ever be able to fill the large shoes Ledger left behind, I am happy to report I’m eating those words for breakfast, lunch and dinner for, minimally, the next six months thanks to the newest film in the Batman universe. It tackles the backstory of, not our hero, but his arch-nemesis with the perfect storm: an unflinchingly gritty script, precise production design, a scary vision for the Joker of today and just the right talent to pull it off. Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, best known for his buddy comedies “Old School”, “Road Trip” and “The Hangover” series, “Joker” is a tantalizingly dark case study of evil created, not born. A villain formed by society, Joker this time is played by the notoriously shy Joaquin Phoenix, an actor’s actor and scene-stealer who melts into the role of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck party clown whose verbal ticks and off-kilter sense of humor don’t make him any friends. He supports his bed-ridden mother (Frances Conroy) in a slummy apartment in Gotham’s sketchiest neighborhood by taking odd jobs dressed in full make-up and wig, moonlighting as a wannabe stand-up comedian. The iconic laugh associated with the perpetually grinning anti-hero is even given some context. It’s not just a device used to instill greater fear of the character; Arthur has a physical disability, a product from an abusive past that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times. The head trauma from his childhood also plays into his inconsistent grip on reality, a dizzying drink of dissociation. He falls hard for the single mom down the hall (Zazie Beets) and daydreams about what it would be like to be a guest on his favorite late night talk show hosted by the smarmy Franklin Murray (Robert De Niro). Arthur's life begins to unravel when the world continues to knock him down. He loses his job and gets picked on one too many times, setting off a series of events leading to a cultural revolution threatening to burn Gotham to the ground. At first hesitant to claim his rightful place as the king of mayhem and overseer of the uprising, Arthur is replaced by Joker, a rash, brash, unapologetic killer who is no longer confined by expectations or etiquette.  With a portfolio of films that veer on the side of comedy, Phillips tackles his first true drama with ""Joker"", and he absolutely nails it. The psychological suspense builds slowly but steadily with a script that balances the two most important aspects in a big screen character study: space in the small moments for a break-out performance and a firm hand with the storyline that flows naturally to the fireworks finale we expect from a ""superhero movie"".  But this isn't like any other Batman film we've seen and could best be compared to ""Logan"", the Wolverine send-off that plucked at heartstrings and fully rounded out the character and his journey. In the same way, this film rests solely on Phoenix's shoulders. As the titular character, Arthur/Joker is present in nearly every scene, and his emotional journey is under constant scrutiny. From his mannerisms to his physicality (the actor reportedly lost 52 pounds and developed symptoms of a disorder), Phoenix gives the performance of his career, one already filled with admirable, transformative performances.  But this one is different. This one is his cry for gold. Oscar gold, and the masses will surely be chanting his name and singing his praises on high.",POSITIVE

"Dec 7, 2020"," ealth commissioner Edward O’Rourke declares a state of emergency (likely around the year 1981, though the setting is obviously fictional) concerning the garbage piling up on the streets of Gotham City, thanks to a strike by trash collectors. And with the overflow of litter comes super-rats, which are sure to further plague the people on the bottom, who must traverse these infested, decaying avenues. It’s a bleak setup for the arrival of a fitting antagonist; when the disconnect between the ultra wealthy and the utterly destitute grows large enough, the city will burn – and a macabre symbol of resistance and chaos will rise. In the context of a superhero flick, this premise sounds commonplace. But “Joker” is no ordinary superhero flick. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of traditional action-comedies in the vein of Marvel’s seemingly one-a-month output. It may be the DC universe, but it’s been stripped of all glamor, adventure, and straightforward humor; it’s “Taxi Driver” (not just due to Robert De Niro’s casting) crossed with “The Silence of the Lambs” (some of the cinematography resembles horror films, and the graphic violence is undoubtedly horrifying), highlighting the ugliness and the sorrow of tough times fueled by anxiety and governmental abandonment. All of the superheroism has been scrubbed out, leaving in its place resentment, neglect, and anger (and rebellion along the lines of “A Clockwork Orange”). Arthur “Happy” Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is the product of this unsightliness, having endured years of abuse at the hands of all sorts of people, now recently released from a mental hospital with little supervision save for an uncaring social worker checkup and seven different prescriptions. Like Peter Lorre’s Beckert from “M,” Fleck toys with his face as if it were a malleable mask, experimenting with how his appearance fails to reflect what lies underneath. Not only does he contend with a number of mental illnesses, filling him with permeating, morbid thoughts, but he also suffers from a rare neurological disorder that causes him to burst into fits of uncontrollable laughter, often through tears of misery. It doesn’t help that he has no friends, he lives alone with his mother (serving as her caretaker), and his peers routinely regard him with discomfort. “People think you’re weird.” So, of course, a fellow clown from Fleck’s work gives him a gun and bullets. Arthur may have the initial intentions of a Patch Adams, but with all the disappointments and the contempt that surround him, it’s not long before he wanders down the path of vigilantism. And this is a very unusual side of vigilantism – when someone dangerous and far less than a righteous antihero opts to be judge, jury, and executioner. The film builds a considerable amount of tension through continuous, aberrant behavior, becoming darker and darker as the story progresses. If it was designed primarily to emphasize and examine mental illnesses and the way that society responds to them, “Joker” would be a profound, penetrating picture. But the protracted episodes of delusional psychosis chiefly work to craft an origins tale for Batman’s archenemy; the repetitive grotesqueries aren’t given a context beyond how a severely mistreated, emotionally fraught person might transform into an eccentric serial killer – and then a riot-inducing icon of disgruntlement. Nevertheless, this is surely the most realistic depiction of a supervillain becoming a supervillain thus far, coping with specific derangements, constant belittlement and psychological torment, and tragic physical abuse. The looming, literal class warfare is a backdrop for Arthur’s alienation and loss of identity, leading to violent retaliation, some of which is so shrouded in breaks from reality that it’s difficult to sort out what is actually happening and what is transpiring only in his mind. But Phoenix gives 200% to this role, supplying fascinating explanations for the Joker’s jester makeup, his murderous motives, and his relationship to Bruce Wayne – all formerly cryptic bits of a legendary mythology. Phoenix is clearly thoroughly invested in his performance, even when many of his more unsympathetic, highly disturbing actions and mannerisms make the film hard to watch. But with the peripheral connection to Batman, audiences will likely give lots of leeway to the distressing representation of psychological disorders and Fleck’s moral bankruptcy. Yet “Joker’s” boldness and originality, particularly in the realm of comic book character adaptations, doesn’t always translate into entertainment value. Apart from Phoenix’s unforgettable turn, the film is unrelentingly unsettling. Designed by Mike Massie | © 2006-2024 Gone With The Twins | All movie related images © their respective owners.

"Oct 19, 2020"," Let's get this out of the way first. Joaquin Phoenix saves Joker. Without Mr. Phoenix, Joker would be kind of dull. Without Mr. Phoenix, there would be no danger. As it is, even with Mr. Phoenix Joker, isn't as smart as it thinks it is. At times it feels like first year psych mixed with first year philosophy, with a dash of some half read Thomas Harris novels. It often mistakes nihilism for dark, predictable for edgy. Humourless for serious. Style for substance.  This isn't me saying I didn't enjoy Joker. I did. Is Joker a great film, like the filmmakers think it is? Not really. Is it a good film? Yes, yes it is. But that's the Phoenix quotient coming into play. Without Joaquin Phoenix, Joker might not be good at all.  What else is Joker not? It is not a remake of Taxi Driver, though there are moments that are meant to remind the audience of Travis Bickle. But, the finger gun to the temple is recurring motif. It is not a remake of The King of Comedy, though Robert De Niro is playing a role meant to remind of us of Jerry Lewis' Jerry Langford. And Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck hangs a blanket and practices walking through the curtain onto the talk show stage. Joker isn't based on any existing DC story, has no place in the Batman mythos. But there are moments taken straight from the pages of The Dark Knight Returns and Killing Joke.  What is Joker then, I can hear you asking patiently. Well, at times it's incredibly uncomfortable. I started to squirm somewhere between the comedy club called Pogo's, which was the name of John Wayne Gacy's clown persona and Joker's sharp edged clown make-up, which is based on the clown make-up of, well, John Wayne Gacy. Joker isn't going to do any clowns any favours. Heck, after this and It: Chapter 2, I'm hoping for a feel-good clown movie, something clown positive. Anyway. This is reading pretty negative, I better get to some of the good. I mean, I did enjoy this movie. I enjoyed Lawrence Sher's cinematography. The movie looks like it was shot in 1981. The yellows and the beiges and the grain and the grit. It all has a dirty, washed out look. But it goes deeper than that. The movie has a texture that can be found in low budget movies from that era. It's something almost tangible. None of the colours really pop until Arthur Fleck is in full make-up, dancing down stairs that belong in Georgetown, behind the MacNeil home. It's one of the moments that elevates the movie into something approaching greatness. Arthur Fleck in a suit the colour of dried blood, clown make-up on, hair coloured with a hint of green, dancing to music only he can hear, as he makes his way down stairs straight out of The Exorcist.  I also enjoyed the details - smoking everywhere, the layer of grime and soot everywhere, the smudged mirrors and peeling paint. The yellow teeth, the stained fingers. It's rare the film that conveys what it must smell like in the world it has created. Joker pulls that off and then some. This is a movie that smells like cigarette smoke and lead exhaust. This is a movie that smells like TV dinners and cabbage. That smells like sweat and desperation and panic. People looking for their comic book movies to be shiny and fresh and antiseptic should look somewhere else. This is a gritty comic book movie that makes other gritty comic book movies look like Wonderful World of Disney.  And then there's Joaquin Phoenix. At this point, to say Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor is kind of like saying the sun is nice or bacon tastes good. In Joker he contorts himself, externally and internally. He is incredibly uncomfortable in his own skin. He has a choking, gasping laugh when he is under emotional stress, almost like a form of Tourette's. He also has a high pitched laugh/giggle that is always misplaced, always coming at inappropriate moments or a beat late. It's like a hyena that doesn't understand humour but is trying, desperately, to fit in. A large part of what makes Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck tick might be his desperation. He just oozes desperation. It comes off of the screen in waves. It's a challenge for the lizard part of our brains to feel any sympathy or empathy for Arthur. He is desperate to be the hero of his own story. He is desperate for his mother's affection. He is desperate for honest human connections. But he is a psychopathic loser who just stumbles from one accident to the next, rarely taking any initiative. And when he does take initiative, it's the stuff of nightmares. Maybe it's because the character of The Joker was never given a clear origin, is an almost blank slate, maybe it's this that has allowed multiple artists to create unique and individual characters. Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and now Joaquin Phoenix. They all created individual characters that have little in common except some face paint and extremely anti-social behaviours. It's fascinating and there is little like it in popular culture. We should get into this discussion some time over beverages, adult and otherwise.  And now let us wrap this up. I liked Joker, I enjoyed the film. Did I love it? Nope. Did I dislike it? Nope. Maybe if the script was given another pass, maybe if someone had realized the pop psychology was doing no-one any favours, maybe the film could have been better. Is Joker worth seeing? Possibly. Maybe. It's your hard earned money. If for nothing else, see it for Mr. Phoenix's performance. This is highlight reel stuff. ",POSITIVE

"Sep 17, 2020"," Hollywood Anglophilia reached new heights in 2019 and The Two Popes is Exhibit A: two old Englishmen in dresses speaking in foreign accents pretending they’re popes. Because of this movie, Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy didn’t get Oscar nominations for Uncut Gems and Dolemite Is My Name. That’s strange, because Sandler and Murphy are comedians who started out on Saturday Night Live, and The Two Popes would have worked better as a sketch on Monty Python’s Flying Circus. So instead of Terry Jones in a frock, Anthony Hopkins plays Benedict XVI, the ex-Nazi pope, as if he’s the doddering ghost of Rutger Hauer. Jonathan Pryce, a veteran of four Terry Gilliam films, plays Pope Francis as a warm, life-loving nebbish who seems Jewish in his self-doubt. Even so, the pair’s dynamic lacks spark. Suitably for a Netflix film, they resolve their differences by watching TV together on the couch at home before nodding off to sleep. By the final scene, these two elderly priests dance the tango, exchanging a whisper Viaggio in Italia-style, like Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson at the end of Lost in Translation, bringing the weird, conservative pedophile wing of the Catholic Church together with the less weird wing that flirted with liberation theology when it was younger. In The Two Popes we are supposed to find it significant that Benedict doesn’t know the music of the Beatles. In Jojo Rabbit we get to hear the Beatles sing “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in German as Taika Waititi compares the Third Reich to Beatlemania in an opening montage featuring scenes from Triumph of the Will. This unasked-for pop-culture critique sets up a silly movie about friendship and acceptance—all those Nazis needed was love. Either that, or Waititi couldn’t secure the rights to “Get Back.” Waititi plays Hitler in Jojo Rabbit, with blue eyes like Robert De Niro’s in The Irishman. Hitler, acted by Waititi below Fred Armisen-level, is here a wacky sitcom neighbor more than he is deranged or even odd. It’s just that he’s touchy about Jews. At one point Waititi-Hitler blurts out “correctamundo!” to Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), the Hitler youth who fantasizes the Fuhrer is his best friend. Hitler saying “correctamundo” is only not arbitrary here because it’s a word from a sitcom. Jojo Rabbit combines Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson in the worst, cop-out ways. While an obscure song by Love called “Everybody’s Gotta Live” plays over a tricky parallel-tracking dolly shot that could come from an Anderson film, we are supposed to think of Anne Frank’s plight. When Jojo’s mother (Scarlett Johansson), the one humanizing force in his life and a member of the Resistance, is hanged in public by the Nazis, Waititi mars her tragedy by focusing too long on the spectator pumps on her feet dangling in the air, an image that is supposed to be disturbing and heartbreaking, not clever and artistic. Tarantino, like Lewis, killed Hitler in Inglourious Basterds, and I prefer the purposefully stupid “Anybody order fried sauerkraut? Burn, you Nazi bastards!” of The 14 Fists of McCluskey in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood to this mélange of other people’s styles that is cutesy, fake-subtle, emotionally manipulative, and soft on fascism. I’m fairly certain that the film is pro-Brexit, but exactly how I don’t know, and after Dunkirk I don’t care. At this current level of Hollywood production, expressionistic British militarism is all the same to me and it’s worn me out, which is perhaps its intention. I do know that 1917 buries the achievement of Russian Ark the same way calling a movie 1917 tends to obscure other things that happened that year. I guess part of the pointlessness is that a lot of things happened in 1917, and here is one of them. The war was going on in the trenches. Why it was happening we understand less from 1917 than we understand why the buffalo stampeded in The Revenant. A month before Joker came out, there was a mass shooting in Midland-Odessa, Texas. A man fired from his job drove through those cities shooting at pedestrians from his car and then from a U.S. Post Office van he hijacked. He killed seven people and wounded twenty-two others. The shooter lived alone in a metal, dirt-floor shack without electricity or plumbing, his only companion a dog. Police chased him in the postal van to the Cinergy Entertainment Permian Basin cineplex, “the largest community entertainment center in Texas,” where they shot and killed him in front of theaters showing already-forgotten movies including Don’t Let Go, Bennett’s War, The Peanut Butter Falcon, Overcomer, Angel Has Fallen, Ready or Not, Good Boys, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, The Angry Birds Movie 2, and Dora and the Lost City of Gold. On the TV news show CBS This Morning, their “Lead National Correspondent” David Begnaud, wearing a dark burgundy button-down shirt the color of blood, showed up at the cineplex and said to the camera, “We are at the movie theater here in Odessa. We’re here because this is where the rampage ended. But what police don’t know, and what they may never know, is was the gunman coming here to continue his rampage?” Joker was released in this atmosphere, in this kind of world, where after a deadly tragedy a man like Begnaud, who should know better, goes on national TV and says idiotic things at a crime scene because that’s his job. So Joker seemed to a lot of film critics, who should also know better, like it was part of the problem. Joker is about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) with a terrible life and mental health issues who loses his job and then kills people. In his case, he also goes on TV and kills a talk show host (Robert De Niro). As a Batman spin-off, it was thought that Joker could lead to a real-life mass murder like the one in Aurora, Colorado, where in 2012 a deranged, orange-haired lunatic shot and killed twelve people and wounded fifty-eight others during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. Some critics said Joker should be banned to prevent that from happening again, or at least shunned, and Entertainment Weekly, which comes out monthly, was so appalled by it that they took a bold stand by refusing to give it a letter grade at the end of their review. I dismissed these reactions, but when I went to see Joker, there was a man at the same show as me who had two large emotional support dogs with him. This man wore sunglasses throughout the entire screening, along with a tool belt that had a dozen items dangling from it, including a flashlight and bunches of Ziploc baggies, presumably for dog shit. At several points in the film he got up and walked the aisles of the theater, jangling and grunting, while the dogs, back in their seats, whined in his absence. This man’s presence had a real “Emergo” effect, like the skeleton that flew over the audience’s heads in the original House on Haunted Hill. His presence was unsettling and his random strolls added to the menace of what was on the screen. I wondered whether he was armed, so I moved to a seat closer to an exit door at the front of the theater, where I had a better chance of escaping if he opened fire. Like Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, Renée Zellweger plays Judy Garland as an emaciated exemplary sufferer. With tiny-twitchy head movements, pursed lips, little laughs and quips, and squinting, she portrays Garland in the last year of her life as doomed and drunk, a reluctant trouper not ready to go on and unwilling to accept that there is any good reason to go on except money. And unlike Phoenix, Zellweger has to sing and sound like Garland in Judy, and her fake bad dancing is better than his. Instead of being an antihero to the alienated, she has to clearly mark the line between theater kids and show people, a line that the survivors of High School Musical, Glee, Pitch Perfect, and various TV talent shows would be wise to note. Wearing a black mink over summer outfits inappropriate to the end of the year in London, Zellweger’s Judy cycles through a variety of punk looks depending on what time of day it is in the movie. She’s Stiv Bators before her shows, wasted and smeared, Sid Vicious after them, momentarily triumphant with spiky hair, and Holly Vincent when she wakes up in the morning, still alive. Zellweger finds the tragedy of Garland’s life in odd moments—staring at a pretty slice of cake she is afraid to eat, turning the plate around. Judy takes place in London in 1968 in winter. After films with Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in England (My Week with Marilyn, 2011) and Annette Bening as Gloria Grahame in England (Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool, 2017), the “Hollywood actress in decline in Great Britain” genre officially exists. Seeing the most glamorous American women of their time shivering palely in the cold under grey skies next to stagnant little pools in damp parks is how England gets its revenge on Malibu. We learn that British fans will love these women no matter what, even after they’ve been rejected by the industry, by various husbands, and by a fickle public who has moved on to Audrey Hepburn. If we find out that Barbara Payton spent the winter in Folkestone in 1960, Jennifer Lawrence will have a comeback film. With its trio of competing blondes at different stages in their careers, and a large group of characters actors playing other clownish Fox News personalities, Bombshell could have been a sharp combination of Fassbinder and Christopher Guest. Instead, director Jay Roach, of the Austin Powers movies (and Trumbo), stages it as a set of intergenerational realizations that lead to individual empowerment. If Roach had really wanted to empower this film’s audience, he and screenwriter Charles Randolph would have bluntly stated the salaries news anchors like Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) and Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) were paid to lie to their aging right-wing audience for so many years, and how their lying was further incentivized and rewarded with  bonuses. After that had been established, the film could have had a meta ending like Little Women or A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, except in this case, in one last twist, we would also learn how much money Theron and Kidman made pretending to be the deluded sellouts they were playing underneath the prosthetics. Alas, as a Hollywood movie about TV news, Bombshell is not Tout va bien. Roach has no insight into Roger Ailes as an auteur, except to have Ailes shouting the dumbest thing certain film directors also yell to excuse their worst impulses: “It’s a visual medium!” Played by John Lithgow in a fat suit as a hunchbacked ogre with a cane, Ailes in Bombshell could have been a medieval grotesque or a repellent double-crosser like Charles Laughton in The Big Clock. By the end of the film, however, we are expected to pity this fat, limping predator. Rupert Murdoch, who discards Ailes to save his TV network, is played in turn by Malcolm McDowell, a man twelve years younger than Murdoch and a hundred years better-looking, proving a woman should have directed Bombshell. On the less debonair end of the spectrum, Richard Kind plays Rudy Giuliani in Bombshell, and that is a whole movie I’d like to see, but only if it’s directed by the Safdie Brothers. Kasi Lemmons’s Harriet, a biopic of the black freedom fighter and Civil War commander who escaped slavery on her own and then risked her life to free dozens of others, has a perfunctory quality that renders Tubman’s story a little dull. The most brutal scene in the film is one of black-on-black violence, in which a slave catcher (Omar Dorsey) beats to death a freedwoman played by Janelle Monáe. Cynthia Erivo, an award-winning English theater actress, plays Harriet, and Joe Alwyn, also English, plays her former owner. This acting arrangement implies, unfortunately, that the sick, exploitative history of the American South is classy drama for English people to play, but when it comes to Americans like Dorsey and Monáe, it’s something more basic. Little Women takes place during the same period in American history as Harriet, and Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of the beloved classic features a bunch of Irish, British, and Australian actors as the title characters—Saoirse Ronan is Jo, Emma Watson is Meg, Florence Pugh is Amy, and Eliza Scanlen is poor, doomed Beth, who dies, as she always does. Laura Dern, a pure product of Southern California, beams over them as put-upon Marmee, their weirdly nicknamed mother. Was her name pronounced “Mahmee” when Little Women was written in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1868? I think it must have been, because if there’s one thing young people from New England who move to New York to become writers like Jo does should know, it’s that the hardest r’s are the ones we leave behind. Gerwig’s Little Women is an adaptation for a new century. She has reimagined the narrative, cutting it into large chunks and reordering them so Alcott’s story is told out of sequence. This was a gamble with a book that is familiar to readers all over the world, and it works. The film is something of a masterpiece, with long, loping scenes shot on location in Massachusetts. Even Paris is in Ipswich here. Each scene is so lovingly crafted and sincere, and everyone in this film seems so committed to getting it right. It’s the ultimate in professional cinema, a standard that other directors should look to. Gerwig has outdone contemporary Hollywood (and Masterpiece Theatre) in every respect. Each actor in Little Women shines, with Pugh and Timothée Chalamet (as Laurie) standing out, even as they revolve around Jo and then slide out of her orbit. Pugh was especially effective sitting next to Meryl Streep, who plays the girls’ rich aunt in purple makeup. Seeing Marriage Story on the Upper West Side, its natural habitat even though the main characters live in Brooklyn, was so perfect that by the time the movie was over I felt kind of giddy. On the way out I thought to myself, “Now here is a serious film about important things, with real acting in it. So grueling, and yet ultimately so at peace with the reality of relationships.” Unfortunately for me, seeing it at the newly reopened Paris Theater was also like going to the Trader Vic’s in the Plaza Hotel across the street afterward and having four mai tais to celebrate, if the Trader Vic’s was still there and hadn’t been closed by Donald Trump when he bought the Plaza because he thought it was tacky. The next morning I had a post-Marriage Story hangover and I hated myself for liking it. I swore I’d never go see another movie about some bougie fools and their inconsequential divorce and their real love, which is Stephen Sondheim. Johansson, for her part, has to dress like one of the Beatles on the cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and tie her ex-husband’s shoe, the same way she has to wear a Tyrolean hat and tie her son’s shoe in Jojo Rabbit. Earlier in the film, she dressed like Let’s Dance-era David Bowie. I’m not sure what this impetus to further costume the Black Widow is, but I read that the next film Noah Baumbach is writing, with Greta Gerwig, is based on Barbie, the doll. Will Barbie extract herself from her box the way Johansson escapes her marriage and finds herself a nice place in LA and wins an Emmy to put in it? As for the emotional horror of some of the breakup scenes in Marriage Story, this is also a film in which Driver has to cut his arm with a box cutter to prove the film isn’t bloodless. Marielle Heller’s new film, like her previous one, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, is set in New York in the 1990s and is also about an angry writer struggling to get by. Lloyd (Matthew Rhys) has so much integrity his editor at Esquire (Christine Lahti) is mad at him, so she sends him on an assignment they both think is beneath him: interviewing Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), the host of the PBS children’s show, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Heller’s film explicitly asks the question, “Why do we write for magazines for a living?” and answers it by stating that we do it because “we get to change a broken world with our words.” It’s a nice sentiment from a very strange film, aimed at Gen X writers from bad homes who are trying not to let life make them bitter, and probably failing. The film’s strangeness makes this convincing, and it’s what saves it from gooeyness. One of the most unexpected and evocative scenes in any film last year is in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It’s the scene with Lloyd and Fred eating lunch together in a Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, where Fred demands a moment of silence that spreads across the dining room and out into the world. Things like that are delicate and hard to make work, as are two other important elements in this film. One is the mix of models from Rogers’s TV set with real life. The other is Tom Hanks. I am starting to really enjoy late-period Hanks, and this film states right up front that it is Hanks’s sometimes otherworldly weirdness that saves him as actor, and then goes on to imply it can save all of us. Hanks-as-Rogers can talk to his puppets like they are real people, sing his simple songs about liking you, and ask grownups disarming questions: “When did you become angry? Did something happen?” So many of these films are about fatherlessness. Either fathers are absent from them, or, if they are present, are terrible, active forces that ruin lives. Ford v Ferrari is different in that it shows the way a father can be lost to a dangerous profession—a slow but sudden process in a job that’s all about speed. This Spielbergizes the film by concentrating too much attention on Ken Miles’s (Christian Bale’s) son, Peter (Noah Jupe), and reducing his sexy wife, Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), to motherhood when all we want is cars, machinery, more speed. In Red Line 7000 (1965), Howard Hawks customized his characters to be without those kinds of bonds. Mangold, whose way with actors is so sure, seeks to reinstall cinematic values into mainstream factory production. He has ended up making an auto racing film far more clean-cut than Hawks’s. As with magazines in the Mister Rogers movie, so with cars in Ford v Ferrari. Objects from another era now becoming passé, their value must be restated for the new audiences of a digital world. Mangold’s film is about how “the machine becomes weightless” and “everything fades” at 7000 RPMs, the point at which the machinery is working at top capacity. This metaphor for the cinema, about “a body moving through space and time” requires explanation because digital technology erases all that—weightlessness and other forms of non-being are built in. So Ford v Ferrari, set around the same time as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, coincidentally features some of the same things as Tarantino’s film—a fight with canned food, a hero who lives in a trailer, lots of aimless driving, competition from an Italian industry that is doing it better than the inventors of the form. The central relationship here, between two men as in certain Hawks films, is the same as in Tarantino’s movie. Matt Damon’s Carroll Shelby employs and relies on Bale’s Ken Miles to do dangerous work he can’t do himself. Since Mangold lives on the humane side of the Hawksian Fallacy, Ford v Ferrari doesn’t go as far as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, where Tarantino pushes Hawks’s cold, brutal side into new areas, exposing acting as a non-dangerous profession, a series of poses against the inner turmoil of obsolescence. Ford v Ferrari’s meta-cinematic qualities remain buried, the men are not Hollywood bozos, and the whole enterprise can be enjoyed on a basic level, even, or perhaps especially, the part where Tracy Letts’s blustery Henry Ford II explains that James Bond is a degenerate. Ford v Ferrari sticks to the facts: Ken Miles died in a car crash. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a shaggy dog story wrapped in a fairytale, saves people who were killed and kills people who are still alive. One person it does not kill is Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), stuntman for cowboy actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio). Instead, Booth is wheeled out to an ambulance, into another life, one where he no longer works for Dalton. As at the end of Hawks’s Red River, we do not want to see either of the film’s main characters die, anymore than we want to see Sharon Tate and her friends killed by the Manson Family. Dalton is given his moment of heroism in the film when he torches one of the Mansons (Mikey Madison) with a flamethrower he conveniently has in his poolside cabana, implicitly comparing the Mansons to the Nazis it was used against in one of Dalton’s films. Tarantino respects the Chekhovian rule that if you show a flamethrower earlier in the movie, you have to use it later. This weapon had appeared as a prop in a film within the film, where it was established as real—as real as anything else here. Similarly, when Dalton imagines himself into The Great Escape, replacing Steve McQueen, we see this on-screen. Tarantino digitally grafts DiCaprio into a role Dalton never played. We then cut to Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in a movie theater seeing the real Tate on-screen in The Wrecking Crew. Dalton/DiCaprio ends up in a film he wasn’t in, but Tate/Robbie does not appear in place of the real Tate in a film Tate was really in. The real enemy of such critics is not Tarantino but the passage of time, just as the future, in the form of the eight-year-old actor Trudi Fraser (Julia Butters), at first seems like a tiny nemesis for Dalton, who will render him one more humiliation. Studious, serious, worshipping Disney, young Trudi represents the future of the movies and of American culture. She helps Dalton get himself together after an eight-whiskey-sour night, and if he throws her to the floor with a little too much force in their scene together, so what? She’s wearing pads, of course, and taking falls is part of acting. If the Trudi Frasers of the world will someday replace the Rick Daltons, for now at least they know they’re both in the same game. “A little power can turn a person into a monster,” Jewell’s lawyer (Sam Rockwell) tells him early in the film. This is Eastwood’s theme. He drives it home by having Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde represent law enforcement and the news media. These good-looking, TV-ish actors play an FBI agent and a newspaper reporter soullessly, as boring hacks unconcerned with truth and justice because they are preoccupied with success and fame, and always think they’re right. In a time when, because of Trump, we are all supposed to have a newfound love for our protectors in the intelligence agencies and the media, Eastwood has decided to show them in the most perfunctory way possible, as handsome zeroes. While Hamm and Wilde meet in bars and carry on a boring affair during which they barely look at each other, Jewell’s mother (Kathy Bates) sits at home trying to watch movies like Sands of Iwo Jima while she worries about her son going to prison the way everybody worried every second that Sully might be found guilty of being a hero. The whole film has an uncomfortable, tense feeling which Eastwood establishes in the masterful Centennial Park bombing scenes and carries throughout. Set in 1996, filled with brand name products, tense with worry but stuck at home, Richard Jewell is an accurate portrait of the U.S.A. Eastwood insists it hasn’t changed much in twenty-three years. By getting the streaming service Netflix to produce and release into movie theaters a hugely expensive, three-and-a-half-hour-long movie, Martin Scorsese proved something about the cinema today and how moviegoing is different than watching TV. The Irishman, which on-screen is called I Heard You Paint Houses, which is a better title, is a story of friendship and the false sense of duty that can come from it as it deteriorates over fifty years. I saw The Irishman in a huge theater on a giant screen, and I did not want to get up, didn’t want it to end, and could have watched another hour of it if there was one. It seems like most everybody who watched it at home complained it was too long, redundant, and looked funny. It did not seem like entertainment to them. That was the message they sent out into the world and it reached me loud and clear. What does that mean? Do I have a false sense of duty to the cinema? Or have people who watch movies at home, even great ones, been trained by their quality-TV habit to want things to be bingeable in forty-five-minute chunks, easy to ignore, and better to listen to than to watch? Most people seemed to have viewed The Irishman over the Christmas holiday. Could it be that their bad mood about it has something to do with frustration with their own families, and with the sense of entrapment that comes with being home for Christmas? That’s where I think the real false duty is. The cinema may be an escape, but the living room couch in your parents’ house definitely is not one. While the florid Hoffa is the lesser of the two evils in Frank’s life, his ideals make him less convincing than the corrupt and ruthless Bufalino, who wields a quiet mastery over others. The exception is Frank’s daughter (Lucy Gallina, then Anna Paquin) who is repelled by Russell and fond of Jimmy. The awards banquet scene in this film, with Paquin and Pacino dancing while Pesci plots his demise with a reluctant De Niro, more than justifies the film’s running time, just as certain scenes justify the enormous running times of films like The Leopard, and that scene probably also has a basis in all the awards shows Scorsese has had to attend over the years. Pedro Almodóvar’s elegy to memory and loss in the life of a film director is the exact opposite of The Irishman or Uncut Gems. This is the story of a man who wants to stay at home, see nobody, and do nothing. He doesn’t even want to go to awards shows. His pain is completely internalized, as we learn in a beautifully colorful animated sequence that combines PowerPoint art and medical graphics. Salvador (Antonio Banderas), a respected film director, has learned that Pascal was right when he said that all of humanity’s problems stem from our inability to sit quietly in a room alone. That’s also a description of dying, as Salvador has slowly learned while reaching the point where he can’t do anything to get better. Then film programmers reunite him with Alberto (Asier Etxeandia), the junkie actor he blames for fucking up one of his films. The two of them have been asked to introduce a restored version of one of Salvador’s early movies, Sabor, from the 1980s. (Almodóvar has become a master at looking back at the eighties.) Alberto, the actor, asks to read a memoir Salvador has been working on, which describes Salvador’s life at that time. After reading it, Alberto decides he should turn it into a stage monologue. Its performance, not credited to Salvador, will reunite him with his lost love (Leonardo Sbaraglia) from the time of Sabor. Almodóvar’s ability to be both ultra-contemporary in his settings and ultra-modern in describing the past are unique in the cinema. Much of the film concerns Salvador’s childhood when, as it happens, he lived in cave with his mother (Penelope Cruz), and a hunky local handyman (César Vicente) painted his portrait. Almodóvar is perhaps the only director in the world who can make cave-dwelling feel like living in an art gallery, and definitely the only one who could convince us that Penelope Cruz is Antonio Banderas’s mother. As a film about filmmaking, Pain and Glory pivots on the mechanics of how screenwriting becomes cinema. Its meta-cinematic ending rivals Little Women’s but refuses to try to impress anyone watching it, a perfect encapsulation of Salvador’s character as he comes back to life. This whodunit is light entertainment at its finest, a surprising movie with an enjoyable sense of complication and a dream cast. It showed up like it came out of nowhere even though it was made by Rian Johnson, who directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Each of them was appropriately bold and squirmy while questioned by Daniel Craig, playing an incongruous Southern detective with the unlikely name Benoit Blanc. We are told he is from a long line of master police detectives down South. Maybe Blanc’s father was Sheriff J. W. Pepper from Live and Let Die and he met James Bond when Bond was Roger Moore and not Daniel Craig. Who associates police detectives from Mississippi with getting to the truth? Blanc, however, proves to be a friend of the working class when he helps the family’s Latina housekeeper (Ana de Armas) negotiate the schemes of the duplicitous family she works for, and Craig, in his absurd Southern accent, gets to ask the strangest question in movies this year, about the patriarch’s alt-right grandson (Jaeden Martell): “What were the overheard words of the Nazi child masturbatin’ in the bathroom?” Between Parasite and The Irishman, I’ve got to stop looking at Twitter. I saw a very intelligent person I know very cynically tweeting that Parasite’s success came down to canny decisions on the part of its American distributor, and then announcing that the film wasn’t sufficiently socialist. This has got to be the least predictable effect of social networking: someone in the United States upset because a successful Korean genre film doesn’t address the concerns of the DSA in the exact right way. At the same time that was happening, other critics were picking through Hong Sang-soo’s fifteen or so films of the decade trying to determine which one was the best so they could put it on their Top Ten Films of the Decade lists. None of that has anything to do with film criticism as far as I’m concerned, and denying that Bong’s work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change was reactionary in some kind of new pop culture way. It is not just those things that make Parasite an excellent movie, and there is plenty of room in the cinema for both Bong Joon-ho and Hong Sang-soo. It may be that the few people who grumbled about Parasite are just allergic to peaches, but I think what they’re really allergic to is class-based criticism in works of popular entertainment, especially when they are fueled by violence, comedy, clever screenwriting, and sharp acting. If popular movies become too leftist and continue to improve, they are going to be really annoyed.

"Sep 13, 2020"," I was already in a fragile state emotionally when I entered the movie theater to watch the long-awaited Joker. I saw the film later than I usually see films, a fact that came courtesy of my involvement in a week-long project around the issue of childhood violence that had me both emotionally and physically drained.  I've never understood violence toward children. It doesn't make sense, but it's become so commonplace that it's hard to even be surprised by it anymore.  I haven't grown used to it, not by a long shot, but I no longer go through life wearing rose-colored glasses convinced that one of these days we're going to eliminate violence toward children because one of these days we, we being society, will finally catch on to better alternatives than leaving our dead children in a laundry bag in the back yard.  It was in this fragile emotional state that I sat down to watch Joker, a film that has arrived in theaters with so many warnings and cautions and advisories that you just know Warner Brothers had to be feeling just a little bit skittish about the film's box-office potential even with its Golden Lion win at Venice Film Fest.  Joker is an imperfect masterpiece, a social justice wonderfilm masquerading as a deviant superhero film and origin story that that wrestles with a society torn asunder by inequity and greed, heartlessness and cyclical brutality.  Joker is alleged to be a stand-alone film, a one-off journey that melts itself into your skin and leaves you feeling tattooed by its horror-tinged psychosis. It's difficult to imagine Joker as a stand-alone experience, especially if it proves to be a box-office smash, but we're dealing with Joaquin Phoenix here and that instantly gives the claim credibility. Known more for his artistic integrity than a thirst for box-office numbers, Phoenix reportedly lost 40 lbs. to play Arthur Fleck/Joker and it's difficult to imagine he'll be up to the task of doing so again.  While most still proclaim Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight to be the pinnacle achievement of the comic book universe, for my money this Todd Phillips directed film lays claim to the title with a brutal Joker-like smackdown of epic proportions. While purists may, and probably will lament the film's deviations from its source material, such complaints are nonsensical.  We had all been warned in the weeks leading up to Joker's release that it was too violent, too over-the-top, and that it glorifies violence.  Joker is violent, yes, but it's far less graphic and gratuitous in its violence than recent popular films like John Wick 3 and Rambo 27, or whatever number it is now. Joker doesn't glorify the violence, but it absolutely demands that we understand it. Joker demands that we look and listen and feel the violence perpetrated upon Joaquin Phoenix's masterfully portrayed Arthur Fleck. It's an interpersonal violence and an organizational violence and an institutional violence and the kind of violence that is so pervasive you don't even know that it's happening.  Then, Joker becomes what it's ultimately meant to be - a film about what happens when the victim becomes the victor or at least stands up and demands some attention and fights back with everything they have. Joker reminded me much more of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest than it did any of the oft-quoted Scorsese influences such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.  When we meet Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, he's living a subsistent life in a Gotham City tenement apartment with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), an invalid obsessed with late night television host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Arthur, an over-medicated former asylum dweller, is semi-interested in nearby neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), though soon his interest will be derailed by a lack of medication and a late night bullying encounter that begins to unravel his psyche and bring out his darker side.  Joker takes place somewhere around 1981, though its production palette feels 70's inspired and there's little denying that Phillips is clearly identifying Gotham as symbolic of New York City.  Joker is ultimately about what happens when the joke becomes the Joker, when the society that creates inequity and discrimination and hate and despair is finally thrown into reverse and the disenfranchised fight back. Joker isn't so much a sympathetic character, but with remarkable discipline Phoenix creates an unforgettable character that you understand even as he's maniacally doing a downward spiral. He doesn't become that which created him - he becomes their worst nightmare.  It has been frequently noted that Joker is Joaquin Phoenix's film and such an observation is hard to argue, though the film's ensemble cast is impeccable down to the most minor of roles. Phoenix's physical transformation is jarring, his immersion so complete that it's jarring. Phoenix never hits a false note with a character that practically demands he play a symphony. While it's difficult to say if he will be recognized as on par with Heath Ledger, it would be utterly unforgivable for the performance to not at least receive an Academy Award nomination. The truth is that the two performances aren't comparable - they're variations of a masterpiece each beautiful in their own right.  Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Penny, while Zazie Beetz infuses the film with an under-utilized humanity as Sophie. The De Niro appearance is a stroke of genius, a bit of slight stunt casting that works as De Niro turns Pupkin into Franklin.  Hildur Guðnadóttir's somber, mournful cello score is easily one of 2019's most immersive and impactful original scores, while kudos must be given to D.P. Lawrence Sher for creating a Gotham that perfectly balances on an uneven tightrope between the darkness and light that defines Arthur Fleck's cellular transformation.  Joker isn't the best film of 2019, but it's one of 2019's most unforgettable cinematic experiences and the kind of film you will be thinking about for days and weeks after viewing it. While some will claim Joker leans to the left politically, the truth is that the film is more an apolitical journey into what happens when the have nots have had enough.",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2020"," La violencia es inherente al ser humano, de alguna forma nuestro concepto sobre lo que está bien y lo que está mal es aprendido, dictado y orquestado por una sociedad que logra organizar parámetros morales que se sitúan dentro de los paréntesis de lo correcto. La soledad saca nuestro verdadero yo, la comunidad y el temor a las consecuencias emocionales y físicas son lo que nos mantiene dentro de un pequeño espectro de estabilidad. ¿Pero qué ocurre cuando alguien es pisoteado, no escuchado, violentado, enfermo y no tiene nada qué perder? El Joker siempre ha sido uno de los villanos más icónicos en la historia del cine, las tiras cómicas, los superhéroes y la cultura pop en general, y lo que distingue a Joaquin Phoenix de sus pasadas interpretaciones es la tenebrosidad que causa el sentir su cercanía. En la sociedad actual, y me atrevo a decir que desde siempre en la comunidad humana, han existido personas como Arthur Fleck, enfermas, pisoteadas, y en un conflicto total con la moralidad. Personas que encuentran refugio en la soledad y escucha en las consecuencias de sus actos violentos. Phoenix engrandece su actuación al presentarnos una persona desconocida en un personaje repetido, cuya mayor frustración se ve reflejada en una risa patológica que termina presentando un trasfondo importante sobre el pasado de este. Sus movimientos retorcidos, expresiones faciales y penetrante mirada nos proyectan un espejo del alma de un psicópata recien nacido. Directamente inspirado en Travis Bickle de “Taxi Driver” y Rupert Pupkin de “The King of Comedy”, la presencia de Scorsese está desde la estructura del personaje hasta el ritmo de la historia. Sin dudas la mejor actuación de lo que va de año y en mi opinión la más completa y grandiosa interpretación del personaje. Una película sobre un personaje de una tira cómica, que termina siendo un thriller psicológico con la suficiente libertad creativa como para homenajear el cine, hablarnos sobre los sentimientos más oscuros de la realidad humana, deleitarnos con su banda sonora y mantenernos al borde del asiento con una inimaginable tensión, y un resultado aun más sorpresivo. Es increíble como en los primeros minutos de la cinta conectamos con su protagonista hasta el punto de saber sus pensamientos, y Phoenix se encarga, junto con la trágica trayectoria de su personaje, de desapegarnos por completo del supuesto conocimiento de lo que está ocurriendo en la mente de esta persona. Todd Phillips logra darnos una película que parece poder transmitir los mismos sentimientos viéndose totalmente muda. Es tan poderoso lo que se cuenta y de la manera en cómo se cuenta que aun soportando gran parte de su calidad en su música, me puedo imaginar sintiendo los mismos estragos viéndola sin escucharla. Una Ciudad Gótica apegada a la realidad, utilizada para servir de reflejo a nuestra sociedad actual. Y aunque terminan siendo sus escenas más clichés, no se siente forzada la introducción del universo en lo que parece ser una película tan alejada del tono del Caballero de la Noche. Lo que ocurre con Joker es que presiona fibras importantes en los sentimientos de empatía, causando una controversia interna interesante en su audiencia. Joaquin Phoenix se aprovechó de su protagonismo para dar la variación más real, única y espectacular del personaje. Una interpretación merecedora de todos los galardones. La ejecución del filme es cuasiperfecta debido a su estudio y desarrollo de personaje, su ubicación en este universo tan amado es la cereza en el tope del helado. De por sí la película es excelente, y luego de esto es que nos damos cuenta que resulta ser de uno de los villanos más importantes de los últimos tiempos.",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2020"," As the summer draws to a close, we all need some excellent films to keep us company as we curl up on the sofa and welcome the crisp autumn months. Enola Holmes, the great detective’s spirited younger sister, proves her brother’s equal in this enjoyably peppy adventure mystery based on the popular novels by Nancy Springer. Played with appealing zest by Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things, the teenage Enola is also no slouch when it comes to deductions and she, too, has a puzzle to solve. Why did her unconventional feminist mother (Helena Bonham Carter) disappear on Enola’s 16th birthday? Giving the slip to her aloof brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill, dapper and amused) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin, prim and reactionary), who want to send her to finishing school, Enola sets off for London to find her mother. Along the way, she finds her fortunes intertwine with another young rebel, a floppy-haired runaway lord (Louis Partridge) who is being pursued by a remorseless bowler-hatted assassin (Burn Gorman). Enola is more than a match for the perilous scrapes that ensue, having been home-schooled by her mother in jujitsu, among other pursuits. Very much a heroine for today, Enola breaks the Victorian mould in other ways as well - and she also breaks the fourth wall, addressing the viewer with winks and asides from the start (a device perhaps borrowed from Fleabag, similarly helmed by Enola Holmes’s director, Harry Bradbeer). Happily, it all works, making the film a jaunty, mildly irreverent sidebar to the Sherlock Holmes canon, and Brown’s Enola a bright on-screen role model. Poet, actor and model Greta Bellamacina adds some more strings to her bow as writer, director and star of her debut feature film, a defiantly quirky, gently funny ode to female friendship and artistic aspiration. Bellamacina plays struggling poet and single mother Celeste, who is striving without much success to find both a publisher and her long-missing father. Meanwhile, her flaky upstairs neighbour and babysitter Stella (co-writer Sadie Brown) seems to be devoting more time to an implausible online romance than she is to getting her acting career off the ground. Their efforts throw up moments of comedy as well as frustration, with a streak of self-effacing humour dispelling any whiff of self-indulgence. Shot in a burnished black and white that every now and then flushes into colour, Hurt by Paradise is also a loving cinematic tribute to London, finding melancholy beauty in bohemian corners of Fitzrovia and Soho with a fondness that recalls Woody Allen’s Manhattan. Toxic male anger runs rampant in this contrived but exciting road-rage thriller starring Russell Crowe and Caren Pistorius. Indeed, the credits haven’t even finished rolling before we witness at a distance Crowe’s unnamed character commit a domestic double murder. He remains at boiling point for the rest of the movie. Definitely unhinged. Pistorius’s hard-pressed single mom, Rachel, is unlucky enough to have a run in with him at a traffic light later that day, which is enough to turn her into the object of his furious ire. Everyone else in her life, including her teenage son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman) and lawyer friend Andy (Jimmi Simpson), had better watch out as well. For Crowe, the soon-to-be-divorced Rachel represents everything he despises in women and in society at large, which is bad news, too, for anyone else who crosses his path as he seeks to make an example of her. Nothing about the film is subtle, but if you’ve turned up expecting down-and-dirty genre thrills then Unhinged certainly delivers. Director Derrick Borte keeps the pedal to the metal, staging some truly staggering automotive mayhem as Crowe rampages across the city. Meanwhile, Pistorius makes the most of her thinly drawn character and Crowe, looking more than ever like a blubbery walrus these days, oozes furious malice. His character may remind you of Michael Douglas going off the rails in Falling Down, Joel Schumacher’s 1993 drama of urban paranoia, but two decades on, today’s political climate makes Crowe’s rage even more incendiary. Batman’s cackling archenemy the Joker gets his own big-screen origin story. And it’s no laughing matter. Controversial and divisive, director Todd Phillips’ nightmarish drama departs from Hollywood’s usual comic-book playbook to deliver a disturbingly compelling movie; one that has more in common with films of the late 1970s and early 1980s – notably Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - than with the current DC universe. Famously, Joaquin Phoenix lost three stone to play the film’s mentally fragile central character, Arthur Fleck – and reaped a Best Actor Oscar for his pains. Living in the film’s grim, grotty version of Gotham City circa 1981, Arthur is an oddball loner who works as a party clown by day and cares for his sick mother at night. He also suffers from a Tourette’s-like affliction that causes him to burst into uncontrollable laughter. He dreams, however, of emulating his TV idol, talk-show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro in an ironic echo of his role in The King of Comedy), and becoming an adored stand-up comedian himself. Arthur’s subsequent journey takes him through street beatings and mental breakdown, and sees him adopted as the figurehead of an anti-rich street movement before we get hints of the future Joker of comic-book legend. Repellent and pitiful at the same time, Phoenix is absolutely riveting, his fearless performance a world away from Cesar Romero’s campy shtick in the 1960s TV series and every bit the equal of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger’s scene stealing turns in Batman and The Dark Knight. Like Phoenix, the film is often tough to watch – but always thrilling. The story of the first woman jockey to win Australia's highly prized Melbourne Cup is one of those rousing, outlandish tales where real life outdoes fiction. Michelle Payne, the youngest of 10 in a racing dynasty of jockeys and trainers, is only six months old when her mother dies. She grows up determined to become a champion jockey and, despite a near fatal fall, a further family tragedy and the dyed-in-the-wool sexism of the racing world, nothing can deter her from her goal. Making her directing debut, Rachel Griffiths doesn't steer too far from biopic convention, but she gets foursquare performances from Teresa Palmer as the headstrong Michelle and from Sam Neill as her equally stubborn widowed dad, and the movie's feelgood final furlongs are sure to have you cheering. Stevie Payne, who has Down syndrome, plays himself and, as Michelle's brother, her horse's strapper and her biggest supporter, steals the film with his charm and wit. Over the course of a summer on the French Riviera, working-class 16-year-old Naïma (Mina Farid) gets swept up into the Chanel and champagne world of her sensual, fast-living 22-year-old cousin Sofia (Zahia Dehar), who takes up with a pair of wealthy yachtsmen (Nuno Lopes, Benoît Magimel) as her new patrons for the season. Shot in an around Cannes, this typically Gallic coming-of-age drama courts sensation by casting Dehar - known to French tabloids as ‘la scandaleuse’ following her involvement in an underage prostitution scandal – but its deceptively subtle handling of sex and class turns out to be psychologically nuanced and insightful.  There's a new drug on the streets of New Orleans: a pill that for five minutes gives the user superpowers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's rule-breaking cop wants to find the source, and so does Jamie Foxx's enigmatic ex-soldier, his motives initially unclear. Streetwise teenage rapper Robin (Dominique Fishback), a part-time pusher of the drug, is caught somewhere in the middle. Adding sci-fi flourishes and rocket-fueled action to the scuzzy urban cop film, directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (makers of Catfish and Paranormal Activity 3 and 4) have come up with a super action thriller fantasy. And with well-aimed swipes at 'guys in suits' who care nothing for the people of New Orleans, there's a withering social critique in there as well. Shotgun wedding takes on a new meaning in this darkly funny horror comedy. Young bride Grace (Samara Weaving) is marrying into the filthy rich Le Domas clan. According to tradition, each new member of the family has to play a randomly allotted game on their wedding night. On most occasions, the game is innocuous. However, Grace draws a deadly version of hide and seek. Can she evade her murderous in-laws, now armed to the teeth with crossbows, axes and guns, until dawn? Combining gouts of gore, cutting satire and eye-watering black comedy, Ready or Not recalls such recent films as You're Next and Get Out in the way it pits a spunky representative of the 99% against members of a sadistic elite. The mood here is more comedy than horror, but we're still rooting all the way for the terrific Weaving's heroine, who keeps her nerve even as her bridal white dress turns increasingly bloodstained as the night wears on. Tracee Ellis Ross looks and sounds the part as an imperious soul diva in this hugely enjoyable comedy drama set in LA's music scene - and the fact that she's Diana Ross's daughter only adds an extra frisson. Cast opposite Dakota Johnson (another showbiz insider from birth), she plays a pop legend named Grace Davis who has been coasting in her career for years. Her manager (Ice Cube) is pushing her to take up a lucrative Las Vegas residency, but her put-upon personal assistant, wannabe producer Maggie (Johnson), reckons she can do better. We're a long way from A Star Is Born here. The crises in The High Note are resolved far too readily, and the plot turns are easily anticipated. But Ellis Ross and Johnson chime well together, and the script has enough tart wit (much of it delivered with Ellis Ross's throaty chuckle) to compensate for the slight story. There are some pointed observations along the way, too, about the role of gender, age and race in the pop music business. The soundtrack isn't bad, either, with interesting cover versions and some very deep cuts. Listen out for Leon Bridges, Elmore James, Maxine Brown, Lee Moses, PP Arnold, and Cher's cover of Dylan's 'All I Really Want'.  Together on screen for the first time, national treasures Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen spar beautifully in this twisty thriller about a career con artist who sets his sights on a wealthy widow. Hooking up with her on an online dating site, McKellen’s veteran crook Roy reckons Mirren’s trusting suburbanite Betty is an easy mark. But will his fiendish swindle go to plan? Based on the bestseller by Nicholas Searle, this highly entertaining mystery takes us through a series of sinuous plot turns, and then springs yet more surprises. (Too many, some may feel). Its most enjoyable feature, however, is the delicious spectacle of screen veterans Mirren and McKellen going toe to toe. We first meet their Roy and Betty in parallel scenes that play over the film’s opening credits. Sitting at their respective computers, they fill out their dating profiles. Smoker? No, taps Roy, cigarette dangling from his mouth. Drinker? No, taps Betty, wine glass at hand. Roy’s fibs, we quickly discover, go far deeper. At the same time as he is courting Betty, he is also plotting an elaborate scam with his partner Vince (Jim Carter) to defraud some gullible investors over a Russian investment. As the deceptions mount, the plot becomes increasingly slippery, with flashbacks from the story’s 2009 present to Berlin in 1948 and 1943. Roy is a nasty piece of work, it soon becomes clear, but what else can we glean before the story’s end? The filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s joyfully groundbreaking, gleefully subversive hip-hop musical about one of America’s Founding Fathers captures the stage show’s energy and excitement – and, thanks to artful up-close camerawork, throws in some extra intimacy, too. Shot on Broadway in 2016, the performance has Miranda himself in the lead as Alexander Hamilton, the brilliant orphan immigrant from the Caribbean who became George Washington’s right-hand man during the War of Independence and played a leading role in the creation of the US Constitution. Miranda, also responsible for the show’s music, lyrics and book, tells this story with furious verve and wit, qualities matched by the dynamic fizz of Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography, while the production’s most revolutionary stroke - the casting of mostly black and brown faces as white figures from history - packs an even bigger charge today. The black adopted son of liberal white parents stirs up trouble with deft alacrity in this absorbing film, which shares with its enigmatic protagonist the desire and dexterity to push people’s buttons. Played with cryptic charisma by Kelvin Harrison Jr, the eponymous Luce is a former child soldier who was pulled out of a war zone in Eritrea at the age of seven to be raised in comfort in the US by well-meaning, well-heeled couple Amy (Naomi Watts) and Peter Edgar (Tim Roth). Ten years later, he is his high school’s star pupil, a skilled debater and a talented athlete to boot. ‘I’m a poster boy,’ he says, mockingly. ‘A black kid who overcame his tragic past.’ He does, however, have a prickly relationship with his exacting history teacher, Harriet Wilson, played by Octavia Wilson. And when she asks her class to write an essay in the voice of a historical figure, he picks the 20th-century political philosopher of decolonisation from Martinique, Frantz Fanon, notoriously an advocate of revolutionary violence. Is he simply fulfilling the teacher’s brief or expressing his own beliefs? Like Luce himself, director Julius Onah’s film keeps us guessing, throwing in white privilege and guilt, black identity and code-switching - and a bag of illegal fireworks – into the story’s combustible mix. This is very much a drama of ideas (it’s based on the play by JC Lee) and a whiff of the stage still clings to the characters’ intellectual tussling, but it is very well acted, endlessly stimulating and, at this present juncture, extremely timely. A film critic for over 25 years, Jason admits the job can occasionally be glamorous – sitting on a film festival jury in Portugal; hanging out with Baz Luhrmann at the Chateau Marmont; chatting with Sigourney Weaver about The Archers – but he mostly spends his time in darkened rooms watching films. He’s also written theatre and opera reviews, two guide books on Rome, and competed in a race for Yachting World, whose great wheeze it was to send a seasick film critic to write about his time on the ocean waves. But Jason is happiest on dry land with a classic screwball comedy or Hitchcock thriller. Marie Claire UK is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

"Aug 16, 2020","Phillips constructs a palpable sense of down-and-dirty dread, helped by Phoenix's commitment ... but the movie stops short of ever expressing an opinion.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2020"," The initial outburst of acclaim for Todd Phillip’s Joker was followed by an equally vocal cry of dismay and critique. For sure, it is not an easy film to stomach, but beneath the provoking exterior is a film executed with impeccable flair. The curveballs that Joker will throw at you stay in your head for hours afterwards, as does the haunting collapse of its protagonist.  Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a comedian who is going nowhere in life and is on the receiving end of harassment and violence on a frighteningly regular basis. Most significantly, for reasons both personal and societal, he is almost incapable of integrating into the world at large. Instead of the powers that be offering to help him, Fleck (and others disadvantaged by narrow thinking, as suggested several times throughout the movie) are violently cast aside. This toxicity, emptiness and mockery painfully twist Fleck into the clown prince of crime. Fleck may initially evoke your sympathy, but this quickly dissipates as his transformation takes hold. This is a very different Joker, indeed a very different adaptation of comic lore, than what has been seen before. It plays out like the most classic of Scorsese-directed male downfalls. This ode to Martin Scorsese, who was initially on to produce Joker, never lets up – a Taxi Driver reference emerges in the opening minutes. But where Phillips diverges from this classic take is with his eye for colour, using it to staggering effect as the damaging mantra of ‘just keep smiling’ is played out to a sad clown lament. The stylistic triumphs of Joker are the film’s greatest strengths, followed very closely by some stunning cinematography from Lawrence Sher and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s electrifying, cello-driven score. Phoenix, also, is in terrifying form. His anguish-laden take on DC’s greatest villain confirms him as one of the greatest character actors working today. He does a phenomenal job of capturing Fleck’s demise with a powerful, tragic performance. His movements at times give the impression that the world is painfully contorting him into something he is not. It’s unlikely that anyone else could have pulled off this two-hour mutation quite like him. He is capably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Frances Conroy as Fleck’s mother Penny, from whom Arthur seems to have inherited his apathy and loss. Robert De Niro’s involvement, after all the publicity it received, is just De Niro doing a role so purposefully written for him. Then again, there is great satisfaction to be had watching that. Joker is a film that will divide opinion for sure, but much worse has been committed to cinema screens and been met with less scrutiny and panic. This is an unrestrained artistic triumph that lacks sensitivity in parts but cannot be accused of siding with or promoting evil. Instead, it is a warning. The world’s most disadvantaged people are not to be made clowns of by those who would use their power to sweep them aside. If they do, the foundations of their world will collapse. Joker is a stark message about what will happen if this collapse features bloodshed. It is a film that will be picked apart for months, and – thanks to its ending in particular – will likely be debated for years to come.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2020"," First, let’s get this out of the way: Joker, director Todd Phillips’ stylish genesis story for the most iconic villain in the Batman canon, is not measurably more violent than any number of other action movies out there today. What’s more, the rich atmosphere of the film is at times extraordinarily tactile. Phillips has created a world for his audience to live in: drag your fingers along the paint chips of a peeling wall; scuff your shoes on the littered sidewalks; dab your finger in the smeared greasepaint on a sad clown’s face. And at its center is a monumental film performance: Joaquin Phoenix attacks the role with what amounts to a two-hour silent primal scream. At times he seems  to descend from the screen, kneel on the fold-down theater seat in front of you and push his tragic face into yours, radiating a smoldering heat that makes you wish you’d ordered extra ice for your drink at the concession stand. And yet…and yet, Joker is a hollow Fabergé egg of a film, crafted with over-the-top artistry on the outside, empty of meaningful context beneath its brittle shell. We meet the titular character when he’s just an ordinary Joe, a loner named Arthur Fleck. He’s got dreams of becoming a standup comic, but he’s also got an unspecified brain condition that causes him to burst out into inappropriate laughter and fits of compulsive behavior. Late at night, after tucking in his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), Arthur watches a talk show hosted by a low-rent Johnny Carson-type comic named Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), imagining himself to be a guest on the host’s couch. “Wait a minute,” I hear you saying. “Isn’t this exactly the same plot as Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy? Didn’t that movie have De Niro as a deeply disturbed standup wannabe, and didn’t he sit alone at home pretending to hold court on the couch of a late-night host?” Well, yes. In fact, for those of us who treasure The King of Comedy as one of Scorsese’s best films, watching De Niro sitting behind that desk in Joker brings the uneasy feeling that, 37 years later, Rupert Pupkin is still hosting The Tonight Show and Jerry Lewis is still tied up in his apartment. Of course, Arthur Fleck spirals into hyperviolent madness in a way the sweet but delusional Rupert Pupkin never did. His progressive dissembling is painstakingly portrayed against the background of a Gotham City where the oppressed underclass — victimized in undefined ways by the town’s super-rich overlords — is, like him, barreling down a one-way road to violent eruption. Phillips’ vision of Gotham City is a parody of 1980s New York City, as envisioned by someone who wasn’t there at the time. Garbage is piling on the sidewalks, social services have been yanked from those who need them most, and thousands upon thousands of homeless people mill about, hoping the uber-rich tycoons in their suburban mansions and midtown penthouses will toss them a coin or a bone. Riding a graffiti-ridden subway one day — still in his clown suit and makeup after being fired from his job — Arthur is hassled by some Wall Street punks in suits. Arthur responds in a reasonable manner: He shoots them dead. And now he is a media hero: the mysterious clown who took out three privileged merchants of greed. It’s an approximation of the 1980s Bernie Goetz saga, but of course Phillips gets it backwards: Bernie was the guy in the suit and the guys he shot on the New York subway were were poor teens who may or may not have been trying to mug him. Immediately, the mysterious killer clown becomes a Gotham media sensation, inspiring thousands to take to the streets in clown masks chanting, “Kill the rich!” Oddly, Phillips doesn’t seem to have much of a problem with this — certainly Arthur doesn’t, as he wanders the streets of the riot-torn city, watching with obvious pride the anarchic fruits of his violent deed and engaging in his own self-affirming acts of gratuitous brutality. It all leads to a climactic and admittedly breathtaking scene on Murray Franklin’s TV show, one that we all see coming — yet we keep hoping will unfold differently than we expect. One has to wonder why the violence of Joker is eliciting such outrage in social media. And true, we heard much the same sort of outcry a half-century or so ago in response to Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch and Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. But Peckinpah was defiantly re-defining the Western, objecting to the bloodless violence that had sanitized the genre. And Kubrick, working from Anthony Burgess’ novel, was examining the persistent role violence plays in our society and the perils of free will.  Joker is telling us…what? That comic book-phony bad beginnings lead to comic book-phony reigns of terror? The story arc of the character Joker— a troubled man who sinks into the depths of violent insanity — is fatally incomplete. It’s not really an arc at all; just an inverted super slide that disappears into inconsequential darkness. It all reminds me of a Goth teenager: He dresses in black, circles his eyes with mascara and mopes around in his room, all the time with no idea what he’s so depressed about. Though cynical and sloppy, your review makes some efforts to give credit to Phoenix for his acting chops. Otherwise, you say his Arthur Fleck is an “ordinary Joe”? Did you not notice he’s obviously mentally and emotionally disturbed? How is that ordinary? Then, you say he kills the rich jerks for “no reason” but it’s right there in the scene that they taunt and then mercilessly beat him? Did you miss this part? Then, De Niro was obviously a clever homage to his role in Scorsese’s KoC flick. Filmmakers do this thing all the time. And finally, his arc is a man who’s been wronged his whole life and it becomes clear he has no reasonable expectations to be happy and takes it out on society.  Most all the other comments show some very poor interpretations and strange fear this movie would be a cause celeb for more violence. How right you may have been but in a completely different way than you expected, eh? I know I’m super late on this. I was just skimming through reviews of some of my favorite movies and found this. And I just have to say – in no disrespect to you personally – this review is ludicrous. Near the end, you said that his Joker’s story arc was incomplete and not even an arc at all, just a “super slide that disappears into inconsequential darkness.” But that IS an arc in this case. Arthur Fleck had spent his entire life as a clinically depressed man facing an inconsiderate and careless society that did the opposite of help his mental state. He tried to keep his mental health stable until he reaches a tipping point when he’s attacked by the 3 rich bullies on the train and kills them. and the final fall was when he found out his mother and biological father beat him and tied him to a radiator as a baby. And on top of that, his idol (Robert De Niro) made fun of him on national TV. His character arc was leading the chaos against the rich. He was happy when that happened , not because he liked to see hatred against the upper class, but because he was happy to see people finally notice him. That’s how he perceived it. And in response to your last statement, he had CLINICAL depression. He didn’t know what he was depressed about because it was clinical. It’s a thing. Don’t compare that to the cringe-worthy depressed teenagers. I have friends that work in law enforcement, and there absolutely is genuine cause for concern regarding this movie that extends beyond the theater in the weeks and even months ahead. For those that are inclined to commit murders of innocent people, this movie could be all it takes to push them over the edge.  Phil, I hope you’re right that the movie won’t cause mass murders. By the way, Bob didn’t say the movie would cause mass murders, he said hopefully it wouldn’t inspire a new round of them which is exactly how I feel too. Bob, I agree with your comments on De Niro as well, and would add he made a foul-mouthed fool out of himself just last weekend repeatedly using the f-word. Poor judgement in addition to his poor choices in movie roles. Thank you for NOT including a trailer to this film, Bill!  Paragraph 3 alone should be enough to turn anyone off on it, but likely will be found appealing to (no shock) many people in today’s society. Maybe the outrage on social media has to do with what, I don’t know; the multitude of mass murder sprees in the last two months?!  Perhaps the idea/fact that extreme law enforcement measures are HAVING to being taken nationwide outside and inside the theaters showing this film have (Hello?) some intelligent people upset. And an unnecessary one on inconsequential darkness to boot. The only brightness is the money Warner Bros. & all others associated with it, stand to make. Hopefully it won’t be inspiring yet NEW rounds of mass murders. Of course none of these multi-millionaires/billionaires in their gated communities will care one bit, or be affected. Such a comforting thought!  Robert De Niro’s being in it comes as no surprise. It’s easy to find articles online on HIS long, sad decline as a film star.  “Bad Grandpa” being a good example from some years back. Hey, when ya need the money, ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Yes, I’m talkin’ to you, Robert, and not criticizing. The high cost of living IS really horrible. YOU my friend, obviously can’t retire either! Welcome to the club.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2020"," Few films are electric enough to make headlines before audiences even see them. Enter “Joker,” which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, a rare honor for a superhero origin story, though its tone is more reminiscent of the Scorsese masterpieces “Taxi Driver” (1976) and “The King of Comedy” (1982). It has since become a media lightning rod as to whether the R-rated film would inspire copycat violence like the Aurora, Colorado, theater shooter at a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012). Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? “Joker” can’t answer that chicken-and-egg, but it brilliantly shows a man crack. As the film opens nationwide this weekend, it delivers a disturbing experience that is so terrifyingly real that it is sure to divide audiences. Don’t expect a Marvel action flick for kids. This is a gritty character study, one where fans and critics can all agree on one thing: Joaquin Phoenix could laugh all the way to the Oscars. Based on the graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke” (1988), the plot follows Arthur Fleck, a freelance clown who lives with his aging mother in 1981 Gotham City. His mental condition includes random bursts of piercing laughter, causing him to try his hand at stand-up comedy like his late-night idol Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). But when society laughs him off life’s stage, he turns to crime. By now, there have been numerous portrayals of the iconic Batman villain. Cesar Romero hammed it up in TV’s “Batman” (1966-1968), Jack Nicholson stole the show in Tim Burton’s “Batman” (1989), Heath Ledger earned a posthumous Oscar in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” (2008), and Jared Leto was upstaged by co-star Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn in “Suicide Squad” (2016). Now, we get Phoenix, who despite publicity stunts (“I’m Still Here”) has proved to be one of our most gifted actors. He earned an Oscar nomination in Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” (2000), swung away in M. Night Shyamalan’s “Signs” (2002), won a Golden Globe as Johnny Cash in James Mangold’s “Walk the Line” (2005), earned his third Oscar nod exposing cults in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “The Master” (2012) and fell in love with a computer in Spike Jonze’s “Her” (2013). In “Joker,” he is transfixing, rivaling Ledger as authentic rather than cartoonish. Phoenix lost 52 pounds for the role, his ribs protruding from his emaciated body, but it’s more than just a physical transformation. His eyes burn with combustible danger, while his voice wheezes and gargles as he tries to control fits of laughter, covering his mouth with his arm and crying because he can’t stop cackling. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to watch, the type of humanistic portrait of a flawed anti-hero that is almost guaranteed an Oscar nomination. In fact, it sticks with you so long after you leave the theater that you wouldn’t mind if he actually won. Most of the credit belongs to Phoenix; the rest belongs to writer-director Todd Phillips, who is best known for hilarious frat-style comedies from “Old School” (2003) to “The Hangover” (2009). You might think it an odd transition to switch genres from broad-appeal comedy to origin-story tragedy, but like that old song “Tears of a Clown” — take a good look at his face, his smile is out of place. Co-writing with Scott Silver (“The Fighter”), Phillips painstakingly paints Fleck as more than just an insane monster, but rather a pained individual in need of our sympathy. His mother (Frances Conroy) isn’t quite Norma Bates, but it’s enough to explain his afflictions. When his colleague (Glenn Fleshler) hands him a pistol, we know Chekhov’s Gun has to be fired. And when a romantic subplot with neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) starts to feel forced, a twist adds another layer. As these character elements ultimately boil over into violence, we buy into the madness because every killing makes logical sense, leaving audiences morally conflicted. These victims obviously don’t deserve to die, but the script gives us plausible motives. These aren’t random acts of violence; they’re people who directly pick on him, cost him his job, even humiliate him in front of the masses. It’s all shot in grim tones by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, with wardrobe by Mark Bridges, who uses a brown and burgundy palette where Fleck’s vests show he’s guarded. Backing it all is an unsettling score by Hildur Guðnadóttir (HBO’s “Chernobyl”) that should have been left to carry the film on its own, rather than an odd dance down a staircase set to Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2.” Later choices fit better, from Cream’s “White Room” to Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life.” Where the entire exercise threatens to buckle under its own weight is the larger social commentary of the “have and have nots.” It’s an important and relevant theme, but it balloons into a revolution that’s not entirely earned, conflated with a connection to billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of Bruce Wayne. At first it feels contrived, but ultimately it allows for even more Batman tie-ins than you might initially expect, which I consider a net plus. That said, don’t expect a typical superhero movie with post-credit teasers to the DC Extended Universe. This is a stand-alone character study in the vein of Scorsese, who was originally attached to produce. Phillips introduces an entire new generation to the finger gun of “Taxi Driver” (1976), the wall of TV monitors like “Network” (1976) and celebrity daydreams like “The King of Comedy” (1982), where DeNiro’s Rupert Pupkin kidnapped his late-night TV hero (Jerry Lewis). This time, DeNiro plays the reverse as the film builds to a shocking climax. It’s the type of cynical finale where I can totally understand if you walk out hating it (please don’t bring the kids) or blown away (agreeing that TV hosts shouldn’t poke fun at guests like “American Idol”). Either way, it has people talking, it’s made with cinematic fire, and it boasts a performance to haunt your dreams. The question isn’t whether it’s dark; that’s a given. Instead, we must always ask: Did the filmmakers accomplish what they set out to do? If the goal was to tell a convincing origin story about an iconic villain, showing us why he became the way he is, this one nails the downward spiral. If you’re aghast at the violence, that’s life. If you’re worried it’s not faithful enough to the comics, why so serious?

"Jul 15, 2020"," Evil never gestates in a vacuum. To take shape, go out into the world and evolve, it requires a countervailing force to challenge it on multiple planes - from the visceral at one end to the ethical at the other. Joker, a dark, subversive and wholly absorbing account of the origin of the seminal DC Comics villain, delves into the nature and substance of malevolence through the means of a story that, for the first time ever, does away with Batman. But that does not mean Arthur Fleck, played with stunning aplomb by Joaquin Phoenix, does not have a fight on his hands. It is so extreme that it drives the mentally fragile man over the edge. Joker, Batman's bete noire, is born. In this sweeping construct, Fleck isn't obviously incited by a crime-busting superhero but by social realities loaded heavily against his ilk, people who are easy to paint into a corner and crush. For all the numbingly abominable violence that he unleashes when rage gets the better of him, he morphs into an inadvertent rallying figure for those that have been hung out to dry by rapacious stockbrokers and insensitive administrators. Fleck has been dealt a terrible hand. As he sinks into insanity as a result, he makes common cause willy-nilly with others who are similarly down in the dumps. Joker opens with Fleck coming out of a correctional home and walking straight into a city where sanitation workers are on strike, garbage is piled up everywhere and he is brutally assaulted by a gang of teenagers for making off with a signboard announcing the demise of a music store. ""We live in a society that stinks,"" he later says. Up until a point, Fleck isn't bad at all. He makes visible efforts to be as inoffensive and unthreatening as he can be although his hollow, rasping laugh, which he is unable to control owing to a neurological condition, cannot but draw unwanted attention. Fleck lives in a cramped, dimly lit apartment with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy) and plays the dutiful son to the hilt. Embedded in the old lady's back story is one of the precipitants of her son's metamorphosis. The building's elevator does not work and on his trudges up and down the stairs he bonds with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a single mother and his neighbour. He is aware of the absence of a father and searches in vain for a stand-in. ""I've been the man of the house ever since I can remember,"" he says (with a mix of remorse and pride) in the course of a spur-of-the-moment conversation with Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), a late-night television show host he idolizes to the point of distraction. The Fleck-Franklin relationship, another reason that hastens the onset of Joker's destructive streak, is an obvious reversal of the 1983 De Niro-starrer The King of Comedy, where the actor played a wannabe stand-up comic who looks up to a senior in the business who he goes to the extent of kidnapping. Another Martin Scorsese film (Taxi Driver) is cross-referenced in Joker, but not quite as directly. Like De Niro's Travis Bickle, Arthur Fleck receives the rough end of the stick and is pushed to the wall by the scorn repeatedly heaped upon him by a society that, as his counsellor reminds him, doesn't ""care a shit"" about him. Joker definitely wouldn't rank alongside Scorsese's finest films, but it has enough inherent heft and ambition to be in a league way, way above that of most superhero flicks. The screenplay, jointly written by Scott Silver (The Fighter) and the film's director, Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy), combines the tropes of a grim, gritty psychological thriller with overt stabs at social commentary. It turns Gotham City of the late 1970s/early 1980s, where chaos reigns supreme, into a microcosm of contemporary New York, where a war is on between ""those who have made something of their lives"" and ""those who haven't"". The man who speaks of this era-defining divide - business magnate and mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of the future Batman, Bruce Wayne - elaborates on why the former group sees the latter category of citizens as ""clowns"". This creates a socio-political context for Fleck's ""rebellion"" against the established order. When funding for the social services that pay for Fleck's meds and visits to his social worker is cut, he is left to fend for himself. The director of Joker leans heavily on the astounding brilliance of an emaciated-for-the-role Phoenix to create an accidental moral disruptor so strong that he blows everything away like a gust from hell. The actor, all skin and bones, fires on all cylinders. As a clown-for-hire languishing at the very bottom of the socio-economic pecking order, Phoenix uses accentuated dance movements to express both agony and ecstasy, the angularities of his scraggy body rendering his swaying particularly disquieting. The film plunges into the life of the archvillain in a way, and to an extent, never attempted before. In doing so, it delivers a provocative and corrosive take on the very notion of villainy and radically pushes the boundaries of the genre, turning into an unsettling yet fascinating character study. Joker's acts of violence are as random as they are pure and unalloyed, unleashed with the sole intention of registering his presence in a world where he is a mere clown, a failed one at that, and a perennial butt of ridicule. Fleck's misgivings propel him into situations that are fraught with danger. The more trouble he gets into the harder he recoils from the world. As he goes into a shell and plans his reprisals, each action of his is bloodier and more startling than the previous one. His tussle is as much with his own worsening psychosis as it is with a city that he believes should be burnt down. It is an environment in which Fleck's wounds inevitably fester and his fury mounts. At one point in the film, he admits that ""I don't believe in anything"" although we see him right from the start of the film jotting down his thoughts and jokes in a notebook that, in its sheer arbitrariness, mirrors the state of his mind. Many may find this heightened portrait of a villain bordering on the irresponsible and tendentious because it seems to make a 'hero' out of Joker. But don't we live in a world that is increasingly being taken over by democratically elected madmen thriving on fear-mongering and viciously divisive strategies? It is also problematic that in times in which mass killings have been hitting the headlines with alarming frequency, evil is sought to be equated with mental instability. Yes, the dark, disturbing worldview of Joker may leave you severely discomfited. However, as a portrait of anxiety and nihilism stemming from poverty and systemic oppression, Joker is flat-out magnificent and undeniably compelling. No two ways about it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 8, 2020"," “Put on a Happy Face” is the war cry for the invisible, the ones suffering from depression and the lonely outcasts of society who are simply classed as that just for being a little bit different. Writer/director Todd Phillips unravels the mental state of Gotham’s Arthur Fleck/Joker with a deep-dive slow-burn character study of the birth of the supervillain with darkly disturbing vigour. Failed party clown and failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a beaten and tortured soul, a character who is in dire need of a good meal and the acceptance Nah love of the people around him. Having had to deal with traumatic issues since childhood, engulfed in an unsympathetic system and living with his sick mother, Arthur leans on the numerous amounts of medication he has to take on a daily basis. Knockback after knockback, Arthur is not only let down by his work colleagues and abandoned by the system but finds himself the city’s punching bag as a decaying Gotham divides itself between the rich and the poor. Suffering from a condition, Arthur can’t stop his uncontrollable laughter whilst his pain and suffering darken the souls of his eyes. Any nice gesture sees him slapped down with ignorant intolerance cutting away at the humanity that once filled his darkened heart. As his world descends even further into darkness, something snaps in Arthur’s brain as he emerges out of the other side of the mist, reinventing himself into the iconic figure we all know as Joker and the poster boy for Anarchy in Gotham. Phillips Joker is certainly unique, an origin story that is a galaxy away from any other comic book film on the market today, and meticulous care has been taken to build a picture of the delicate mental stability of a man at breaking point without tugging on the heartstrings of sympathy.  We all know the Joker as a cold and callous criminal mastermind but we are opened up to what came before, his emotional state and even his moralistic values play a part in how his crime spree began to play out. Whilst set away from the current DC Universe we are never far away from the mention of the Wayne name just to remind us all that this is where this character belongs. However, the timelines and the age of each of these characters just don’t add up to any current Batman storyline we are familiar with, making it a rather jarring and confusing bugbear in the plot. Phoenix goes deeply method with intensity and is spectacularly superb, he not only owns the character of Arthur with every intricate movement of a deeply troubled man but he cuts a disturbing figure of pain. With the transformation into the green-haired, suavely dressed Joker, an urgent confidence engulfs his every fibre. He has made the character well and truly his own but there are moments of clarity, in his posture and pose where Heath Ledger’s Joker shines through a simmering veil. Die-hard fans of the DC universe might just be in for a deep dark shock from a film that at times is more art-house than comic book. Uncompromising and far less violent than you have been led to believe (there are certainly more extreme movies out there to influence those of a weak mind), Phillips and Phoenix deliver a shattering and fresh new take on an age-old character.",POSITIVE

"Jun 27, 2020"," When I first heard about Joker, the comic nerd in me was, to put it mildly, skeptical. Did we really need to explore the background such an iconic villain? Besides, Joker's is a background that has never been definitively settled on in the comics, with many differing explanations put forth since his introduction. It's this ambiguity which makes him such a lasting, and frightening, character. Pulling the mask off the evil hardly ever works. Just ask films like Hannibal Rising or wordy mouthful-titled The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Throw into the mix that it was being co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, who's mainly known for his comedies like Old School and The Hangover series, and nothing about this idea boded well to me. Then I saw the first trailer. It was different, but I still wasn't fully convinced to jump right out and see it opening weekend. When the second trailer dropped, it was kind of a game changer for my interest. Maybe Phillips had done it, maybe he really had created a different kind of villain exploration movie?  Gotham City, 1981. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown for a service that hires them out for performances and odd jobs. He lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who he's been taking care of for as long as he can remember. Arthur also has several problems: He suffers from depression and pseudobulbar affect (in the form of uncontrollable fits of crying laughter) for which he's taking several medications, he's socially awkward and makes people uncomfortable and, to top it off, he's just not very funny, which is a hindrance to not only his job, but also his dreams of being a stand-up comedian. After being attacked by some teenagers while on a job, a co-worker gives him a gun for protection. Days later, when some drunken stock brokers harass him on the subway, he uses the weapon. Though he's not caught, witnesses saw a clown running from the scene. His actions unintentionally begin a social movement, and seeing its effect on the city sets Arthur on the path to finding his true self. Joker is a brilliantly executed melancholy exploration of mental illness, anchored by a riveting performance from Phoenix. This film is so pessimistic it doesn't simply see the glass as half-empty, it then takes said glass and, believing it's not worthy enough for any kind of sustenance, dumps the water on the floor, then shatters the glass in case anyone would dare try to offer it something else to drink. Phillips successfully steps well outside his comfort zone and does an amazing job with both the story and the filmmaking. It opens with the late-'70s/early-'80s version of the Warner Bros. logo, and continues with a very of-that-time feeling font style to the credits, all to visually explain this isn't present-day. From there, he takes his time to cautiously tell a very tricky tale. Dealing with matters of mental illness, especially when associated with the creation of a villain, involves the proverbial eggshells. When you're trying to make the villain simultaneously sympathetic and reprehensible, things get trickier. Fortunately, Phillips chose the perfect leading man. Phoenix is at the top of an already impressive game as Arthur. I said above that his performance was riveting, and that's an understatement. You can't take your eyes off him, not just because he's in almost every second of runtime. He gives Arthur believability, honesty and humanity, while also managing to achieve an off-putting creepiness that thinly covers the capacity for seriously nasty deeds. This growth into evil isn't rushed, either. Arthur doesn't jump right into a life of crime and violence after his subway confrontation. He watches as the world reacts, taking it all in along with the way that same world treats him day-to-day, until he finally comes to terms with who he really is, who he's probably been all along. This is a movie you'll be thinking about long after you leave the theater, possibly even days later. There are so many layers to the film begging to be peeled back and examined. Toss in a few satisfyingly-placed references to the Batman lore, and you have one of the most original, and what I predict will be one of the more polarizing (a couple walked out halfway through my screening), comic book films ever made.

"Apr 4, 2020"," Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable
single white guy who is shaped by society into becoming yet another version of
the Joker, a comic book villain that has existed for almost eighty years.
Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and works as a clown for
hire, but he dreams of being a stand-up comedian. Alas, he suffers from a
condition where he laughs uncontrollably in inappropriate moments, causing him
to further be a social outcast. As we already know given he is one of the
grandest villains in cultural history, Arthur is a man on an unstoppable train
to madness, mayhem, and anarchy.  An excessive amount of think pieces already exist in draft
versions squirreled away across the internet, all itching to have their moment
in the digital sun. I’m already exhausted by the oncoming flood of fan art and
YouTube breakdown videos. That exhaustion hit me right in the gut about half an
hour into the film, right about the point where I realised what narrative beats
the film was going to hit, and how obvious and eager the film was to hit those
beats.  Additionally, this exhaustion can’t help but come from the
fact that this iteration of the Joker feels wholly reactive to the current age
we live in. It feels like Todd Phillips reference material was not a stack of
DC comics, but instead a wealth of bookmarked hot collared right and left wing
blog posts about the current state of the world. And, instead of picking a
side, Phillips can’t help but have created a film that feels like a grand
shrug, with a hypothetically middle ground tagline of ‘there’s some very bad
people on both sides’. Inevitably, the media has thrown themselves into a
flurry, genuinely concerned that this film might create a world of copy cats,
with the on screen violence spilling into the aisles and flooding into the
streets. This says a lot more about the world that we’re living in that the film
ever manages to do. The discussion surrounding Joker feels like outrage culture writ large, when the film itself
is more of a parable about the gulf that exists between the poor and the rich. All of this adds to the feeling that if this weren’t a comic
book film, then it wouldn’t be getting the attention it is getting. In fact, it
probably wouldn’t have been made at all. A lot has been said about how Joker pulls from the aesthetic of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and while those influences are blatant and oddly
relevant for the material, it’s clear that Phillips was less interested in
making a comic book film, and more keen on making a hard adult drama with a
budget. In today’s landscape, Taxi Driver
or The King of Comedy would struggle
to get financing, so it’s painful to see that for a filmmaker to make a story
about a man gradually turning to mania and mayhem, they have to turn to the
most popular genre at the moment.  In turn, the fact that Phillips so clearly wants to tell a
serious adult drama makes the moments that the ‘comic book’ roots appear feel
trite and annoying. There is a grand level of presumption of knowledge when it
comes to a film like Joker. The
filmmaker knows that you know who Batman is, and they know that you know who
Thomas Wayne is and what his inevitable fate will be, so Phillips needs to find
a way to weave these threads into the film. The inclusion of Thomas Wayne feels
organic, even if he is presented as a mildly brutish generic rich man wanting
to be a Mayor (we do see him from Arthur Fleck’s perspective after all). But
when Bruce Wayne is shoehorned into the plot, you can’t help but cringe. And
then, as the climactic violence driven narratives death throes kick on, and
Phillips drags us back down that
alleyway to see yet another death of the Wayne’s – spilled pearls and all.  Strip away the comic book threads and you’re halfway to
getting a great film. Don’t get me wrong, Joker
is an immaculately crafted slice of cinema. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography
captures a skewed version of New York City, with all its glorious piss-filled
puddles shimmering with stark realism, and every inch of makeup slathered onto
Arthur’s face feeling as grimy and tarlike as possible. Composer Hildur
Guðnadóttir crafts a powerful, suitably dramatic, slightly operatic score that
weaves in and out of the mildly obtrusive needle drops that appear to remind
the viewer of those Scorsese influences. These two elements go a long way in
helping create the tone of the film, allowing Joaquin Phoenix to do his most
Joaquin Phoenix-y performance yet. It’s a powerhouse of a character piece, disturbing in its accuracy and dedication to mental instability and madness. Phoenix is, arguably, the best actor working today, and he clearly enjoys digging into the fractured psyche and misguided aspirations that flourish in Arthur Fleck’s mind. Fleck’s obsession with wanting to be a comedic guest on the Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) talk show, and ideally receive the validation he so desperately desires, is tangible. De Niro is, as expected, superb, wearing a set of dentures that are so perfectly ‘talk show host teeth’ that it hurts.  But, the lines between reality and fiction blur when it comes to both Phoenix’s portrayal of Arthur Fleck and the narrative. For starters, one can’t help but have flashbacks to the stilted and misguided publicity stunt that Phoenix pulled when creating a ‘rap-persona’ for the mockumentary I’m Still Here, where he went on David Letterman and muttered his way through an interview. On top of this, Fleck dreams of making a martyr of himself
by committing suicide on live TV, and given the attempts to portray mental illness
in an open light, the comparison to the real world on screen death of Christine
Chubbuck can’t help but be made. This is accentuated further by the repeated
moments where Fleck visits his therapist, only to find that funding for therapy
is being cut, causing Fleck to state that nobody cares about the mentally ill.  In Antonio Campos’ retelling of Christine Chubbuck’s life, Christine, Rebecca Hall’s Christine
continually tries to further herself and her career, but is consistently shut
down and ignored, is routinely rejected and ridiculed, that it leads her to a
point of exhaustion, and as history tells, she took her life live on TV. Joker is a hyper-realised,
hyper-fictionalised version of Christine’s story, one where instead of living
in hope, Arthur Fleck finds comfort in fear and hate. If there’s anything
irresponsible about Joker, it very
well might be this.  Even though we know that the Joker is a capital V Villain, Todd Phillips so earnestly wants you to empathise with Arthur Fleck, to understand how someone so completely rejected by society would turn to a life of crime and violence, and for the most part, he succeeds in doing so. Yet, given the extensive history of the character of the Joker, we can’t help but realise that we’re being asked to empathise with the devil. That in itself isn’t a terrible idea – after all, to understand why terrifying people do terrifying things, we should understand the steps that were taken in their lives to get to that point. But within Joker, there is a dubious presentation of mental health. The film wants to suggest that ‘if only these people had gotten help, this wouldn’t have happened’, but then that would suggest that we should sympathise, rather than empathise, with Arthur’s plight, which is violent and antagonistic, and so far from help that he has become a lost cause long before we meet him. And that in itself is a major problem.  Meandering in the background of Arthur’s pathetic existence is a narrative about the poor rallying against the rich. Phillips employs iconography so commonly utilised by the left, namely the ‘eat the rich’ (seen here on protestors signs as the less sly catchcry ‘kill the rich’) motif that exists online as a shorthand for the destruction of capitalism and the removal of the uber-rich. To some, it may seem that Phillips is clearly aligning Arthur Fleck with the modern left, suggesting that all it takes for them to be whipped into a flurry of protests is the brutal murder of three rich white bros. After all, the climax has Gotham City swamped by clown mask wearing folks, taking back the city by any means necessary. But, Joker is not smart enough for that.  See, as good as a film that Todd Phillips thinks he’s making, he’s simply not a strong enough director to balance the tightrope that is presenting empathy for a madman who brutally kills multiple people throughout the film and who also clearly has mental health issues that need working on. In one sly moment, Phillips has a background reference to Billy Wilder’s Ace in the Hole, only this time it’s presented as a porn film and not the caustic destruction of the media that the original film is. It’s here that it becomes clear that Phillips merely thinks that referencing this material (and, of course, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy) is heavy lifting enough, allowing the prior knowledge of these texts to create the subtext, rather than Joker ever actually crafting a subtext of its own. This becomes even more apparent when Fleck quotes ‘Cellophane Man’ from Chicago, showing a complete misunderstanding of that sad man song, and it’s with this note that Phillips possibly adds to kindling to the misguided incel fire.

The vicious circle of duty-bound readers and conversation-chasing editors which has attended the avalanche-like rollout of Todd Phillips’s Joker is symptomatic of a culture starved for zeitgeist cinema. The thinkpiece-industrial complex has already descended on this skimpy, mostly just fine movie and picked its bones clean; only for a public so surfeited with superheroes that Christopher Nolan seems like the vanguard of thematic and aesthetic ambition would Joker be received as a challenging, appointment-viewing surfacing of toxic white male misery. I can’t believe we signed over a whole season of The Discourse to a filmmaker who still thinks there’s something inherently hilarious about little people. Joker is an origin myth, a grim and pseudo-religious “And that little boy grew up to be …” story like Batman Begins, showing how one of life’s shat-upon becomes a supervillain and a galvanizing figure for a mass movement of antisocial violence. It wants to be — and the industry, critics, and fans, in ways alternately breathless and begrudging, have taken it seriously as — a reckoning with the extremes of abjection, with the psychic trauma and social rejection that could lead someone to a nihilistic howl of laughter. But it’s far too derivative, far too wedded to its juvenile mythology, and finally far too tentative to deserve discussion on such terms.  That abjection at least takes an ideal form in Joaquin Phoenix as sad clown Arthur Fleck. Arthur — who, like John Wayne Gacy, paints his mouth with sharp north-pointing corners — has a medical condition that causes him to break out into uncontrollable laughter when upset. Phoenix lost an unhealthy amount of weight for the role; his ribs all but poke through a loose-skinned torso, which he holds at unnatural angles so that he seems permanently contorted, a full-body rictus. He looks even more down and out than the film’s circa-1981 Gotham City, where black garbage bags pile up on the sidewalk as a sanitation strike drags on.  Sign up for our free newsletters to get the latest art news, reviews, and opinions from Hyperallergic in your inbox every weekday. To see our full list of free newsletters, click here. Arthur lives with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), who writes plaintive and unanswered letters to her onetime employer, the condescending kajillionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen); his fantasy father figure is late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, superb as a smugly anodyne monoculture avatar). Arthur’s obsession with Murray and the transformative promise of fame shouts out to De Niro’s own stanning of Jerry Lewis in The King of Comedy, while his diary-of-a-madman journaling (in a childish scrawl: “I just hope my death makes more cents than my life”) and subsequent vigilantism echo De Niro in Taxi Driver. In these Martin Scorsese films, the pathology of De Niro’s characters merged with the pathology of New York City, and the world. Joker tries to merge the pathology of Phoenix with the pathology of the earlier films. Phillips began his career by making a scuzzy G.G. Allin documentary and founding the New York Underground Film Festival before graduating to frat pack comedies. Here he gestures to seriousness with a constant dirgeful cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, but emits major dirtbag vibes when imagining the depravity of Joker’s milieu. He utilizes un-PC standup routines at the nightclubs Arthur visits, and invokes frequent trolling music cues (“Send in the Clowns” for its literalness, Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life” for the triumphant tone, “Rock and Roll Part 2” by imprisoned child molester Gary Glitter), which complement the fart-trombone irony of the clown prince of crime himself. This is all pretty weak tea, but Joker largely entertains moment-to-moment, thanks to a star who captures the character’s mesmerizing pulp energy. With his stumbling-in-a-fog voice, Phoenix seems to speak, like he moves, through enormous, invisible resistance. It’s disturbing when he catches a gust of verbal eloquence or physical momentum. (He’s also a great physical comedian who can bring himself up short in a snap.) In a cheap suit and clown makeup, dancing erratically down one of the Bronx’s step streets, he seems borne along on a swift current of destructive impulses.  Those Bronx step stairs are in Highbridge, just west of Grand Concourse, the “boulevard of dreams” modeled after the Champs-Élysée and the pride of an area that was a prosperous Jewish and Italian suburb in the first half of the 20th century, before every white family save apparently the Flecks fled the city’s death spiral. The film makes heavy use of prewar apartment buildings way uptown, abandoned Brooklyn subway stations with their cracked and stained mosaic tile, and rundown Deco exteriors in Newark and Jersey City. Despite the Se7en-esque color grading, Phillilps has a feel for architecture which suggests aspiration, decrepitude, and millions of hidden lives, and harmonizes with Arthur’s grand delusions.  But there are elements of the character that are beyond even Phoenix’s abilities to sell. During Arthur’s climactic appearance on Murray Franklin’s couch, which is meant to synchronize his torment with the roiling anger of a city left to rot by contemptuous elites, Phoenix resorts to trying on different swishy voices in an effort to inject some organic disturbance into his summing up of the movie’s thesis. Pre-release, the fear was that Joker’s portrait of a pathetic, lonely man who finds his voice in violence might goad copycat lashings-out. In fact, the film channels Arthur’s rage toward a series of One-Percenters, like Wayne and Franklin, who are personally mean to him. In Arthur’s relationship with his mother — if not with his neighbor crush, an incredibly perfunctory role for Zazie Beetz — Joker at least attempts to acknowledge that a “beta male” like Arthur might transfer his self-hatred onto women. At any rate, it’s closer to being authentically fucked up about gender than it is about race, with which it barely engages.  Gotham is a mirror for received notions about urban America, and Joker, with its graffiti and news reports about “super rats” overrunning the sidewalks, evokes the lurid high-water mark of the white flight era, when tall tales of wanton lawlessness rebranded New York as “Fear City” for skittish out-of-towners. Implicit in most coverage of crime in New York in the ‘70s and ‘80s was the idea that the urban population was a problem that had to be controlled. Arthur’s first kill comes in response to subway harassment, in an obvious echo of Bernard Goetz opening fire on four young black would-be muggers on a 2 train in 1984. Here, though, the menace comes in the form of three slick-haired banker douchebros. Arthur, as an anonymous clown-painted avenger, becomes a figure of notoriety. His rampage, like Goetz’s, is splashed across the covers of Gotham tabloids, which are as alarmist and crime-obsessed as New York’s. He then becomes the totem of a clown-masked Occupy-esque protest movement. The idea that the random murder of upper-middle-class white men on public transit in 1980s NYC would galvanize a populist movement against white elites is ahistorical and flatly ludicrous. I don’t want or need a serious consideration of white grievance from a movie about the clown who fights Batman, but given the position Joker has assumed in our national conversation, it’s disingenuous and pandering for Phillips to root through a grab bag of resentments and pick out only the least problematic, like he’s trying to find the last candy in the bag that isn’t licorice. The rebellion Joker inspires appears, behind the clown masks, to skew white and male. This is flammable material, but late in Joker, it takes the form of a subway car packed with rowdy dudes in near-identical pop culture costumes, headed downtown to commit wanton property damage.

I love to hear reasonable criticism when it is presented properly and concisely, but this whole page was just oblivious hate for no reason other than not understanding the film.

I sincerely believe it just went over your head, so try watching it again and writing another article that is easier to read for both yourself and your readers. I don’t hate phillips but the film was really boring and sad, not everyone has to adhere to your world views – let people express their opinions the same way you’re enjoying being able to express yours. I wonder how I’d review this movie I have not seen.  I want desperately to see the down the stairs dance I can tell you that.  The best dancer of my generation has been Christopher Walken and the frame implies a worthy competitor. I liked the movie. I was taken with Phoenix’s performance (in a positive way). I read the above review but has trouble tracking. I think Mark’s review missed a very simple point of the movie (and maybe I’m too simple to appreciate the details he assigned to the movie overall). This is a story about person mentally disabled aggravated by his inability to mature with aging. He is desperately searching for approval by his mother and society. Making his character  a clown emphasized his needs covering up his obvious social shortcomings. Folks with problems like the character are common (as we are experiencing today) and very difficult to portray. I thought Phoenix accomplished it with perfection. While Asian-American Art may be “plagued by generational amnesia,” as Sharon Mizota wrote for Hyperallergic, the artists and curators of  Scratching at the Moon are definitely not. The maps show the location of the Ukrainian Pavilion at the Biennale and the sites of real bunkers or air-raid shelters in the city from a time not so long ago. In a 10-day meditation, Jemila MacEwan silently nurtures a seed in the palm of their hand amidst the hustle and bustle of the iconic public park.

"Feb 13, 2020"," There is an irony at the heart of JOKER: one of the most original-feeling comic book movies in years achieves its supposed sophistication by plagiarising the cinema of Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet. JOKER wears its influences on its bloodied sleeve, but the lack of nuance and a determination to be iconically shocking mean it squanders much of this potential. JOKER is a beautiful but simplistically shallow tale of one man’s downward spiral, tacked on to a recognisable cinematic icon. Todd Phillips’s film is a Batmobile with the engine of a clown car. The story opens in 1981 on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire, being beaten up after his prop sign is stolen. As he lies bruised on the ground, in garbage-ridden and rat-infested Gotham City, it is clear this man is down on his luck and the understanding of others. Suffering from several mental ailments, he lives with his mother and dreams of taking his standup comedy routine to a popular late-night show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). After Fleck is fired from the clown gig, the film charts his path through despair, violent reclamation of control and delicate grip on reality. It then accelerates into personal and societal anarchy as he careens towards an unexpected appearance on Franklin’s show. Reverence for THE KING OF COMEDY is hammered home by casting De Niro as a talk show host, with whom Fleck is obsessed (albeit with De Niro slotting into a role more akin to Jerry Lewis’s). Fleck’s nature more gently evokes TAXI DRIVER when placed in the DC universe’s equivalent of New York City. There is also window dressing of DC Comics lore with the presence of Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne; Gotham mayoral candidate and father of the future Batman. “…JOKER channels New York noir of the 1970s and 1980s, with the sharp edge of the material showing the film wishes to be a more challenging and uncomfortable film than nearly all comic adaptations to date.” On the narrative and visual front, JOKER channels New York noir of the 1970s and 1980s, with the sharp edge of the material showing the film wishes to be a more challenging and uncomfortable film than nearly all comic adaptations to date. To heighten the impact of the story, it also seeks to attach it to a character with existing cinematic baggage. JOKER is an ambitious film, but there is an arrogance in the manner it blends this melange of objectives and influences. The films JOKER looks to – TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY, PRINCE OF THE CITY amongst others – dealt with corruption, societal issues, or the dangers of neglect in ways that are terrifying because of their lack of sensationalism. Lumet’s urban settings had a banality to go with the malignancy. Scorsese’s THE KING OF COMEDY is a disorientating and disturbing watch, in part because of the mundane outward expression of Rupert Pupkin’s narcissistic desire to be heard and seen. At every turn, JOKER looks to be a heightened version of this latter picture, right down to Fleck’s relationship with neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz). However, in pursuing a hyper-stylised descent for Arthur Fleck, Phillips robs the film of the same grimy reality it so clearly seeks. As a result, the references are superficial and superfluous to the material at hand.  “The films JOKER looks to […] are terrifying because of their lack of sensationalism. [By] pursuing a hyper-stylised descent for Arthur Fleck, Phillips robs the film of the same grimy reality it so clearly seeks.” The desire to be challenging with an iconic character also strips the film of the meaning it seeks. The elements harking back to that assemblage of challenging, morally grey cinema imply a desire for intertextuality but deliver little more than empty homage. Further, the mixed success of the execution makes the film itself pretty unstable. There is cacophonous indecision between Hildur Guðnadóttir’s wonderfully painful original score and continuous needle-drops of rock and jazz-influenced anthems. In jumping back and forth as Fleck’s mind flays, it is unclear whether the film wants to settle on a lyrical, explicitly petrifying descent or the more banal phantasmagoria that can be found in THE KING OF COMEDY. JOKER includes a rug-pull moment delivered as a big ‘Aha!’ reveal, whereas in Scorsese’s 1983 picture it was done matter-of-factly in the opening scenes. This reveal is even more jarring when the plot mechanics of the script rely on some logical absurdities elsewhere, which would only have made sense in a delusional context. JOKER posits the idea that the neglect and lack of magnanimity displayed by SocietyTM create that society’s supervillains; that we don’t need agents of chaos when we trample upon and mock people to the extent that they lash out in return. It’s a potent idea – particularly to attach to such an iconic character in 2019 – but the execution and script lack the subtlety to pull this trick off (just as the Occupy Gotham subtext to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES felt tacked on in 2012). Part of the fascination of ‘descent into madness’ stories is the fear generated at the suggestion of the susceptibility of otherwise stable people or by questioning the role of the spectator. This morbid fascination is what drives some of the best examples like BENNY’S VIDEO, NETWORK, or – one film that feels very much in mind when watching JOKER – FALLING DOWN. However, we know from the title (and not living under a rock) Fleck – from an already deeply troubled starting point – is destined to become an iconic supervillain. Therefore, any commentary on what drives that and the responsibility, if any, society has is dulled. Merely displaying banners advertising a repertory showing of MODERN TIMES in Gotham does not count as commentary; nor does an on-the-nose tirade delivered to De Niro’s unempathetic TV host. Relying on familiar iconography to deliver a new story would be forgivable but JOKER goes further: it is all too willing to sit smugly in the comic book furniture, contrary to what its supposed high-mindedness would imply. Thomas Wayne forms part of a half-baked subplot involving the former employment of Fleck’s mother by the Waynes’ company. Although the senior Wayne serves a narrative purpose, the surname ‘Wayne’ itself does not, merely being present to generate empty drama; perhaps to hook folk bored by the lack of Batman (a further scene in the film’s closing segment is glaringly tacked on to link to the wider story possibilities). The ambition of JOKER is commendable, but the film is merely standing on the shoulders of giants. The problem with the film is not a disturbing story or morally murky characters, but the empty homage used as a vehicle for them. Beautiful cinematography and physically transformative performances here are merely clown’s makeup; a conjuring trick that distracts from a simplistic script and a shallow rendering of complex themes. Having read your review there are elements I agree with. I wonder however if you were projecting your own vision of how the Joker should be. I for one found the cinematography and the setting breathtaking. It was a real throw back to the dark edgy city scapes of NYC. Where society was unforgiving and people simply pawns in a rich man’s world. Arthur represents one of those pawns who through adversity rises up, not through some pre-ordained path, but through delusional insanity. His actions evoke a spirit in the mass underclass who yearn for a martyr. A leader. To take on those that control Gotham . The rich are portrayed as mean. Superior and Undeserving. You begin to understand the actions of Arthur. I never once felt he was the bad guy. Had we not witnessed the gang beating, train incident or him being neglected by a cold society, his actions in isolation would seem cold and callous. This is a stark reminder that society needs to care for its people, to make it more inclusive, to be more kind. The constant race to the top is really a race to the bottom.  In summary I found the Joker a refreshing antidote to the whole comic book genre. It was a grown up film for grown ups. It was not your Avengers, Batman gadgets and make believe fantasy that bears zero connection to today’s or even tomorrow’s society. The Joker sets new ground. It is  grounded in the normality and the banal, tackling a difficult subject matter, albeit superficially, and providing context behind the rise of the Joker.  It is a welcome departure from the DC vs Marvel race to showcase which film can out GROSS each other. I for one commend it and look forward to the next installment of Arthur Fleck. I like & appreciate your slant on this. You echo my experience in watching the film & my sentiments. I found it very powerful, & Joachin was amazing. Very disturbing, intimate portrayal, especially since he was also put in the mental position of killing his mother. I don’t see this Joker coming out 10 yrs later like Heath’s Joker, who seemed to have more of a mental handle on himself than I think Arthur could achieve – but who’s to say whom Arthur would evolve into? I think Todd Phillips had a real handle on these mental insights. I hope he does another to further answer Arthur’s future for us. Yes, it’s disturbing, but life is often disturbing, especially for the poor and the brutalized. This reviewer’s standing up for the rich is an act of cowardism. The millions who’ve seen the film are proof that the reviewer got it wrong, as they so often do. Your defence of the film seems to have almost nothing to do with what the reviewer is saying, which leads me to question your understanding.  Talking about the reviewer ‘standing upon for the rich’ sounds like slightly confused Antifa type rhetoric, it’s  thrown in solely due to biases unrelated to the review.  A large box office does not mean that the audience universally loved a film. I understand many people feel a personal attachment to this film and thus feel a need to defend it, but ultimately a very large proportion of those people that watched the film had mixed or negative feelings about it – in reality Joker is polarising – its marmite.  For the Stans: Its CinemaScore is  B+, which is a middle of the road score — a lower score than both Abominable and Hobbs & Shaw, so overall audiences enjoyed it less than those films. The CinemaScore is far more objective than online audience reviews as it’s a randomly controlled study of what cinema audiences felt, so is not susceptible to positive or negative online review bombing by militant fans. Personally, I had mixed feelings about the film, in some ways its great, in some ways its fairly weak. I feel the review above captures some of the underlying narrative issues with the film well. Film reviewers offer a broader perspective and understanding of film as a genre. This films overly derivative nature, narrative flaws and tacked on comic book elements (wedged inelegantly onto a non comic book film) are thus well exposed within this review.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 6, 2020"," Every four years or so, typically around the time of a presidential election, a genre flick storms the zeitgeist with the force of its social metaphor. In 1969 it was Night of the Living Dead; in 1972, The Godfather. Rocky (1976), Ghostbusters (1984), The Matrix (1999), and The Passion of the Christ (2004) are other examples. Unlike previous zeitgeist films, but like every other one of 2019’s 10 top-grossing movies, Joker is part of a well-established franchise. The other nine top-grossers are animated or CGI spectacles, part of a trend that began in the early 21st century with the triumph of the Spider-Man and Shrek movies, the Transformers tales, Toy Stories, and the renascent Star Wars saga. More than a passing Bush-era fancy, comic book superheroics are the face of digital cinema—a state of affairs that prompted a protest from Hollywood’s most distinguished living director. In an interview with a British film magazine that went viral and was subsequently amplified by an op-ed piece in The New York Times, Martin Scorsese maintained that Marvel movies were “closer to theme parks” than they were to movies “as I’ve known and loved them throughout my life,” bluntly adding, “I don’t think they’re cinema.” People said the same thing about talking pictures and, in a sense, they were right. Scorsese is acknowledging the digital turn that has affected cinema as much, if more subtly, than the coming of sound 90 years ago (and, ironically, is a technology that he uses himself in The Irishman to de-age the faces of his stars). No comic book movie has ever won the Oscar for best picture (Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is closest, having won in 2004) but, not inclined to take the long view, Marvel fans took Scorsese’s criticism personally. The 78-year-old director was #OKBoomer-ed on social media and beyond. It’s striking that Joker, a rival for Oscar glory if not precisely a Marvel movie in that it took its characters from a DC comic book, was conspicuously absent from Scorsese’s critique. Was this because, as nearly every critic pointed out, Joker drew so directly on Scorsese’s 1983 King of Comedy—even incorporating its star and sometime Scorsese alter ego Robert De Niro—that might almost constitute a remake? (Indeed, Scorsese later admitted that Joker was a project to which he had at one time been attached.) Or was it because, like Alan Moore’s mid-’80s superhero comic book Watchmen, Joker—a movie predicated on actual locations and human performances—turned superheroism on its head? Like the original Watchmen, Joker is a thought experiment—like, suppose this caped crusader shit was really real? Or, as Todd Phillips, an NYU-educated director hitherto associated with gross-out dude-coms like Road Trip and The Hangover, told The Wrap, Joker was “a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film.” Introduced in the first story of Batman No. 1, published in 1940, the Joker popularized the figure of the evil clown. You might even say that he became the grinning poster boy for coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. If Batman stood for vigilante justice, the Joker was the embodiment of pure, random terror. (In the late-’80s comic books, he not only killed Batman’s ward, Robin, but passed himself off as Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations.) Always a popular character—Cesar Romero was called upon to play the part a dozen times for the campy mid-’60s TV show—the Joker’s unbridled id exerts far greater fascination than Batman’s tightly corseted superego. Jokers Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger completely overshadowed Michael Keaton and Christian Bale, the actors who played Batman in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman and Christopher Nolan’s 2008 reboot The Dark Knight. But, however redolent of urban decay, neither of those movies were as “real” as Joker. Set in Gotham City, aka New York, circa 1981, Joker refers not only to Scorsese’s Taxi Driver but evokes several other echt ’70s New York dramas, Dog Day Afternoon and Network. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives with his incapacitated mother and a black-and-white TV in a slum tenement on a grim street that’s recognizably the Bronx. (Given his family name, he and his mother might be the last remnants of a once-Jewish neighborhood.) Fleck is basically a marginally talented rent-a-clown, working both on the street and in hospitals (a creepy echo of the ’70s serial killer John Wayne Gacy who had performed as a clown at children’s parties), hired out of an agency that might have been a subtenant of Travis Bickle’s taxi garage. Fleck is also a geek. His involuntary, uncontrollable high-pitched laughter—a nervous tic akin to Tourette’s syndrome—results in ridicule and shunning. He is mugged in midtown and broad daylight by a marauding group of black and brown kids, fired by his agency, and deprived of public benefits. Fleck is unable to connect with most ordinary people (notably his social worker, a hospital record clerk, and a fellow bus passenger, all African American) and dissed by the white elite epitomized by the powerful Wayne family that becomes the object of his obsessive hatred. (Bat fans take note.) Even as the world kicks him out, Fleck maintains a fantasy relationship with a wisecracking TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) akin to the one Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) established with his idol, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), in The King of Comedy, although unlike Langford, Franklin is pleased to exploit his clearly disturbed fan. No less than The King of Comedy, Joker slips in and out of its protagonist’s imagination and is, in some ways, more psychologically fraught. Oedipal conflicts are even more overt and Joker builds on the ritual underlying The King of Comedy—implicit in the two powerfully archaic nouns in its title—by introducing the notion of the clown as scapegoat. Fleck’s breaking point comes when he turns on a group of abusive, privileged young stockbrokers in a subway altercation meant to remind New Yorkers of the “subway vigilante” Bernhard Goetz who shot four black teenagers in 1984. It is at this point that he becomes the character who Mark Dery described in his essay “Cotton Candy Autopsy,” as “the quintessential psycho-killer clown” and “the crazy-funny mascot of our chaos culture.” Is chaos culture a political force? (Back in 2017, Steve Bannon was being compared to the Joker. How many times has Donald Trump been called a “clown”?) Shifting from individual to collective protest, Joker’s second half evokes the Guy Fawkes mask introduced in the 2005 film V for Vendetta (and thus, along with Batman and the Joker, copyright by Warner Bros., which sells tens of thousands of copies each year). The hacktivists known as Anonymous used the mask in 2008. It was next deployed by Occupy Wall Street in 2011 and subsequently appeared during the Arab Spring (causing it to be banned in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain). It has since turned up in Thailand, Turkey, and most recently Hong Kong. The parallel here is impossible to miss. Not the least interesting thing about Joker is that no one knows precisely what to make of it. Could history’s highest grossing R-rated movie, taking in over a billion dollars worldwide, also be, as John Waters admiringly put it, “the first big-budget Hollywood movie to gleefully inspire anarchy”? While some expressed the familiar fear that Joker would inspire copycat violence, the criminologist Adrian Raine found the movie “surprisingly accurate in its depiction of the anti-hero’s pathology and as well as the way he “was incrementally driven to ‘reactive aggression.’” In other words, rather than mayhem, the movie might promote empathy. The surprise winner of the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival, Joker was immediately denounced as an incel manifesto and an apology for straight-white-male jerks. Doubtless sensitized by #MeToo disdain of his jerky douche-bro oeuvre, Phillips pushed back against the forces of perceived political correctness, telling The Wrap “what’s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right.” Indeed Joker has been highly praised by prominent leftists. Recognizing a diagnosis of populist anger, Michael Moore hailed Joker as a “cinematic masterpiece,” a movie “about the America that gave us Trump.” Appreciating Joker’s apparent call to revolution, the Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek published a piece under the headline “Don’t insult Joker by comparing him to Trump.” The movie’s “elegance,” he concluded, resides in the absence of a “move from self-destructive drive to a ‘new desire’ for an emancipatory political project.” Thus, “we, the spectators, are solicited to fill in this absence.” But who are we and does it include the movie’s most intriguing supporter, Donald Trump? Months before Joker appeared, Team Trump recognized the importance of the Batman mythos by appropriating the theme from The Dark Knight Rises for a campaign video. Five weekends after Joker opened, CNN reporter Shimon Prokupecz tweeted that a senior White House official revealed that Saturday, Nov. 16 (the day after he pardoned a convicted war criminal, Clint Lorance), Trump screened Joker in the White House for an audience of “family, friends, and some staff” and, in a confirming report from Yahoo! News, “liked the film.” Given that Trump himself refrained from tweeting, we can only speculate on what exactly the president liked. Was it the violence? Trump is famously a fan of “Shark Week” and the brawls in the 1988 Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Bloodsport. Only two weeks before showing Joker he had attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden, surrounded by friends and family (Congressmen Kevin McCarthy and Mark Meadows, Eric and Don Jr.) pumping his fist at the action as 150 protesters—clowns?—massed outside. “People are feeling helpless, like they have no power,” one member of Refuse Fascism told the Daily News. Did the president experience nostalgia? “If you’re Donald Trump, it’s always 1979,” the culture critic Stephen Metcalf wrote recently in The New York Times. “New York City, at least the parts you deserve to own (The Plaza, Studio 54, 21 Club), is a bachelor’s playpen. The rest of it? Ungovernable hellscape.” Was it the on-screen vengeance wreaked on his public enemy Robert De Niro? A professional appreciation of successful demagoguery? An enjoyable spectacle of existential ressentiment with masked clowns demonstrating under a banner “Kill the Rich” that could just have easily read “Kill the Bitch”? Was it pure nihilism, the thrill of unbridled id? The fact that this total loser takes Fred Trump’s advice to be a killer? So many possibilities to tickle the Trump brain, but one thing is certain. There was no shock of recognition. Joker is undoubtedly the year’s Trumpiest movie and I mean that as a compliment. Not only an intelligent throwback to the feel-bad shock cinema of the 1970s, Joker is all but unique in its social realism: No other movie so cogently addresses the crisis of the present moment, both in Hollywood and the world.

"Feb 5, 2020","  “Joker” is a cinematic dead end. An exploitation movie without a sense of humor, a satire without a point, a hollow story with no empathic protagonist, and a shallow rip-off of Martin Scorsese’s “King of Comedy” and “Taxi Driver"" put together, here is a movie that doesn’t begin to meet the criteria of meaningful art. Casting Robert De Niro as a television talk show host à la Jerry Lewis in “King of Comedy” comes across as a cheap stunt — a really cheap bit. Set in an early ‘80s era that never happened, the film follows mentally ill Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). Getting all the rejection he requires is high on Arthur’s daily list of things to do. Arthur wants to be a stand-up comic but hasn’t any aptitude for the gig. It doesn’t help that one of his litany of medical woes includes Arthur laughing uncontrollably in social situations.  Homicidal thoughts lead to a series of killings after Arthur gets a gun. However, if you’re looking for an anti-gun theme, you’re on your own. It would also be a stretch to make a case for “Joker” putting a fine point on the mistreatment and neglect that America treats its mentally ill. I’m curious what Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier would have to say about “Joker,” considering the rigor with which each filmmaker has employed in their trenchant social satires (see Haneke’s “Funny Games” or von Trier’s “Manderlay”). My guess it that neither filmmaker would have any favorable words for such an insipid film as this. Some audiences may marvel at Joaquin Phoenix’s willingness to put his personal demons so publicly on display but, based on his wince-inducing Golden Globes speech, the type-casting on display just cuts too close to the bone. This movie can make you feel sick — vomit-in-your-seat sick. Naturally, Arthur has parental issues. He takes care of his ailing, also mentally ill, mother when he isn’t trying to track down his biological dad. Could it be that his father is the millionaire Thomas Wayne, father to Batman? Yawn. You can blame this film's kitchen sink narrative design on “Joker’s” basis in DC Comics characters, but screenwriters Scott Silver (“8 Mile”) and Todd Phillips are clearly shooting from the hip with a hack cavalier attitude that openly insults their audience.

"Jan 29, 2020"," In 1988 Alan Moore wrote Batman: The Killing Joke, a graphic novel that quickly became regarded as the definitive origin story of The Joker. In recent years, however, Moore has stepped away from his creation to the point of lamenting even writing it. Not only does he believe it to be ‘not interesting’ he also declared in an interview to the now defunct mania.com as being ‘too nasty’ and ‘too physically violent’. It many ways Moore’s incarnation of Joker feels like a blueprint to the one we see in the 2019 Todd Philips incarnation – disturbing, horrifically violent, unrepentant, entitled and unwavering in the destruction he wreaks. However, the greatest difference between Moore’s Joker and Phillips’ is the nature of the ‘origin’ being depicted. Moore built upon the 1951 origin – of a failed comedian pressured into violence – but treated it with ambiguity. It could be true, but it could be false – in the manner akin to multiple choice. We could believe it if we wished, but it never explained him. Not truly. But – and this is the fundamental point – it never humanised the Joker. It never justified the atrocities he committed. It never sought to rationalise his psychopathic destruction. It never made us feel sympathy for him. And that is the unnerving thing about watching the 2019 version – for just over two hours we are forced into alignment with a monster. And, not only that, it wants us to unrepentantly side with him. It feels hyperbolic to say that this results in a terrible sense of inescapable unease when watching, but it’s the truth. Whilst the film is shot beautifully, with a constant tight frame that claustrophobically traps us in the world of failed comedian/clown Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) to the point it feels like they are willing us to experience some semblance of Stockholm Syndrome, and is impeccably rendered – this is a Gotham that seems wild and truly threatening – this is a film that makes for disturbing and chilling watching. It’s an origin story of a villain without the counterpart that makes him one of the most iconic figures in pop culture, without the antithesis of Bruce Wayne/Batman we are submerged in the world of a seriously disturbed loner whose deluded entitlement drives him, whose self-declared deprivation results in his committing utter depravity. The world depicted on screen is a world without hope, a bleak landscape devoid of empathy. This is pseudo-social commentary where the bleak shall inherit the earth. This Joker doesn’t ‘just want to watch the world burn’. Here the hollow proclamations of revolution are merely rebranded self-pitying revenge; egotistical and raging in its insular-minded cynicism.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 22, 2020"," Watching Joker belatedly, I understood quite clearly why it got so many Oscar nominations. For what it is, it’s gorgeously assembled, with a ragged jewel of a performance by Joaquin Phoenix at its center. The problem is, well, what it is. Joker is set in Gotham City (read: New York City when you hate it; Metropolis is New York City when it’s energizing and teeming with good culture) circa 1981, and garbage is rotting on the sidewalks in its saggy tons. Joker got eleven Oscar nods, and it deserves eight of them. The grimy, soul-grinding milieu is realized with all the talent and vision $62.5 million can buy (while we realize that a movie like this not connected to a superhero franchise would have to make do with a fraction of that bankroll), and yet aesthetically the film is built to caress the eye and ear. The first half hour or so, establishing damaged wannabe-comedian Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) and his uncompromising misery, is top-shelf filmcraft.  Unfortunately, there’s still an hour and a half to go, and Joker ends up repeating itself and lap-dancing its same handful of nihilistic points again and again. Even Phoenix eventually runs out of tricks until we can’t distinguish Arthur’s actual behavior from the iconic, narcissistic behavior (that now-famous stairway dance) in his head. We sit and diagnose Arthur: he’s a mama’s boy who suffered childhood abuse that may have rattled his brain to the point that he emits paroxysms of inappropriate laughter. The way Joker ties into the larger Bat-universe is fairly stupid; Bruce Wayne’s moneybags father Thomas (Brett Cullen, replacing Alec Baldwin and essentially doing Alec Baldwin) is an insensitive jerk, a tough-on-crime elitist who calls poor people “clowns” and is running for mayor. How is he connected to Arthur? Well, he is but he isn’t. It’s that kind of candy-ass movie, toying with big plot moves and then rescinding them.  Despite the supporting cast doing more or less what they’re asked — including Robert De Niro as a talk-show host Arthur fixates on — the movie is handed to Phoenix, and he does amazing things with his physique and voice. He commits fearlessly, and it’s a shame that people have to sit through, ultimately, a failure of a movie to see the performance. Phoenix triumphs over the material — who couldn’t? The material seems to have been conceived for him to triumph over it. The talk about Joker’s biting big chunks from Martin Scorsese, specifically Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, is a little overblown. If anything, Joker shares more DNA with Abel Ferrara’s 1979 Driller Killer, in which the cold reality of the mentally ill being dumped onto the streets due to lack of funding was more disturbing than the gory drill-killings. Same goes here: again, if someone wanted to make a real drama about such issues that had nothing to do with DC Comics, it’d have to be made for couch change. Sadly, it doesn’t much matter that the topic is addressed in a big hit, because it isn’t really addressed so much as made into background.  An army of talent has been marshaled here to fashion a beautiful piece about a pismire. It’s loaded with artistry without itself being art, and the primary reason is that Todd Phillips, its nominal director, isn’t a director. Oh, he knows how to get usable footage for fake-outrageous mainstream comedies like the Hangover trilogy. But he can’t really shape material so that it means something or earns the horrible associations it may dredge up in some viewers, and it keeps backing away from anything truly explosive. Like The Dark Knight Rises, it demonizes protest (what the hell drugs was Michael Moore on when he praised this thing for its politics?) and finally takes no stand. It just takes this rambly, inchoate semi-narrative about a fractured psyche and pushes it out there on a toxic exhaust cloud of irony. I don’t usually pick on movies for violence they may or may not inspire, but Joker is the sort of interiorized, subjective work that doesn’t show Arthur’s life for the rancid squalor it truly would be; it just tries on the kinds of grim and gritty pirouettes and outfits that appeal to real Arthur Flecks. But, unlike a true work of art (like those two Scorsese classics) that would drive me to its defense, Joker is all pose. It says nothing about Arthur or his victims or his brutal world. Nothing. ",NEGATIVE
"Jan 22, 2020"," One can divide film critics into two factions: those who believe movies should come with a side order of social responsibility, and those who think all topics are fair game and films should be measured for what they are — extraneous factors be damned. Is the director a creep? Important to know, but I’ll still watch Allen and Polanski films. Is the movie vile? I’ll defend the existence of A Serbian Film and Salo to the death, even as I try to scrub them off my brain. Nobody praises shitty films because their directors are virtuous. Cinema should challenge audiences and make them uncomfortable. Give that up, and you end up with bland movies that try so hard to be liked they satisfy no one. Joker is a portrait of a community rotting from the inside. It’s set in a Gotham City that, despite its retro vibe, is Trump’s America in a nutshell — an unkind, unpleasant and toxically egotistical place where the pursuit of fame is a corrosive force. Inspired by Batman’s archnemesis (more closely than you think), Joker revolves around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a hapless, mentally unstable man — the kind of person you’d cross the street to avoid. Arthur is in dire straits and his situation gets worse by the hour. A frequent victim of abuse, he hangs on to the belief that if you smile at the world, the world will eventually smile back. Guess how well that works for him. Soon enough, reality becomes too much and Arthur murders three Patrick Bateman-types. His idea of fighting back — killing and maiming people — restores his dignity and builds up his self-esteem (MUDDLED MESSAGE ALERT). Unexpectedly, his crimes are celebrated by the many Gothamites who resent the city’s elite. A psychopath is born. I’ll state the obvious and say Joker is a timely mash-up of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, right down to the gritty New-York-in-the-’70s aesthetic. But for all his Scorsese fanboying, director Todd Phillips makes a critical mistake by framing Arthur’s criminal acts as justifiable. All but one of his victims are abusers. So, what… murder is okay when you kill bad people? The only individuals who see Travis Bickle or Rupert Pupkin as heroes are as deranged as those characters. And yet Phillips seems to want us to sympathize with Fleck’s predicament, and even identify with him. Hmmm. But Joker is freed from its misguided sociological bog by Joaquin Phoenix’ performance. Few actors can match his level of nuanced intensity (see The Master, You Were Never Really Here and I’m Still Here). I thought Heath Ledger delivered the definitive portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime, but honestly? Phoenix may have surpassed him. Joker has within it a cautionary tale that warns keeping people poor and disenfranchised is an act of political and class violence. It also connects mental illness to white supremacy, incel culture and the “they’re comin’ fer our guns” ideology, which isn’t the most responsible take.",POSITIVE
"Jan 21, 2020"," Yes, that includes JoJo Rabbit. Even the cringey and self-congratulatory Nazi slapstick of Taika Waititi’s quasi-Wes Anderson anachronism-riddled World War II satire — which might have worked nicely if compressed into a 5-minute short — ultimately had something to offer, even if it was simply the not-quite-groundbreaking message that Nazis are bad. A lethally dull and spiritually deadening exercise whose strained black humor and self-importance makes even the profundities of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy feel meaningful by comparison, Joker deserves inclusion on a list of the year’s emptiest and most derivative movies. Ultimately just another of many spinoffs from the wellspring of mid-20th century comic-book heroes and anti-heroes that continues to keep Hollywood profitable, it awkwardly masquerades like its hero in cheap greasepaint as something to be taken seriously. Much of the ooh and aah around the blockbuster has circled around Joaquin Phoenix’s bracingly unhinged turn as a sad-sack momma’s boy would-be comedian who spirals into homicidal madness after the world fails to appreciate his sense of humor. The only criticism one might make of his anchoring performance is that it is too showy, which would be akin to carping that Daniel Day-Lewis’s Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York was just a little much. Overkill is part of the equation. That being said, when an actor on Phoenix’s level is going full-tilt in a movie that does not have the dramatic or artistic weight to back him up, the effort can feel like more of a strain. Does he hurl himself into the role with a nerve-rattling effort, rending his body and expressions to embody this delusional and ultimately murderous sad-sack? Absolutely. Is any of it edifying or in the least unpredictable? Not particularly. To witness Phoenix’s reservoir of talent used in the interest of a high-impact story, see what he does in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here. A brutally violent and chillingly abstracted noir about a mercenary fixer who gets in over his head cleaning up problems for the rich and powerful, its portrayal of corrupted morality in an alienated urban environment has far greater impact than anything seen in Joker. The makers of Joker have suggested that they were not so much making a comic-book character’s origin story but rather trying to smuggle a dark character study about the lack of empathy in the modern world into a mainstream vehicle. That could well have been true in the beginning. And filmmakers have had to compromise with the studio system since its beginning to trade off commercial considerations in order to get their story told. But Phillips is not exactly some untrusted artiste; the first Hangover alone made nearly a half-billion worldwide. If the interest was really to craft an adult story, why not leverage his clout to greater effect and produce a more original piece of work? For Joker, Phillips drops his homicidal trickster into an urban hellhole drawn straight from Taxi Driver (or at least a visual idea of Scorsese’s movie). Only since this is Gotham and not actually New York, it’s a CGI simulacrum of ungentrified grit, with oh-so-carefully applied graffiti and glib references to everything from from the 1977 blackout riots to the 1984 Bernhard Goetz subway shootings — there’s even a confusingly and cynically tossed-in callout to Occupy Wall Street. But since it is all in service of pushing the Joker toward his preordained role as giggly psychopath anti-hero, everything that precedes that moment of evolution has about as much impact as everything in Rogue One that turned out just to be nothing more than setup for Darth Vader’s grand appearance. Now, with a billion-dollar box office and 11 Oscar nominations — especially galling in another year in which women were shoved to the side, given that the self-inflating and destructive nihilism of Phoenix’s Joker is essentially an apex 21st century toxic male only in analog form — Phillips has provided the industry an off-ramp for grinding yet more filthy lucre out of increasingly strained comic-book properties. DC and Marvel may potentially see the road open to an entire sideline of fall release R-rated prestige pictures running in parallel to their PG-13 summer tentpoles. Studios can now follow the Joker model of decanting comic heroes and villains into purportedly more serious vehicles by attaching an indisputably great actor and placing them inside a simulacrum of an acknowledged classic of the past. Spider-man (Timothee Chalamet) cleans up the Red Hook docks ala On the Waterfront. Infuriated by injustice, Superman (John David Washington) goes to law school and turns Atticus Finch.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 21, 2020"," Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a professional clown living in early 1980s Gotham City. He lives with his elderly mother. He sees a state-appointed therapist, but she does not seem interested in his problems. A gang of youths beat him up in the street. When it becomes clear no one cares about his welfare, Fleck begins a descent down from despair toward a murderous rampage. I am unsure if it is even worth reviewing Joker, Todd Phillips’ hugely successful bleak drama that has already grossed a billion dollars in cinemas and picked up 11 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Whatever my opinion of it, it has already proved itself to be resonant with a mass audience. As it happens, my opinion is resoundingly negative – but who will likely care? There is an ever-expanding disconnect between critics and audiences that feels particularly evident here. If you enjoyed the film, go ahead and continue to enjoy it. You do not need me applying a fierce and arrogant brand of negativity in your general direction. Never let someone ever tell you that your opinions are wrong, and continue to enjoy Joker. For everybody else, be aware that some spoilers ensue. Allow me to briefly describe another film to you: Tetsuya Mariko’s Destruction Babies. It features a delinquent young man named Taira (Yuya Yagira): orphaned, as good as homeless, and largely abandoned by a society that simply does not care enough to provide assistance. His abandonment has clearly stimulated some level of mental illness, so he heads into town and starts picking fights. Always unarmed, always with other men, but within those limits he simply begins walking up to strangers and punching them repeatedly in the face. Some fights he wins, some he loses, but each comes with the same blunt wet slapping sounds of fists upon flesh. It is deeply confrontational, highly visceral, and incredibly disturbing and difficult to watch. Mariko’s film has a lot to say about societal responsibility, and abandonment, and particularly violent masculinity. I recently wrote up a huge list of my 350 favourite films of the 2010s and it came in at #31. Destruction Babies is the real deal, one of many films out there that address these issues. Joker is the weak grey photocopy of the real deal. It ostensibly seems to have a lot to say, but it never sits still for long enough to actually convince me that it means any of it. It seems to shout out a lot of social commentary, but never finishes a sentence. Referencing “The Emperor’s New Clothes” always strikes me as a slightly lazy technique in reviewing film, but I’m not sure there has been a film so suited to the comparison in years. If you prefer, you can alternatively evoke Shakespeare’s oft-quoted line from Macbeth: ‘A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing’. Both fit the film perfectly. Joker is a pastiche, cobbled together from a string of older films and assembled into its own bleak narrative. That, in itself, is a perfectly reasonable technique. Many filmmakers make outstanding cinema out of pastiche – particularly Quentin Tarantino, who has perfected the practice to the level of post-modern high art. Todd Phillips, whose previous films include the comedies Road Trip, The Hangover, and Due Date, has not perfected the practice. His reference points are obvious. His screenplay, co-written by Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile), is deeply predictable. When it tries to surprise, it does so with an openly telegraphed and clumsily executed twist. When it tries to shock, it walks away strangely bowdlerised. It is a film clearly intended to shock and disturb. If, as a viewer, you are seeking a great film from 2019 that uses violent behaviour to shock and disturb, I recommend tracking down Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite or Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale. Both examine serious social issues in a deeply confronting manner that is designed to shake their audiences to attention. Joker is talking the talk without delivering a suitable impact. Phillips also has a very murky handle on how his audience is to treat Arthur Fleck. He is presented as a sympathetic character, yet commits awful crimes (including a scene on a train that odiously echoes the real-life Bernhard Goetz shootings of 1984). As the protagonist he is an unreliable narrator, in a poorly defined manner that brings almost every event in the film into question. A key series of scenes imply a relationship that does not exist. When Fleck realises this, the film goes through a series of visual and editing cues that heavily imply Fleck murders someone. For one thing, the scene has an open ending and the other character is never seen again. No, Phillips has told the entertainment press, that character survives. Such narrative uncertainties make it impossible to reliably engage with anything in the film – at which stage one must ask what the point is of any of it. Is Joker a weakly plotted and confused story, or is it simply presented that way through Fleck’s troubled perception? Without clearly signalling the difference, Phillips is simply obfuscating. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a varied performance in the role, that sadly weakens the moment he adopts his Joker persona. Other members of the cast deliver more consistent work, but in all honesty there is no particular stand-out. Phoenix’s performance also feels weak because he is playing an iteration of the character already played by a string of excellent actors. He fails by comparison; he is an extremely poor Joker. One could potentially argue he is a Joker suited to this specific narrative. After all, all fictional texts are open to translation and re-interpretation, just as long as enough remains to tie that interpretation to the original work. In the case of the Joker, there are essentially three key aspects to the character that need to exist: that he dressed like a clown, that he is funny, and that he is scary. One can tweak the proportions – for example, Cesar Romero was mostly funny and only a little bit scary, whereas Heath Ledger was funny and frightening in equal measure – but all three aspects have to somehow be present to reflect the character on the broadest of levels. Sadly, Joaquin Phoenix plays a Joker that is neither funny nor scary. Instead he simply plays a mentally ill man treated terribly by society, whose subsequent murderous rampages feel more boring than effective. Each murder Fleck commits during the story pulls him another step away from audience identification. He feels like the literary Joker precisely once, when he brutally murders one person but affectionately spares another. At any rate, by the film’s end all sense of sympathy is drained from the character. What is left is not even offensive or unlikeable. He is simply dull; a banal retread of older, better iterations of the Joker. Joker uses its DC Comics connection as a crutch. Without it, it seems unlikely that the film would ever have seen the inside of theatres. Fleck is a dull character surrounded by other dull characters, telling a weak and fuzzy allegory about toxic societies and mental illness. It has much to play with, but nothing to say. This is not a disturbing or challenging film as its reputation suggests. It is a commercially packaged simulacrum of such fare. It has been artificially rendered safe for mass consumption. Audiences should seek out challenging films. They should stretch their experience of difficult subject matter, or confronting violence. Go out and watch Destruction Babies, or The Nightingale, or Parasite. Watch Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Hell, go for broke and try Pasolini’s Salo or Srđan Spasojević’s A Serbian Film. Todd Phillips’ film is riding high on a platform it has not earned or respected, and it has taken your money through insinuation and replication. Joker climaxes with Fleck in a screaming crowd, dancing on top of a car: he’s cheap entertainment for the masses. So is this film. I implore you: move on from Joker. You are better than this. We all are. Maybe people watched it because it’s about a comic book character. This movie about a comic strip lacks in social commentary. Watch the Serbian Film! Lol. What a hipster indeed! A Serbian Film is one of the worst films of all time. Joker has its issues but its nowhere near as banal and repugnant as that festering turd. I wouldn’t say there’s a widening gap between critics and audiences; quite the opposite This was strongly divisive for both audiences and critics.

"Jan 17, 2020"," This Monday January 13th movie fans held their breath in excitement as the nominations for the 92nd Academy Awards were announced in Hollywood. One can certainly argue that too much time and energy is put into the Oscars but it is also a nice way to look back at the year in film and hopefully honor some of the strong films released by both big and small studios. This year I have actually seen all of the nominees for Best Picture, so I thought it would be fun to share my thoughts on each film and what chances each film has to win. I am thrilled to see an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser like Ford v Ferrari get nominated for Best Picture. What’s great about Ford v Ferrari is that it is not just an underdog racing movie (which is a genre I LOVE!) but it is also a wonderful movie about friendship. Christian Bale is excellent as Ken Miles and Matt Damon is great as his bewildered colleague Carroll Shelby. I loved all the supporting cast especially Noah Jupe and Caitriona Balfe as Bales’ son and wife respectfully. The film is a little too long but it’s a highly entertaining watch. I do think it is a long shot to win and comes in at 9th place in my prediction ranking. This new version of Little Women has become quite a part of my life lately. I have seen it twice, written my review, and then been on 2 separate podcasts where I discussed and ranked it. I really enjoyed this take on the classic story of Little Women. In particular the non-linear storytelling (which I usually hate) really worked to help make each sisters choices more valid especially Amy and Laurie. I loved all the performances and filmmaking choices like costumes, production design etc. The script got a little too cute at times and I would have preferred they used 2 Amys but it is still one of my favorites films of the year. Unfortunately with Greta Gerwig getting snubbed for Best Director the odds for it winning Best Picture are small and it is at 8th place in my prediction ranking. Writing satire is probably the most difficult type of screenwriting. The line between clever skewering of society and an unfunny piece in poor taste is incredibly difficult. Director and writer Taika Waititi managed to do just that with his film JoJo Rabbit where we learn that even the worst of ideologies can be driven out of someone (especially a child) by the power of human connection. I laughed. I cried. I was delighted and I recommend anyone watch it and experience something unique at the theater. However, because the subject matter and approach is not for everyone it is unlikely to win and gets 7th place in my prediction rating. Upon its release I was one of the few detractors on Martin Scorsese’s epic mob film The Irishman. There is much to admire in the film especially the terrific period detail and performances. My issue is the story and characters. The lead character Frank Sheeran is an admitted soldier for the mafia, meaning he doesn’t have a lot of moral questioning of what he is asked to do. He dutifully follows orders. It isn’t until the last 30 minutes of a very long movie that introspection happens and things become interesting. It was too little too late and the ponderous pacing made it a tough watch. As far as predictions, The Irishman was a clear favorite back in November, but with the length being a factor, DeNiro not getting nominated, and a general overall lack of awards season buzz all make it an unlikely winner and ultimately 6th place in my prediction ranking. I must admit I put off watching the new drama Marriage Story from writer/director Noah Baumbach. The idea of seeing a couple go through something as horrible as divorce for 2 hours sounded very unpleasant especially during the holidays. However, I finally watched it and it’s very well done. The writing feels authentic to the characters and I appreciate the script doesn’t pick sides for the male or the female. The acting is tremendous; although, I’m a bit baffled at the awards love being shown to Laura Dern who is fine but nothing extraordinary if you ask me. I think the movie is just too small in scope to win the big prize without a surprise win like Moonlight had a few years ago so it is 5th place in my prediction ranking. Another movie I put off watching is Todd Phillips origin story of Joker. I was pretty sure with the tone and violence it wouldn’t be my taste and after what happened with Shazam I wasn’t interested in facing the angry mob unless I had to for having an opinion. Once it got nominated I watched it and it’s not for me. Basically the Arthur of the film lives in a dystopian where everyone is underhanded, unkind, cruel and bitter. His story wasn’t interesting to me because there never was a valid option for him to chose a different path. Of course he is going to become a supervillain if everyone treats him like complete garbage. This is not a world I connect with or agree with but I’m not a cynical person. Nevertheless, many do seem to enjoy the film and it got the most nominations, so it could win. However, there’s enough backlash and enough comicbook/blockbuster stigma to prevent it. I have it at 4th place in my prediction ranking. If I was going to predict a surprise win it would be Parasite. The South Korean thriller by director Bong Joon Ho is the consensus favorite for almost everyone I know. Whether film snob on twitter or everyday moviegoer, we all seem to love Parasite and that’s because it’s a great film. It is entertaining, enlightening, surprising and has something to say without beating you over the head with it. I also think the preferential voting system of the Oscars could help Parasite out the most because even if some don’t have it first almost everyone will have in their top 3. It could be the Green Book of 2020. The downside is some may feel a win in International Film is enough for it and a subtitled film has never won Best Picture before and that is a barrier for some voters. This is why I have it at 3rd place in my prediction ranking. These last 2 are very tough to decide between when it comes to predictions. 1917 is an incredible, immersive experience telling the story of 2 soldiers in World War 1 as they attempt to deliver a message across the trenches. It is set up like one take and you really feel like you are there with the soldiers which I found emotionally exhausting and moving. I highly recommend seeing it in the theater if at all possible. It just won the Golden Globe so if it wins Best Picture I won’t be surprised at all but I think the Academy voters are just narcissistic enough to pick the movie which is all about them instead. That makes 1917 in 2nd place in my prediction ranking. In director Quentin Tarantino’s latest film he does a lot of things right to peak Oscar interest. First of all, he gets a top notch cast with Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie. Then he has the film set in Hollywood and it be an alternate history of the life of a tragic figure Sharon Tate. You portray the struggle of being famous and a washed up star, which Hollywood loves (hello Birdman...). You have enough gratuitous violence and humor while showing off Los Angeles in 1969, you’ve got yourself a Best Picture winner. I enjoyed the film well enough but thought it was quite self indulgent especially in the long, excessive driving scenes that went nowhere. This isn’t the best film of the year in my opinion but I think it strokes all of the voters ego enough to win Best Picture and it is my top prediction! So there you have it!  What do you think of the 9 nominees? Have you seen them? Do you think they are worthy choices or do you feel something better was left out? Let me know and what would you prediction ranking be for the winner? Let me know in the comments! Fun getting all your thoughts on these and getting to know your odds for all of them.  Of the three I’ve seen, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is the onlybI’ve really liked, but I do find it a bit needlessly long-winded in a lot of moments.  Jojo Rabbit was fine but honestly kind of forgettable to me so hard to think of it as the ‘best’ of anything and I have this thing where I haven’t outright hated either Taika Waititi movie I’ve seen (it and Ragnarok) but I think I seem to not find them as amusing as most.  In the case of Parasite, I see where it was well-made and get what it was trying to say but I found it a highly unplesant watch with characters I found hard to root for by the midway point and everything that point on was way too unpleasant for me.  I feel like I missed out on something since everyone loved it but it just wasn’t for me.  I’m happy for everyone who loved it getting to see it getting all the awards love, I just hope film Twitter as a whole doesn’t write off anyone who dislikes it as stupid and/or that they dislike due to popularity, especially since I REALLY wanted to like it. Huh. I guess I’m not really rooting for any of the characters in Parasite but I understand them rich and poor. Anyway that’s fine. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and reading! I am a huge fan of The Joker.  It is one of the original stories out there.  Focus is on a character from the Batman comics and not Batman.   There is huge deeper message about how people with mental illnesses are disregarded, disrespected, and discarded.  A few of the other nominees are makeovers of past movies.  I don’t need to see another version of Little Women, a WWI movie or a gangster film.  A movie with subtitles should not have been nominated in my opinion, especially with Asian stereotypes. I understand not liking Joker for all the reasons you listed except for the idea that he wasn’t given a choice to change his path. Because I feel like giving him a path to redemption or an easy path to the mental health treatment would have taken away from the messages the film was trying to say about mental health and the unfair treatment of workers in late capitalist societies. The film honestly had me desperetly hoping Arthur would get the help he needs and Arthur treating his transformation like fate, (as well him turning how others treated him into an ideological motivation to become the Joker) despite how easily avoidable it was made the film more intense and gripping to me.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 16, 2020"," To say that JOKER is one of the best comic book films ever
made is no exaggeration nor fanboy theory. In an age where such films are
plagued by special effects and spectacle that are as impressive to look at as
they are forgettable fluff, JOKER comes to show that comic book-based films can
have multiple things to say and will create intense conversation that perhaps
no other superhero or comic book film has ever created. Most impressively, the
film does not seek to easily please nor impress audiences. It stays true to
itself and, in the process, sweeps us along the way and immerses us in its
dark, terrifying world. Not since THE DARK KNIGHT have we seen such a magnetic, transporting,
uncompromising and raw film that is daring enough to get rid of artificial
effects, contrived plotlines, expensive production to deliver something of
incredible timeliness and quite a stirring commentary of the world we live in
today. In inspiring multiple interpretations, even the vocal critics of the
film will not deny that such conversation is one of the film’s prime merits.
Unlike most DC and Marvel stuff, that has turned into what looks like console
films where drama is sparse in the middle of dizzying effects and epic battles,
the JOKER shocks and stuns its audience without a hint of effects.  As it turns out, the real world, with its stark parallels to
the story of the Joker, is much more terrifying than any villain created by
some CGI. And it’s indeed quite rare to see such a dense, layered and complex
comic book film at a time when studios are going safer and safer. It’s quite a
miracle that such a film exists in the first place and its existence alone
should be celebrated, even if this does not mean it should, nor will, be
unanimously praised in every corner.  A character study rather than a conventional origin story,
JOKER is one of those films that surprises, stuns and shocks it audience rather
than create instant sentiments of love or passion. It’s a trait of many great
films that, as a bit of time has passed by, their narrative boldness and utter
uniqueness are realized and fully appreciated. Gritty, dark and psychological,
this is not a film made for mere popcorn entertainment but has several things
to say.  There are a multitude of ways through which analysis about
the film can, and will, be drawn – but perhaps the best way to view JOKER is to
interpret it as a journey of longing. In every frame and every scene, Philipps
brilliantly builds a character on its path to transformation, stemming from
needs and emotions that are so far away that they have become expired dreams;
ghosts hunting a troubled man. As Arthur (an astonishing, career-best
performance by Joaquin Pheonix) disappears gradually until his true self
vanishes only to then rebuild his identity as the Joker, the deconstruction and
reconstruction of identity is quite something to behold.  This journey of longing is presented in phases, or chapters,
within the context of the story: longing to get away from loneliness, longing
to find true belonging, longing for justice, love, laughter – but most
importantly longing to be accepted and noticed. Each of these emotions occupy the
film with wordless and sparsely-written scenes that speak to the process of
creating a deranged, unhinged killer whose mental illness is transformed into
insanity as the longing grows more urgent and ultimately leads to despair and a
hunger for revenge. That’s not to say that the film presents mental illness in
sentimental, sympathetic ways – but in a world where mass shooters are plaguing
the news cycle and destroying lives, JOKER argues that understanding society’s
illnesses and diving into the criminal mentality are not synonymous with
forgiveness. Sometimes, it’s important to look at how the very same place we
call home has expelled, marginalized and turned a blind eye to those who have
turned it into a killing ground ruled by fear. There are no redeeming qualities
for monsters like the Joker, but some monsters are man-made.  Verdict: JOKER will be the most talked about film of the year, if it isn’t already, but it’s a remarkable accomplishment on many levels. An intricate, layered and complex character study disguised as a comic book film – who makes these films anymore in Hollywood? ",POSITIVE

"Jan 13, 2020"," It is, perhaps, a truism that every generation gets the Batman or Superman that they need/deserve. With Todd Philips’ JOKER, though, we get more than a cultural gloss of the zeitgeist.  We get a funhouse mirror that lurks deep within a house of horrors that is an extrapolation of what happens when the 1% of the haves push the have-nots too far. This Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) is not the chaos of Heath Ledger, nor the camp of Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. No, this Joker is the not unreasonable reaction to helplessness in the face of a world gone mad.  That’s what makes him so terrifying. At least to the 1%. In his pre-Joker incarnation, Joker is Arthur Fleck, a troubled, but essentially gentle spirit coping with urban decay in the 1980s. He’s the only child of a mother whose mind wanders, and he believes it is his purpose in life to bring joy to the world. Unfortunately, the world is not interested. In fact, it regards him in his clown frippery and make-up with disdain and condescension that can deliver a severe beating for doing nothing more than laughing. When funding cuts deprive him of his psychiatric social worker, when a co-worker’s putatively good intentions go wrong, and when his idol (Robert de Niro), a late-night talk show host finally takes notice of him only to mock him, Arthur spirals downward. When a secret his mother (Frances Conroy) has kept from him surfaces, he snaps. Or maybe he already snapped, and we didn’t see it because it hadn’t registered with Arthur himself yet. Phillip’s script is told from Arthur’s POV, and is such an oneiric, immersive experience, where up is easily down, and Arthur becomes an object of empathy, even when behaving erratically. Even when becoming violent, so all-consumingly have we been swept up, that are we into his moral compass, a strict and honorable one, which he has created for himself. The shock and disgust are not ameliorated, nor is there the safety of knowing what Arthur’s strictly and honorable act or acts will be. The most disquieting thing about JOKER is, in fact, that endless interplay between understanding and disbelief at any given moment over any given act. It is grotesque and it is fascinating as it plays with Old Testament justice and sheer madness. Phoenix is breathtaking. With a cackle of a laugh that Arthur bellows, he becomes the hollow man, wasted in mind and body, pretending to feel the joy that has eluded him, and a palpable desperation that it pretense will become reality, if he only laughs harder. It is heartbreaking. As is his equally palpable tenderness tempered with despair that renders him inert, through to the liberation of succumbing to insanity and the peace that it brings him, Phoenix is ferocious in his temerity, and fragile in his violence. It is a depiction of madness that is disturbing for the empowerment it brings, and the happiness it imparts to one who has so sorely desired, and deserved, it. He is the embodiment of the film’s world turned upside down, and it is a performance in which nothing has been left to chance. It is as nuanced as it is daring. The politics of JOKER are stark, starting with the title character’s assertion that he doesn’t believe in anything. It is the cry of the downtrodden who have had their dreams beaten out of them, and what happens when they have nothing left to lose. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of future Batman, Bruce and a heroic figure in other incarnations of the tales of Gotham, is here a rich man who views the underclass as clowns when they dare to protest their condition. Later, two cops are trailing Joker and lose him in a crowd of protesters dressed as clowns who were sparked to action by Joker’s killing of three wealthy men who terrorized of fellow subway riders as a joke. As a metaphor, it is sublime. As a comment on our time, it is prescient. As a warning, annotated as it is with a scene from Chaplin’s MODERN TIMES, it is the single scariest thing in JOKER. For all its hints of Kafka, TAXI DRIVER, and PSYCHO, JOKER is piece The genuine smile smile Arthur beams as he watches the fiery riot he has inspired is heart-warming, cautionary, and deliberately disquieting.",POSITIVE

"Jan 10, 2020"," There have been many comic-book villains to grace the silver screen, each of them ranging somewhere between instantly forgettable and memorably iconic. Those who fall towards the latter usually get more than one incarnation. The pinnacle of these characters has to be the Joker. A homicidal clown, he has been played not twice but a total of four times, and now a fifth, getting the title role in the new film Joker. This film is unique because it seeks to put a new spin on the story of the Joker by giving him a story. Prior to this film, the character’s history had been more or less a mystery. The film presents a humble man, Arthur Fleck, who grows increasingly distressed at the callous nature of his fellow inhabitants of a 1970s-era Gotham City. He suffers beatings, scoldings, and mistreatment due to his mental illness, pushing him to the brink of madness. Typically, the story has gone that the terror of Gotham City creates Batman, and Batman’s existence creates the Joker. Joker takes it the other way around and has the clown emerge first, with the Bat soon to follow.  It’s not at all a bad set-up, and Joker goes to great lengths to show a man who is trying his very best in trying times. You’re meant to feel for Arthur when he suffers his multiple misfortunes, but there comes a point when his reactions to those misfortunes are not for your sympathy. Joker works brilliantly in making you feel empathy for someone capable of committing monstrous crimes, making it all the more disturbing when those crimes occur. While most comic-book origin stories make you long for the protagonist to don their iconic get-up, Joker is a movie that does the opposite. You fear for the lives of the people in Gotham if Arthur completes his transformation into Joker. When he finally does put on the colourful suit and painted face, it’s akin to watching a horror movie monster emerge. While Joker is an interesting take on a well-­established character, it’s unfortunately let down by a messy ending. Most of the movie takes you on an exceptional journey full of intrigue, masterfully developed tension, and impactful performances to remember. The ending betrays all that and settles in with a misguided message that betrays what was initially set up for the film. ",NEUTRAL

"Jan 6, 2020"," Opening this weekend:

Joker—This is an origin story for Batman’s white-faced, green-haired original nemesis, probably the most famous of all super-villains. Debuting in Batman’s first adventure in 1940—his appearance is said to have been based on Conrad Veidt in 1928’s The Man Who Laughs—the character helped to popularize the “sinister clown” archetype that ultimately led to Pennywise.

But this new film, directed and co-written by Todd Phillips of the Hangover flicks, shows us the Clown Prince of Crime when he was just Arthur Fleck, a single man sharing a shabby apartment with his mother in a gray, unhappy version of Gotham City in the ‘70s. Arthur, who has an affliction that causes him to laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately, proudly works as a clown-for-hire and aspires to be a stand-up comedian. Alas, he’s generally the cosmic butt of the joke: Assaulted by street hoodlums, insulted by people on the bus, deceived by coworkers.

He even fantasizes about bonding with late-night talk-show host Robert DeNiro—that’s right, Gotham City is so down on its luck that Rupert Pupkin actually has his own show. This isn’t just a throwaway gag, either. Although the film seems to draw on influences ranging from Network to The Purge, the biggest inspiration is clearly Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, with Arthur in the Pupkin role.


The reason to see the film is the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Like Renee Zellweger’s Judy Garland, it’s a stunt turn; Phoenix reduced his body to a gaunt husk, and his face has a hawkish, forbidding handsomeness; he looks like James Taylor on meth.


But he doesn’t play the character as a criminal genius, or as a comic genius, or as any kind of a genius. Arthur is just a victim; he suffers and suffers until at last he lashes out in violence. In that sense, Joker is another of those “Sympathy for the Devil” stories, like Dracula Untold or Maleficent or Laurence Oliver’s version of Professor Moriarty in The Seven-Percent Solution, giving us a softer take on a notorious pop-culture ne’er-do-well.

Phoenix overcomes the self-pity inherent in the material; he gives Arthur a sweet soul, and makes it hard not to like him, and to cringe when you see his next humiliation coming. In that sense, Joker is compelling.

But it’s also on the heavy, overambitious side. Its attempt at an epic social strand doesn’t come off, and the nods to the DC “universe” are (perhaps deliberately) perfunctory. But not everything about the Joker of the comics needed to be jettisoned. The movie would probably be more fun—albeit maybe less honorable—if, say, Arthur was genuinely funny, or if his crimes had a prankster’s panache. Whenever the film allows itself a little grim humor, you feel the audience stir to life a bit more.


It would definitely be easier going if somebody had knocked out and tied up the cello player. I thought the droning of low strings on the soundtrack was going to crack my skull open.

One more thought: Now that they’ve given the Joker this treatment, how about a similarly squalid, small-potatoes version of the Batman myth to match? That would be a really good joke.

Where’s My Roy Cohn?—If anybody on the 20th-century American scene seems like a real-life super-villain, it’s Roy Cohn. This documentary chronicles the life and career of the defiantly amoral pitbull and fixer of the Rosenberg trial, McCarthy’s sidekick in the Red Scare and the Lavender Scare, the glowering loser in the Army-McCarthy Hearings, the mob lawyer, the early mentor of our current President. The title, by the way, is supposedly a wistful remark of Trump’s, in disgust at the perceived failure of AG Jeff Sessions to protect him.

Directed by Matt Tyrnauer, the movie is a quick remedial rundown of Cohn nastiness. There’s nothing much new here, including the implication that Cohn was a key factor in the introduction of the combative, zero-sum style of modern politics. The film does manage, however—maybe unintentionally—to evoke a certain pity for Cohn, especially the late footage of him, still half-heartedly non-denial-denying he was gay while he was dying of AIDs, a sad, boyish look on his face. The generational terror that Cohn’s expression hints at doesn’t mitigate his guilt, but it complicates it.

There’s nothing much new here, including the implication that Cohn was a key factor in the introduction of the combative, zero-sum style of modern politics. The film does manage, however—maybe unintentionally—to evoke a certain pity for Cohn, especially the late footage of him, still half-heartedly non-denial-denying he was gay while he was dying of AIDs, a sad, boyish look on his face. The generational terror that Cohn’s expression hints at doesn’t mitigate his guilt, but it complicates it. But this new film, directed and co-written by Todd Phillips of the Hangover flicks, shows us the Clown Prince of Crime when he was just Arthur Fleck, a single man sharing a shabby apartment with his mother in a gray, unhappy version of Gotham City in the ‘70s. Arthur, who has an affliction that causes him to laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately, proudly works as a clown-for-hire and aspires to be a stand-up comedian. Alas, he’s generally the cosmic butt of the joke: Assaulted by street hoodlums, insulted by people on the bus, deceived by coworkers.

He even fantasizes about bonding with late-night talk-show host Robert DeNiro—that’s right, Gotham City is so down on its luck that Rupert Pupkin actually has his own show. This isn’t just a throwaway gag, either. Although the film seems to draw on influences ranging from Network to The Purge, the biggest inspiration is clearly Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, with Arthur in the Pupkin role.


The reason to see the film is the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Like Renee Zellweger’s Judy Garland, it’s a stunt turn; Phoenix reduced his body to a gaunt husk, and his face has a hawkish, forbidding handsomeness; he looks like James Taylor on meth.


But he doesn’t play the character as a criminal genius, or as a comic genius, or as any kind of a genius. Arthur is just a victim; he suffers and suffers until at last he lashes out in violence. In that sense, Joker is another of those “Sympathy for the Devil” stories, like Dracula Untold or Maleficent or Laurence Oliver’s version of Professor Moriarty in The Seven-Percent Solution, giving us a softer take on a notorious pop-culture ne’er-do-well.

Phoenix overcomes the self-pity inherent in the material; he gives Arthur a sweet soul, and makes it hard not to like him, and to cringe when you see his next humiliation coming. In that sense, Joker is compelling.

But it’s also on the heavy, overambitious side. Its attempt at an epic social strand doesn’t come off, and the nods to the DC “universe” are (perhaps deliberately) perfunctory. But not everything about the Joker of the comics needed to be jettisoned. The movie would probably be more fun—albeit maybe less honorable—if, say, Arthur was genuinely funny, or if his crimes had a prankster’s panache. Whenever the film allows itself a little grim humor, you feel the audience stir to life a bit more.


It would definitely be easier going if somebody had knocked out and tied up the cello player. I thought the droning of low strings on the soundtrack was going to crack my skull open.

One more thought: Now that they’ve given the Joker this treatment, how about a similarly squalid, small-potatoes version of the Batman myth to match? That would be a really good joke.

"Dec 11, 2019"," “Why so serious?” That’s the immortal line from Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight, but it’s how many will feel after watching the latest take on the character in Todd Phillips’ Joker. Some have already voiced concern about the film’s bleak nihilism, which has reportedly incited riots and prompted mass shooting threats in theaters. Others have labeled it a theatrical masterpiece. Truth be told, both sides have good arguments. Joaquin Phoenix continues to be this century’s Marlon Brando, as advertised. The Stygian madness and Orwellian setting, however, are almost too much to take and things get disjointed, which makes Joker one of the most hyped-up middle-of-the-road movies to come out in a long time. War is Peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. These are the conflicting mottos of Gotham City in 1981 (three years before 1984). New York doubles as Gotham, and so does its trash epidemic. Steam shoots up from the sewers. Garbage is piled knee-high in the streets. It’s a novel sight in the clean comic book universe. The problem is, the garbage extends to the characters. No one — and I mean no one — is remotely likable. There are bad guys and badder guys. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) asks his fellow street clowns. Being a clown is his part-time job, and during the day he tap dances and waves a sign around, while putting on a fake smile that’s easy to see through. Arthur is miserable. He’s been kicked up and down Gotham like an empty can. Kids steal his sign then beat him senseless. Audiences mock his standup comedy. All he has left is his dying mother (Frances Conroy), who he lives with and takes care of. How can he keep going? How can we keep going? They say laughter is the best medicine for sadness, but for Arthur it is a mental illness. He has a condition that causes him to break out in fits of laughter at the awkwardest of moments. Joker is an origin story for the Batman villain, so fans of DC comics will recognize this as a precursor to the infamous laughing gas. The fan service doesn’t end there, though. For two hours Arthur must be beaten and tortured, tortured and beaten, until his only response is to become the menacing Joker we expect, ultimately campaigning for anarchy, and giving the city the good ol’ revenge line we all know is coming: “Who’s laughing now?” The punishing violence here is no laughing matter. I found it odd that The Hangover’s director was put in charge of such a prestigious and dark picture, but to my surprise, Phillips pulls it off from a film-making perspective. His is a world that calls back to classics. Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin, a scheming talk show host much like the one in The King of Comedy. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher’s tracking shots and zoom-ins pay homage to other Scorsese hits like Raging Bull and Goodfellas. While Scorsese is the obvious aesthetic inspiration, it’s what is shown on theater signs in the background that projects Phillips’ greatest influences. Modern Times, Blow Out and Zorro: The Gay Blade should give you an idea of what the director is going for. I think Joker’s controversial reception is really about the lack of meaning on screen. There’s no takeaway. Besides capitalism sucks and love your neighbor, what else does Phillips have to say? The Joker becomes a sadistic Robin Hood, putting holes in a few Wall Street douche bags, and the city rejoices. “Kill The Rich” read the headlines. Though the movie is in no way condoning these actions, the mismatched tones are insulting. As the city slowly descends into anarchy, and Arthur descends into madness, there’s a weird playfulness to the proceedings that’s downright offensive. It’s as if Phillips can’t help trying to be funny. Even in the brutal murder scenes, there’s a dynamism to the score and imagery that suggests we should be rooting for this sociopath in makeup. Lots of people are going to disagree, though. What cannot be argued is that Phoenix has once again turned in an Oscar-worthy performance, and it rivals previous takes on the role (that’s saying something considering the company he’s in: Ledger, Jared Leto, Caesar Romero and Jack Nicholson). With The Master, You Were Never Really Here, Her and now Joker, Phoenix has become the go-to actor for portraying male anxiety in contemporary times. I won’t spoil what he does here, since it is thrilling to anticipate, then discover, what Joker does and where it goes by the end.  What I can say is that Phoenix is the high point in a film with a lot of low points. No joke.",POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2019","Joker is a decent movie. It has its strengths: Phoenix's tour de force performance and Hildur Guðnadóttir's score among them. But for all that, it's not really worthy of all the hand-wringing it's inspired.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 6, 2019"," Even this early in the film, we already know it's not just Arthur. The Gotham City he inhabits is literally lined with trash, thanks to a garbage strike, which in turn has brought out the ""super rats."" Among the city's human citizens, wanton violence is the order of the day; the very first scene shows Arthur getting jumped by a group of teenagers for shits and giggles. Arthur's personal life is no less hectic. He's struggling with an undefined mental illness and a condition that causes him to break out in uncontrollable laughter. (Yes, this is one of those stories that paints people with mental health issues as violent, despite the fact that they're more likely to be the victims of violence.) He's barely scraping by at his clown-for-hire job, while trying to break into the merciless world of standup comedy. And when he's not dealing with all of that, he's taking care of his frail and lonely mother. He's on the brink as it is, and it's a foregone conclusion that a bit of bad luck will finally push him over the edge. The film is called Joker, after all, not Arthur, and in that regard, it delivers. You will, as promised, get to witness the devolution of a troubled man into a full-fledged supervillain. You just may not get much more out of it. Or at least, I didn't. To the extent that Joker feels unique, it's thanks to Joaquin Phoenix -- and in particular, his way of moving as Arthur, which is at once graceful and grotesque. Arthur never feels more wounded, more powerful, more menacing, or more fully realized than when he is dancing by himself, which is a blessing since there are many, many scenes of Arthur dancing by himself.  Otherwise, Joker tends toward the tedium that comes with taking big, familiar concepts and smothering them under layers upon layers of unearned self-seriousness. Director and co-writer (with Scott Silver) Todd Phillips knows how to shoot a pretty picture -- one painstakingly modeled after the '70s films it's aping, like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver -- but doesn't seem to have much of anything to say about what he's decided to show us.  So we see, for instance, ""anti-rich"" riots and protests around Gotham City (to Joker, they're the same thing), but depicted in such broad strokes as to be rendered completely meaningless. Who are these people? What do they hope to achieve? Are their grievances legitimate, or are they just being jerks? Joker not only fails to ask these questions, it doesn't even seem capable of imagining them. The same goes for its lead. Joker's sole narrative mission is detailing how Arthur becomes the Joker; there are no subplots or side characters significant enough to distract from this focus. Yet for all the new facts the film serves up about him (some of which, annoyingly, are delivered with an ""... or is he?"" smirk), it offers little insight into his psychology or his personality or his soul. If it's difficult to muster much sympathy for him, it's also hard to work up the energy to be properly disturbed by him. On the rare occasion this film does find itself in danger of making an actual point or taking an actual risk, Joker tends to pull back. The clearest read of the film is as a power fantasy of self-actualizing by giving into fury instead of trying to fight it. Try to get any more specific than that, though -- perhaps by stopping to wonder who that rage should be directed at, or what might be accomplished through it -- and Joker demurs. Likewise, some of Arthur's most horrific deeds are only implied, not shown, all the better to have it both ways. Do you like the idea of Arthur committing a particular disgusting crime? Great! You can assume he did, and give Joker credit for being edgy enough to go there. Would you like him more if he didn't? Well, you're in luck, because there's no proof that he actually went through with it. It is likely that Joker would have been a far more alienating and upsetting experience if Phillips had chosen to confirm some of those particulars. It is also probably the case that Joker could only gamble so much, given that it's an expensive blockbuster designed to appeal to a broad audience -- one that would bring with them their own associations with the character, and could therefore project whatever they wanted to see in the movie, for better or for worse. The result of these creative decisions, however, is that whatever power Joker, as a pop culture icon, might wield, Joker, as a movie, feels toothless. It's a teenager making obscene gestures, but only when the teacher's back is turned. It's an old man yelling at a cloud because he knows the cloud can't yell back. It's a reply guy who hides behind the devil's advocate to voice all his most obnoxious opinions without actually owning them. Perhaps that's just as well. It's not as if our world is lacking in encouragements and excuses for asshats to act out. But by the time the fully formed Joker started whining to a captive audience that ""Everybody is awful, and nobody's civil anymore,"" the only thing I could think was: Is that it?

"Nov 29, 2019"," There’s a scene in “Joker” when a theater full of tuxedoed socialites gather for a charity screening of Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times.” As the fat cats cackle, it’s striking to see one percenters appropriating and reveling in a Depression-era film that skewers the oppression wrought by industrialization at the expense of the working everyman, a film branded as liberal propaganda and communist-leaning in its day. It’s a brilliant juxtaposition. It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry, and the most impressive element of Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as the titular, iconic villain is that he manages to do both at the same time. “Joker” itself, on the other hand, often just wants to have it both ways. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) and is afflicted with not just “bad thoughts,” but also a neurological malady that triggers loud, spasmodic laughter during moments of stress. It’s an embarrassing condition, and Fleck’s public outbursts after usually laced with sobbing. Fleck is a literal amalgam of both Thalia and Melpomene, an intriguing interpretation that positions his internal tension as the source of Joker’s madness. Fleck’s affliction has pigeonholed him as a party clown, a job that periodically makes him a target of derision and even physical attack, and a job he loses due to his erratic behavior. Meanwhile, Fleck’s tortured psyche also parallels the plight of a growingly downtrodden society, where haves like billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) sanctimoniously placate and preside over the growing have-nots. “Joker” succeeds as a layered, even contemplative character study in the context of a comic book origin story. Phoenix gives his all to a performance that occasionally feels overdone, but mostly stays true to the film’s evolutionary intent. Director Todd Phillips deliberately renders the milieu—including some deep-seated mommy issues—that might give rise to a homicidal clown villain. It’s the proper perspective to consider anytime the film grasps for greater meaning. Indeed, the film’s missteps are threefold. First is a useless subplot involving Fleck’s affection for a young mother living down the hall (Zazie Beetz) that’s clumsily written, not believable, and utterly pointless. Second is its rank derivation. A filmmaker could do far worse than ape Martin Scorsese, but Phillips isn’t subtle about it. Fleck is Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin rolled into one. As in “Taxi Driver,” a coworker gives Fleck a fateful firearm, he points his misdirected ire towards a politician running for election, and his violent actions are misinterpreted and misappropriated by a gullible hoi polloi. Like in “The King of Comedy,” Fleck is obsessed with becoming a famous entertainer like his favorite Carson-esque late night talk show host, Murray Franklin, who is played by Robert De Niro, naturally. “Joker’s” politics is where matters become murkiest. Wayne calls those who celebrate Joker’s violent vigilantism “clowns,” thereby spawning a backlash, a not-so-distant echo of a pejorative used by another politician to brand foes during our last election. Indeed, the lemmings inspired to action by Joker’s example deify and place their misguided faith in a psychopath whose motives are purely self-obsessed and apolitical. On the other hand, the clumsiest analog occurs during a mass protest held by Joker-inspired acolytes, when protesters wearing clown masks hold up signs reading “Kill the Rich,” “Wayne = Fascism,” and “Resist.” Phillips tries to make some larger statements about our culture (including a swipe at the modern-day arbiters of comedy); his political metaphors are pointed and intentional, but they’re also scattershot and conflicting. The criticism that Phillips is celebrating, justifying, or inspiring the actions of a violent antihero are misplaced. Other than one act of self-defense, it’s patently clear that Fleck’s escalating actions are the bloody, inequitable reprisals of a budding narcissist. To borrow a line from the last Joker film, Fleck just wants to watch the world burn. He finally finds purpose by surrendering to his fate and becoming his manic embodiment of a depraved world gone literally mad. That’s just fine and dandy as the tale of how Joker was born. As for the rest of the muddled messaging, the joke’s on us.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2019","It's an incredibly heavy film. It's well done, but it's heavy and leaves the viewer feeling like they've just gone 10 rounds in a heavyweight boxing match. It's mentally exhausting and desperately dark.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 23, 2019"," This movie is rated “R.” It’s not something funny or quirky to enjoy with your family with its themes of abuse, madness and a ghastly, vicious society that erupts into violence at a moment’s notice. Its grim tone is pitch-dark, its title character pathetic, tortured and brimming with brutality. This isn’t a comic book anti-hero movie. It’s the story of a major meltdown of an individual and society itself. Phoenix, of course, is the titular character in 1980s Gotham City of a few decades back. He doesn’t become Joker until the last part of the film. When the movie opens, he’s a struggling clown and stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck, beaten down physically and mentally at nearly every turn. While he performs with a sale sign outside a store that is going out of business, passing kids steal the placard. When he tries to retrieve it, they beat him mercilessly and leave him in the garbage-strewn streets. He goes home to his mother (Frances Conroy, television’s “Six Feet Under”) in their crummy apartment. She sends letter after letter to Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen,) a wealthy man who is running for mayor. Arthur’s mother once worked for Wayne as a maid and thinks he will help her out. In the meantime, Arthur’s job as a clown takes a turn for the worse while he tries to sort out his mental anguish with a therapist and prescriptions. While class warfare wages on the streets – reminiscent of “The Purge” films – Arthur becomes more unstable. After loss upon loss, his mental turmoil builds to a disastrous crescendo. Phillips’ film is a nod to the earlier work of Martin Scorsese, with the “Taxi Driver” look of the environment and a homage to “The King of Comedy,” in which DeNiro played Rupert Pupkin, a character fixated on being a late-night talk show host. Phoenix’s performance is electrifying. I can think of no other actor who could give this interpretation of Joker the intensity it deserves. Every contortion of his face communicates as much, if not more, than a line of dialogue. It is an Oscar-worthy performance. The Parents Television Council warns parents: “Along with the Alamo Drafthouse, and several movie critics, we want to warn parents about the extremely violent content in the ‘Joker’ film that is being released nationwide this weekend. Despite its R-rating, parents may believe that this film is appropriate for kids given that it is an extension of the popular Batman franchise. ""Film critics have described the film’s horrific violence committed by the Joker and even criticized the timing of a film that asks viewers to sympathize with one man’s all-too-realistic decent into darkness,” PTC President Tim Winter said in a news release. “We applaud Alamo for its unprecedented warning to parents about not taking their children to see this film because of its ‘very, very rough language, brutal violence, and overall bad vibes.’ “With the Joker, Hollywood continues its war on kids by turning a comic book-themed franchise into violence-porn. Scientific research has concluded that media violence is among the top three contributing factors to societal violence. Our own research has found that violence in comic book-themed TV shows is increasing. “Hollywood cannot have it both ways – they cannot herald the entertainment they produce and distribute for its ability to change the world for good, while refuting the harmful impact it can have when the content is violent, sexually explicit, or profane.” The Parents Television Council is a non-partisan education organization advocating responsible entertainment. It was founded in 1995 to ensure that children are not constantly assaulted by sex, violence and profanity on television and in other media. The national grassroots organization has more than 1.4 million members, and works with television producers, broadcasters, networks and sponsors in an effort to stem the flow of harmful and negative messages targeted to children. The council also works with elected and appointed government officials to enforce broadcast decency standards. It produces research and publications documenting the increase in sex, violence and profanity in entertainment.

"Nov 21, 2019","Where did the Joker come from? What's up with the clown schtick? Is his mom named Martha? All these questions and more are answered definitively by director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, and it only takes two ponderous hours.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 21, 2019"," Whether you’re standing in the theater lobby or curled up in bed, deciding what to watch next is often the most difficult part of any pop-culture junkie’s day. And with dozens of films in theaters on any given weekend, plus virtually endless layers of streaming purgatory to sort through in search of your next binge-watch, there’s more out there—and tougher decisions to make—than ever. Fortune‘s here to help you navigate the week’s latest offerings, boiling all the entertainment out there down into three distinct recommendations: should you see it, stream it, or skip it? Find out below. Pain and Glory —which refracts Almodóvar’s childhood memories back across his illustrious career—is one of the director’s most personal ventures, a sort of “autofiction” that places Antonio Banderas in the role of an aging, ailing Spanish director. But it’s surprisingly one of his more accessible films, too, and a generous one in its articulation of living, dying, and the creative process that subsumes all in between.  The character, named Salvador Mallo, has more in common with Almodóvar than spiky hair and the earned solemnity of a reformed enfant terrible. Coming of age in a Catholic household, raised by a single mother (the elegant Penelope Cruz in flashbacks, and Julieta Serrano, wonderful in a lower-key way that’s just as captivating, in the present) and flushed with the nascent tingling of first desire, Mallo’s a thinly veiled stand-in, and the director finds ways to speak powerfully through him, even in scenes where Pain and Glory diverts from being a straightforward autobiography.  Occasionally, unfamiliar threads are introduced that invigorate its interweaving of past and present. The film gradually reveals itself to be a sensitive paean to a life lived, if not always wisely, at least authentically. Banderas’s performance is so towering, so finely shaded yet thrillingly unvarnished, that the film feels at many a moment ready to burst with all the raw feeling bottled up inside it. In the finale, it finally does, fireworks rippling against the night sky, bright and beautiful for as long as they may last, their light illuminating the dream of a child, eyes wide and mind newly ablaze, far below.  An Amblin haze backlights this wistful, melancholic little tale about kids growing up all in a hurry once uncovered treasure puts them, dangerously, at odds. Set along the Jersey Shore, it’s largely framed as the story of Peter (Jaeden Martell), a soft-spoken teen who tags along as his older brother’s friend group breaks into vacation houses, plundering valuables to bankroll long, lazy days along the boardwalk.  When Peter and his brother Alan (Keean Johnson) uncover what would seem to be the perfect score—gold coins forgotten beneath floorboards in a dead man’s home—they’re at first euphoric, in that headlong, innocent way that sees only the wealth and none of the potential consequence. But there’s Red (Alex Neustaedter), their mercurial and unpredictably violent best friend, who’d have fit in well alongside the gang in The Outsiders you weren’t supposed to root for, out to get his share of the gold. Writer-director Kevin McMullin, with a script strongly reminiscent of Stand By Me and designs on replicating its warm ’80s cinematography, keeps things small-scale, allowing the performances of his young leads to stand out. Martell, in particular, summons an emotional depth and earnest charisma that works well for the kind of wise-beyond-his-years leader he’s playing here, a slight variation on the typically meeker heroes he’s played in It and Midnight Special. But McMullin loses the thread as Low Tide flows gently into what should be its pulse-pounding, climactic moments, summoning none of the urgency and tension that a great coming-of-age story needs to stand out. At just 86 minutes, it’s a film that doesn’t overstay its welcome but never really announces itself either. How do you solve a problem like Joker? It’s become difficult to consider Todd Phillips’s self-serious supervillain origin story apart from the punishing discourse surrounding it, at the heart of which lies a disagreement about what our popular entertainment owes us, if anything.  Should movies take a moral stance on the political landscape into which they’re being released—more specifically, must they take a specific stance, lest their provocations be seen as aspirational, rather than merely artistic, and galvanize the wrong kind of people to violent action?  These are tricky, queasy questions to ask (though any answer should make clear that art doesn’t cause violence and never has). Joker, as it would happen, isn’t smart enough entertainment to even effectively pose its questions, much less answer them; what’s most remarkable about the film may just be that the conversation surrounding something so calculated and (despite appearances) commercial has grown so heated. After all, Joker isn’t really out to watch the world burn; it’ll settle for igniting the box office a few weekends over. A chaotic work that openly glorifies its nihilism without care for how doing so undercuts it thematically, Joker is more concerned with rising above its comic-book brethren, preaching the gospel of itself, than making any profound statement about class, mental health, inequality, and mob justice (all issues stuck in its crooked set of teeth). That wouldn’t be a problem, apart from that the film is itself as deluded as the clown at its center. Joker postures like a work of art, a high-minded drama with something to say, yet more often acts like a stupid popcorn pic that can’t keep its story straight (let alone its self-contradictory politics). Even worse, the film never once seems to think we can see through its artifice. Any incendiary tilt to its narrative is offset by a self-imposed and half-baked sense of weight. The fault would seem to lie with Phillips and co-scribe Scott Silver, both of whom seem far too enamored of their combustible, of-the-moment conceit, and perhaps scared stiff by it, to responsibly handle the material. Visceral though the film is its aesthetic resurrection of the pulpy ’70s and ’80s New York playground where Martin Scorsese staged Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (two films Joker cribs from liberally despite seemingly failing to sense the acerbic wit veined in both), Joker operates almost entirely at the surface level.  Joaquin Phoenix, at the eye of this storm, is the real reason to watch; his bravura performance is a feat of acting more forceful and frightening than any I’ve seen this year. All hunched shoulders and sunken-in chest, skin pale and seemingly stretched so thin across his face it resembles a Halloween mask, Phoenix doesn’t play the man who would be Joker so much as lock himself within the character’s emaciated frame and throw away the key.  What a shame, though, that his carnival tent-top of psychic pain is pitched upon such poisoned ground. There’s real ambition to Joker, but its vision isn’t just ugly (and if it was only that, it might be a better, or at least more interesting film). It’s also near fatally obtuse, so intent on being gritty, dark, provocative, and profound that it settles for the shallowest, least interesting version of all four. In this, it is exactly the equal of Phoenix’s villain: a nasty, masochistic piece of work possessed by the notion the world must heed its lone-wolf howl, even though it has nothing to say once given the platform.  —Will Adam Sandler finally get an Oscar nomination?—How Comedy Central grew up to hold its own against Netflix—Netflix bets its future on Stranger Things creators with new deal—Musicians and fans unite to keep facial recognition tech out of concerts—Building Judy Garland: How Renée Zellweger was transformed into the legendFollow Fortune on Flipboard to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

"Nov 21, 2019",Joaquin Phoenix who goes all in with another full-throttle performance full of intensity. It's not entertaining or wholly original in it's approach but it comes with a phenomenal performance.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 19, 2019"," In the canon of onscreen violence wrought by chillingly malevolent men, two scenes loom large: Malcolm McDowell’s macabre rendition of “Singing in the Rain” in A Clockwork Orange, and Christian Bale’s axe-swinging jive to Huey Lewis and the News in American Psycho. Both graft hallmarks of innocuous spectacle onto violent assault, and as their critics aver, obscure patent immorality with the seductive tempo of fun. Of all the images that stuck after the first trailer drop for Todd Phillips’s Joker, one was strikingly familiar: Joaquin Phoenix as proto-villain Arthur Fleck, grooving to a guitar solo in a turquoise shirt, yellow vest, and a rust red suit in lieu of the usual purple, his vertiginous stage a cascading staircase on an empty city street. Joker is filled with these balletic bursts: after his first, pivotal kill, Fleck preens mesmerically in the flickering fluorescence of a grimy bathroom, framed by cinematographer Lawrence Sher in lambent greens and reds; before a big night out, he dances in his underwear while dyeing his hair that toxic, seminal green, like a teen girl mid-makeover sequence. His solo choreography might loosely bookend violence, but never actually coincides with it—a fact which has yet to deter some of the moral hand-wringing. But the derivative patina of a Sinatra-backed slo-mo reveals one of the film’s main failings: in aping the ambition and prestige of its motley influences, it winds up with a bungled understanding of its own relation to violence. The missteps begin at inception. Where prior incarnations of the Joker have confined his characterization as  Batman’s foil, Phillips’s is the first film adaptation to detail, in protracted, psychorealist devotion, the Joker’s backstory, mostly absent Bruce Wayne. In a ’70s New York–inflected Gotham of neon-flecked grime, this Joker is reanimated as Fleck, a middle-aged white man who lives with his mother and works sporadic rent-a-clown gigs. He suffers from a neurological condition that prompts convulsive bouts of laughter, caused by a brain injury from childhood abuse. Every week, he sees a state-funded psychiatrist in her cramped office, amassing RX bottles and Travis Bickle–haunted diary entries that double as joke rehearsals. He is subjected to constant violence: beat up by a group of listless brown kids in an alleyway, then a trio of drunk white yuppies on the subway; sucker-punched by a rich white man in a gilded bathroom. In Heath Ledger’s Joker of apocryphal motive and origin, there is an echo of Alan Moore’s canonical Joker monologue from The Killing Joke, largely taken to be the character’s apotheosis: “All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy,” goes the climactic axiom, “That’s how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.” That catalyst for apocalypse is singular, but Phoenix’s Fleck has only ever had bad days, the dark accrual of trauma after trauma in a life now teeming with it. Some of Fleck’s characterization is initially compelling, but eventually struggles under its comic-franchise aegis. In the confines of a generic origin story, the tense is always future anterior: by the time of whatever plot machination, the character will have become X, will have done Y. Even the modulations that emerge in every new version of the character have a teleological drag. There is, however, the specific physicality of each new actor’s performance, and here, the way Phoenix’s body is used as a dichotomous site of revulsion and easy spectacle. The concern that Fleck’s pathologization would invite too much sympathy is, from the first shot, countervailed by the framing of Phoenix’s body as grotesque, often arced in shapes that seem to defy the very build of his skeleton, back and shoulders pocked by shadows that mark strange concavities.  A palpable air of pure exertion pervades everything from Phoenix’s well-publicized weight-plummet to his near-asphyxiating contrivances of laughter: the body collapsed into its emaciated self, straining against its bare physiology. It’s a whole performance that stakes itself on corporeal self-defiance, a spectacle that repels as it enthralls. Unlike the abstract desires of previous Jokers, circumscribed by their role as nemesis or diffused by their anarcho-nihilism, Fleck, at least initially, wants some reasonable things: not to be ostracized for his mental illness; not to be senselessly pummeled by strangers; to access his medication; not to work a shitty job for a pittance; not to live in a dysfunctional building with his mother, whose own delusions have disfigured his entire sense of self. Maybe the only desire beyond the minimal exigencies of dignified survival is Fleck’s crush on his beautiful neighbor (Zazie Beetz), a fantasy subplot so minor and anodyne it could be excised entirely (he wants kindness, affection—that, we already know). In Phillips’s construction, Fleck is less interesting as a character than a cipher for social malaise; the structural causes of his personal ills are glossed but never probed. Trash-strewn and super-rat infested, the image of Gotham’s collapsing infrastructure is an anachronistic bricolage of the urban crises that beset New York across the late ’60s and ’80s: the 1968 garbage collector strike; the clampdowns on postwar social welfare systems across the ’70s; the racist subway vigilante of ’84. Halfway through Joker, Fleck’s shrink tells him that the city has cut her funding, and leaves his medication to fate.  Newspaper headlines lambast the wealthy: “GROUNDSWELL OF ANTI-RICH SENTIMENT”; “KILL THE RICH.” On the night of his final gig as a rental clown, Fleck makes citywide headlines for a violent altercation on the subway, but only as an anonymous, clown-faced vigilante, an image soon co-opted by Gotham’s denizens for sundry causes. Fleck spends most of the film impervious to the revolutionary rhetoric ascribed to him—the legend of the clown circulates with a life of its own, and even when it returns to him, he dissociates from its symbolic import entirely. After Fleck is invited on air by talk-show host, Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro (in an oblique throwback to his turn as wannabe star comic in Scorsese’s The King of Comedy), he’s asked if the clown makeup donned for the night is an expression of political dissent, but Fleck demurs: “I don’t believe in that. I don’t believe in anything.” Even after he divulges his identity as the clown-faced vigilante, he stresses to an increasingly incensed studio audience that he is not political, and the subsequent boos suggest they’d be more forgiving if he actually was. At a protest outside a billionaire’s soirée, someone brandishes the sign “WE ARE ALL CLOWNS”, which briefly rings parodic but speaks to the easy recuperation of popular iconography for ideologically disparate ends. Joker doesn’t understand its representation of violence because it doesn’t know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy à la V for Vendetta, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets. Somewhere, in the back of a police car, a post-Fleck Joker admires the burning vista of his gonzo orchestrations. It’s a dehistoricized rendering of protest that flattens the varied and complex history of public demonstration into photogenic rioting (though you’d be remiss to expect more from this film), and in so doing reiterates a useful point: anyone can single out an image or an object, charge it with a volt of personal animus, and resuscitate it as something else. Appropriation can be a consolatory response to structural frustrations, though there remains an obvious, mutual causality: that a mass shooter might appropriate this particular Joker for their own racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, ethno-nationalist aims indicts a world that has set the stage for their vitriol, as much as it does any individual film’s “responsible” representation. The problem here might be better framed as one of media literacy. At The New York Times, Dan Brooks identifies a reductive misreading attributed, ironically, to a certain critical class. “Ostensibly too sophisticated for superhero stories, our critics have accepted the Joker’s power to corrupt the masses in real life, on a more literal level than the most addled comic-book fan ever would.” The moral concern for those susceptible masses who are bad at reading is so pervasive as to be moot: everyone is prone to decontextualizing, and co-opting cultural objects, just as Joker does, self-seriously gleaning those weightier themes from early Scorsese with only a vague sense of how to repurpose them. Towards the end, Phillips even indulges a moment of self-congratulating medium-reflexivity, with a shot of a dozen security screens, each displaying footage of prior violence, in yet another echo of shots that already happened in the ’70s. Maybe the film would’ve felt surer had it found another shape for all its references (something more playful?), one that wasn’t also cramped by the übermensch fantasies of the franchise enclosing it.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 16, 2019"," A recurring criticism that’s been levelled against the new film “Joker” is the perceived emptiness of its ideals. The film seems to engage, or attempts to engage, with politics, mental health and our obsession with fame and power. But for many its engagement is more superficial than anything. So hollow is its engagement that – for many – the film comes across as empty posturing, leaving us with the spectre of a dancing Joaquin Phoenix, gyrating in distress. But what if that unwillingness to interrogate is not a narrative limitation but part of the film’s aesthetic intention? What if the perception of “Joker” and its emptiness as lazy avoidance of engaging with its themes is actually part of the film’s own aesthetic and narrative identity? What if the hollowness that “Joker” evokes is exactly in keeping with how this tale of bloodshed and chaos is meant to land? “Joker” is billed as a psychological thriller but is perhaps best described as a kind of schematic character study of its protagonist. Arthur Fleck is a party clown who lives in dismal Gotham City in 1981. Arthur has a neurological disorder that comes with a handy explanatory card – ‘Forgive my laughter, I have a condition’. He lives an isolated life with his mother and they share a rapport that seems companionable on the surface but is clearly tense. His life is marked by absence more than presence – little human connection, few emotional or creative outlets, and little to strive for. In an early scene, he imagines himself making an appearance on late-night talk-show host Murray Franklin’s show. It’s the happiest we’ll see him for much of the film. Even his moments of vague happiness are all projections. Director Todd Phillips, who has co-written the script with Scott Silver, intimates this from the first scene where we watch Arthur before a mirror hooking his finger in the corner of his mouth, feigning a smile and then a grimace. As if trying them on for size. Even his emotions come from a space of affectation than true earnestness. We later see Arthur, in clown-costuming, aimlessly twirling a sign for a store that’s going out of business – “Everything must go,” it declares. Arthur is soon intercepted by a group of teenagers of colour, who steal his sign and then pummels him. The image of the hapless Arthur in despair is mirrored 30 minutes later when a trio of white men threaten to pummel him, but by this point in the film – a scene that’s been part of “Joker’s” ad-campaign – Arthur has had enough and has turned his back on society. Decked out in full clown-makeup, he murders them. It’s the critical action that marks the Joker’s origin, and it’s the critical action that sends an already restless Gotham into political chaos as the lines between the haves and the have-nots (casually called “jokers” by Thomas Wayne, a mayoral candidate). Phillips does not reveal a clear political ideology in representing the political uprising at work here. The film nods to the complicity of the rich in the degradation of the city, but the city’s perspective of the poor and isolated is not particularly warm. With a few exceptions, the world of Gotham is one of nihilistic darkness and empty sadness. Arthur attempts to entertain a child on a crowded bus and his mother snaps at him. The action is mirrored later on when he tries to entertain a rich child on his lawn, this time it’s the butler who snaps at him. Rich or poor, the people of Gotham are exhausted and on-edge. And Arthur is isolated from both halves – resentful of the richness of the upper-class but also the dismissiveness of his economic peers. His life is almost aggressively marked by absence of anything to the point that the film, which follows him for all of its runtime seems peculiarly unaware of who exactly he is. The film owes a great deal to Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur. Phoenix uses his body as a weapon, even before the transformation into the Joker. Arthur carries himself with an unrelenting tension that is released in moments where his body seems both terrifying and pathetic. And although Phillips and Silver sometimes appear too reticent in moments where the screenplay holds back, Lawrence Sher’s cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score are reliable pillars. The film looks like a realistic tale, except Sher suggests early on that something just isn’t quite right here, so the film’s grainy darkness and odd mix of colour key us into moments of unease. Guðnadóttir’s music, chilling or atonal or absurd depending on the scene, offers us a perspective into Arthur’s headspace that the film does not always seem willing to. I’ve been mulling on Arthur’s central unknowability since I saw the film. Phillips brings us uncomfortably close to Arthur in all his peculiarities, but even at the film’s end it’s hard to discern just who exactly this man is. There’s no satisfying coda that explicates his most nuanced desires, even the journal he carries around with him doesn’t do much in the way of solving. The journal is part of his court-mandated therapy but he uses it as a joke book. “I hope my death makes more cents than my life,” he has scribbled inside. It’s hardly riveting comedy, but it seems like a key. Arthur is, by all indications, a nobody – he travels through life unseen. In a morbidly funny moment, he walks into a glass door that he thinks should automatically open. It turns out the door was an exit, not an entrance but the idea holds strong. No one really sees him. Or that’s what he thinks. In an early scene, Arthur makes a second visit to his court-appointed therapist. She, distracted, has some bad news to tell him and isn’t quite keyed in to his own rambling monologue. The programme has been cut because of budgetary reasons and both the therapy, and the medication he needs, will be ended. Empathetic, but also realist, she attempts to give him some harsh truths: “They don’t give a shit about people like you Arthur. And they don’t give a shit about people like me either.” It’s an essential line in the film’s ideology. Here she’s rejecting Arthur’s loner stance and drawing a clear line of solidarity between him and those around him. It’s crucial that this therapist is a black woman. She may be in the chair of authority in this room but she recognises that Gotham sees her as incidental as much as they see isolated Arthur as the same. But by this point in the film, Arthur is too far gone. He can’t hear her. Or won’t hear her. He can only see his own pain, his own struggle. But discerning audiences would recognise that Arthur isn’t the only one suffering. It’s that idea—a film to represent those loner men who think they alone are suffering—that has seen the film come under scrutiny and criticism as an unnecessary ode to incels. But the incel moniker seems ill-fitted for “Joker”, a film that rejects carnality and erotic desire. The incel portmanteau (“involuntarily celibate”), used since the nineties, came to public notice a recently coinciding with a series of mass murders by men who blame women for their lack of sex. But the hullabaloo over Joker’s place as material ripe for alt-right incel solidarity seems incredibly misplaced. If there’s anything truly surprising about “Joker” it’s the way that it eschews romantic interest as a spring-board for violence. It says something that in this nihilistic world of Gotham, where everyone seems unhappy, the four characters that offer anything resembling warmth are three women of colour, and a little person. The one given most focus is Zazie Beetz, offering a tender turn as Arthur’s neighbour, and the object of his affection. But the quasi-romantic arc of the film is more perfunctory than earnest. It represents a necessary arc in proving Arthur’s own mental unreliability but neither Philips nor Silver is that invested in romance as a springboard of pain. Arthur’s interest in romance is transient; what he really wants is attention. From his mother, from Thomas Wayne, from his idol Murray Franklin. Although the film hems and haws about whether his desire is legitimate, the deluge of obfuscation the film uses does not hide Arthur’s clearly-coded hypocrisy. Arthur insists that he is alone, but he isn’t really. Late in the film, when he’s asked whether his ideology is political, he insists it’s not; the groundswell of support for him is accidental, if anything. But Arthur’s own rejection of community seems the film’s central indictment of him. Phillips is fascinated by him – his increasingly malevolent antics, his disregard for social norms but by the time the film’s bloody end, with a final murder that’s suggested rather than explicated, the fascination seems more perverse than in earnest. If Arthur’s Joker is the end result of a life of trauma the film is cautious enough to suggest that it’s not the only way. There’s no sense of satisfaction to cap this off, instead the hollow emptiness that comes with the coda makes sense in context. This is the life of an empty man and the films aesthetic aggressively mirrors his psychosis. If you feel empty at the film’s end, it’s because you’ve gotten a window into Arthur’s own emptiness.",POSITIVE
"Nov 15, 2019"," Melodrama was an ultra-popular entertainment form of the Gilded Age. It seems fitting, then, that in 2019, we have returned to the genre in Joker. By now there are a thousand different takes on Joker — I’ve read dozens, capping it off with “A Lacanian Reading of Joker,” which seemed like a good time to quit. Such a wealth of varied responses indicate that this film is the Rorschach test of our day. But that’s a good thing. That means, love it or hate it, we have an interesting and relevant film on our hands for once that compels people to head to the theater, see it, and offer a public reaction. What I haven’t seen discussed yet is Joker’s heavy emphasis on its chosen narrative genre, which, for most of the film’s running time, isn’t “comic book movie” at all but melodrama. Joker, born Arthur Fleck, is an endlessly abused victim of cruel familial and societal tyrannies whose suffering is finally recognized by the community that, in the end, celebrates him. This is a model melodramatic plot that would’ve been familiar to audiences as far back as silent cinema. Here, it’s made bleakly ironic because of the chaotic, violent means of its hero achieving recognition in the end. Fleck becomes Joker by refusing to play the part of melodrama’s innocent victim, who almost always upholds society’s professed values and is egregiously punished for it. It’s a good move on Fleck’s part, since the innocent victim often dies and is wept over by people who only learn to appreciate them posthumously. In Joker, the title character repeatedly wonders what kind of story he’s caught in. The film opens with Arthur Fleck, in full clown makeup, using his fingers to push the corners of his mouth up to resemble the comedy mask and down to resemble the tragedy mask. Later, he says, at a crucial turning point of violence that changes him from Arthur to Joker, “I thought my life was a tragedy. But now I know it’s a comedy.” Problem is, if it’s a comedy, no one’s laughing, not the audiences within or outside the film, if you rule out the nervous giggling at some screenings. Arthur/Joker as would-be stand-up comic tells “jokes” no one recognizes as jokes, and his last line acknowledges that he’s redefined the form for himself by thinking up an entirely private “joke” and then saying in menacing tones, both to his therapist in Arkham Asylum and to us in close-up, “You wouldn’t get it.” The character’s creation back in 1940, and his alarming relationship to jokes, smiles, and laughs, were in part inspired by a 1928 silent film melodrama, The Man Who Laughs. Based on a Victor Hugo novel, it’s the story of one of King James II’s political enemies whose child is disfigured in punishment, his upper lip cut off to create a hideous permanent “smile” that condemns him to an adult life of displaying himself as a traveling carnival “freak.” He remains virtuous and saintly in spite of all ill-usage as he tries to win the love of a true-hearted and conveniently blind young woman. At the end of Joker, when he’s set off a revolution in the streets, he’ll repeat the Lillian Gish “smile,” his lips red with a mixture of clown paint and blood. But before he’s transformed fully into the title character who now gets the joke of trying to behave sanely in an insanely rigged society, Arthur Fleck begins the film as a slum waif, too. He’s been taught by his mother to “smile” regardless of his feelings, and of course his terrible laugh, a joyless, hacking, cawing bray supposedly caused by a “neurological condition,” is the darker manifestation of his false, involuntary expressions of happiness. His mother tells him he was born to “bring laughter and joy” to the world, and his ugly environment is emblazoned with signs saying things like, “DON’T FORGET TO SMILE,” which, in a moment of rage, he changes by inking over “FORGET TO” and creating a new sign that says, “DON’T SMILE.” He’s the struggling victim of the world’s brutality whose suffering goes unrecognized, making him seem “invisible,” as Arthur puts it. “I hope my death makes more cents than my life,” he’s written plaintively in his journal, showing he intuits the class-based horror of his world. In melodrama, the community will finally recognize the victim’s suffering and virtue — and champion them in a sudden reversal at the end. Melodramas achieve their huge emotional effects through these reversals, their narrative structures like a fever chart of soaring highs and gut-punch lows, victory snatched from defeat, great moments of joy and triumph turning into total humiliation and despair. A good example of this in Joker is when Arthur sees his filmed routine from a local stand-up club being aired on his favorite TV show, seemingly celebrated by the comedian he reveres as a kind of father figure, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, playing out a skewed continuation of his Rupert Pupkin character in Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy). It’s a dream come true until, at the moment of peak elation, Arthur realizes his failed routine is being mocked for cruel audience laughs. Arthur’s physical suffering in the form of his spasmodic laugh is augmented by actor Joaquin Phoenix’s emaciated frame and ability to contort his body in painful-looking ways. It makes Arthur the grotesque equivalent of melodrama’s typical blind girl or deaf mute or pathetically limping Tiny Tim, that much more poignant and set apart as a martyr for capitalistic cruelties and the cosmic sins of an immoral world. The sheer abjection of Arthur’s situation in life is stressed to the point that Charles Dickens, master of melodrama, would’ve tipped his hat admiringly. Arthur works as a low-rent clown, the saddest clown in the world, and takes care of his pathetic invalid mother at home. Then there’s the sickening urban poverty, the terrible living and working conditions, the rogues’ gallery of exploiters of misery that emerge from such conditions, the atmosphere of diseased greenish and bluish miasmic light in slum dwellings where a mad repetition of abuse is heaped upon Arthur — not just one but two public beatings by multiple assailants that get him down on the ground so he can be kicked into total submission. But it’s the backstory of Arthur/Joker’s life, in all its lurid plot reveals, that takes the purest form of melodrama. Initially, Arthur believes he and his ailing mother, Penny Fleck, are merely the unlucky poor, and Penny’s pitiful unanswered letters to her former employer, the wealthy mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (father of Bruce Wayne/Batman) are deluded because the rich never help the poor. That’s melodramatic enough in its built-in class critique, a big part of the popularity of melodrama, which has one foot in social realism and one foot in the epic, the excessive, the fantastical. Then — spoiler alert — Penny tells Arthur he is actually the son of Thomas Wayne, who couldn’t marry her because of his lofty social position, which is why she had to leave Wayne’s employ. Holy plot contrivance, Batman! This would mean Penny Fleck is the “ruined servant girl” of a thousand melodramatic plays, novels, and films, impregnated and cast away by a heartless man of wealth, practically driven “out, out into the storm” like Lillian Gish (again) in D. W. Griffith’s Way Down East (1915). And Arthur Fleck would be the son of wealth and privilege, abandoned to his fate in the streets unless he can be recognized and recovered, like Oliver Twist in the Dickens novel. And Arthur and Bruce Wayne are half brothers, one legitimate, one illegitimate, as in untold numbers of melodramatic plots about secret, shamefully hidden family relationships that come to light in emotionally over-the-top confrontations. Arthur stages a very typical one in the men’s room of the fabulous gilt-edged theater where he confronts Thomas Wayne with Wayne’s supposedly guilty secret. There’s a screening of Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times going on, which is attended by about five hundred wealthy men, all in tuxedoes. Arthur sneaks in wearing an old-time theater usher’s uniform, which might as well have “Little Man of the Working Class” stitched on it, and he stands for a moment in the middle aisle surrounded by tuxedoes, watching the movie. A shot from behind frames and illuminates him against the screen so he becomes one with Chaplin’s famous “Little Tramp,” who’s always struggling and failing to keep a job and a place in the heartless modern world that inevitably casts him out in the end. Chaplin’s comedy doesn’t age well for many contemporary viewers because his worldview was fundamentally melodramatic, as Dickensian as his own life had been as an impoverished London child orphaned young. His comedies are loaded with poor but beautiful girls of extreme virtue, sometimes blind, and pitiful mothers and grandmothers struggling to make ends meet, threatened by the landlord if they can’t make the mortgage, plus abandoned children and heart-tugging stray dogs. They’re all championed by the down-and-out but always game Little Tramp. He’s constantly set upon by the cruel forces of the ruling class, represented by vicious bosses and sadistic cops, almost always huge goons who tower over him. When not wringing tears out of this material, Chaplin got a lot of very funny comedy out of it. As traumatic as it is to live the plot of an old-fashioned melodrama, Arthur suffers more from discovering that the story his mother’s tale doesn’t actually conform to one after all. He learns she was both abused and a mentally ill abuser herself, resulting in his “neurological condition” of spontaneous laughter. With the exploding of his mother’s melodramatic tale, Arthur begins his violent exit from the role of doomed innocent and starts exacting bloody revenge. Inadvertently, he inspires his suffering fellow citizens to rise up in protest against their wealthy oppressors and give them “what you deserve.” An ugly but fully justified class war results from the actions of a deranged man who doesn’t consciously understand it, though he finds the angry chaos “beautiful” after his long acquiescence to brutality. The ending of the film has been frequently noted as its weakest part, which seems erratic and muddled. It’s possible that Phillips, who claims not to have wanted to clear up the “ambiguous” ending, wasn’t quite sure what kind of narrative he was heading into once he left key aspects of melodrama behind. It’s a form with a proud history, cohering in the eighteenth century when philosophers, writers, composers, and artists were grappling with radical new ideas that ultimately fostered the American and French revolutions, and centered on the cosmic significance of the ordinary citizen caught in familial and social traps. The extreme popularity of the form, especially in novels and plays, was taken up in early cinema, though starting in the 1930s it began to be rapidly devalued as it became associated with women writers, stars, and audiences. In the 1970s and ’80s Marxist and feminist film theorists began a reevaluation of the importance of melodrama in terms of its social criticism, especially in terms of class, gender, and race. But an endless stream of soap operas and hack plotting in movies and television have associated “melodrama” with “failed drama” in the public mind, and its more radical possibilities have been left unexplored in our era. At least Phillips indicates in this film that he recognizes those possibilities, and that’s promising. A return to melodrama seems fitting at this time. It was, after all, an ultra-popular entertainment of the Gilded Age. Cinema itself arises at the end of this era and develops fully as the Gilded Age overlaps and partially gives way to the Progressive Era, when reformers attacked government corruption and finally began to enact policies aimed at ameliorating the gruesome social ills of class society. Looking at Joker for a kind of microcosmic version of melodrama giving way in the end to something better, however inchoate, is absolute wishful thinking. But like I said before — it’s the perfect Rorschach inkblot.",POSITIVE
"Nov 15, 2019"," Todd Phillips' supervillain origin tale ""Joker"" makes for a thin, grim, dystopian horror story buoyed by a perfectly pitched performance from an insanely skeletal Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. A medical condition creates Arthur's hideous, maniacal cackle, a forced, nonstop laugh bleeding with sorrow, a survival mechanism that kicks in when Arthur feels nervous. For two hours, Phoenix cackles his way through a bizarre and frightening metamorphosis from a crushed, innocent soul into a raging, demented agent of chaos, finally emerging as Batman's future ultimate nemesis, a deranged do-badder all dressed up (in clown makeup) with no place to go at the end. In 1981, Gotham City mirrors a period Times Square with grimy, gritty streets lined with garbage bags, porn theaters and rundown buildings gilded in graffiti. In this supremely squalid set design metaphor, Arthur works as a clown, but he aspires to be a stand-up comic. Arthur's weak grip on reality disintegrates when three white Wall Street-type bullies on the subway target him, unaware that a clown colleague has given him a gun. He uses it. Newspaper headlines scream of a new vigilante, ""Kill the Rich: A New Movement?"" That sets in motion a class war between the have-nots - dressed in militant clown garb - and the callous ruling wealthy elite. The ensuing riots make for lots of stylish action, but are actually less interesting than the conflict building within Arthur as he succumbs to nihilistic murderous rage. Phoenix supercharges this Martin Scorsese-lite polemic with a bombastic, electrifying portrayal of unyielding sympathy for Arthur, whose desperation to connect with others descends into despair. On the elevator, Arthur finds a kindred spirit in a single mom named Sophie (Zazie Beetz), after she puts her fingers to her head like a gun. He responds with the same gesture (recalling Travis Bickle from Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"") and that becomes a morbid motif for ""Joker."" Arthur lives with his aging, nutty mother (Frances Conroy) in a dingy apartment where they watch a black-and white TV, mostly to see ""Live with Murray Franklin,"" a Johnny Carson ""Tonight Show"" knock-off. Robert De Niro has twisted fun playing Franklin, a TV personality like the Jerry Lewis character in Scorsese's ""King of Comedy."" (In that movie, De Niro plays a mentally ill comedian, a role somewhat mirrored by Arthur in this one.) Wayne wants to become mayor for the citizens who matter: the wealthy, the people who can sit through Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" without seeing any connection between the desperate financial conditions of the Great Depression and the current state of affairs. In my review of the horror tale ""Ma,"" I wrote that a society creates its own monsters through bullying. Through rejection. Through insensitivity and dehumanization.",POSITIVE

"Nov 10, 2019"," To its credit, Todd Phillip’s Joker is exactly what it sets out to be: a dark, disturbing portrait of a dejected, lonely man sliding quickly into a moral and psychological abyss. For two hours we watch as Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose fragile mental state is physically embodied in his frighteningly skeletal frame and hollow eyes, comes apart and re-emerges as a new variant of the notorious comic book villain the Joker. The film’s connection to the DC Universe is tenuous at best, with a few characters providing a thin connective tissue between the film’s events and the familiar narrative of how Bruce Wayne, the son of slain billionaire parents, becomes the vigilante superhero known as Batman. The film has been described as a stand-alone project, which is underscored by the fact that it could literally stand on its own without any connection to the Batman universe and be roughly the same film.  Phillips, cinematographer Lawrence Sher (who has shot all of Phillip’s films since The Hangover Part II in 2011), and production designer Mark Friedberg (a veteran collaborator of Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch) work hard to evoke the grit and grime and despondency of late ’70s urban squalor, making it even worse by setting the film during a garbage strike. Not since Maniac (1980) has a film felt quite so grim and grimy, although the obvious model is not William Lustig’s gory slasher film, but rather Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976), which similarly follows the mental fallout of a damaged man pushed by his environment to a murderous rage that he misunderstands as some kind of divine justice. However, whereas Scorsese’s film (scripted by Paul Schrader) has a clear sense of narrative and thematic purpose that links the protagonist’s mental collapse into violence with the morally bankrupt culture that is constantly threatening to swallow him (best exemplified in all the manhole covers belching hellish steam to the rumbling strains of the late Bernard Herrmann’s penultimate score), Phillip’s Joker feels mostly unmoored, running through a stock list of injustices both personal and social that finally shove Fleck over the edge and turn him into a one-man insane clown posse.  It doesn’t help that he is already so thoroughly damaged, depicted unflinchingly in the film’s opening scene in which he sits before a mirror applying clown makeup (his job is standing on crowded street corners holding a department store’s liquidation sale sign) and trying to force his sad-sack face into a smile by jamming his fingers into the corners of his mouth. We learn early on that he suffers from a mental condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter at inopportune times, particularly when he feels stressed or embarrassed. He lives in a shabby apartment with his elderly mother (Frances Conroy), who is clearly suffering from her own mental illness. Together they watch a Johnny Carson-esque late-night television host named Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, playing the Jerry Lewis role from Scorsese’s The King of Comedy to Fleck’s Rupert Pupkin), who Fleck imagines will one day call him down from the audience and give him his dream shot (he longs to be a comedian even though he has no real sense of how humor works).  Fleck finds a possible source of redemption via his relationship with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a pretty single mother who lives down the hall. The idea that Sophie, who is clearly struggling in life but nonetheless appears to be well grounded in reality, would have anything to do with someone like Fleck is one of the film’s biggest narrative stretches, and a later revelation about the true nature of their connection is less shocking than it is simply facile. Phillips and co-screenwriter Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter) endeavor to muddy the divide between Fleck’s inner world and his exterior reality, but they do so inconsistently, as opposed to a film like Lodge Kerrigan’s Clean, Shaven (1994), which takes us into a schizophrenic mind for 80 minutes and doesn’t let go. Kerrigan’s film stays true to its convictions, whereas Joker uses troubled subjectivity as a cheat, rather than for insight. One cannot fault Joaquin Phoenix’s central performance; he goes all in in every way imaginable, but doesn’t oversell it, which is always a danger. Of course, we’ve seen Phoenix play disturbed and psychotic so many times now that his turn here feels more like a variation of his previous work, rather than something new and troubling (he is good, but nothing in the film equals that moment in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master when he’s hurling himself repeatedly against the wall of a jail cell in perfect contrast to Philip Seymour Hoffman’s utterly calm figure in the cell next to him). Phoenix is also working, of course, in hotly contested terrain since Heath Ledger played what many viewed and continue to view as the definitive Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008), a character whose refusal to commit to any particular backstory provides an intriguing contrast to Phoenix’s Joker, who is all backstory.  We get a glimpse of the deranged criminal mastermind to come in the film’s chaotic final moments, but for the most part it is Fleck suffering, suffering more, and suffering some more, both mentally and physically. He draws violent bullies to him like moths to a flame (perhaps they smell his weakness), and when he finally lashes out at a pair of yuppie jerks on the subway who look like Eric and Donald Trump Jr. clones, we aren’t sure if we’re supposed to applaud or feel terrified. That is a good thing, since it gives the film a jolt of ambiguity that it desperately needs, albeit one that fades away as the film moves toward its inevitable conclusion. The eventual meeting of Fleck and his television idol Murray Franklin has a strangely forced quality, not so much because it is meant to evoke both Scorsese’s superior earlier film, as well as Phoenix’s own bizarre yearlong performance art stunt a decade ago whose most famous moment found him in the world’s most awkward interview with David Letterman, but because it doesn’t offer any possibilities other than the violence that ensues.  Part of Joker’s problem is that it is over before it begins because there is no other possible outcome than what we eventually arrive at, and Phillips and Silver don’t give us an interesting enough trajectory to make up for that loss (random attempts at physical humor, such as having Fleck walk into a glass door after asserting himself, don’t really help). Instead, they try to purposefully confuse things by oscillating between the grim and the ironic; at some points they want us to just see the world as a dour hellhole of isolation devoid of any sense of hope, and at other times (such as when Fleck, well on his way to becoming the Joker, dances in slow motion down a large set of stairs to Gary Glitter’s anthemic “Rock and Roll Part 2”) they want us to see it all as sick irony or maybe a perverse celebration of the loner’s revenge. The fact that Fleck’s rebirth as Joker is partially enabled by a mass antifa-like protest inspired by his own retributive violence conflates individual sickness with social and economic unrest in ways that are emotionally engaging, but ultimately empty of real meaning.  One of Joker’s other major touchstones is Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s disturbing 1988 graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, which similarly traced a possible backstory for the Joker. However, that novel worked not so much because of its depiction of how the Joker became the Joker (which ended up greatly influencing Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman), but because it had the audacity to suggest in no certain terms that the Joker and Batman are two sides of the same coin, sharing an insanity that collapses in on itself in the haunting final panels. In Joker, all the insanity is front loaded on Fleck and has nowhere to go but down. One cannot argue that this is not a bold and fundamentally transgressive studio film, and its best joke may very well be that it successfully convinced a mass audience to lock itself down for two hours with a madman. But one cannot help but wish that they had pushed it even further and invested it with real substance, rather than a lot of grim posturing.

"Oct 28, 2019"," You need a certain grasp on mental illness if you're going to make a movie about the subject, even one aiming to tell the story of how one of the most iconic comic book villains became the formidable evildoer he is today. Before considering all the other ways it comes up short, ""Joker,"" our sorta grim, sorta moody, thoroughly self-satisfied current box office champ, fails at this most basic of levels. It's never able to go beneath the clown makeup to let us feel the all-consuming rage inside. There's a rigidly choreographed inevitability to the mayhem, and that's a betrayal of what makes this impish psychopath tick. So how does Todd Phillips, the prolific studio hand behind such enduring bro epics as ""Old School,"" ""War Dogs"" and the ""Hangover"" trilogy, convey aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck's descent into murder-driven insanity? By positing the budding evildoer as the victim of bullying and class warfare. As the current parlance goes, that's a choice, one that's turned the Warner Bros. release into a lightning rod for ubiquitous social media flareups. It plays like a Rorschach test for where you stand on issues like incel violence, social inequality and the mass media's stronghold on the cultural conversation. How you feel about '80s nostalgia also factors into how you will react to this skin deep origin story. The year is 1981, as Phillips' keeps reminding viewers at every turn, beginning with the nifty logo Warner Bros. used at the time. The setting is Gotham City, though the movie does little to hide that this is a slightly fictionalized variation on Ed Koch's New York. Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix, reaching into his tic-driven bag of tricks) barely makes ends meet as a clown-for-hire. There he is, sporting a lime green clown wig as he races after a bunch of hooligans who took off with his ad sign. Cue the ass kicking and the glimpse of the ne'er-do-well writhing in pain in a back alley. Exposition comes soon after, in the form of meetings with a social worker who berates Fleck for not writing on his journal, then is confounded when he shows the notebook filled with (not very good) jokes and nondescript sketches meant to denote antisocial behavior. As if that needed spelling out. The situation at the apartment he shares with his mom Penny is just as depressing. Penny (""Six Feet Under's"" Frances Conroy, returning to the DC Universe after playing Halle Berry's mentor in ""Catwoman""), ill and bedridden, whiles away the hours watching Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), a Johnny Carsonesque late night TV host, and begging her son to contact the employer, moneyed philanthropist Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen, giving a thuggish spin to Bruce's dad). Nothing about the mother-son interaction suggests a shared past with either character, not even after it's revealed both have loony bin stints in common. Ah, but Fleck has dreams, big dreams, of rising above this urban purgatory to be Murray's guest. Then he'll be on his way. He'll make them all see the comic genius behind the creepy demeanor and involuntary laughing fits. Unbeknownst to him this is where his heretofore unexplored capacity for grisly acts of violence will come into play. How do we know he's succumbing to the darkness within. He does this trancelike dance I like to call bathroom tai chi. ""Joker's"" premise is actually pretty intriguing, once you set aside any qualms you might have about revealing the background of a character who derives much of his strength from the aura of mystery that surrounds him. Joker as a bottom feeder with daddy issues who just wants to make what is arguably the country's toughest audience laugh? It sounds, at least on paper, like a nifty DC Elseworlds one-shot comic aimed at older (notice I did not say mature) readers. But instead of mining the setting for texture and an enveloping sense of dread and unease, Phillips is all too content playing Scorsese cosplay, with a dollop of Paddy Chayefsky thrown in for good measure. This Joker's Gotham is all window dressing. Smoke and mirrors. Even the obstacles Fleck faces feel more like items on a checklist than daunting challenges. The filmmaker's affection for ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" is palpable, but even more glaring is a reluctance to plumb the depths of the demons that drove Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, both played by De Niro in his prime. For all the criticism Phillips has encountered that he's leaning too much on his influences, ""Joker"" still feels like the work of the bully who, by making ""The Hangover,"" gave bros their own quotable, male-bonding variation on ""Bachelor Party."" (Have you tried watching that repellent comedy lately? It's aged particularly poorly, but let's face it: It was bad news to begin with.) And when you have a movie jock telling the story of a marginalized weirdo who goes off his meds, there's a noticeable dearth of nuance in said pariah's journey. In addition, for all the effort Phillips makes to set this film apart from more direct adaptations of DC Comics characters, he's awfully eager to trot out faces and places familiar to even the most casual Batman fan. The tie-ins are more than superfluous; they're counterproductive to Phillips and co-screenwriter Scott Silver's attempt to distance themselves from more familiar elements that, at least to this reviewer, keeps the film shackled to a cinematic universe it should not feel obligated to acknowledge so pervasively. A busy and obstrusive score, by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, telegraphs almost every turn from the threadbare plot well before it happens. The most crucial aspect of this Batvillain that Phillips and Silver fail to capture is how he thrives on embracing chaos. There ought to be a sense of anything-goes menace to his actions, even at this early stage, something that both Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan, that squarest of mainstream auteurs, understood innately. But ""Joker"" can't be bothered to keep moviegoers on their toes. It has a schedule to keep, impressionable fanboys to rile up, filmographies to borrow from. (Scorsese homages abound, but it also reminded me in parts of another New York-based filmmaker: Abel Ferrara, a loose cannon who might have turned this material into something that truly gets under your skin.) The filmmakers have left Phoenix high and dry. The star wrings out some pathos out of a lazy, undercooked script, but this is hardly a breakthrough for the Oscar nominee, who was much, much better playing another mentally unhinged man caring for a sick mother in Lynne Ramsay's ""You Were Never Really Here."" Admittedly, before the film reaches its mundane, preordained ending, Phillips does pull off some brutally effective bloodshed. And its climactic confrontation, unfolding before TV cameras' unblinking gaze, gives Phoenix and De Niro a chance to go on a verbal mano-a-mano. Yes, it gives the director an opportunity to step up to the soapbox to deliver a facile rant that spoonfeeds the film's message to viewers, but the scene is competently executed, even when it's pretty obvious where it's headed. Such moments, however, are fleeting, breathing spaces in a movie about societal chaos where order prevails, a peer into the abyss of madness that doesn't have a crazy bone in its body. It's a vapid poseur of a movie, a weakling trying on a brawler's knuckles. Heath Ledger's maniacal agent of destruction would have kicked this sorry-ass loser off Gotham's tallest building.

"Oct 28, 2019"," Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight Trilogy” helped popularize the idea that superhero movies could exist as reflections of reality rather than their comic book source material. For decades, the Joker has existed as an over-the-top sinister arch villain, drawing a sick delight from being responsible for some of Batman’s darkest hours, including killing Jason Todd and paralyzing Barbara Gordon. For big screen feature films, the criminal mastermind’s terror stems from utterly realistic nature of his tyranny, the kind of evil not dissimilar from those who commit mass shootings or other heinous acts. Todd Phillips’ Joker rarely feels like a comic book movie. Instead, his take on the iconic villain plays out as more of long think piece on the nature between isolation and evil. For a character who’s been committing crimes for eighty years, the comics don’t tend to spend a lot of time on the background information that led the Joker on the path of darkness. There isn’t even really an established history regarding the character’s real name. Joaquin Phoenix presents Arthur Fleck as a pathetic individual. Arthur is clearly mentally ill and lacks any meaningful connection to the outside world besides his similarly delusional mother (Frances Conroy). Arthur wants to be a comedian, but it’s unclear if he actually knows what a joke is. Phoenix’s mesmerizing lead performance is more than enough to carry the narrative past many of its meandering moments. Giving one of the strongest performances of his storied career, Phoenix plays Fleck with such nuance that it’s often hard to take your eyes off him in each scene. Many talented actors have played the Joker, but Phoenix ensures that his take will go down as one of the best takes on the character. As a film, Joker is a bit diminished by Phillips’ approach to potential sympathy that one might feel toward the film’s “protagonist,” a label that feels uncomfortable if not accurate. Arthur Fleck is a very bad man who’s led about as tragic a life as one could present on film. Never lost on the audience is the sense that the Joker represents a failure on both fronts of the “nature vs. nurture” debate. The narrative fully explains how this monster came to exist, but Phillips isn’t interested in telling anyone how to feel about Arthur. Some may appreciate that approach, giving the audience full leeway to come to their own conclusions. Situations are rarely as black and white as many films make them out to be, but Joker feels utterly comfortable swimming around in the grey. Arthur can be grey and sympathetic, understandably despicable. Whether those implications should be transferred onto Fleck’s real-world counterparts is a different story, albeit one where the lines might seem a little blurred. The other aspect of Joker that doesn’t quite work is its desire to exist as part of Gotham’s larger lore while simultaneously being about as far removed from a comic book movie as has ever been presented on screen. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) plays a supporting role, an inclusion that feels more obligatory than out of narrative necessity. The Joker is without a doubt the most well-known comic book villain in history. There isn’t any explicit reason why the Wayne family needs to be included in his story. Phillips hardly makes the case for their presence in this film. Joker is a triumph largely due to Phoenix’s performance. The film has a lot of flaws, but Phoenix keeps the narrative afloat with his commitment to the character. For a genre wrapped up in franchises and connected universes, it’s rather refreshing to see a movie with a concrete beginning, middle, and end. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary!

A bunch of kids steal the sign and then beat him up, bad. The beatdown stays with Arthur and festers inside.  It’s clear that young Arthur feels comfortable in his misery. There are moments when his desire to connect to others is clear but he’s unable to do it. He makes an effort to be normal but he knows, deep inside that it’s not going to get better. So, he turns up the dial, all the way. The more he hurts, the more he laughs and his response to almost everything is to laugh or giggle, or cackle which sounds a lot like crying. You get the truth rather quickly. He’s feeling nothing. Arthur is dead inside and close to a full on nervous breakdown. If Arthur reminds you of Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver” you would be almost correct. Arthur is a professional clown and aspiring stand-up comic who lives with his “crazy” mother (Frances Conroy) in a depressing apartment. The year is 1981 in a Gotham City that looks like New York City. There is no getting around it; Phoenix’s performance is breathtaking. He is playing an underdog with a damaged mind, and yet you can’t stop wanting him to get his act together.  Arthur and his mother watch hours of the late-night talk-show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Witnessing the bonding experience leaves you feeling sad and hopeless. Trying to keep it all together, he’s fired after revealing a gun at a children’s hospital ward.  On the subway, Arthur (still wearing his clown suit) is teased and attacked by three young Wall Street types. Furious, he pulls out his gun and shoots them dead. The case becomes front-page news.  When Arthur connects with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), his neighbor, the two take turns miming Travis Bickle’s finger-gun-against-the-head suicide gesture. An odd choice but effective here.  Then something happens … Arthur starts becoming confident, even funny. When he dances on a concrete stairway near his home, he fully commits to his insanity. He’s stopped trying to be normal (that’s impossible) and is living in his moment. In the end, we think we know how his story goes but the surprise is on us. He’s becoming (yikes, and gulp) likable, and maybe that’s the most disturbing part of “Joker.” Reviewed at New York Film Festival, Oct. 2, 2019. MPAA rating: R. Running time: 122 minutes.

"Oct 23, 2019"," Ten-minutes into watching Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck cower, twitch and bumble across the screen and through the urban decay of his world, I began wondering how writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver were going to twist this tortured soul into the Clown Prince of Crime. But this Joker isn’t the zany, plot-hatching crime boss that Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger embodied so memorably in Christopher Nolan’s 2008 film, The Dark Knight. This Joker is one of society’s untouchables who, through a series of misfortunes, discoveries and impulses, blunders his way into the persona of chaos that continues to unnerve and tantalize us. In its depiction of Fleck’s quixotic descent, Joker is as much about the spectators as it is about its tragic spectacle.  Most akin in technique and tone to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976), Joker is set in a Regan-era-esque Gotham, where millionaires thrive, mental health services are slashed, and masses of the poor are left to languish on sidewalks and holed away in shabby apartments. One such peon is Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire and target for the displaced rage of just about everybody. He’s got a weary counselor who perfunctorily listens to his gripes, and a bag full of psychotropics, which keep a quavering lid on the urges roiling inside him.   Yet fits of laughter erupt from him; his efforts to choke them down epitomize his white-knuckled existence. His misplaced dreams of being a standup comic are stymied by his stage fright, awkwardness, and off-kilter attempts at humor. The pervading grotesqueness of the film is ameliorated only by Hildur Guðnadóttir‘s cello, which lends an empathic auditory angel to Fleck’s reedy, tremulous voice. It is gut-wrenching and uncomfortable, watching Fleck try and fail to entertain audiences, neighbors and passersby. And here’s the metatextual irony at work in Joker: we’ve come to be entertained, like Fleck’s beleaguered Gothamite audience, but we end up disgusted, regarding Fleck with pity, at best. Indeed, the pathos Fleck evokes so overwhelms it makes us want to run out of the theater. When we bought our tickets, we anticipated the film’s degenerative arc, but the filmmakers push us just about to the edge of leaving before violence breaks out of Fleck like one of his bizarre cackles. And we feel compelled to stay — and watch. Fleck’s homicidal moments come almost as a relief. Fleck processes them in a private, wordless dance where he becomes fluid and graceful. More ballet than method acting, Phoenix’s physical performance transitions Fleck into the sinister, sadist clown, Joker. Still no criminal mastermind, Joker is buffoonish in his murderous stalking and scrambling around Gotham. Yet his heinous acts of bloodshed garner him the attention and laud of fellow malcontents. It’s this turn that problematizes the film on several levels. In Hollywood films, where the mentally ill are either sages or serial killers, this film opts for the latter. In doing so, Joker depicts yet another stigmatizing portrait of people with mental illness who, statistically, are violent only to themselves. With that said, the mentally ill are uncomfortable to be around and in the face of this discomfort, the members of society flee from and ostracize them. Systems of care falter or exacerbate. In isolation and disconnection, these individuals often remain unknown and act out in ways that make connecting with them difficult if not impossible. So too is Arthur Fleck, for at the center of a throng of warped admirers he’s merely the masked figure in a tableau, his smile a rouge of his own blood. Critics have panned Joker for its lack of humor and homages to 1970s cult film favorites. They’ve also reacted against the film’s illusive or absent message. But in doing so, they’ve missed the point of this psychological thriller, which merely borrows comic book material to make its societal comment. In its conclusion, the film shows its moral core, addressing the problem of evil—a topic befuddling theologians and philosophers alike.  In the face of societal problems, media moralizes, counselors offer platitudes, politicians mischaracterize in ways that are hurtful and dismissive, and average denizens disengage or exalt extremes. In the same way that Jack Ritchie’s “For All the Rude People” prompts us to consider how we treat others, Joker forces us to confront how we see (or don’t see) the mentally marginalized.",POSITIVE
"Oct 23, 2019"," Ed. note — even Cinema Scope, in the face of potential online wrath, must needs post a SPOILER warning before reviews of films such as this. The joker
is not one, but three. A film, consisting of three, is usually a nuisance. Joker, splendidly directed by Todd
Phillips and ingeniously performed by Joaquin Phoenix, is the opposite
(although being more than just one film). Let’s call it what it is then, and
what many immediately after its Venice premiere and now Golden Lion award have
enthusiastically called it: a masterpiece. This film works perfectly for all
superhero nerds cunningly manoeuvring through the Batman film-, series-, and
comic book-universes, just as it works for those who grew up and got lost in
Scorsese-land. The latter will indulge in scenery drawn from Taxi Driver, and smile upon the fact
that Phoenix’s Joker, a.k.a. Arthur Fleck, is a failed stand-up-comedian who adores
TV-show host Murray Franklin, played by Robert de Niro, who in King of Comedy was a comedian obsessed
with a talk-show host. The DC aficionados, on the other hand, will first of all be struck by the absence of the goody-goody: here, not Batman but the Joker takes and gives it all, a saviour of a different (the losing and destroying) kind, with morals standing above most of his fellow citizens’. Butler Alfred, on the contrary, is subtly present, at the gates of the Wayne family’s property namely, where Fleck (deprived of father, acknowledgment, and social status) meets his presumed half-brother Bruce Wayne while looking for his mother’s secret love (and thus probably his own begetter) Thomas, a tycoon running for mayor of Gotham City. Cinema Scope has been published since 1999 with articles on world cinema. The magazine has compiled a list of the top 10 films of each year.",POSITIVE
"Oct 22, 2019"," For all the controversy swirling around Joker, all the political and cultural discourse, all the thinkpieces claiming it’s either the most genius or repugnant film ever released, the most shocking thing may be that it is, simply, fine. To say that Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising is to say that Phoenix is in the film, because the actor has never not offered a compelling, complex and committed performance. He plays Arthur Fleck, an isolated professional clown with a medical condition that causes him to erupt in unnerving shrieks of laughter. The victim of bullying and some of Gotham’s typically vicious violence, Phoenix portrays Fleck’s fear and discomfort physically, contorting his gaunt face and emaciated frame into forced smiles and meek retreats.  Arthur is desperate for kindness, which is in short supply in Phillips’ effectively grimy evocation of New York in the early ’80s, bathed in sickly mustards and greys, covered in graffiti and overrun by rats. The city feels weighed by a corruption and cynicism that seems to have pushed out the city’s joy, solidarity and humanity. Phillips’ camera work, the use of empty space, and the supporting performances all create an unsettling sense of isolation and hopelessness. Gotham’s corruption has real effects on Arthur’s life, as cuts to medical and psychological programmes deprive him of medication and support, while the wealthy continue to thrive. But Arthur also feels entitled – not only to care and attention from women, but fame and glory. He dreams of being a worshipped comedian, despite not being funny. An unclear amalgamation of these injustices, both real and perceived, leads him to gradually transform into the violent, maniacal Joker. In the process, he inspires an uprising, as he looks to finally make the society that alienated him pay attention. This amalgamation is the problem, both narratively, and yes, politically. Shoving women’s lack of desire for a creepy man in the same “injustice” box as systemic wealth inequality is eyerolling – but it’s also a tired and mundane depiction of the creation of violence. Arthur is denied what he wants, then acts out, feels powerful, and the story escalates. This is an unoriginal portrait of villainy, of masculinity – and even of the Joker. Far from being groundbreaking, it’s a traditional approach. Other aspects of Phillips’ film also feel derivative. There are endless hat-tips to Scorsese and Lumet, while the director’s narrow vision of Gotham offers no sense of anyone else’s struggles beyond Arthur. The joker masks donned by the city’s growing mob further serve to keep them faceless. Joker is about a social uprising driven by a white, misogynistic, mentally unwell man – but says absolutely nothing about men, misogyny, mental health or society. It’s a writing approach that feels cowardly, lazy and unsatisfying. As a nightmarish portrait of urban isolation and a gritty comic book origin story, the movie is superbly acted and tensely paced. It also lacks nuance and plays into well-worn tropes. It’s good. It’s not great. But let’s definitely yell about it some more.",POSITIVE
"Oct 22, 2019"," The stars finally aligned and I was able to see Joker this week. Throughout the entire movie my heart was pounding, and I was on the edge of my seat. It touches heavily on mental illness, and my mind couldn’t help but think about all of the real people that the system has failed. That is why I think, even if this isn’t your typical type of movie, you should see it. Everyone should see it. If you paid close attention (or any attention at all) to the trailers, then you know Joker is not a typical comic book film. In fact, it is far from it. We don’t see the villain taking on the good guy, and threatening to bring down society. Well, not really. What we see is a mental ill man who has had nothing but bad luck. The city cuts funding for his social worker and medication, and he is left to battle his demons alone. That, coupled with the fact that so many people are just downright awful to him, and things take a turn for the worse. As Arthur says, “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? — You get what you deserve.” (click here for more powerful Joker quotes about mental illness). And he isn’t wrong. Society has failed many people. The government has failed many people. If you see someone who is clearly struggling, do you stop to see if they are OK, or do you cross the street to avoid them? Sure, you might not feel safe. And you might be afraid of them hurting you. But if everyone feels like that, how are they going to get the help they need? How are they going to get better? They won’t. And that is the depressing truth of the world we live in. It has already been confirmed that this is version of Joker is not a part of the current DC Universe. However, we do see Bruce Wayne — and we see him get a full on shove in to becoming Batman. We also see Arthur rally a LOT of other clowns, and people behind him. Which is the start of the making of a fantastic villain. The Joker’s origin story for this one? Society let him down. You can’t get much darker than that. I would love to see this film spark a new DC Universe. And I think it would be important for everyone to watch them, if they continue down the same path. I absolutely loved this movie. My husband? Not so much. He enjoyed it, but said it was a bit slow. One thing we did agree on though is that it has a very important message about mental illness. And everyone should watch it. Maybe it will make people think twice about how they treat others — I know it has made me think. So even if this is not your type of movie, do me a favor and watch it. I don’t think you will regret it. Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks — the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he’s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.

"Oct 22, 2019"," So many folks I know want to talk about “Joker.” They’ve read in or sought out or describe a welter of divergent yet thoughtful interpretations, and Todd Phillips’ aggrieved movie may be more valuable, on its way to a $900-million worldwide gross, as a vessel in which viewers invest themselves in concerns that range from societal disregard of the mentally challenged, class, economic equality or the merely odd than as a great film. Even if “Joker” merely suggests or implies or shoehorns, the conversations have been plentiful and good and that may be worth more than a fully realized Gotham City-set shriek of powerlessness. Phillips has finagled what genre director Phil Karlson called “little pieces of truth” into “Joker.” “Why so spurious?” was my reaction to early outrage, when only the festival caravan and a few reviewers had seen the movie. Cicada-furious clickbait rose in air. On the rare instance that I loathe a movie as much as the early going of “Joker,” it can turn out years later that I love it. About forty minutes into the often-flabbergasting Babbitry of “Joker,” there’s a duet for performer and cello (Joaquin Phoenix, composer Hildur Guðnadottir) that seethes: silken, serpentine motion combined with two minutes of unexpected musical beauty. The effect is as if the shooting of three Wall Street bullies had electrified Arthur Fleck’s body with the entire storyline of the never-made third season of “The OA.” Earlier in his dingy apartment, Arthur is possessed as if an Egon Schiele wraith, contorting his bare-chested, emaciate torso; coming after the subway incident, this scene suggests he is now “clothed” in the persona he is about to take on. In that moment, Phoenix’s seven-meds A. Fleck takes the twitch from his Freddie Quell. I was smitten, if only for a moment, convinced this could be a scene that persuaded the jury members at the Venice Film Festival, led by Lucrecia Martel and including Shinya Tsukamoto, Piers Handling, Stacy Martin, Mary Harron, Paolo Virzì and Rodrigo Prieto to hand it the top prize. (The repeated, blunt tabloid headlines of “KILL THE RICH” may also have tickled fierce filmmakers like Martel, Harron and Tsukamoto.) But beyond Phoenix and the melancholy dream-drench of Guðnadottir’s gloriously grandiloquent lamentations, what is “Joker”? Among examples of Phillips’ contentious extracurricular bluster, the best may be what he told Vanity Fair for its Joaquin Phoenix cover story: ‘’We’re gonna take $55 million from Warner Bros. and do whatever the hell we want.” Thinking on the choice to blend and remake “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy,” it seemed like Phillips just wanted to spend that $55 million to swing from the chandelier like Martin Scorsese. That reading, of “I want you to know what I know,” not, “I am compelled to show you a thing,” is not kind to “Joker.” The more I thought of “Joker” after seeing it three days before it opened, it got small and smaller, a package, a parcel, a lozenge, an afterthought, a regret. Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram.",POSITIVE
"Oct 19, 2019"," The classic Batman villain Joker, played previously by the likes of Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill, gets the reboot treatment, this time with Joaquin Phoenix as the maniacal clown with a propensity for violence.  Joker is only just now opening around the world but it has already generated reams of controversy thanks to its ambiguity over its violence and empathy for a sociopathic murderer. But let’s not get to that just yet. Because even without all that, Joker is still a jumble — sometimes brilliant and sometimes trite. Among its flashes of excellence is a self-serious movie that isn’t nearly as deep as it thinks it is. Fleck is a downtrodden man working as a clown for hire but with aspirations of being a stand-up comic — a career ambition that always surprises those he meets because his whole sad sack thing doesn’t exactly scream funny man. He lives with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy) and attends a city mental health service once a week where a mostly uncaring case worker doles out his meds. Somewhere in his background is a stint in an institution.  Joker is trying to say something about the equality gap between the callous, tuxedoed elites of Gotham while the poor are kicked to the kerb, the garbage piles up and the city burns to the ground around them. And in this, Joker becomes a flashpoint of resistance for those who feel victimised in this economic system to rally around — interesting to note that most of the Gothamites who don clown masks and riot also look like middle-aged frat boys looking for an excuse to punch out. But Joker actually says very little about wealth inequality, mental illness or victimhood that you can’t glean from the abstract of a longform magazine feature. The sequence in which a lot of rich people sit in an opulent theatre and laugh at Charlie Chaplin’s The Tramp character is so beyond on the nose.  Where Joker is strong is Phoenix’s performance. He inhabits the role completely, a hypnotic force you can’t stop watching. In particular, watch how he moves his body, all gangly limbs and strange dance moves to highlight Fleck’s awkwardness and almost otherworldliness. It may be surprising to know that Joker was directed by Todd Philips, who is best known for The Hangover trilogy, but that experience with slapstick comedy serves him well here in dynamically capturing Phoenix’s mad physicality. But Philips also doesn’t know when to be restrained. He and director of photography Lawrence Sher compose some genuinely beautiful shots and sequences but then repeat those visual flourishes over and over again to the point of exhaustion. While Phoenix is incredible, the film wastes its supporting cast, which also includes Robert De Niro, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham and Zazie Beetz in a stupidly thankless role.  Joker has been slammed for its potential to incite violence from similarly disenfranchised men who may feel entitled to fight back against a system they believe has deprived them of girlfriends, but that isn’t Joker’s only issue.  If it were, Philips may be right in feeling besieged by the negative coverage of the movie’s problematic parts. So while it mostly scores on many technical levels, it could fail to connect with audiences. Art is meant to be challenging and provocative but Joker steps too far over the line into nihilism and that’s not a fun time for anyone. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 18, 2019"," Las calles sucias y grises de Gotham, reminiscentes del Manhattan de los años setenta, se convierten en el escenario perfecto de Joker (Guasón), la esperada cinta que narra el origen de uno de los super-villanos más temibles de DC Comics. El archi-enemigo de Batman, quien hizo su debut en las historietas del hombre murciélago en 1940, ha fascinado e inquietado al público desde entonces tanto por su complejidad, como por sus ideas anarquistas que incitan al caos y a la violencia. Un antagonista impredecible y fuera de lo ordinario que ha sido creado y moldeado por la misma sociedad, y que de cierta forma representa un lado oscuro y perverso de la condición humana. Uno que a veces preferimos evitar o ignorar, ya sea por temor o incomodidad. En Joker, el director Todd Phillips (The Hangover, Old School) realiza un íntimo y perturbador estudio de personaje que se aparta de los convencionalismos del cine de superhéroes. Un intenso drama psicológico que raya en el horror, sobretodo cuando encontramos paralelismos entre el universo ficticio del cómic y nuestra realidad. Una cinta que abandona las frenéticas secuencias de acción cargadas de efectos especiales, para en su lugar brindarnos una oportuna crítica sobre temáticas, quizá delicadas, pero de gran relevancia en la Unión Americana: el control de armas de fuego, la desestigmatización de las enfermedades mentales, y la lucha por la igualdad social. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) trabaja como payaso en una pequeña compañía de entretenimiento. Desde pequeño, su madre le enseñó a siempre sonreír y hacer reír a los demás. Es por ello que el más grande sueño de Arthur es el de convertirse en un comediante de stand-up, a pesar de sufrir un trastorno neurológico que le impide controlar su risa – una condición que se conoce como risa patológica o inmotivada. Sin embargo, la crueldad del mundo exterior ha ido borrando poco a poco la felicidad de su rostro. «¿Soy yo, ó el mundo afuera está cada vez más loco?» pregunta el protagonista a una trabajadora social que evalúa regularmente su estado mental. Las noticias en la radio y la televisión pintan un panorama cada vez más desolador, la indiferencia se ha convertido en un cáncer para la sociedad, y el 1% de la población continúa enriqueciéndose a costa de los demás, encargándose también de mover la balanza política, económica y judicial a su favor. La vida de Fleck comienza a descender rápidamente por un espiral de locura tras perder su empleo y la ayuda social por parte del gobierno, descubrir su verdadero origen, y convertirse en el hazmerreír de un programa nocturno de variedades conducido por Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). No obstante, un brutal evento a bordo del tren subterráneo de Gotham hará que su vida cambie por completo y que éste encuentre un sentido a su existencia. «Todo el tiempo creí que mi vida era una tragedia. Ahora veo que es una comedia» menciona el protagonista quien pasa de ser alguien invisible ante la mirada de la sociedad, hasta transformarse en la figura principal de un movimiento de rebelión. Antes de desmenuzar la película a fondo, hay que hablar de tres cosas: primeramente, la escalofriante y gloriosa actuación de Joaquin Phoenix. Una interpretación sumamente física y visceral que causa una reacción inmediata de miedo y desacomodo. Al igual que Heath Ledger lo hizo en The Dark Knight en el 2008, el Joker de Phoenix es un personaje impredecible, y eso logra tenernos al borde del asiento con una sensación de constante inquietud. Su actuación tan siniestra se mete debajo de la piel, tanto así que al final de la función salí con las manos temblorosas. Desde las escenas de baile tan íntimas como demenciales, hasta su explosivo diálogo mientras aparece en el show de televisión de Murray, Phoenix es sensacional. En cuestión técnica, hay que reconocer tanto la música incidental, a cargo de Hildur Guðnadottir, y la fotografía de Lawrence Sher. Las melodías de la compositora son magníficas y capturan a la perfección la tristeza y la desolación del personaje principal, mientras que el trabajo de Sher ayuda a provocar inquietud y tensión en el espectador a través de sus ángulos y las tonalidades de las imágenes, las cuales evocan el estilo de las cintas de Martin Scorsese en los años setenta. Mucho se ha hablado de Joker desde su estreno en el Festival Internacional de Cine de Venecia, donde se coronó con el máximo premio de la competencia, el codiciado León de Oro. Su mensaje ha polarizado opiniones y ha resultado demasiado controversial. Por un lado, hay quienes argumentan que la cinta glorifica al villano. Otros más la han tachado de irresponsable, sobretodo ante la crítica situación que se vive en los Estados Unidos con respecto al fácil acceso a las armas de fuego y al sentimiento nacionalista que ha invadido ciertos rincones del país. En mi caso, el filme me pareció brillante e incisivo en su manera de incomodar para lograr transmitir un mensaje que es importante y urgente. A pesar de que la película se sitúa en 1981, lo cierto es que la historia es un reflejo de la sociedad actual y como tal, creo que es necesario ver el extremo al que podríamos llegar si continuamos ignorando los problemas que hemos puesto debajo del tapete. Me refiero a un sistema fallido que deja en el abandono y que no brinda apoyo a individuos con trastornos o enfermedades mentales, y a una sociedad que continúa estigmatizando y burlándose de personas que sufren de discapacidades. Esto, aunado con la falta de control de armas, se convierte en una combinación peligrosa, la cual desgraciadamente hemos visto repetirse en varias tragedias que han sacudido a la Unión Americana en los últimos años. Me parece entonces interesante cómo la película cuestiona la «villanización» de las enfermedades mentales. Si bien, la película nunca pide simpatía por el personaje principal, ésta demanda empatía para entender que sin apoyo, sin medicamentos y sin instituciones o programas, todos somos de cierta manera responsables de esta problemática. Sin embargo, el discurso más aterrador de la película es el de la desigualdad social. Al observar al Joker alzándose sobre un taxi mientras una multitud se congrega a su alrededor gritando y celebrando sus terribles actos de violencia, un escalofrío recorrió todo mi cuerpo. La simple idea de que cualquier «payaso» aproveche las frustraciones de una sociedad dividida para convertirse en líder y esparcir una retórica fundada en el odio, caos y violencia es estremecedora. Algo que tampoco está muy alejado de la realidad, y que quizá es por ello que tuve una reacción más visceral a esta lectura en particular. El único problema que tuve con Joker fue la dinámica racial retratada en la cinta, la cual intenta pasar casi desapercibida, pero que me dejó un mal sabor de boca. Desde el grupo de adolescentes (posiblemente latinos) que golpean al protagonista al inicio de la cinta, quienes posteriormente son llamados animales que están destruyendo el mundo, hasta la interacción con la mujer y su hijo a bordo del autobús y la escena donde Arthur apunta su pistola al televisor mientras una persona de raza negra aparece en pantalla, todos estos breves momentos podrían apuntar a un sub-texto racial muy problemático. Si Joker es el comienzo de una nueva franquicia de Batman, Warner y DC Comics van por buen camino. Uno por el cual poseen la oportunidad de diferenciarse y ofrecer algo más arriesgado y oscuro que sus competidores. Joker funciona tanto como entrada dentro del universo cinematográfico de DC, como también por méritos propios. Si quitásemos los elementos que relacionan a la historia con la del hombre murciélago, el estudio de personaje tan atinado que Phoenix y el director Phillips realizan, así como su mensaje de índole social, lograrían que la cinta tuviera el mismo impacto. Joker es una experiencia cruda, maniática y perturbadora. Una historia que nos muestra tanto el desequilibrio mental del protagonista, como el desequilibrio de la sociedad que le rodea. Una fábula que en medio de su fantasía muestra una posible y terrorífica realidad que está en nuestras manos evitar a toda costa.",POSITIVE
"Oct 18, 2019"," Bill Finger’s creation The Joker has remained one of the most fascinating figures in all of pop culture and comic books medium. Every new generation finds an angle upon which to examine the Joker and how he’s so much more than a simple Batman villain. It has fascinated artists for decades how someone can sink so far in to the murky depths of madness that they can’t even see the light anymore. Christopher Nolan set a high bar that director Todd Phillips almost touches with the ugly, grotesque, depressing and yet quite fantastic “Joker.” Set in Gotham City 1981, Arthur Fleck is an aspiring comedian and working Joe who suffers no end of getting beaten around by everyone. Even people with the slightest edge on him manage to get their licks in. Committed to his mother, he dreams of being a guest on his favorite late night comedy show. But after one nasty incident on a train, Arthur sets out to finally right all the wrongs that have been committed to him. Armed with a revolver, and clown make up, he intends to set Gotham on fire, and make his mark. “Joker” is that kind of film that aims to become something so much more than a movie based on a comic book, and much like Nolan did with Batman, Phillips helps us to see the Joker in a brand new light. No one origin of Joker has ever really been accepted as canon, but Todd Phillips does explore what it’s like to lose your sanity in a world that’s become so much more vicious. Phillips presents 1981 Gotham as a world very similar to our own where the ill are tossed away and forgotten, the general public is obsessed with fame, politicians have zero connection to real world problems, and average citizens have just about had enough. The Joker in here is not the harbinger of this vicious violent despicable world, he’s merely the ultimate product, the one that’s taken the cruelty and turned it in to the ultimate joke. Only when Arthur begins to leave bodies in his wake, only when he begins to convey his sheer sense of madness does he begin to grab attention from the world around him, and the more he attracts, he gains an insatiable hunger. Phillips is never above committing to the idea of irony and plot twists, injecting every single plot with a thread of irony that’s pretty brilliant when dissected. “Joker” is going to be one of the many comic book adaptations that will warrant analyses, and for good reason. Even in the end, Arthur can’t help but laugh at everything he’s seen and done and wonder if perhaps he’s made an impact. Or maybe he’s made absolutely none at all. Maybe he was just what Gotham needed the whole time. Or maybe it was all one big funny accident. Phillips creates the least stylish comic book movie ever filmed with a world that’s muted, and flushed in grimy browns and ugly yellows. They’re complimented by Joaquin Phoenix’s absolutely incredible performance as Fleck. With his lanky build and wide grin, Arthur is a man who delights in laughter, but is very disconnected from society’s view of what is conventionally funny. That’s exemplified in a scene in a comedy club where Fleck, studying another stand up comedian, laughs at all the serious elements of his bit, while gawking confused as the audience chuckles the actual intended comedy. Phoenix steals the movie away from just about everyone, and his performance as this forgotten man with delusions of grandeur who is finally let in on the joke is an absolute sight to behold. If I have anything negative to take away from “Joker” is that Todd Phillips borrows heavily from Scorsese. He apes the templates of films like “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy” almost religiously. If you’ve seen those films, you know what “Joker” is and where it all leads in the end. While that doesn’t hinder the whole of the film in the end, Phillips’ obvious influences distract from the overall sum of the parts or its impact, it becomes quite obvious as the film winds down. In either case, “Joker” is a surprising feat. It’s a masterful dramatic thriller about an ugly world and an ugly society, and how one individual caught on to the inherent humor of it all.",POSITIVE

"Oct 17, 2019","Simply as a film, Joker leaves much to be desired: It's heavy-handed and derivative. But as with previous superhero narratives, it provides a fascinating allegory for present concerns.",NEGATIVE

Generally, if someone asks me what I think of a movie as I’m leaving the theater, my response is “I don’t want to answer that question right now.” I need time to process most films and don’t like to get boxed in by a knee-jerk reaction. As I was leaving Joker, I ran into a friend who asked: “What did you think of the movie.” I immediately blurted out, “I hated it! I hated it! I hated it!!” I admire several aspects of the film-making; the cinematography, most of the editing, some of the music, and nearly all the acting. We’ll get to that, but first I need to explain the depth of my unhappiness with this movie. Prior to its release, DC went to great pains to insist that Joker was not just another comic book movie. No costumed super-heroes appear, and the universe is never in danger of being annihilated by a villain with near God-like powers. Joker is intended to be a case study of how a severely disturbed, but otherwise “normal,” human being descends into the madness that seemingly consumes all comic-book villains. As any number of critics have stated, the fatal flaw with executing this concept is that at least two other far superior films have already trod a nearly identical path – sans the comic book nature of the lead character. Both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy watched their protagonists devolve from frustrated social misfits into homicidal maniacs. Some parts of Joker feel like they’re following these classics nearly scene for scene. The only discernible difference is that this movie’s sociopath parades around in clown makeup. The fundamental issue I have with Joker is that it’s unnecessary. I’ve followed the character from the comic books, and TV show of my childhood through all the Batman flicks. Even in Heath Ledger’s seminal portrayal, which is where the role should have been retired, there was never any need for a back-story, and one was never offered. The character’s just not important enough to be placed in the same context as Travis Bickle or Rupert Pupkin. Joaquin Phoenix is fascinating, as always. There’s a physicality to his portrayal that gives his version of The Joker character genuine depth. Even when I was preoccupied with the sight of his emaciated body, I felt an unsettling sense of his power. Phoenix significantly outperforms both the script and the staging. When Robert De Niro first walks on stage, it feels like Robert De Niro making a Robert De Niro appearance. It doesn’t take long for him to morph into a different, fully realized human being, however. How odd it must have felt for De Niro to play Jerry Lewis’ role from The King of Comedy opposite Phoenix’ Bickle\\Pupkin hybrid in clown makeup. I have to wonder if he had any qualms about a comic book character appropriating two of the most iconic characters in movie history whom he created. While I was intrigued by Joker’s strong (if somewhat obvious) soundtrack, I noticed that the music, rather than the script or the visuals, often pushed the plot. That’s not always a bad thing, but it seemed to be happening a lot. A soundtrack should compliment a movie, not drive it. The only questions worth raising are, why does no one on the set of a popular TV show notice an armed serial killer in clown makeup walking around the place while mobs of anarchists in clown makeup are simultaneously burning the city to the ground? And why, when his presence can no longer be ignored, does no one make any attempt to interfere with his activities? That the filmmakers, at this stage of the Batman narrative, chose to make Bruce Wayne not the victim of random violence but the orphan of despicable parents who got what they deserved, isn’t a plot hole. It’s an obscenity.  Are we now to understand that Batman isn’t an avenging crusader against evil, he’s just a clueless entitled brat who never grasped the plight of the working class?

"Oct 17, 2019"," Content by Tony Macklin. Originally published on October 17, 2019 @ tonymacklin.net.I thought there was no reason at all in 2019 for making another film featuring the character The Joker. It had been done, and reached its apogee in the past.
Cesar Romero camped it up as The Joker in a television series (1966-68) and a film Batman: The Movie (1966). Jack Nicholson nailed the role in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). There was no further reason to personify the character.
But Heath Ledger outdid Jack Nicholson. What a concept. He transcended Nicholson's iconic performance when he portrayed The Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008). Ledger posthumously won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger had reached the pinnacle. Others tried, but there was absolutely no reason for another Joker. I was wrong.
In the film Joker, Joaquin Phoenix brings the character of The Joker to vital, fitful, palpable, fascinating existence. He is now a title character, among brilliant previous supporting characters. He is part popinjay, part vermin. But most of all, he never stops being human. He is the most human of Jokers.
That humanity, as twisted as it may become, burns on the screen.
For the first half of Joker, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is the victim. We sympathize with his being mistreated and abused.
It's like Death Wish (1974) in reverse. The vicious bullies are punks, but this time they're elitist punks - rich ""pricks."" We actually root for Fleck to get his vengeance against them. Like Hitchcock, director Todd Phillips manipulates his audience in a masterly way.
But as Arthur descends into madness, his activities are no longer heroic. They become severe, angst-ridden, and mean-spirited. The last part of the film boils over, sloshing with violence. It's a wicked trip.
Director/co-writer Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver know their movies. The scenes between Arthur/Joker and television host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) draw heavily on Scorsese's The King of Comedy (1982), which had De Niro and Jerry Lewis. In Joker, Arthur, who works for a clown company, wants to be a standup comedian, although his mother (Frances Conroy) says, ""Don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?"" Not if you're a lethal comedian. 
In Joker, there are three movie titles on marquees. All could be relevant. Ace in the Hole (1951) is a film about how the media and a mob corrupted a rescue attempt. Blowout (1981) focuses on how sound misleads, as does Joker's humorless laugh. And Zorro, the Gay Blade (1981) is not the Zorro that we expect.
The film's last sequence is perhaps reminiscent of Road Runner in a mental institution.
Joker teems with striking images created by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and dramatic music by HIldur Guonadottir. It's a film of vivid effects, but it's not always graphic. It has possibly two or more murders not on screen. We have to decide - to participate.
The end of Joker plunges us into a world of absurdity and cruelty. It could be taken as a metaphor for the present.
Joker features psychology, and especially the impact of mob psychology.
Joker is now King.
Whatever mob you fear, they're out there.

"Oct 17, 2019"," Arthur Fleck (the remarkable Joaquin Phoenix) is a loner; a man who, for his entire life, has looked after his ailing mother. He is a clown for hire, struggling to make ends meet, taking on one humiliating gig after another in his dark, depressing hometown of Gotham City. Arthur dreams of being a stand-up comic, but any attempts of his to get on the comedy ladder result in few laughs – most of which are at his expense. He suffers from a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at any given moment and is shunned by society. Social services are being cut down, his medication is not working and one sudden violent moment on a train changes Arthur’s life forever, leading him down a path of chaos and self-destruction. DC Comics’ film adaptations of late have had a wobbly ride… but they are having the last laugh here with Joker’s $96 million take on its opening weekend and reviews that have run the gamut from the sublime to the ridiculous. They have certainly shaken up the genre – the Marvel Cinematic Universe has taken its fans to some pretty grim places – but DC has certainly upped the ante here with such a bravely dark and disturbing take on a character from a comic.  This is an origin story borne in tragedy. It is an intimate character study of a man trying to fit in, a man who despite his tragic appearance wants to bring joy into people’s lives. Ironically, Arthur is nicknamed ‘Happy’ by his mother. But life only wants to beat him down – his social worker doesn’t listen to him; his clown colleagues at work can’t resist picking on him; his mother loves him but is distant.  He lives in a city in chaos. It is a Gotham City that is seedy, creepy, dirty, rat-infested and crime-ridden; where the millions of poor people are downtrodden by the handful of rich – and as Arthur retreats further and further into his shell, his act of violence sparks a movement that inspires the city’s demoralised citizens to rise up. Phoenix is on screen virtually for every minute of the film’s two-hour running time and it’s an all-consuming and wholly mesmerising performance.  Ever one to go very deep into his characters, the actor has lost lots of weight to inhabit Arthur’s skinny, gaunt, and grey physique and embodies his fragile persona effortlessly, commanding sympathy and revulsion in equal measure – from his sincere devotion to his mother to his pitiful attempts at stand-up via the acceptance of the evil that slowly engulfs him. In a defining moment, he seems to be celebrating his new persona with a mesmerising solo slow dance in a public toilet. A poignant line written in Arthur’s chaotic diary reads “the worst thing about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don’t”. And this is the point the film wants to make – Arthur is an ordinary man struggling for acceptance in a world that does not acknowledge he needs help and as his sanity begins to unravel and can’t tell any more what is real and what is imagined, so begins his inexorable path into blackness. Director Todd Phillips does not let up on the bleakness at any point. It is a film firmly grounded in humanity and ordinary and basic human vulnerabilities and needs in moments of challenge. The Joker may be a popular character from Batman lore but there is nary a superhero to be seen here (at least one who has yet to evolve). Phillips has assembled a strong supporting cast around Phoenix. Robert de Niro is restrained and effective as Murray Franklin, the talk-show host whom Arthur is obsessed with (a nice twist on the actor’s legendary 1983 King of Comedy role). In a small but powerful role, Frances Conroy excels as Arthur’s mother – a woman whose own flights of fancy have a large emotional impact on Arthur’s psyche. Abominable (U): After discovering a Yeti on the roof of her apartment building, teenage Yi (voice of Chloe Bennet) and her two friends embark on an epic quest to reunite the magical creature with his family. But to do so, they must stay one step ahead of a wealthy financier and a determined zoologist who want to capture the beast for their own gain.

"Oct 16, 2019"," Todd Phillips will be forever remembered with this stylish, bitter, and visceral Joker, a story set in Gotham City in the early 80’s that elucidates about how the downcast Arthur Fleck, magnetically played by Joaquin Phoenix, became the DC villain that we all know from the Batman saga. Arthur, who struggles with a condition that makes him laugh compulsively during tense situations, is a punching bag of a society corrupted by money and power. Victim of severe childhood abuses, he earns a living by performing in parties as a clown or holding store signs on the streets. He lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), a fragile woman who ironically calls him Happy and lives obsessed with Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), her wealthy former boss who is now running for mayor. The latter’s son is the young Bruce Wayne, who would become Batman in the future in order to avenge the death of his parents and fight the crime in the streets. Heavily medicated to combat mental illness, Arthur still dreams in becoming a stand up comedian, a tough task with his condition. He is an innocent victim of a bleak world and is wounded both in the heart and in the head. It’s so, so weird to see one of the saddest persons in the world cackling without control whenever in trouble. It has a disquieting effect. The bitter circumstances of life deteriorate his fragile state to the point of making him commit murder and feel good with it. It’s his instinctive and emotionless response to a poisonous society, the dangerous chant of the displaced and the dispossessed. The malevolent act has the support of the miserable people of Gotham, who starts a revolution against the corrupt system. Arthur’s creepy side makes him unpredictable and his tortuous mind has lots of room for imagination. With a killer gaze and that broad smile in his face, he premeditates his next step: victimize Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the popular host of a talk show who contributes to his downfall by making fun of him on the TV. Simultaneously gripping and unsettling, Joker is a win for Todd Phillips, an unremarkable director until now, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver (The Fighter; 8 Mile) and had dedicated his directorial career to comedies such as the Hangover trilogy (2009,2011,2013) and War Dogs (2016). Without a hint of hesitation, he injects mordantly funny moments among the torrents of sadness and makes the film thrive both as a noir drama and a clever psychological thriller. Digging deep into his role, Phoenix was the secret weapon required to make us understand the human pain behind the Joker’s wickedness.",POSITIVE
"Oct 15, 2019","Joker is a visual feast about mental illness, the crumbling of an unstable economic system, and toxic masculinity that thinks it has something groundbreaking to add to the comic book universe, but merely adds an obtuse reflection.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 15, 2019","Phoenix's Joker is a monster of his own making, and the film succeeds in blurring the lines between fantasy, reality, and hyper-reality, manipulating its audience to participate in the horror while challenging the individual's own mental soundness.",POSITIVE
"Oct 15, 2019"," TODD Phillips delivers another hangover of a movie in Joker, albeit one where the laughs are few and far between and the messages fly thick, fast and in grim, disturbing fashion. Much less a comic book movie and more a sly, insightful piece of social commentary, this pulls off an incredibly neat trick by framing a cautionary tale about mental health within the single most watched film genre of the moment. Thatâs not to say that it turns its back on the universe in which it exists, feeding into Batman folklore in masterful fashion. But in a move worthy of the Jokerâs own ability to toy with peopleâs psychology, this film confronts difficult subject matter, challenges contemporary morality and ethics and leaves you with a head-spinning conundrum. Joker continually toys with its audience. How much did you like/enjoy it? How far did you sympathise with its main protagonist? Did you understand him? Could you condone him? Is his journey an inevitable one born from societyâs indifference and/or ignorance to the issues surrounding him (abuse, mental illness, loneliness and rejection)? A lot has been made of Jokerâs relationship to Scorseseâs Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, which is accurate and even nodded to in the casting of Robert De Niro in a supporting role. But I was also reminded of Se7en for the way in which it surrounds its viewers in unremitting bleakness, only finding light (via its character’s own epiphany) in its darkest hour. Essentially a character study, Joker chronicles the rise of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an unsuccessful clown with dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, as he slowly becomes one of cinema’s most iconic villains. Initially, Arthur is just attempting to exist within the squalid, rat-infested streets of Gotham City in 1981. But he’s handicapped by a condition that forces him to laugh uncontrollably in certain situations (of anxiety or distress), meaning that he is written off as a loner and a freak. Worse still, he’s quite often beaten up and left in a crumpled heap. But after being pushed too far, Arthur begins to assume a new identity – that of a darker clown, partly in response to the media manipulation of a violent situation he was at the centre of. With civil unrest creating a divide between Gotham’s rich and poor, society embraces the Joker as some kind of hero – a cult figure giving voice to a thousand grievances. Working from a script co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, leading man Phoenix offers up a transformative performance as Arthur/Joker, creating a villain who is frighteningly real. As such, comparisons with past Jokers (not least Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight) are redundant. This is a completely different beast. The focus is almost entirely on Arthur. We witness his pain, his heartbreak, his anguish and his rebellion. And for each of us, there will be a certain point where he crosses the line from anti-hero to out and out psychopath. But Silver and Phillips don’t just take us on a journey; they explore the reasons for it and its consequence. Arthur’s condition is a focal point for some of the mental health issues facing society today: whether in the lack of funding that sees so many people left to fend for themselves, or in the way that every day people view and often shun it. Yet while certainly provocative in its outcome, few people could deny that Arthur’s journey holds a mirror up to American social problems, in particular, and the problems that the right to bear arms brings. In that regard, it is uncomfortable; but designed to be. Concerns over empowering incel culture (otherwise known as involuntary celibates), or provoking copycat acts, fall wide of the mark, in my opinion. The film isn’t irresponsible in the way it confronts such issues without ever suggesting we should condone them. Rather, it invites viewers to judge for themselves and to perhaps be more wary of these issues… to bring them out into the open. It’s why so much has been, and continues to be, written about it. Mental health and the battle to recognise and support it is one of the biggest issues surrounding society today. It’s a battle-ground that’s on a par with feminism and race, albeit one that encroaches upon every gender and race. It’s arguably why Phillips chose to place Arthur on a bus filled with people of colour in a key early scene. And Phillips isn’t seeking to suggest that every case of untreated mental illness is a mass killer in waiting. Such suggestions are as wide of the mark and hysteria promoting as notions of Jaws depicting great white sharks as one of the biggest threats to mankind, which therefore must be hunted to the point of extinction. Joker is many things, but it doesn’t set out to be dangerous or irresponsible. Rather, some of the accusations being levelled against it could be. What it does promote, in my opinion, is rational debate surrounding sensitive and complex issues. If this sounds a million miles removed from the notion of what a comic book movie should represent, then that’s perhaps deliberate in part. Joker could yet become its own forum to debate such issues. But as previously stated, it doesn’t lose sight of the requirements of the character. The final moments are spectacular in the way they set up a potential wider Batman universe, while feeding into what’s known about the characters. If anything, Joker re-imagines the superhero genre in the same way that Christopher Nolan did previously with the Dark Knight trilogy. In doing so, it also re-establishes a villain as someone to fear, or to be terrified by. At a time when many movie villains are embraced by popular culture and emblazoned across T-shirts, Phoenix’s Joker shouldn’t be able to be ‘idolised’ in such a manner. He’s in no way cool. He does strike fear. He makes you nervous. Phoenix’s performance is such that he inhabits this person, exposing his complexity for all to see. He can be sympathetic. But there’s always something uneasy about him, something unreal. He gets into our heads and refuses to budge. He lingers and he haunts. We can see why he becomes who he does… but it doesn’t make the journey any easier, or any less sad in its own melancholic way. Joker is a film to admire more than like. But it shouldn’t be underestimated. It is a massively impressive, highly intelligent, openly provocative and ferociously performed masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019"," Al menos en la copia de Guasón ( Joker , 2019) que yo vi, el logotipo del Festival de Venecia aparece hasta terminar los créditos. En los pósters oficiales no encuentro ni una mención microscópica del León de Oro que recibieron la película y su director, Todd Phillips , y me pregunto si tal vez aquel signo de orgullo para otros galardonados —Renoir, Varda, Kurosawa, Von Trotta, Ray—, provoca en las oficinas de Warner Bros . una inusual vergüenza. Quizá la impresión de una “película de arte” pondría el objetivo real de Guasón, las ganancias, en peligro. Si en los años 70, cuando distribuyó Malas calles (Mean Streets, 1973), Warner esperaba millones —y los obtuvo—, hoy, en el Hollywood DC (Después de los Cómics), Guasón no me parece nada más que otro intento de responder afirmativamente la misma pregunta que Deadpool (2016): ¿Puede una película de adultos ser un taquillazo? En México, donde los tabloides manchan de sangre a sus lectores, Guasón está clasificada B-15, es decir, van a entrar hasta los lactantes que no tengan dónde quedarse durante la función. Pero si recordamos aquella escena de Los Simpson cuando Bart descubre que películas para adultos son las de Truffaut, Bergman y los Lee más famosos —Spike y Ang—, no me parece que ni en México ni en ninguna parte del planeta Guasón esté pensada para espectadores maduros. Al contrario, como fiel producto de Phillips, la ganadora del León de Oro de este año me resulta corporativa, convencional y reaccionaria. Es cierto que, al estilo del izquierdista Ken Loach , buena parte del metraje nos describe a Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin Phoenix ) como una víctima del sistema. Ciudad Gótica está en caos y la atención psicológica que le brindan a este hombre flaco, socialmente inepto y dado a desconcertantes ataques de risa es miserable. En una oficina oscura una trabajadora social le hace siempre las mismas preguntas, y después de cada sesión Arthur regresa derrotado a la calle manchada de basura. Cuando pierde su trabajo como payaso y se cancelan los servicios psicológicos por falta de presupuesto, se nos sugiere un mundo sin alternativas donde un hombre desesperado encuentra en la violencia un amparo ante el asedio. Pero aunque Guasón se comporta como el melodramático cine de Loach, donde sólo faltaba que a sus personajes los orinaran hasta que pasó en Sorry We Missed You (2019), sus influencias son más populares, obvias y presumidas por Phillips en entrevistas y conferencias: Taxi Driver (1976) y El rey de la comedia (The King of Comedy, 1982). ¿Pero alcanza el director de Guasón la complejidad psicológica, formal o política de Martin Scorsese ? En defensa de Phillips, a veces ni el propio Scorsese lo ha logrado. Vidas al límite (Bringing Out the Dead, 1999), por ejemplo, se plantea como un regreso a las preguntas de Taxi Driver pero Scorsese se concentra más en la formidable construcción de una Nueva York dantesca que en los conflictos internos de su protagonista. Phillips no logra ni eso. La fotografía de Lawrence Sher se atiene al mero pragmatismo de la trilogía ¿Qué pasó ayer? (The Hangover) y no alcanza más que un registro generalmente inexpresivo de los espacios y las situaciones. Algunas imágenes resaltan la soledad del protagonista con cualidades de postal, pero en otros planos Sher parece incapaz de lidiar con Phoenix y termina por afectar su interpretación al filmarlo de perfil o en planos generales donde casi no vemos sus expresiones. En los demás aspectos, Guasón fracasa por ceñirse a los parámetros de su género. Si bien las secuencias de acción escasean más que en otras películas de superhéroes, aquí hay más de ellas que en Taxi Driver . La trama, con paternidades truculentas, coincidencias recurrentes, personajes alucinados y un alzamiento popular decorado con fuego, choques y balazos, contradice por completo el tedio de Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) mientras empuja la televisión con su pie hasta tirarla, o cuando ensaya su discurso de superhéroe frente al espejo. Más que retarnos a contemplar la retorcida imaginación de un psicótico, Guasón le busca el espectáculo y, de manera contradictoria, termina condenándola en el desenlace, cuando un previsible fan service nos demuestra que Arthur ha inspirado un movimiento destructivo y condenable. Si en el plano final de Taxi Driver Travis redescubría el deseo de matar y demostraba ser no un héroe sino un hombre olvidado, posesivo y rencoroso, en el de Guasón se lamenta el auge de una figura moralmente simple: un supervillano. El sentido de la película se complica con la aparición de un trumpiano Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), que asume el rol de antagonista. Tanto él como Arthur son moralizaciones evidentes que advierten: el individualismo del empresario está mal, pero la violencia de la protesta está peor. Convencional la forma y pobres las ideas, el elenco debería poder salvar Guasón, pero el motivo por el que Robert De Niro fue tan exitoso en El rey de la comedia es el mismo por el que su papel en Guasón sirve como referencia a aquel filme y nada más: no es gracioso. En su rol como anfitrión de un famoso programa nocturno, De Niro resucita a Jake La Motta, de Toro salvaje (Raging Bull, 1980), un hombre abusivo que hace chistes no para encantar a una audiencia sino para demostrar su superioridad sobre ella. En contraste, Phoenix mezcla al patético protagonista de El rey de la comedia con el bestial Freddie Quell, de The Master (2012), y logra una interpretación efectiva pero poco matizada. Su repertorio de gestos no es tan vasto como en The Master porque su personaje representa nada más los dos polos del payaso: la tristeza y la demencia. Se podría decir exactamente lo mismo de la película en sí: Guasón intenta darle seriedad a un género familiar pero se aferra a la convención; insulta el neoliberalismo pero ve con desconfianza la resistencia; reduce a un hombre a víctima para luego condenarlo por victimario.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 14, 2019"," anadora discutida del pasado festival de Venecia, la película Guasón ha generado una buena dosis de controversia porque parece favorecer la violencia del lado del pobrediablismo sicótico. Ante los reparos de críticos y autoridades estadunidenses, los creadores –el director Todd Phillips, los ejecutivos de la Warner Bros.– se han apresurado en desmentir tales intenciones. Siendo una película derivada de personajes de los cómics DC, la caracterización de su protagonista epónimo supone algo más complejo que la villanía bidimensional. Para ello, Guasón canibaliza libremente dos películas clave de Martin Scorsese: Taxi Driver (1976) y El rey de la comedia (1982). El ambiente es el mismo –Nueva York/Ciudad Gótica como una amenazante cloaca, permeada de mugre y violencia–, pero, sobre todo, las motivaciones del héroe son una calca del desequilibrio mental de Travis Bickle y Rupert Pupkin, respectivamente. Como Travis, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) siente que el mundo le debe algo y encontrará en las armas de fuego su instrumento para ejercer el vigilantismo megalómano (hasta existe la misma imagen del protagonista apuntando su revólver contra las figuras que ve en la televisión). Como Rupert, Arthur aspira a la fama como cómico stand-up y su máxima ilusión es aparecer en el programa de Murray Franklin, un socarrón conductor de un popular talk show. (El hecho de que Franklin sea interpretado por Robert De Niro es una tácita aceptación de dichas influencias). Ambas vertientes se conjugarán en el sangriento clímax. Pero, a diferencia de Scorsese, cuyo nihilismo es auténtico, Phillips y el coguionista Scott Silver abundan en la autocompasión de su personaje. Así, la narrativa se preocupa por dibujar los trazos lastimosos de la biografía de Arthur Fleck: niño adoptado por una madre desquiciada (Frances Conroy) que lo llama  Happy, víctima del abuso de las parejas de ésta, fracasado payaso de alquiler, adulto solitario que sólo puede fantasear ser el novio de la guapa vecina (Zazie Beetz) de al lado y que padece una risa nerviosa, sardónica, que sólo irrita a quienes le rodean. Pobrecito. Nunca el Guasón había sido tan patético. Encarnado por otro actor, Arthur Fleck podría haber sido una caricatura del perdedor urbano. La caracterización de Phoenix (quien siempre ha tenido un brillo demencial en la mirada) lo sitúa en un registro realista que lo hace perturbador. Al ser uno de los pocos actores hollywoodenses dispuestos al riesgo, convierte al protagonista en un hombre tan repelente como fascinante. En las secuencias finales, cuando Arthur ha asumido plenamente su creación del Guasón y baila de manera triunfal sobre unas escaleras al ritmo de una canción de Gary Glitter (un abusador de menores, por cierto), el pobre diablo se ha erigido en héroe. En ese sentido, como aprobación de una línea de conducta admirable, pues el personaje ha desatado todo un movimiento social antiautoritario, la película se ha vuelto potencialmente perniciosa.

"Oct 14, 2019"," a sustancia corrosiva del rencor social. El estreno internacional simultáneo de Guasón (Joker), la cinta de Todd Phillips ganadora del León de Oro en la pasada edición del Festival de Cine de Venecia, ha suscitado una fuerte polémica que rebasa, con creces, la estricta valoración de sus cualidades artísticas, entre las que destaca, de modo incuestionable, la formidable interpretación que hace Joaquin Phoenix de su protagonista central. Quienes por inadvertencia esperaban una secuela más de una rutinaria película de superhéroes, inspirada en la historieta gráfica de Batman, descubren desconcertados la ilustración fílmica de los siniestros delirios de un desequilibrado mental llamado Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), un patético hombre-anuncio en las calles atestadas de basura de la ficticia ciudad de Gotham (un Nueva York que en los años 80 padece una severa huelga de servicios de limpia), para quien la agresión que sufre por parte de un grupo de adolescentes será el detonador que avivará una violencia personal reprimida y secretamente cultivada durante largos años. Esa violencia, desplegada a través de una serie de actos criminales, es fruto no sólo de una enfermedad mental asociada con la esquizofrenia, sino también de una acumulación real de agravios y maltratos que en Arthur – payaso de ocasión y comediante mediocre– han cultivado un agudo resentimiento social. La parte interesante y perturbadora de la película es el modo en que delirio y realidad se confunden en la mente del protagonista, e incluso también en la percepción misma de la historia por muchos espectadores. Sea deliberada o fortuita la intención del director y guionista de confundir así las pistas del relato, lo cierto es que el resultado semeja una peculiar arma de dos filos, la postura ambivalente del realizador que transforma el desequilibrio mental de Guasón y su violencia homicida, lo mismo en un espectáculo complaciente, moralmente cuestionable, que en el diagnóstico feroz de los extremismos a que puede conducir la insensibilidad de una sociedad que menosprecia, abierta o veladamente, a los seres marginales. No era otra la fuente de agravios que padecían los protagonistas de dos cintas a las que Guasón rinde un tributo transparente: el Travis Bickle (Robert de Niro), de Taxi Driver (Scorsese, 1976), y el comediante frustrado Rupert Pupkin (nuevamente De Niro), en El rey de la comedia (Scorsese, 1982). La gran diferencia entre el impacto de aquellas dos cintas notables y la película que hoy despierta tanta polémica es el modo inaudito en que el desprecio a las minorías y la humillación al ciudadano común desfavorecido ha trascendido la simple anécdota para volverse una práctica institucional en las políticas públicas de países como Estados Unidos o Brasil, o parte del este europeo, permeables cada vez más a un discurso autoritario. Cuando Thomas Wayne, candidato a la alcaldía de Gotham City y supuesto padre del bastardo Arthur Fleck, exclama con sorna: Quienes hemos logrado hacer algo con nuestras vidas, siempre veremos como payasos a los que no lo han logrado, la previsible reacción del aludido y humillado sólo podrá ser un Espero que mi muerte tendrá más sentido (o hará más dinero) que mi vida, y esa profunda frustración individual llegará a contagiar a un número mayor de desposeídos quienes habrán de culpar de su suerte a las élites sociales hasta clamar Muerte a los ricos, desatando el caos urbano, la rebelión de las masas, la proliferación de las máscaras que resguardan el anonimato de la revancha, el encono incontrolable del rencor social. El fuego a la vuelta de la esquina. Ese clima apocalíptico es el que visiblemente ha fascinado a Todd Phillips, realizador sin la maestría artística de un Scorsese, pero con el olfato suficiente para reconocer la eficacia de un discurso incendiario en la pantalla en estos tiempos del recelo social, la posverdad triunfante y la impune reivindicación del odio a lo diferente. De la obra artística redonda y contundente que fue Taxi Driver hemos pasado, décadas después, a la película panfleto, al exabrupto anímico totalizador que prescinde de un punto de vista manifiesto y certero, y que diluye la denuncia política en una mera política del espectáculo. El marasmo ideológico y narrativo que es Guasón tiene como venturosa redención artística el desempeño prodigioso de Joaquin Phoenix, sostén verdadero de toda esta empresa comercial. Al espectador atrapado en los delirios de Arthur Fleck, el propio Guasón podría decirle con ironía: “ The joke’s on you” (La broma es sobre ti).",POSITIVE

"Oct 13, 2019"," There are exceptions but the general tendency in Hollywood is to create one-dimensional villains when making an action flick.  You’ll have someone (normally a male) trying to take over the world, or assassinate a popular figure, or steal billions of dollars, or simply blow up the planet.  The plans usually lack logic (or at least start off sensibility and ultimately become illogical).  Equally puzzling are the life goals of the incompetent henchmen who sign up to the villains’ causes. There are reasons why film writers make such decisions.  In a two hour movie, there often isn’t time to “flesh out” an intriguing bad guy when the prominent focus is on the heroes.  Further, having a simplistic villain makes it easy for the filmmakers to guide audiences’ emotions and avoid controversy.  They bear no resemblance to divisive figures in the real world so you can sit back, eat your popcorn, and view it as mindless entertainment. The Joker appeared in the first Batman comic book ever published in 1940 and he has since become the most utilised villain in superhero movies.  Jack Nicholson in Batman (1989), Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (2008) and Jared Leto in Suicide Squad (2016) have all put their own spin on this famed character. Joker is a very different comic book movie however.  There are no “traditional” heroes and so the entire 122 minute running time is spent developing and analysing a purported villain.  We learn that the Joker, better known as Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), is a struggling loner.  He has no friends, he receives no mail, he’s battling to hold down his job as a performing clown, and he has mental health issues which require seven different types of medication.  In his own words – “I just don’t want to feel so bad anymore.” On a near-deserted subway train one evening, Arthur watches as three sleazy businessmen taunt and harass a middle-aged woman.  Arthur, still wearing his clown face from work, unwillingly becomes involved and after a violent scuffle, he pulls out a gun and kills all three men.  You could argue he first acted in self-defence but when he puts several bullets in the last victim, it’s clear his motivations include anger and vengeance.  Accustomed to being bullied, he enjoyed having the “last laugh” for once. It’s not long before Arthur’s actions kick-start an uprising within Gotham.  Authorities want him identified and apprehended but there’s a growing number of people who see Arthur as the “poster boy” for a powerful anti-capitalism movement sweeping across the city.  They’re tired of austerity-loving politicians cutting services to the underprivileged while the wealthiest 1% continue to thrive and prosper. Joker isn’t perfect.  The second act is sluggish and it pushes its message too forcibly in places.  Still, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  Writer-director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) and co-writer Scott Silver (The Fighter) are taking societal problems that you might see explored in a Ken Loach film and bringing them into the superhero realm.  Arthur is a complex character and while you may not agree with his approach, you’ll understand his troubled mindset and the reasons why some support him.  There are parallels with real-life issues currently playing out in the media. Given Heath Ledger posthumously won an Academy Award for playing the same character, it was always going to be a tough ask for Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line) to produce an equally memorable performance.  He’s gone close though.  Phoenix has created a credible villain with a fragile mental state and a creepy disposition (particularly his laugh).  His portrayal adds to the film’s grim, unsettling tone that you’ll have trouble shaking off as you leave the theatre. A surprise winner of the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, Joker is intended to be a “stand alone” feature that isn’t part of the current DC Extended Universe.  That’s a shame because I’d love to see the introduction of arch nemesis Batman to find out where this alternative timeline goes next.",NEGATIVE

What is there to say about this movie? If you clicked on this review, you already have feelings about the film, even if you haven’t seen it. Trust me as I was one of those people. Going into Joker is interesting as there’s a lot of baggage. As someone who loves DC, I was excited. As someone who is hit and miss on the Joker as a character, I was nervous. I’m also not a fan of this agent of chaos version that became so popular with The Dark Knight. Then there’s the grim nature of the film and how it handles the subject matter. That came with me as I went into my press screening, for better and worse. Thankfully, the beauty of cinema is its power to make the noise go away and suck you into its magic. For its two-hour running time, I was firmly in the world of Todd Phillips’ Joker. Now, how do I feel about that world that Todd Phillips’ crafted? Well, the performance at the center of the film is a masterpiece, but the rest of the movie is merely okay. Joker is made well enough and features some craftsmanship that you’d never expect from the director of The Hangover, but it doesn’t go that extra mile. For the first two acts of the film, the filmmakers showed you a look at mental illness with heavy-handed commentary and compelling scenes sprinkled along the way. That worked for a while but quickly ran its course. Things quickly change when it gets to the final act, and the movie keeps into another gear…then the real fun begins! That last act comes with such a lively performance from Phoenix and even better filmmaking that I felt like everyone finally woke up and came to work. A slow burn is excellent. You can have a film where things drag out until the very end, that’s acceptable. But you risk losing some viewers along the way if your material isn’t engaging enough. And that’s where Joker loses me. The story gets a little predictable at times and doesn’t entirely make up for some of the slower moments. It wasn’t until things finally kicked up a notch that I thought the movie finally found itself, don’t know if the wait was entirely worth it yet. Most people are interested in the movie for the Joaquin Phoenix performance, and that makes sense as this is one of the most talked-about performances ever. Tackling a darker version of the character like this is hard following the iconic Heath Ledger performance many loved in The Dark Knight, so Phoenix had big clown shoes to fill. Well, Joaquin Phoenix more than fills the shoes. His take on the Joker, known her as Arthur Fleck, is chilling from the very first scene. Almost every frame of Joker is Phoenix, and that’s no easy task. There’s plenty of highlights with Phoenix as Fleck throughout the film, but when he appears on the talk show as the trailers suggest, that’s where I finally loved the character. At that moment, it felt like the Joker as a character and Joker as a film finally came into their own. Before that moment, though, Joaquin Phoenix is fleshing out his demo reel with kooky moments of strange laughter or odd dancing. Speaking of that laugh, the movie tries to explain it away with some medical reason, and that came off as one of the more cringy “we have to explain everything” moments. As a fan of DC Comics, though, I can’t help but feel like adding any Batman-lore in this movie felt like a chore for Todd Phillips. If you have a younger sibling, you’ll understand this. Remember when your parents asked you to bring along your little brother and sister to hang out with your cool older friends? It felt like Phillips was that older brother having to drag its comic book little brother around embarrassingly. Every time someone mentioned Gotham or the Waynes; it felt like tacked on. Honestly, if you removed any mention of the Waynes from the movie and shifted some story points around minorly, the movie wouldn’t even miss the connection to the world of DC. The film by no means needed to stick to some source material, a little bit more love for the medium could’ve added a bit more to the project. Add in little odds to iconic Arkham doctors, add in more of the Waynes, show me the early stages of Gotham’s world of crime. Those simple fixes could’ve brought the enjoyment of the film up, but Joker went for another “more grounded” take following the footsteps of Nolan. An excellent performance from Joaquin Phoenix? Sure. A great film around him? Not so much. Joker is by no means a “bad” movie, but I didn’t leave me shocked or awed by any of what was happening on-screen. If you saw Taxi Driver, you’ve seen this movie. If you’ve seen Clockwork Orange, you’ve seen a scarier version of this. For fans of the Joker character, there’s enough to sink your teeth into here. For DC fans, this gets a little trickier to call. Overall, not the worst time at the cinemas in 2019, but for all the buzz around it, I expected to be a little more buzzed.

"Oct 13, 2019"," Long before it was released Todd Phillips’s Joker was shaping as the most controversial film this year in the United States. The big sticking point is the portrayal of the famous super villain as a sad, mentally-disturbed loser driven to breaking point by a series of unhappy breaks that would have shredded Job’s fortitude. Arthur Fleck is one of life’s victims. In his forties he lives with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy) in a seedy apartment block in Gotham City. He imagines a future for himself as a stand-up comedian but he’s scary rather than funny. Arthur has a mental problem that causes him to laugh hysterically when under pressure – and every day brings new pressures. That laugh is a high-pitched shriek which cascades into a mad cackle. It’s one of the few recognisable traits he shares with the Joker we know from the Batman movies. Arthur’s day job is working as a clown, complete with fright wig, grease paint and floppy shoes, but rather than spreading joy he attracts aggravation. He’s beaten up more than once, betrayed by friends, and conceives a hopeless passion for the single mum who lives down the hall (Zazie Beetz). His own mother is forever writing letters to her former employer – bilionaire busnessman Thomas Wayne, (Yes, another Trump surrogate!) who ignores her pleas for assistance. No present-day actor is better than Joaquin Phoenix when it comes to playing the psycho. He was chilling last year in the role of a well-intentioned serial killer in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really There. That film now reads like a rehearsal for Joker. There was the same mad stare, the same hesitant, stumbling speech, the same buried trauma. The character even lived with his old mum. Phoenix was always going to have to work hard to get past Heath Ledger’s electrifying performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight Rises (2008), but he’s incandescent. There’s rarely a moment when Phoenix isn’t on screen. We follow him through every sordid episode of Arthur’s life, and creep inside his mind. Todd Phillips makes these fantasy sequences so naturalistic we are continually having to do a double-take. It seems impossible that Arthur would elicit warm, paternal feelings from talk show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro); or get admiring looks from the girl down the hall. It’s all in his head, and for a few bewildering minutes it’s in ours as well. The real Arthur seems designed to give everyone the creeps with his long greasy hair, his boney frame, and his weird stare. When he smiles it comes across as a sinister leer. It’s so creepy it may prevent Phoenix from taking out the Oscar for which he is now a front-runner. The critical disapproval of Joker seems to kick in when Arthur undergoes a transformation which permits him to unleash the violent impulses that have been raging around in hs psyche for most of his life. His sickness is exacerbated by Gotham – a city in which plutocrats such as Thomas Wayne just keep getting richer, while the poor are ground ever more deeply into the dirt. When social services are cut Arthur no longer gets his medication, and the demons start to emerge. The truly drastic part of the film is the way Arthur achieves what psychologists call ‘self-actualisation’ through murder. He finds it’s exhilarating to blow someone away, and hey, they all deserve it. What’s even better is that his crazed deeds find a host of admirers. Suddenly Gotham City is overrun with ‘killer clowns’. The underclass is rising to take a revenge on those who have taken everything else, and Arthur is their hero. It’s a much bigger thrill than making people laugh. To get to this vision of ascendent anarchy Phillips takes us through a long, intense wind-up, with more than a nod towards the fims of Martin Scorsese, especially The King of Comedy (1983), which features De Niro as the psychotic would-be comic. We feel sympathy for Arthur even though he’s a repellent personality. When he turns on his tormentors we’re on his side. At least until everything goes too far. I suspect it’s this feeling of complicity that troubles the film’s detractors, who see Arthur as a close cousin of those gunmen who keep killing innocent people in public places. The worry is that Joker will incite violence, although every second American movie might be liable to that charge. Did somebody say “Quentin Tarantino”? To view this film through the lens of moral indignation is a poor way way of reading a movie that finally succeeds in putting a human face to a character from a superhero comic. Perhaps the trick is to leave out the capes and leotards altogether. Batman is present in only the most oblique way, as Thomas Wayne’s small, pampered son. Arthur may be a head case but his madness is presented as a natural reaction to the circumstances his life. As usual, it’s a reminder of the deep divisions that have opened up in American society during the age of Trump. If violence is a natural product of a community that is learning to take pleasure from hatred, Joker affords us a glimpse of the coming apocalypse. It might once have been dismissed as a Hollywood fantasy but as the pillars of Amercan democracy develop more cracks than a new Sydney housing estate, it all seems disturbingly plausible.",POSITIVE

"Oct 12, 2019"," Joker is the latest DC outing chronicling the origin story of Batman’s most iconic villain, but unlike previous properties Shazam and Aqauaman, it’s a film that feels much more like the publisher’s Black Label comics. Its a darker and nastier affair that comes across almost like a Scorsese film, with an obvious Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy influence. Comic fans will notice a slight departure from source material, The Killing Joke, and other than the occasional Wayne character, the film is free from the confines of having to tie into a wider DC universe – and it’s all the better for it. For all the controversy surrounding the film, it’s not as ultra-violent as expected, favouring a slow burn approach that delves into the psyche of the man who would become the Joker. It’s an affecting and upsetting experience, but that’s the point. Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker centres on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown for hire who aspires to become a stand-up comedian whilst trying to care for his ill mother (Frances Conroy). It’s 1981 and Arthur is struggling to make ends meet in a broken Gotham that’s littered with ever growing piles of trash, super rats and a growing disparity between the rich and poor. He’s beaten and broken down by society and the numerous medications and counselling he relies upon to cope is cut due to loss of funding. When his hero, late-night TV host Murray Franklin, openly mocks his stand up routine on live TV, he becomes one of the many factors that tips Arthur over the edge, setting in motion his downwards spiral to violence and depravity. His resulting actions will ignite an uprising in the city that will have significant ramifications for years to come. This isn’t your usual comic book fare; this is a sad, unflinching look at when the system fails a person who’s been struggling with mental health issues and social alienation their whole life, and his consequential unsettling descent into madness. Phillips documents the dark and ugly side of humanity; it’s a discomforting reflection of modern times that addresses difficult themes of mental health, abuse and social and wealth inequality, which all have an underlying effect on Arthur’s tale and that of Gotham. It’s an unsettling and raw look at how an awful chain of events can utterly change a person’s world, events that will eventually shape Arthur into the Prince of Crime.  Joaquin Phoenix is completely transformed as Arthur, perfectly embracing the maniacal mask with an utterly chilling, yet scarily vulnerable performance. This is a tragic portrayal of a fragile man who has truly hit rock bottom;  “all I ever have is bad thoughts” he confesses to his counsellor. Phoenix has adapted a unique, almost emaciated physicality to become Arthur, even down to the awkward way he runs and the uncomfortable sound of his laughing fits – I wouldn’t be surprised if he won a number awards for his performance. Frances Conroy is also tragically superb as Penny Fleck, with Robert De Niro going full circle since his King of Comedy days, with Rupert Pupkin becoming Murray Franklin.  Lawrence Sher’s gritty cinematography really does bring to life a grungey and grimey Gotham, with the added colour grading and costumes proving an impressive homage to late 70s early 80s vigilante movies. Chernobyl composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s chillingly dark score is an absolutely perfect companion to Arthur’s descent; it’s a haunting accompaniment that insights a lurking sense of dread which we all know is inevitably coming. Despite all of the controversy surrounding the film,  Joker is the first of its kind comic book movie that really delves into mental health and trauma, featuring an Oscar-worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix that will definitely leave you reeling long after the credits have rolled.

"Oct 11, 2019"," EWTN News, Inc. is the world’s largest Catholic news organization, comprised of television, radio,
                print and digital media outlets, dedicated to reporting the truth in light of the Gospel and the
                Catholic Church. “Nothing happened to me, Officer Starling. I happened. You can’t reduce me to a set of influences. You’ve given up good and evil for behaviorism, Officer Starling. You’ve got everybody in moral dignity pants — nothing is ever anybody’s fault. Look at me, Officer Starling. Can you stand to say I’m evil? Am I evil, Officer Starling?” Hannibal Lecter’s striking riposte to Clarice Starling in Thomas Harris’ novel The Silence of the Lambs is as good a place as any to begin contemplating a movie about the origins of an equally iconic pop-culture villain — one for whom no definitive or canonical origin story exists, with good reason. From the comics to the big and small screens, the Joker has often been portrayed in his most memorable incarnations as an embodiment of nearly Satanic anarchy and nihilism, an inscrutable agent of chaos with no agenda but to shatter the illusion of social order and normality, to deal out terror and death as spectacularly and absurdly as possible. He is a pure psychopath, with no conscience, empathy or fear. That he is both insane and a criminal mastermind may not be a contradiction in terms; that his insanity so seldom constitutes a handicap in matching wits with the DC universe’s greatest detective probably is. Take the most influential version of the Joker’s origins: the acclaimed but controversial 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland — one influence on Todd Phillips’ new film Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. The Killing Joke proposed that the Joker was once a sad-sack chemical engineer with hopeless dreams of doing stand-up comedy until being driven mad by the accidental death of his pregnant wife and his disfigurement in a crime gone wrong. This is crashingly absurd. A man, even a fragile, vulnerable man, doesn’t go from grieving his wife and unborn child one day to a career of random, remorseless mass murder the next because of the emotional trauma of one horrific day. Someone like the Joker would already have been dangerous and scary as a child and a teenager. Phillips’ film tells a less implausible tale of mental illness and childhood trauma, in the process trading the popular picture of the Joker for a vastly smaller, less capable character. Phoenix’s Joker, a party clown and human billboard named Arthur Fleck, could never become Batman’s archnemesis, even if he wouldn’t be in his mid-60s by the time little Bruce Wayne (9-year-old Dante Pereira-Olson) will finally be old enough to put on the cape and cowl. Set in the early 1980s in a decaying, crime-ridden Gotham City, Joker depicts Arthur as a serial victim of random violence whose own violence begins in a subway shooting meant to recall New York’s 1984 subway shooting by Bernhard Goetz. Goetz was dubbed the “Subway Vigilante,” but no one would ever mistake him for a Dark Knight in the making. No more will Arthur ever be a Clown Prince of Crime, except perhaps in his own mind. Perhaps Arthur isn’t the Joker, but a forerunner who will eventually inspire some younger, more gifted criminal. Even in this movie, in a kind of inversion of the “Sons of the Batman” army from Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, Arthur inspires others to put on a happy face and lash out at the world — but this is part of the problem. While Arthur may not fit the profile for supervillain, he does look — up to a point — like the sort of person who might go on a shooting spree. (Note what I’m not saying: Most people who look like Arthur are not dangerous or violent.) There is no useful profile for a mass shooter. The one constant is that they are overwhelmingly male; while it’s often suggested that mass shooters are disproportionately white, this seems to be untrue. Still, there are familiar themes. Arthur struggles with social isolation, bullying violence and other stressful circumstances, fostering a sense of aggrieved victimhood. He lives with his frail mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and the absence of any father he has ever known may be a factor, along with troubling things he learns about his childhood. (A sacred image of the Madonna and Child, suggesting that the Flecks are Catholic, is the only scrap of religious content.) Arthur leads a marginal existence but longs for success and applause. Like his counterpart in The Killing Joke, Arthur aspires hopelessly to work in stand-up and idolizes TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, strengthening by his mere presence the obvious links to Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver). Spree shooters are often triggered by a crisis event, such as loss of a job or a romantic partner. Arthur gets triggered in spades, though his romantic attachment to a gorgeous single mom named Sophie (Zazie Beetz) whose apartment is down the hall from Arthur and his mother leads to a particularly wrenching destination that may catch some viewers by surprise. Arthur kills several people, but not at random; like most mass killers, he starts close to home, targeting people he perceives as having wronged or hurt him in some way. Really random violence against innocent victims might be too alienating to audiences for a film that at least wants to allow viewers inclined to do so to identify sympathetically with the protagonist. Reading between the lines, it’s clear that Arthur has been stalking Sophie — behavior he believes she should and would take in good-humored stride, along with a creepy joke about robbing her apartment at gunpoint. In Arthur’s mind, this is how one flirts and begins a caring romantic relationship. Yet this is all implicit, without a hint of the resentment and anger against women someone like Arthur would feel. Viewers are free, if they wish, to regard Arthur as a hapless victim of his own mental illness and not a man whose anti-social attitudes make him a threat to innocent people around him. Mental-health professionals have worried that Arthur’s unspecified mental illnesses, for which he receives therapy and an assortment of medications until social services funding cuts, may contribute to stigmatization of mental illness, particularly in connection with violence. (In an effective conceit, Arthur suffers from a condition called pseudobulbar affect that manifests in uncontrollable and inappropriate laughter.) More troublingly, Arthur’s descent into violence seems to have a liberating, empowering effect on him. By making spectacular use of a gun, he gets the attention and even apparently the celebration that all mass shooters desire. Or does he? One can choose, not unreasonably, to regard some or all of the denouement as a self-gratifying delusion. (I know where I would draw the line between reality and fantasy.) Regardless, though, Joker does nothing to cross-examine the Joker’s experience of triumph. On some level the film offers a mass-shooter fantasy fulfilled. Tellingly, as Alison Willmore points out, where Bernie Goetz’s targets were black teenagers, Arthur shoots a trio of drunken, white Wayne Enterprises finance bros who were harassing a woman before they began beating him up. Thomas Wayne’s televised response may be meant to suggest the 1980s-era Donald Trump’s law-and-order rhetoric, most notoriously his calls for the execution of the Central Park Five. This Thomas Wayne is a far cry from the civic-minded philanthropist of Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins. While he is eventually cleared of one odious charge laid on his doorstep — a twist that could prove controversial in the #MeToo era — Thomas is ultimately a callous representative of the same privileged contempt for the needy that results in slashing the social services Arthur relied on. The indictment of Wayne, and the intertwining of the Joker’s life with the Wayne family and Batman’s origins (an instance of what I’ve called Shrinking World Syndrome, one even more dramatic than Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman), raises inevitable questions about young Bruce Wayne’s earliest years and what kind of Batman he will be.

"Oct 11, 2019"," The birth of the modern Joker cult can be dated to 2008, with Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, and its spastic performance by Heath Ledger, who had died shortly before the film’s release, as Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime. Ledger’s Joker was given an abundance of screen time in which to articulate his personal philosophy, a recklessly violent strain of “Do what thou wilt” carnival anarchism; Nolan cited Fritz Lang’s mad criminal mastermind Dr. Mabuse as an influence. Unusual among supervillains, Mabuse is not a killable mortal being but a viral idea, a mantle to be passed from person to person, Mabuse to Mabuse. And while Nolan’s grim, lumbering film is no more interesting today than it was a decade ago, the virality of its Joker has made for a lively extra-cinematic phenomenon, the character becoming a lodestar for Gamergate radicals, TikTok role players, SoundCloud rappers, and a menagerie of other fascinating freaks.

So, courtesy the inevitable logic of franchise metastasis and “cinematic universes,” we have Todd Phillips’s Joker. The film slowly tracks star Joaquin Phoenix’s eventual assumption of the title role. When first encountered, he is a nebbish named Arthur Fleck working as a rent-a-clown and living with his unhinged mother (father is unknown) in a Gotham that in almost every respect resembles the foundering pre-cleanup New York City of the popular imagination. Rather than the system-minded Lang, Phillips takes as his model Martin Scorsese’s immersive dramas of urban anomie and alienation, particularly Taxi Driver (1976) and King of Comedy (1982). The first fully Joker-centric film—I don’t deceive myself in imagining that it will be the last—Joker puts Phoenix on-screen nearly constantly, as Robert De Niro was in those two Scorsese movies. De Niro himself is on hand here as Murray Franklin, a late-night chat-show host who’s a sort of amalgam of Merv Griffin and “Stupid Human Tricks”–era David Letterman. An aspiring stand-up comic, though his own act is doomed by incompetence and a susceptibility to painful fits of pathological laughter, Arthur looks to Franklin as a surrogate father figure and career role model. The alignment of the spectator with Arthur’s viewpoint extends to our sharing in his delusions, including daydreams of stardom with Franklin and a transparently telegraphed twist involving a budding romance with a neighbor played by Zazie Beetz. Our near intimacy with Arthur also allows for an intensive study in the eccentric architecture of Phoenix’s torso: hunched shoulders, pale skin clinging to a barrel ribcage on an emaciated frame, long arms that seem to protrude Ingres-like from the wrong angles. Phoenix is a full-body actor, and Phillips highlights him as such, making room for a number of dance idylls that include slow sways, spastic soft shoes interrupted by pelvic thrusting, and gnarled tai chi reveries. In fact, the film operates under the belief that anything that works once will go over even better the tenth time, and this repetition of effects blunts impact. As such, nothing lingered on here makes the impression that, say, Phoenix’s ecstatic nightclub breakdance in James Gray’s Two Lovers (2008) or his folded-in postures in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master (2012) do in a fraction of the screentime. This isn’t to denigrate Phillips by comparing him to highbrow-auteur directors, but to note that his highbrow-auteur phase is, thus far, the least interesting of his career, which began with nonfiction studies in what is now fashionably called toxic masculinity (1993’s Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, 1998’s Frat House), and continued through raunchy, crowd-pleasing studio comedies centered on, essentially, the same subject matter (2003’s Old School, the Hangover trilogy). Joker marks Phillips’s second dip in the shallow end of the prestige pool, and while it improves on the first, War Dogs (2016), a dismal dark comedy concerning arms dealing, it’s likewise afflicted by shopworn pop-music cues: here Cream’s “White Room” and Gary Glitter’s “Rock & Roll Part 2.” (Better is the original score by cellist and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, which conveys the palpable feeling of a world teetering on the brink.) Early Joker ballyhoo provided occasion for much journalistic hand-wringing over the prospect of the film as a “What Is to Be Done?” for the incel set, a risk for inspiring open rebellion among the unlettered rabble, whose potential adverse reaction to even a whiff of moral ambiguity preoccupies the chattering classes, who know such volatile concepts are best kept safe in graduate-level seminars. Actually, Joker’s au courant radicalism is directed principally toward the moneyed elite, exemplified by Franklin and another media figure, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of the boy-who-would-be-Batman—the urban patrician conception of the elder Wayne suggests something like Nelson Rockefeller, while his casual reference to the disgruntled underclass as “clowns” mirrors Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables.” Arthur is a victim who has fallen through an increasingly frayed social-services safety net, and his rankling rage is grounded in class resentment rather than the racial and sexual hang-ups that plague, for example, a Travis Bickle. (Joker, like James Mangold’s 2017 Logan, is an “adult” comic-book movie, but like all such movies remains essentially sexless.) The inciting incident that sends Arthur off the deep end is a kind of Bernhard Goetz–in-reverse confrontation on the subway, in which the greasepainted by-the-hour Bozo guns down three drunkenly belligerent stockbrokers, one with an Eric Trumpian physiognomy, after they droogishly serenade him with “Send in the Clowns.” Where earlier in the movie Arthur’s subjective delusions and exterior reality are muddled, they finally coincide as his madness metastasizes into the outside world, his outcast’s fantasies of power and potency finding ultimate expression as Arthur becomes Joker, emerging as a hero to the fed-up lumpenproletariat. This metamorphosis serves the purposes of multifilm architecture, though makes little dramatic sense; there is nothing in Joker to suggest Arthur as a leader of men—and, by the looks of things, exclusively men—as a figure of unusual charisma or intelligence. Stringy-haired, wearing itchy polyester slacks and an assortment of dun-colored cardigans, Phoenix’s Arthur is from first appearance far gone, something like a Crispin Glover grotesque—and his confrontation with Franklin on live television plays like Glover’s combative 1987 Letterman appearance taken to its extreme conclusion. (The weird Letterman appearance is a storied tradition, participated in by Harvey Pekar, Harmony Korine, and Phoenix himself.) The face-off between Joker and Franklin, between outsider animus and insider smugness, embodies the tension at the heart of Joker—a film that takes on the nigh-impossible task of smuggling transgressive underground danger into a contemporary, risk-averse multiplex tentpole package. (Years ago, Phillips commissioned the poster art for Hated from very real killer clown John Wayne Gacy.) Most of the time this danger finds expression through the hoariest clichés of encroaching mental illness, including diary-of-a-madman composition books filled with a looping, loony, misspelled scrawl and creepo collage art. Some true triumphal madness is achieved during the last act Walpurgisnacht in the streets of Gotham, but it’s mitigated by the logic of cinematic universe-building, and the knowledge that order must and will be restored. Our anger, too, must today be made subservient to the law of the franchise—it is to the insufficiency of this that the off-script amateur cult of Jokerdom perhaps subconsciously responds, remaining far more potent and petrifying than any mere scenery-gnashing screen jester.

"Oct 11, 2019"," “This labor requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others-in this case, the sense of being cared for in a convivial and safe place. This kind of labor calls for a coordination of mind and feeling, and it sometimes draws on a source of self that we honor as deep and integral to our individuality.” While this concept is strongly linked to gender (women are often expected to perform emotional labor in both professional and personal life) it is also a concept strongly linked to class — many of the careers most notable for their demands of emotional labor are working class and middle-class professions — nurses, bank tellers, social workers, and careers in hospitality and food service. Joker is a film concerned with performance in a variety of spheres. For example, in its aesthetic and philosophical fixation on masks, dance, and stand-up comedy. It also explores the way a failure at emotional performance can have severe material and psychological ramifications for vulnerable members of society. One such person is Joker’s protagonist Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man struggling with poverty, childhood trauma, and mental illness. “The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t,” Arthur writes in the diary he is instructed to keep by a social worker. The expectation of gleeful subservience (“Don’t forget to smile!”) is one not only required by Arthur’s job as a clown — to repress, to entertain, primarily in order to turn a profit for others —  but also in his personal life as a person with a mental illness and obtrusive neurological disorder.  Arthur is a pleasant person for the early portions of the film. He is a diligent caretaker of his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), polite to those around him, and hardworking at his job. Despite his efforts to make those around him not only at ease but happy, Arthur is still left lonely, unheard, and rejected. He is described by his boss as simply “weird” and that he makes people uncomfortable. He is a plain, even unkempt dresser, sickly thin with poor posture, often feminine in his mannerisms, with a disorder that attracts negative attention; his inability to convincingly play the role of normative manhood and regulate his outward expression of emotion has a material effect on his social and financial mobility, leaving him trapped in abject poverty. “For the flight attendant, the smiles are a part of her work, a part that requires her to coordinate self and feeling so that the work seems to be effortless. To show that the enjoyment takes effort is to do the job poorly.” Joker intertwines Arthur’s class and psychological state with a surprising level of emotional depth and social consciousness. Arthur doesn’t just have one bad day that makes him snap, he lives within a system that demands that his entire existence as a member of the working class involves assuring the comfort and entertainment of those around him. His repeated failure to live up to this task eventually causes him to give up the pursuit altogether. Ancillary characters, predominantly the black employees of state-sponsored institutions, are also shown to have their emotional labor taken for granted. Social workers, an administrative clerk at Arkham Asylum (Brian Tyree Henry), and Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a single mother working as a bank teller, it is the job of these four characters in their professional and personal lives to constantly consider the feelings of those around them, even when they are rarely afforded the same courtesy by those of higher status.  Garbage piles up around the city of Gotham, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) shows nothing but patronizing disdain for those in need, and these characters are expected to continue to perform their roles with a smile. When Gotham cuts social service funding for the office, Arthur’s social worker says that the city doesn’t care about people like him, and doesn’t care about people like her either. But the two must both put on a pleasant face, their happiness taken for granted as they are abandoned by the government systems that should be supporting them. “The deferential behavior of servants and women-the encouraging smiles, the attentive listening, the appreciative laughter, the comments of affirmation, admiration, or concern-comes to seem normal, even built into personality rather than inherent in the kinds of exchange that low-status people commonly enter into.” Arthur’s journey is in many ways an escape from a life of performing for others’ benefit, a process of committing himself to free expression for his own sake. He abandons self-consciousness and repression and learns to express his feelings fully, and violently. In the climax of the film, Arthur’s posture and voice have changed, he is vibrant in his dress and physically expressive, free from societal expectations of anonymity and subservience. It is horrific to see Arthur enact so much violence in the film’s final scenes, but there is also a sense of triumph in seeing a downtrodden, abused man free himself from the demands of others, to find cohesion between his internal self and external expression. Notably, Arthur’s convulsive laughter is largely absent once he adopts the Joker persona in earnest; the manifestation of the innermost chaos which he was constantly struggling to stifle no longer plagues him. Unconcerned with economic class, social acceptance, or the care of others, escaped from the artifice of emotional labor, Arthur is at home in his body and mind, and is free to behave — horrifically, theatrically, truthfully, as his heart desires.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 10, 2019"," From a key song choice to Scorsese-indebted bleakness, Todd Phillips’s new movie is designed to trigger a wide range of disturbing emotions. But it’s not a failure. By the time that jaunty tune arrives, late in Todd Phillips’s galactically bleak new Batman-free character study of a Batman villain, the disturbed man-child played by your boy Joaquin Phoenix and about to make his public debut as the Joker has already brutally murdered several people and cry-laughed at discomfiting length, like, 200 times. (A central tension in the movie is whether Phoenix will cough up blood and/or spray snot everywhere, and, gentle reader, I think you already know that he does both.) Joker’s primary aim, of course, is to inspire nausea, revulsion, and tremulous awe at its own button-pushing audacity. The geysers of blood (and snot), along with the pure Tool-video body horror of Phoenix’s writhing-skeleton frame, certainly get the bile flowing. But it ain’t a party until the ’70s jock-jam anthem performed by a convicted pedophile kicks in. There is a word for this, and that word is trolled. “Rock and Roll Part 2”—known informally as the duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, HEY! song—came out in 1972 and has boomed from sports arenas worldwide for decades despite Glitter’s long-documented legal woes, which culminated, in 2015, with the English glam rocker’s 16-year prison sentence for attempted rape, indecent assault, and sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. The tune, devilishly catchy and maddeningly ubiquitous, is a prime example of horrifying perversion embedded bone-deep into the fabric of (deep sigh) society, a joyous and uncancelable cultural artifact that made an irredeemably evil man very rich, and now richer still. That’s richer still because, ah, yes, very good, here comes the Joker, resplendent at long last in full costume and iconically alluring fright makeup, traipsing down a giant staircase that depending on your brain chemistry will evoke either The Exorcist or Big Little Lies, that inescapable goddamn duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, HEY! reverberating through the theater as you bury your head in your hands. Boom. Trolled. Joker made a record-breaking $93.5 million domestic its opening weekend, and very much by design inspired disgusted tweets and stern blog posts about the very notion of Glitter raking in the royalties. The movie’s entire exhausting prerelease hype cycle—from its absurdly rapturous reception at the Venice Film Festival to the media-stoked (and unfounded) fears of theater violence—has relied on this mixture of lurid anticipation and righteous indignation. There is something here to gross out everyone; there is almost nothing else.  Joker, while light-years from any sort of masterpiece, is not a terrible movie: The arresting sight of Phoenix dancing eerily in a cruddy public bathroom, having brutally murdered his first three people, forgives an awful lot, including the fact that the whole movie is shot like all the world is a cruddy public bathroom. But its comically debased intentions, and its endless self-referentiality, and its furious insistence on upsetting everyone at all times guarantee that you’ll walk out of the theater feeling terrible. (The merry cheers in my theater as we watched a terrified little person reach in vain for the locked chain on an apartment door brought me right back to the crowd-pleasing queasiness of the climax of Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.) Empty provocation is one thing. But this is 50 pounds of provocation in a 10-pound bag. Now that it’s finally here, and now that it’s a huge hit, what Joker really ought to make you fear is the All Outrage All the Time cinematic universe it will undoubtedly inspire.  The conventional wisdom in 2019 Hollywood is that only superhero movies make money, and thus all movies must now at least pretend to be superhero movies, and Joker is indeed at its weakest, or at least its thirstiest, when it behaves like a dutiful piece of the wobbly D.C. Comics cinematic empire. Yes, right, the dilapidated city is Gotham City; yes, right, the grimy mental institution is Arkham Asylum; yes, right, the terrified little rich kid’s name is Bruce Wayne. (The revelation that a grown-up Batman’s greatest villain is, like, 60 years old is itself quite a shock.) Maybe 10 percent of that opening-weekend crowd would’ve turned out for this movie if it didn’t have the Batman imprimatur. The 90 percent that would have stayed home would’ve definitely been better off.  Superhero movies, in turn, must now cosplay as classic cinema (shout-out the 1974 paranoid-thriller classic Captain America: The Winter Soldier), which helpfully enrages superhero-averse cineastes. Among everyone else Phillips has offended—top critics, certainly, and also, with his laughable press-tour lament about abandoning comedy due to “woke culture,” at least one actor who actually appeared in Joker—his greatest coup might’ve been the Martin Scorsese–based riot this movie not-so-accidentally touched off. Joker, which costars Robert De Niro as a smug talk-show host, is you might say offensively indebted to 1976’s Taxi Driver (starring De Niro as a troubled loner radicalized by the city he describes as “an open sewer of filth and scum”) and 1982’s The King of Comedy (starring De Niro as a troubled aspiring comedian obsessed with a talk-show host played by Jerry Lewis). As you watch Phoenix navigate a heartless urban wasteland and cry-laugh his way through a disastrous attempt at stand-up comedy, you can nod knowingly at Joker’s good taste while wincing at its craven refractions of past glories. There is no solace in the fact that you’ve definitely seen this movie before.  Meanwhile, last week, Scorsese dismissed Marvel movies as mere “theme parks,” and boom, the comic-book-movie stans are pissed at the Marty stans, and those averse to the oft-ultraviolent spectacle endemic to both the Marvel and Marty camps are pissed at everybody. And suddenly Film Twitter as a whole resembles the unruly and metropolis-leveling mob that our hero eventually inspires in Joker, even as the Joker himself, in yet another provocation, admits that he doesn’t believe in anything, just before his most frightful and public burst of ultraviolence yet. Like the awkward Occupy Wall Street overtones of 2012’s The Dark Knight Rises, Phillips’s movie nods at modern political unease but reduces that energy to its crudest, dumbest form: The Joker quite inadvertently inspires a revolution, and the revolution’s rallying cry quickly morphs from “Fuck the Rich” to “You Get What You Fuckin’ Deserve.” You said it, pal.  There are further meta high jinks in Joker, if you can stand them, including the myriad stage winks to Phoenix’s tiresome history of punking America on late-night talk shows, from David Letterman in 2009 to Jimmy Kimmel last week. But this is all the movie has to offer: Wry and vacuous and morally dubious references to Batman canon, and Scorsese canon, and Joaquin canon, and Trump-era canon, and Superhero-Infestation Hollywood canon. It’s a feature-length trolling campaign with a vaguely movie-like shape, its various beloved costars (from Brian Tyree Henry to Shea Whigham to Marc Maron) crushed under the weight of its cynicism. (The romantic subplot involving Zazie Beetz as a sympathetic neighbor, which gets a pompous, Fight Club–style unbelievable twist, is undercut by the fact that it was never remotely believable in the first place.) Every callback to some other depraved piece of pop culture, from the umpeteenth depiction of the death of Bruce Wayne’s parents to Taxi Driver to “Rock and Roll Part 2,” is designed to trigger your recognition and, exactly one second later, your disgust.  This movie is, emphatically, not a failure, neither in the financial sense nor the artistic sense, if “sickly neon apocalypse” is your preferred artistic mode. But what it succeeds at is painstakingly constructing a safe space in which to celebrate its own total, yawning emptiness. Joker turns nihilism into an Olympic sport, and given that aspiration, if that’s even the right word, there was only one song worthy of the soundtrack.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," The impact of movies is and will always be more than simply their quality, which is why you can’t feel for the aforementioned 1999 David Fincher cult hit only how you feel about the movie when you sit down to watch it. You must consider everything that surrounds the film in question, the conversations around us after we leave the theater. So, no, you’re not going to be able to watch a revisionist film about the Joker made by longtime bro-comedy director Todd Phillips without feeling the impact of the commentary, approach and social ramifications surrounding the film. In and of itself, Joker is mostly a darn good movie played with a loose, anarchistic social commentary. The centerpiece of that commentary is a character that may not be intended as — but can totally be interpreted as — a twisted Pied Piper for the lost and listless.  Joker's titular eventual crown prince of crime is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed stand-up comic — an isolated, bullied loner with a fragile mind, untreated mental illness, delusions of grandeur and bones to pick. Fleck's descent into madness and self-discovery as a villain is at once gripping cinema and bothersome characterization. We didn’t need another Tyler Durden, but we might have just gotten one.  Phillips takes a somewhat cunning approach to the material, essentially recreating pre-Batman Gotham as the New York City of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, spicing it up with the media imagery and commentary found in Sidney Lumet’s Network. Those films certainly inspired their share of controversy and remain lightning rods of ideological discussion — the kinds of films used as twisted statements of purpose in the wrong hands. To their immense credit, though, Scorsese and Lumet's films do function as cautionary tales. In all the worst ways, Joker can lack a sense of perspective in key moments.  Joker’s Fleck is a noxious pastiche of Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin and Howard Beale, played nearly as well as any of those but with only half the nuance in the writing.  Phillips' film plays like blunt-force trauma, the Dark Knight pencil trick tenfold — it works as pitch-black satire, but the subtlety of what Scorsese and Lumet did so well is nowhere to be found. To borrow a phrase from Christopher Nolan’s evil clown, Joker is like a dog chasing cars, with no idea what to do once it catches them. In some moments, the film is downright terrific; in others, it's downright terrifying.  Despite moments that feel like they’re sincerely trying to warn us to about a world that creates Arthur Flecks, Joker often feels unchecked and unkempt in its unforgiving soapboxing and nihilistic, ugly tendencies.  Joker is a good movie, maybe even a great one in some regards. But the problems in its approach run deep, and for the first time in a long time, we might need to really have a serious conversation about how this film might enter our society and what people could take away from it.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 10, 2019"," Do the 23andMe on Todd Phillips' Joker, and most of the DNA is from two Martin Scorsese films: Taxi Driver (1976) and King of Comedy (1983). King of Comedy's influence is clear in the story of a failed comedian. On the Taxi Driver side, we find the influence scriptwriter Paul Schrader brought in from Robert Bresson, a master of austerity. What if Joker had been a movie about a man imploding instead of exploding? Instead of an Au Hasard, Balthazar, Au Hasard, Joker about a man with laughing sickness, stuck in the worst city in the world—a million bleak tenements rimming an erupting volcano of garbage. There'd be no ""cathartic violence"" to allow the wretched Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) pass for anything but a doomed antihero. Budget cuts to the city's mental health program end Fleck's prescriptions for seven different medications; he carries a dogeared card explaining his fits of uncontrollable laughter. Arthur nurses his shut-in mother, Penny (Francis Connor), who bathes in the light of the TV, watching a Johnny Carson surrogate (Robert De Niro). Penny writes unanswered letters to the wealthy thug politician Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who promises Gotham City, Trumpwise, ""Only I can save you."" Penny used to work as a domestic at Wayne Manor. From that point her story gets unreliable.  Arthur works for a rent-a-clown agency with some other grim types, derived from the doughnut-eaters in Taxi Driver—""Another day in Chuckleburg!"" one says. He spins signs, or prances in a cancer ward in front of bald, hollow-eyed kids. His vision of the big time is a slot at an open mic comedy club, and he's collecting gags in his smeary notebook: ""Why are poor people so confused? A: they don't have any cents."" Arthur is bruised skin and bones, with unwashed splotches of greasepaint on his jaw. Shirtless at home, he's crumbled into positions that make him look like a figure in an Oskar Kokoschka painting. The 1970s-oid wardrobe is clownish on everyone: deafening plaids, garish colors and wide lapels. The makeup isn't cheery. The fat lips, the bulbous nose, the black ringed eyes are an ancient code. ""Laugh at this stupid bastard; he just got his ass beat."" One of Joker's few jokes: laying on the asphalt after a stomping, his squirt flower leaks as if Arthur has wet himself. When New York was almost this bad in the mid-'70s, there were nihilist clowns called punk rockers. There were anti-comedians, like Michael O'Donoghue; ""Mr Mike"" would have enjoyed Fleck's idea of a knock-knock joke: ""Who's there?"" ""The police. Your son's been killed by a drunk driver."" There was Andy Kaufman's strategic bombing, murmuring bad jokes in a trans-Danubian accent and dissolving into pretend flop-tears. In performance, Arthur has enough skills to interest pale little Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) wandering alone on the grounds of his family manor; luring him close enough that he can use his fingers to draw the stunned child's mouth into the rictus of a smile. It's all part of Arthur's transformation into a slow-dancing death clown, culminating with the film's most lyrical sequence, a soft-shoe down a littered, ominous staircase.  Phoenix's maniac is never boring, always finding new layers of anguish; it's even remarkable what he does with the cigarettes he chain smokes. When he finally finds his way, his voice is neither young nor old but pedantic—like a put-upon 12-year-old. Odd to see a picture this gigantic, with Hildur Guðnadottir's Icelandic strings groaning away with the noise of a calving glacier, made with nihilist midnight-movie themes. As for whether Joker is what Luis Bunuel called his primordial midnight-movie Andalusian Dog (1929)—""a desperate, impassioned call to murder""—something that copycats will answer: Given all the essays about the irrelevance of movies, it's a sick joke that for once, the influence of film seems to have the power to conjure such a fear. This city-revenge film is smart enough to know that squalor, like waste-water, flows downhill: Arthur's first victims are some rowdy, drunk stockbrokers who want to kick him around for laughs. Among the last images is a tableau familiar from this saga: a little boy in a filthy alley, standing between the bodies of his two parents. As staged here, it leaves us with no hope, no premonition of dashing Bat-adventure. All that can come after this is just a feedback loop of senseless loss and suffering.",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," After talking some serious talk, it was up for debate if The Hangover director Todd Phillips could pull-off the challenge of making Joker a film which sidestepped its comic book origins and deliver something with more gravitas than your usual action-fuelled superhero movie. Amazingly, Phillips has managed to do it, crafting a film which has some hefty dramatic clout – and something to say about the state of society today. It’s not quite the masterpiece that some are saying it is, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a vital piece of cinema.  Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, a lifetime loser who is scraping together a living as a clown and children’s entertainer. Arthur lives with and looks after his ill mother (Frances Conroy), a former employee of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), Gotham’s most powerful citizen and potential candidate for mayor of the city. Fleck is obsessed with becoming a stand-up comedian and every night he watches Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin on his late night talk show.  The world is constantly pushing at Arthur Fleck and he begins to push back, slowly at first but soon he will have the ultimate last laugh.  A film which stands alone from Batman in a general way, Joker still finds itself wrapped in the Dark Knight’s milieu. It’s subtle in its nods to Bob Kane and Bill Finger’s creation but it firmly sits as a film. Phillips’ Joker is brazen in its open homage to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy but it also has certain moments which echo visual cues from William Friedkin’s 1970s masterworks, The French Connection and The Exorcist. For a film which is effectively a character study, Joker packs an impressive visual punch and credit must go to cinematographer Lawrence Sher, who along with composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, has managed to give Phillips’ film some serious weight.  At the centre of Joker is Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck, a powerful performance from an actor who isn’t afraid to go to dark places. Phoenix’s turn riffs on Alan Moore’s seminal 1980s graphic novel, The Killing Joke but it’s very much its own thing. We see a man already at the brink of madness in the films opening frames but that’s only the beginning for what’s in store for this take on one of pop culture’s most iconic villains.  Joker isn’t a film which is enjoyable – it’s tough going and Arthur Fleck isn’t a character who you are meant to like. You can see why there are those who believe this might incite some people to rise up against a world that puts them down, but cinema is a place that (at its best) should offer up challenging and disturbing themes and situations. Joker does this and much more. Is it enjoyable? No. Is it essential viewing? Absolutely. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix, the exceptionally talented actor, three-time Oscar nominee (“The Master,” “Walk the Line,” “Gladiator”) stars in the dark, depressing origin role of 1940s comic book character the Joker, alongside Oscar winner Robert De Niro (“Raging Bull,” “The Godfather: Part II”). Director and co-writer Todd Phillips Oscar nominee (“Borat,”), also known for (“The Hangover” trilogy), is quoted as saying, “I was inspired by the character studies that I watched when I was younger. The look, the vibe, the tone of those films made sense for this story.” The films he’s referring to are “Serpico,” “Taxi Driver,” and “Network.” Fittingly, the setting is 1981 in the dilapidated, crime-ridden Gotham City a.k.a. New York City. “Joker,” the film, is similar to viewing the onset of a colossal gruesome train-wreck, as we view loner Arthur Fleck (Joker) navigate his way in a skewed society that not only kicks Arthur to the curb—he’s labeled as an outcast, and pigeon-holed as a weirdo. Disturbingly depressing, equally creepy, and at times a masterpiece, “Joker” will stay with you long after the credits roll. Joker’s origin story, as viewed by writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver (“The Fighter”), tells of a middle-aged, kind-hearted man who desires to connect with people and to especially please his frail, needy mother (Frances Conroy). By all appearances, she seems to care about her son; she even nicknamed him “Happy,” and tells him to bring joy and happiness into the world. Cue Arthur’s clown job, and the standup comic act. Although, unfortunately, Arthur has the deck stacked against him as his disorder of an uncontrollable bizarre laugh creates awkward situations that only trigger his demise. The initial doting mom storyline seems implausible as the minute we find out that Arthur, was in fact horrifically abused as a child by his mother’s boyfriend while she stood by, not even lifting a finger to stop the abuse creates mistrust. Mistrust in the screenplay and the film as a whole—however, Phoenix, gives a performance of a lifetime—despite an irregular script. The painfully sad backstory transformation of a depressed, clinically ill Arthur Fleck, to that of a sociopath killer, a.k.a. Joker is extremely tough to view. He’s prescribed seven different medications for depression, and tells his caseworker he wants more meds so he can stop feeling so awful. He’s told that the government is cutting back funds, and that she can do nothing more to help him, and that she’ll not be seeing him in the future. Here, society turns it’s back again on Arthur, sending a statement about mental health care. As the film progresses, we view Arthur’s mental deterioration as a fully formed psychosis. All while the script continues to pile on. He’s fired from his ‘rent a clown’ job for destroying his sign, when in fact, a street gang used the wooden sign as a weapon—smashing it downward breaking it on his skull, then kicking and pummeling him in an unsettling brutal back alley scene. Witnessing his continued failures, and beatings are exasperating, building to a crescendo of ‘shock and horror’ when we finally see a shirtless Phoenix—a skeletal figure, with black and blue bruises, the outline of his protruding ribs—a real kill-joy. Phoenix lost 52 pounds for the role, and from this scene forward, we are constantly reminded of his emaciated body, that parallels his depleting soul. The last straw occurs when Arthur appears on his comedic idol Murry Franklin’s (Robert De Niro’s) comedy show as a guest; incidentally, the wide striped colorful curtains are reminiscent of late-night talk show host Johnny Carson’s stage curtains. Again, true to the tone of the script, Franklin initially played nice with Arthur only to turn his back on him by mocking him. We know the retaliation is coming; we’re just not sure the form. Yes, the television sequence is bloody and gory, although not surprising as we’ve previously been subjected to a myriad of bloody violent scenes up to this point. As a Joaquin Phoenix fan since “Gladiator” (2000), I applaud his Joker performance which brought images of Charlize Theron’s serial killer Academy Award winning role in “Monster” (she gained 40 plus pounds for her role), and yes, I thought of De Niro in “Taxi Driver” as well. Though Joker’s gun killing spree is unnerving and uncomfortable, it’s especially so, given today’s mass shooting environment. We’ve already lived through a delusional masked clown persona shoot-to-kill incident—in 2012, Aurora, Colorado in a movie theater during the midnight opening of “The Dark Knight Rises” screening, of which 12 people died and 70 were injured including children. My daughter lived in Denver at the time, and her co-worker was in that theater that night. Needless to say, I was an emotional wreck listening to my daughter on the phone sobbing and I too bursting into tears, and just now reliving this moment, while writing this review—the tears are streaming down my face. But what about those people who died? What about all the victims of mass shootings in this country? In searching for answers, I do feel the film sheds light on mental illness, and the need to elicit kindness in the world. People genuinely are struggling, and as a society, we need to have empathy for those less fortunate, not kick them to the curb. In terms of the film as a whole, I did find that it dragged in a few parts, and the script needed further depth of characters; also, the ‘war on the wealthy’ plot seemed bizarre and unnecessary to the Joker origin tale. The cinematography and art direction are a plus here and at times, spectacular, especially the stairway scene in which Joker celebrates his newfound power. The musical score is a bit off as Eric Clapton’s “White Room,” seemed out of place, whereas the British (“Hey”) or “Rock and Roll Part 2” song seemed perfect, although there’s now a controversy over the songwriter’s 2006 pedophile conviction.",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," The comic book movie gone dangerous, Joker chronicles how  one of fictions great villains descended into murderous madness amidst a rotting  city, brought to life with gritty intensity by director Todd Phillips and led  by an engrossing, fearless, and fearful Joaquin Phoenix.  ""You ask me if I have negative thoughts. All I  have...are negative thoughts"". Madness is all around us, and to a certain  extent, it is also within us. Perhaps it is why stories about the lonely man  who gives into his darkest fears and desires resonate so strongly. Taxi  Driver, Falling Down, Fight Club...all  personify a certain wish fulfilment, a need to roar and gnarl and snap into a  violent rage. Most people have a strong capacity in their life to resist the  need to do such things. Others do not, and too many times we have seen the devastating  aftermath of such mental illness. Joker falls in league with those films, but there is  a catch: where other characters ""snap"", the Joker, aka Arthur Fleck,  ""becomes"". There is a feeling of destiny at play when it comes to  this evolution of disturbed man into ""Crown Prince of Crime"", a  reminder that in the eternal battle between good and evil, everyone has their  part to play. Joker chronicles evil rising within an environment -  dirty, detached, violent, and without sympathy - conditioned to spread its  infection. In a city set to explode, the Joker is the green tipped match.  Set in a 1981 Gotham City that closely resembles the grit  and grim garbage-strike days of early 80s New York, Joker stars  Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. Suffering from a mental illness borne  from head trauma, and detached from a society become increasingly hostile  and unsympathetic, Arthur aspires to become a stand-up comedian while working  as a clown for hire. A series of events leads an already mentally fragile  Arthur to strip away any illusions of normalcy and embrace the dark, murderous  nature of his personality, to become a monster that an underclass of the  disenfranchised embraces as a saviour.  Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) successfully  navigates the comic-book move into exciting, new, and (dare it be said)  dangerous territory. The world building here is more reality based, Phillips  famously avoiding any comic-book source materials to recreate an iconic  character into a menacing, tragic, and scary figure. Phillips strips away the  veneer of the superhero movie and delivers a film stark in tone and dark in  subject. The parallels to a current climate in which masked extremist activists  use violence to intimidate and injure their targets are hard to ignore.  At the centre of all of this is the performance from Joaquin  Phoenix. A razor thin figure of bone and brooding, menacing air, Phoenix takes  to the role of cackling madman with an intense, gritty edge, instilling the  tragic humanity into a monstrous, villainous turn that engrosses and frightens  with equal measure. Popping pills with abandon and attempting to live a life of  normalcy and purpose, Phoenix portrays his Joker as a man who is truly alive  when he scrapes away the mask of civility and leaves blood splattered chaos in  his wake. In the annals of Joker performances, Joaquin Phoenix proves to be the  best yet. Unshackling any notion of ""shared universe""  nonsense and embracing the frightening and dangerous nature of its character, Joker is a stunning example of comic-book filmmaking done with tangible grit and  fearsome artistry. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," At a time when Big Hollywood seems mired in a crisis of creativity, along comes a relatively low-budget studio film boiling with fresh ideas and genuine daring. One of the great things about Joker is that it’s not so much a rebooting but a rethinking of the iconic Batman villain. Technically part of the Batman franchise and the DC Extended Universe, Joker is, in fact, about as anti-franchise a film as you could get in terms of texture and tone. The other great thing is the mesmeric performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Often caked in garish make-up and subject to involuntary bouts of cackling, he delivers a singularly committed, totally compelling turn as a deeply damaged individual with chronic mental issues and a need to be loved in an increasingly hostile and hateful world. Worlds away from the caricatures delivered by Jared Leto (Suicide Squad, 2016) and Jack Nicholson (Batman, 1989), there is a spiritual link to Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), though Phoenix delves much deeper into the disturbed psyche that turns him into a true urban horror. In a bold move, especially for a studio film, director Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver (The Fighter), has stripped away all preconceptions about the character and rebuilt him from the ground up. Plugging the film directly into the social-realist tradition of 1970s American cinema, the story is set in 1981 with Gotham City – a barely veiled New York – ensnared in a garbage strike, a crime wave and growing disrespect for authority, especially the police. Into this steaming stew of urban discontent we meet life-long loser Arthur Fleck, a professional party clown with dreams of being a stand up comic. He shares a squalid apartment with his mum Penny (Frances Conroy) and just can’t get a handle on how to behave around people. Medication and mental health services don’t help much and as Fleck’s prospects become more dire and his world becomes darker he fixates on local tonight show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), who has humiliated Fleck on national TV. Graced with gritty, verite cinematography by Lawrence Sher (War Dogs) that often makes the film look like it was shot in the 1970s, Phillips and Phoenix conjure the most original origin story we’ve yet seen emerge from the comic book movie genre. As violent and as thematically dark as it often is – the story really drills deeply into Fleck’s tortured psychology – the film has moments of sheer brilliance and real bravery, especially when it comes to seeing the world from the point of view of somebody who is clearly deranged, as in Martin Scorsese’s 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver (Scorcese is one of the film’s producers). From the outset of the film’s production, Phillips was determined to avoid comic book cliches, side step fanboy expectations and defy any obligations to fit into the DC movie universe, thus freeing himself and his crew to deliver something truly unique, and at a relatively low cost. (The film’s reported budget of about $60 million is Uber fare compared to the $2-300 million price tag on most comic book films.) Job done. He’s not only achieved that but has done it so well it’s almost impossible to connect this film with the comedy Hangover trilogy he was responsible for. Replete with archival footage, concept drawings and , director by Alexandre O. Philippe (who made the fabulous 2010 doco The People vs George Lucas) takes a deep dive into the making of Ridley Scott’s 1979 sci-fi horror classic Alien and explores why this film – now 40 years old – remains such a pop cultural touchstone that refuses to age. Artists HR Giger and Francis Bacon and director Scott are all highlighted, yet the film’s chief purpose is to pull focus on the work of the late Dan O’Bannon (died 2009) who first dreamt up the idea. Amongst the interviewed is Veronica Cartwright, who was splashed with more blood than anybody during the famous chestburster scene. A must for fans. With more rhetoric than ambition, naive young filmmaker Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) enters a mediocre film school with plans to shoot a drama set in a dying docklands district. Into her life and crammed flat comes Anthony (Tom Burke, from The Musketeers & War and Peace), a laconic foreign office worker and renown moocher whose sophisticated facade hides a slacker with a drug problem. The nuance-rich, slow-burn direction by Joanna Hogg (who also wrote) really works for about the first hour before a dramatic inertia sets in and turns the enterprise into yet another mumblecore dirge about drug addicts. Rare for an arthouse film, Hogg is actually putting the finishing touches on a sequel. Though the production of Rachel Griffiths inspiring, undemanding feel-good family film has nothing to do with Disney, it could easily be mistaken for a Disney film. And that’s no diss. In retelling the true story of Ballarat jockey Michelle Payne, who became the first female to ride the winner of the Melbourne Cup in 2015, Griffiths (working from a screenplay by Andrew Knight and Elise McCredie) has shaped a winning girl-against-the-world tale of personal triumph that dutifully follows all the family film conventions to deliver something satisfying and heartfelt. It’s an impressive debut for veteran actor Griffiths, who embraces the need for big moments, over-sized emotions and clear-cut characters with a warm confidence, creating an easily relatable story bolstered by a sturdy central performance by Teresa Palmer as Payne. We meet her as a young, sparky girl full of the type of ambition TV news crews love. The youngest in a motherless family of ten, she is made more than aware that boys traditionally have the running when it comes to horse racing. Still, her father Paddy (Sam Neill in a role that fits him like a favourite cardigan) is happy to impart the exact type of movie-dad encouragement that will help her hurdle her insecurities and flaws – which are duly highlighted in the film – and follow her dream of winning the Cup. Swiftly paced and sculpted to a very friendly running time, Ride Like A Girl is a solidly entertaining film graced with an underlying set of progressive values about equality, talent, respect and tolerance. Notably, Payne’s brother Stevie, who has Down Syndrome and was a big part of her success, is played by the real Stevie, heralding another step forward in the portrayal of people with disabilities on film. Much can be made for how “with it” the film’s values are, but you know what? When you boil everything down everything in Ride Like a Girl  comes down to the good old Aussie ethos of giving someone a “fair go”. If the movie champions any one value above any others, it’s that. Nothing happens in this film dramatically that isn’t driven by the Aussie tradition of setting aside prejudices and custom (however reluctantly) to allow somebody to have a crack at something, provided they’ve demonstrated genuine talent. Sure, we see Payne receive guffaws of exclusion in the film but they’re never more than hot air that evaporates the more she proves herself. And the film doesn’t patronise her. When she screws up, she pays. In telling of Payne’s triumph the film, thankfully, holds firmly to the principle that just because a film has a strong female lead doesn’t mean it is automatically obligated to reflect some faddish feminist agenda (provided you can discern one). Indeed, one of the terrific things about the film is how it’s primed as an aspirational story about individual triumph rather than as a singularly feminist one. While Griffiths naturally highlights the male domination of the sport and Payne’s determination to break through it, her bumpy ascent is based on merit and the respect she earns comes as a result of hard-earned success. The film has been criticised for not being more politically “woke” and for not getting into the nitty gritty of the horse racing industry, given how the film’s premiere was protested by animal rights activists. The answer to all such carping is simple: it’s nonsense. If you begin to go off on such digressions you’d be making a different film. Another notable thing about Ride Like a Girl is that it serves to reminds us all, as did Oddball and Paper Planes, that the Australian film industry can, indeed, knock out a decent family film when it puts its mind to it. Furthermore, how great is it that Michelle Payne’s story wasn’t allowed to fade away and become some distant memory before somebody got around to making a film about her? In that regard the film follows the American model of celebrating your heroes promptly, and in a way that is enjoyable even to those who might not ordinarily care much about this school of sport. You’d have to be part of that treasured horror movie demographic who jumps with fright whenever somebody spills a box of popcorn to get much spook value out of this slice of sub-Stephen King schlock. The basic story involves a bunch of kids – kids! kids! It’s always kids! – who stumble upon a haunted book in a haunted house that gives the filmmakers sufficient excuse to conjure up a load of singularly unscary ghouls. The film actually starts out OK on Halloween night in 1968 as a group of nerds strike back at their bully tormentors. Things rapidly deteriorate from there. This mess is directed by Norwegian Andre Ovredal (anyone remember the fun Trollhunter from 2010? That was his puppy) and is produced by – wait for it – Guillermo del Toro. That should be warning enough. The prospect of a zombie apocalypse film by veteran arthouse filmmaker Jim Jarmusch –  Stranger Than Paradise, Down by Law, Mystery Train, Night on Earth, Dead Man, Ghost Dog, Coffee and Cigarettes, etc – sounds almost too enticing. Regrettably, the execution just doesn’t do justice to the concept. Set in a small town, the locals (including Bill Murray and Adam Driver as cops) have to deal with the Undead rising from graves after a polar fracking operation goes bad. The leisurely pacing that has become Jarmusch’s signature works well early on but not when things need to get nasty. Not helping matters is a stupid device where certain characters break character and talk through the “fourth wall” – the invisible one between the film and the audience – at the audience about the film. A stupid idea that makes a bad film worse. Oh dear. Even undemanding kids in need of distraction might find it hard not to get restless during this word-heavy, woke animation about a group of Ugly Dolls (based on the toy line) who want to be deemed pretty enough to go out into the real world and be assigned a child. The messaging comes with sledgehammer subtlety, the visuals offer a world of candy-coloured dullness and, despite a stellar voice cast – Kelly Clarkson; Jane Lynch; Wanda Sykes; Blake Shelton; Pitbull; Emma Roberts; Gabriel Iglesias; and Nick Jonas – veteran animator and director Kelly Asbury (Smurfs: The Lost Village; Shrek 2; Spirit; Gnomeo & Juliet) just can’t bring the affair to life. Wait for the stream. The brutal nature of the modern slave trade in South East Asia is exposed in often shocking and violent detail in Australian director Rodd Rathjen’s  extraordinary, gruelling debut feature. Seen through the eyes of impoverished 14-year old Cambodian boy Chakra (Sarm Heng) the simple story follows him as he leaves home in search of a better paying job that will help his family. Soon Chakra becomes virtually imprisoned on a small fishing trawler captained by a brutal thug called Rom Ran (Thanawut Kasro), a criminal whose favourite type of on-board discipline involves dismemberment. Survival becomes Chakra’s key concern as he curries favour with the crew, presenting them with the best fish from each load of sealife they dredge up from the sea floorm most of which will become pet food. There are some pretty intense scenes of violence in the film but, as with Jennifer Kent in The Nightingale, Rathjen has an instinct for knowing just how much to show to deliver full impact without needing to go graphic. The film often takes on a lyrical feel in stretches where there is little dialogue and the boat is framed by a picturesque sea. Cinematographer Michael Latham captures the cruel irony of how the horrors and deprivations that take place on the boat are framed by the exotic, indifferent beauty of the locale. Though it is not stressed strongly enough, the film’s drama is intended to show us the first link in the supply chain of products that end up on our supermarket shelves, and the slave labour involved. The film is designed to deliver a powerful anti-slavery message and has received wide acclaim. At the Berlin Film Festival Buoyancy won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and it will be Australia’s submission for the Best International Feature Film Oscar (where it will compete for a berth on the short list with about 80 films from around the world). Fresh from the film’s packed sessions at the Melbourne International Film Festival, Rathjen was eager to speak to us about the making of the film, the difficulties of production and what impact he hopes it will make. We also spoke to supply chain expert Kate Skattang to pull focus on the slavery situation around the world and especially in South East Asia. She explains how recent legislation will compel companies to closely examine their product supply chains to help expose and eradicate slavery, though it’s early days yet. At a guess, the global slave market involves around 40 million people.",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," As with seemingly every facet of modern American existence, Joker, Todd Philips' nihilistic tale of one of America's most recognizable villains, has been analyzed as much for how it relates to these Trumpian times as its artistic merits. Film critics and political commentators alike have been firing off hot takes about whether Joaquin Phoenix's awe-inspiring portrayal of a painfully lonely man being pushed past his breaking point by an uncaring society is irresponsible in our modern landscape of far-right and incel-fueled mass shootings. Sometimes lost in the noise is the plain fact that Joker contains modern cinema's finest male actor delivering his greatest performance, a mélange of loneliness, mental illness and stunningly poetic physicality. The film, as much an ode to gritty 1970s cinema as it is a Joker backstory, undoubtedly revels in Arthur Fleck's tragic transformation into the laughing homicidal maniac we all know. But it's less of an endorsement of such actions and more of a celebration of the dark character at the center of the narrative. His archaic views about ""PC culture"" aside, Philips has created a pitch-black cinematic world where the have-nots have been pushed beyond the brink by the ever-widening gap between them and the privileged, and brought forth from Phoenix a performance that will be studied as long as cinema exists. Joker forces America to stare into the face of what we've wrought as a people—perhaps that's what people are so opposed to seeing. R. DONOVAN FARLEY.

"Oct 10, 2019"," “I literally described to Joaquin [Phoenix] at one point in those three months as like, ‘Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film.’ It wasn’t, ‘We want to glorify this behavior.’ It was literally like, ‘Let’s make a real movie with a real budget and we’ll call it [expletive] Joker’. That’s what it was.” Joker is certainly a movie. A grossly misguided and irresponsible one that co-opts a beloved character, turning him into a vile martyr for a dangerous revolution. Don’t get me wrong, I am vocal in my defence of comic book movies; the argument that they are not ‘cinema’ is simply narrow-minded (if a film moves you then it is cinema). But this film is not about the Joker, the campy Gotham City crime boss who oozes charisma and showmanship. This is a film about a mentally ill man who does terrible things because he wants to be ‘seen’, and Todd Phillips validates and celebrates him every second of it, turning this villain into a hero. The way that Joker seeks to remove itself from comic book lore in some self-congratulatory way – in Phillips’ own words, this is a “real movie under the guise of a comic book film” (okay sure) – is part of the reason it fails. Co-written with Scott Silver, the pair invent their own origin for the Clown Prince of Crime. They pen the lonely figure that is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a rent-a-clown who cares for his ageing mother in a run-down flat, and who is constantly trodden on by society. Phillips’ Gotham is realised well enough, seedy and grim, featuring Thomas Wayne running for mayor with a not-so-subtle anti-poor agenda. But every attempt to condemn mental health service cuts, capitalism, loss of civility and empathy, feels messy and forced. It is so far removed from its supposed origins that it’s just an empty imitation. The awkward, cringe-inducing humour of Joker relies on punchlines of ableism and misogyny, and you may find yourself, as I did, trying to justify it. It’s set in the 80s, it was ‘okay’ back then – then you wonder what reason it had to be set in the 80s at all, other than perhaps an excuse for its crude, distasteful script. Phoenix does his best, straining for a graceful performance of operatic levels. He has once again transformed his body, and his maniacal laugh (brought on at inconvenient times due to a medical condition) is convincing and jarring. Yet even he can’t save this film from its self-importance. Joker isn’t a work of genius, it’s not radical, bold, nor right-wing propaganda. It’s just a movie, and a bad one. It’s not fun, but impossible to take seriously. Phillips thinks he has made comic book movies appeal to the ‘elite’ cinephiles – but instead he’s made a shallow shit show that pats itself on the back for two hours and two minutes. If you’re after an engaging take on a Joker origin story that takes place in a vivid and vibrant criminal underworld, just watch Gotham on Netflix.  people like this author do not deserve a job at critiquing others. you don’t know what you are talking about, and you definitely should not be writing articles on movies you can’t even comprehend.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," 
	The supposedly incendiary film from director Todd Phillips – heretofore best known for his Hangover bromances – forces us to pick sides, so we’ve been told. By seeing the film we’re condoning the film’s over-sympathetic look at the type of disenfranchised white male responsible for most of the shooting sprees in the U.S. (including the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, shooting at a screening of Batman film The Dark Night Rises). But boycotting Joker is censorship, and censorship of any art form based on its moral position or likelihood to inspire violence is a slippery slope toward creative suffocation. 
	The fact is, Joker is a good film, not a great film. It’s a booming entry into the DC Comics universe, a credible backstory for one of its most beloved villains, and a standalone character study that should satisfy fans along with those who have never seen a film in the Batman canon. But it’s simply not important enough to shoulder the burden of potential violence from every hate-filled misogynist, member of the incel community, or frustrated loner who goes to see it. 
	The story is set in 1981 Gotham, a rat-infested, graffiti-ridden, city of squalor not unlike NYC in the same timeframe, but a far more contrived cesspool of misery. Among the miserable is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown by day and failed comedian by night. He lives with his ill mother (Frances Conroy) and dreams of appearing on a Johnny Carson-style late-night show hosted by Murray Franklin. Franklin is played by none other than Robert De Niro in a role-reversal from 1982’s The King Of Comedy (De Niro is felt onscreen even when he is absent: Joker is beholden in no small part to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy for much of its content). 
	The film is topical: not just from the white-male angst as a source of mayhem, but also in the social movement Arthur inspires after his first outburst of violence. The hopes of the Occupy Wall Street and We Are the 99 Per Cent movements have been buried under the clownish politics of the current White House administration, so a cinematic uprising against authority and the social elite is well-timed. Less comforting is the film’s kind of beck-and-call response to the #MeToo movement: this is why we are the way we are, say those like Arthur, we can’t help ourselves. 
	But then there’s Phoenix’s performance. The actor claims to have lost 52 pounds for the role, and his thin, hollowed-out features suggest Arthur is too depressed to eat. His face and body contort as though possessed, he sweats and cries and suffers, and laughs, of course. Those fans possessive of Heath Ledger’s performance in 2008’s The Dark Knight, for which Ledger won a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar, should be gratified by the fact that Phoenix appears to commit all to the role. Talk of an Academy Award nomination is already everywhere. The role itself, however, fails to connect, feeling more like pomp and posturing than a real-world study of mental illness. 
	But that’s how it’s meant to be. This is a comic book, after all: the real world should only seep in so far. See Joker, or don’t see it: just don’t make any sweeping statements before you do.",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," Back in 2017, long before Todd Phillips's Joker became a contentious media fiasco, Deadline announced that the DC villain origin film would be produced by Martin Scorsese. The idea that Scorsese would be bringing his signature brand of auteur legitimacy and emotionally-relentless storytelling to the comic book genre felt like a welcome breath of fresh air for an industry fraught with predictable, commercialized superhero franchises. Deadline reported that Joker would take place in an early-1980s Gotham City, a gritty and grounded character study, resembling fan-favorite Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and even the director's lesser-known 1983 dark comedy, The King of Comedy. Though the early reports were eventually proven to be misleading (the legendary director allegedly turned down the gig in favor of the Irishman production) Joker does end up resembling those three films in some very blunt and overt ways.  But just because Joker succeeds in looking like these films, it doesn't mean that Phillips also managed to convey their original meaning. Whereas Scorsese always reveals himself to be a empathetic filmmaker first and foremost, Phillips has shown in his first foray into dark, character-centric storytelling that his disposition as a filmmaker is much more cynical and cold than the famous Italian-American screen giant. By presenting us with a narrative bereft of comedy, without a clear voice of reason, in a world that is as un-ironic as it is disturbing, Joker functions as a Scorsese movie devoid of Scorsese's most important quality: humanity. Phillips manages to capture Scorsese's spirit without its soul, making Joaquin Phoenix's take on the villain feel less like the Clown Prince of Crime and more like a Frankenstein monster of 1970s and 80s Scorsese movie references. From the outset, Joker most noticeably resembles Taxi Driver. Phillips's film has a grainy, brown-red-yellow color palette. The characters feel trapped in their dingy and inhumane low-income apartments. The film takes place around a seedy pre-Giuliani-esque Times Square, and like Manhattan in Taxi Driver, Phillips's Gotham City is scum-infested and absolutely merciless. Fleck even hangs out in a working-class locker room full of other loners and Times Square-types. One of these men in Fleck's circle is played by Glenn Fleshler, and resembles the towering presence of the character Wizard in Taxi Driver. But, where Wizard provided the voice of reason in Taxi Driver, Fleshler's similar character is inexplicably malicious—and is brutally murdered in Joker. Wizard's speech in Taxi Driver is often pointed to as a strikingly human moment of the story—one that is iconic for outlining the moral soul that's possible within the fiction of the movie. But, in Joker's attempt to pay homage to this character type, the film misses the point. It's hard to say why Phillips chose to drain that character of his humanity. But it certainly makes Joker a chilling response to the already thoroughly upsetting world of Taxi Driver. Although, unlike Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver, Joaquin Phoenix does not provide narration in Joker, the film puts Arthur Fleck's journal front and center. The image of the protagonist's notebook, which is also routinely shown in Taxi Driver, is a Robert Bresson-inspired Scorsese trademark, an unmistakable point of reference that both Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader would return to throughout their careers. Schrader even used it just last year in his fantastic Ethan Hawke-starring film, First Reformed.  But, where Taxi Driver explored the emotional complexities of a fictionalized character—the nuances of evil—Joker fails in its writing of Arthur Fleck. What's worse is that Joker, as a known character in cinema, is beloved by comic book and movie fans. Because of softer portrayals in the past, there's a certain amount of pre-conditioned sympathy for the character that doesn't belong in a story of this nature. Travis Bickle, was of course, a misunderstood character in cinema who existed in a very different time and place, and whose portrayal has vastly different connotations in 2019. These nuances are important for a film that delves into such controversial, real world subject matter—Scorsese's heart and moral focal point is what makes Taxi Driver a unique and valuable character study. When The King of Comedy debuted in 1982, fans expected a triumphant return to form for Scorsese. The director had been recovering from health complications and had been hospitalized leading up to the production. Scorsese was coming back to shoot the place he knew best–New York City–and with him was his longtime mainstay Robert De Niro. But, what audiences got in King of Comedy was something much darker, weirder, and lonelier than they expected. The film, which starred Jerry Lewis as a talk show host who is kidnapped and tortured by Rupert Pupkin—a sad, unsuccessful, and psychopathic comedian played by Robert De Niro—was not loved in its time. Shot in long, still compositions without any of Scorsese's trademark handheld photography, King of Comedy was misunderstood in its time. But it has since garnered a sizable fanbase who see the pitch-black comedy of the film as vastly influential and important for cinema–a fanbase that happens to include Todd Phillips. Phillips's concept for Joker seems to be something of a spiritual successor to King of Comedy. Robert De Niro, instead of playing the sad loner type, has now become the powerful talk show host with whom the main character is infatuated. Like in King of Comedy, Arthur Fleck vividly fantasizes about being on the Carson-esque talk show. Fleck's mother, like Pupkin's, is oppressive and disapproving–but also stands as the one tether to reality that the protagonist has in the film. And, like Pupkin, Fleck is truly atrocious as a comedian. He lacks a basic understanding of how jokes function, partly because comedy is based on an understanding of human empathy–of which sociopathic characters like Fleck and Pupkin are almost wholly deprived.  In both films, the sad clowns manage to become massively successful as comedians, offering a commentary on how the American media landscape both oppresses and idealizes outsiders. But what makes King of Comedy so effective–and human–in its commentary, is that, well, the film is hilarious. Not in a laugh-out-loud, knee-slapping way. But in a darkly acerbic and ironic sense that makes it impossible to take seriously. One look at Pupkin–a character whose name is constantly mistaken for Pumpkin, Pipkin, etc–will have you chuckling at the sheer stupidity of it all. He has a tiny mustache, a glitzy show-biz mentality, believing himself to be a comic genius despite his unavoidably pathetic reality. He wears bright red jackets, he cracks shitty one-liners. Scorsese's presentation of the character is not unlike the buffoons in The Three Stooges: though Pupkin may take himself seriously, he is undeniably a twit. We can't say the same for Mr. Fleck in Joker. His plight as a mentally-ill loner is so tragic, yet also so repulsive, that when he succeeds in the end, it's unclear if the audience is supposed to be disgusted or happy with him. Phillips's reliance on Frank Sinatra soundtrack cues is also something that brings Scorsese to mind. The Italian-American director is known for using show stopping big band music in his films, and in Joker, Phillips frequently plays the 1966 Sinatra recording of ""That's Life."" The song tells the simple story of a man who continually gets knocked down in life, but always gets back on his horse. By playing it so much–and by having Joaquin Phoenix even mouth the words of the song in the film's ending–we're left with the idea that this song seems to represent the message that Phillips is seeking to send to audiences in his film. Sure, Fleck is knocked down a whole lot in Joker. And he certainly manages to bounce back too. But after seeing all the shooting, stabbing, killing, carnage, crying, and laughing presented without morals in Phillips's film, Joker doesn't feel like a story of redemption or of warning at all. It feels like a gradual loss of humanity. And for Scorsese, the filmmaker who once called movies ""An act of faith,"" all the references in Phillips's film don't feel like they're homages–they feel like blasphemy.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," It’s impossible to watch Joker without being aware of some of the political controversy surrounding the movie. Within months, it went from winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival to inspiring a hysteria that finds the NYPD making a show of force at New York screenings, while theater chains are banning masks and facepaint. The film, some critics warned, was an irresponsible ode to incels, a project that lionizes just the sort of disturbed and hateful men who terrorized the nation with 26 mass shootings over the summer of 2019 alone.  But during a press conference last month, director Todd Phillips told reporters that Joker “is not a political film,” a statement that reportedly elicited laughs from those in attendance. How could a film about a struggling, disaffected white man turning to violence and inspiring a mass uprising by the poor not be about politics?  At the time, I thought Phillips's claim of the film’s apolitical nature was a dodge—which it probably was. But after seeing Joker, I think he’s more right than not. Joker is a movie aware of politics, but it chooses not to reckon with political issues in any real way. Instead, it throws references at the wall, grasping for a gravitas and authenticity to counter Marvel’s family friendly cartoonishness. Wayne Enterprises’ Thomas Wayne, running for mayor of Gotham, is cast as a more benign Trump figure, crossing from the business world into politics with promises that he alone can save a city plagued by crime, poverty, filth, and super rats. After Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck is beaten up by drunken Wall Street-type louts while riding the subway in full clown make-up, he shoots them dead in an attack with echoes of the Bernie Goetz case that divided 1980s New York.  But there’s a lack of analysis as to how politics work, and why politics matters. The murder of the businessmen helps inspire a mass uprising by Gotham’s poor, who don clown masks as they take to the streets. In reality, cruelly bloody displays tend to disrupt organizing efforts, not strengthen them. Even the unabashed racists of the alt-right found their coalition fractured after one in their number murdered Heather Heyer at Charlottesville—and there’s no way a significant number of Americans from any community would take the face of a mass killer as a symbol for its political movement. But because the film doesn’t have any convictions at its heart, other than a childishly nihilistic insistence that everyone is bad all the time,  it assumes that no one else does either. John Cages’ “I have nothing to say and I am saying it” feels like Joker’s accidental tagline.  This profound misunderstanding of aggrieved working people is paired with other missteps. There are two characters in the film who undergo treatment for mental illness, and each inflicts serious harm to others. Meanwhile, in real life, the mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of it.  Joaquin Phoenix does turn in the powerfully evocative performance promised, even if he chews, swallows, and positively digests the scenery, contorting his shrunken frame as he sprints and dances from scene to scene. His Joker absorbs so much pain and inflicts so much more than the film is truly at times difficult to watch.  But for all the muddled messaging of this dark, nihilistic film, I couldn’t summon any sense that it was truly threatening. It’s too clumsy, too grab-bag, the sort of movie that precocious middle schoolers too cynical to allow themselves to properly enjoy Endgame are bound to latch onto. It’s a film where true clunkers like, “I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize that it’s a fucking comedy,” are treated with the gravity of Ozymandias’ epitaph. If anything, some of the panic around the film feels like a pre-internet relic from a time when some legitimately feared that Natural Born Killers and Marilyn Manson would drive youth to murder. The kids, most of whom are alright but some of whom are Nazis, are of course worth worrying over. But we know what allows incels to spread their toxic ideology—tech companies reluctant to shut down the corners of the internet where they congregate. We know what causes senseless mass murder—lack of gun control. Compared to those real life menaces, there’s little in Joker to fear. There’s little in Joker at all.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 9, 2019"," Walking out of the cinema after watching Joker, the thing in my mind wasn’t Joaquin Phoenix’s extraordinary performance (though it is quite extraordinary), nor was it the sublime feat of direction by Todd Phillips (all the more sublime considering this is the guy who duuuuded out the Hangover trilogy), but simply this: it’s gross. It’s a gross film. It’s. Really. Fucking. Gross. Granted, I know, gross isn’t exactly a film-critic term. But then Joker isn’t exactly a film. For one, it doesn’t so much contain a plot as a series of brutal jolts to the senses. It doesn’t so much contain characters as people who take and people who get taken. It doesn’t so much end as unexpectedly climax. It’s porn, in other words, only without the nuance and occasional moments of care. I’m not saying it’s not stimulating if you’re into this kind of thing; I just don’t want to sit next to you while you’re being stimulated. For the uninitiated, we’re back in the comic book city of Gotham, only this time in the Eighties, allowing the art director to pile the trash high and spread the grime thick. There’s no Batman in sight – at least not as a man – and that, as the marketing material would have us believe, is the point. This is an origin story, but not any origin story. It's the origin story of a villain, but not any origin story of a villain. It's an origin story that is purposefully standalone, not a start of a superhero series, but a character study of a man. This is fine as it goes, and going in cold I was as excited as anyone. Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker? What’s not to like? But if you’re making a character study, shouldn’t you, at some point, study character? No such luck. We meet Phoenix’s sad-sack Arthur Fleck, a skeleton who was at the back of the line when it came to flesh and who lives with his infirm mother in an apartment block that can be best described as post-apocalyptic chic. Fleck makes a living clowning for a clown agency and his days are mostly taken by holding signs outside of stores and scaring the remaining life out of sick kids in hospitals. When he accidentally drops a gun at the latter – given to him by a fellow clown; it’s tough out there for jesters – his life starts to unravel. You know: more so. Fleck has a disorder that means he laughs involuntarily in awkward social situations, and a business card that informs people of the condition, to be given while he’s convulsing. He’s on seven different medications, we learn at one point. What for? Who knows? In fact, the only thing we do know about his meds is that he wants more of them. More of which one, you ask? Joker does not bog itself down with such details. It wants to be taken seriously, but never gives us a reason that we should. Is it too much to ask if there’s a point to all this? Apparently so, and here’s where Joker as a film starts to curdle from clumsily dim-witted to accidentally dangerous. Finding that others soon join him in dressing like a clown and killing people – and after being humiliated by a talk-show host, played by Robert De Niro, and exacting his revenge – our villain soon finds himself the movie's hero. And this, believe it or not, is the point: Phillips is so deeply, desperately, embarrassingly in love with Phoenix’s performance that the camera never leaves him, never comes up for air once, and, as a result, never for a second gives anyone else agency or import or, by my count, more than three lines in a row. It’s not so much a horror film from the monster’s perspective as a computer game from one. And not a modern computer game either, but one from the Nineties in which people disappear after you kill them and only say ""Die!"" or ""Argghh!"" Now, I don’t believe – as has been suggested by some – that it’s an intentional right-wing battle-cry, the Joker as a poster incel for all the angry and dispossessed loner-loons out there (but hi! I’m sure you’ll come say hello on Twitter! How’s all the masturbation going?), because, well, that would be crediting Joker with at least some kind of intelligence. It’s not so much an absence of morality that it suffers from as a vacuum of thought. Imagine American Psycho from the perspective of a director who’s really into business cards and promotions and you start to appreciate the problem. What enters that vacuum, then, is a sort of stumbled-upon nihilism, an accidental call-to-cray-cray, a whoops-I’ve-inceled-again dumb explosion of a film. A stupid person’s idea of a “dark” movie, a teenager’s idea of a good one. Phillips has been giving interviews patiently explaining to us lib-tards why he had to leave the world of comedy behind and go make incel propaganda – sorry, drama – instead. “Lol, he funny,” responded the director Taika Waititi on Twitter, who’s about to release a comedy in which he plays Hitler as the imaginary best friend of a boy in the Nazi youth. Watching Joker, I couldn’t help thinking of something that, years ago, the showrunner Dan Harmon told me. This was back in 2006, before Harmon was the celebrated comic brain behind Community and Rick & Morty. He was mostly known at the time as the cocreater of the website channel101.com, where members of the public could submit their digital shorts to be voted on, with the most successful staying on for extra episodes. A kind of X Factor for the comedy kids. While some submissions were huge successes – one long-running series, House Of Cosbys, introduced Harmon to his future Rick & Morty cocreator, Justin Roiland – others were, to put it mildly, less so. “There's a certain category we get from 15-year-old rich kids,” Harmon told me at the time, “where they run around doing rape jokes, shooting women in the pussy, being vaguely racist or eating shit.” Kids, in other words, who’d been insulated from consequence and desensitised to violence and who think comedy and shock are one and the same. And maybe more simply: kids who think it’s funny just because they haven’t grown up yet. I thought about that because if you ever wanted to know, if you ever wondered, what those kids might make if you gave them a $50 million budget, a decent cinematographer and a an Oscar-nominated actor to star, well, it would probably look something like Joker. Yes, it’s beautiful to look at. And, sure, it’s a remarkable performance from one of the acting talents of his generation. But to give it five stars for that, to review it in a bubble and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist, is not just naive but dangerous. You may as well judge a snuff film by the work of the Steadicam. And yet, the worst thing is Joker is so shallow it doesn’t deserve the attention. It really doesn’t! It’s shallow, it’s dumb, it’s gross, it’s goddamn garbage!",NEGATIVE

Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Mucho se ha dicho y escrito ya sobre “Guasón”, y aunque admito que he llegado un poco tarde a la fiesta, no podía dejar de comentarla. Después de todo, ¿cuándo fue la última vez que una película basada en personajes de cómics gana un premio en el Festival de Venecia? ¿O cuándo fue la última vez que vieron una cinta de DC o Marvel que no tenga ningún tipo de conexión con el resto de la franquicia? De la misma manera que “El caballero de la noche”, de Christopher Nolan, o “Logan”, de James Mangold, “Guasón” resalta porque se trata de una película que intenta hacer algo diferente con el subgénero. Por más que haya disfrutado (muchísimo) de “Avengers: Endgame”, no son dos películas comparables; puede que tengan influencias similares en el papel, pero en la pantalla grande, son producciones con objetivos e identidades completamente diferentes. Mezclando el realismo del cine de Christopher Nolan (y hasta elementos de su versión de Ciudad Gótica en la trilogía de “El caballero de la noche”), con claras influencias de clásicos como “Taxi Driver” o “El rey de la comedia”, “Guasón” termina siendo un filme inesperado pero muy coherente con nuestros tiempos. Decidido a mostrar lo que la violencia, el caos, y por qué no, la locura podría hacer con un personaje como este, Todd Phillips ha decidido alejarse de la comedia para hacer de “Guasón” un filme innegablemente violento, pero absolutamente fascinante. Quienes la declaren una absoluta obra maestra están exagerando un poco, pero a la vez, no se puede negar que es la película de DC más original e intensa de los últimos años. Hasta me dan ganas de perdonarles lo decepcionante que fue “La Liga de la Justicia”. El gran Joaquin Phoenix interpreta a Arthur Fleck, un hombre severamente medicado que trabaja como payaso en una versión caótica, sucia y violenta de Ciudad Gótica en los años 80 (aunque estéticamente hablando, parece más la década de 1970). Vive con su madre, la inválida Penny (Frances Conroy) y trata de ganarse la vida actuando en restaurantes o hasta en hospitales para niños. Desgraciadamente, su vida no podría ser más triste: nadie lo valora, nadie lo ve, incluso, y hasta cuando las cosas parecen mejorar un poco al entablar una relación con su vecina, Sophie (Zazie Beetz), todo eventualmente regresa al status quo. Es ahí que Arthur, armado con una pistola que le regaló un compañero de trabajo, pierde todo tipo de control, y sin querer, comienza una suerte de movimiento anárquico en Gótica, el cual podría tener más repercusiones en la sociedad de lo que cualquiera creería inicialmente.  Una película como “Guasón” podría ser “peligrosa” únicamente en un país como Estados Unidos; por algo ya han salido varios comunicadores y periodistas estadounidenses a decir que la proyección del filme podría traer consigo varias consecuencias. Se trata, después de todo, de una película sobre un personaje violento, de alguien que eventualmente se convertirá en un villano, y que nos pide que entendamos sus circunstancias y el razonamiento detrás de sus acciones, mas no que empaticemos con él, y mucho menos que nos identifiquemos con él. Es una línea muy delgada entre la empatía y la comprensión, sí, pero es una que tanto Phillips como Phoenix manejan muy bien, pero que podría ser malentendida en el país de las hamburguesas y las metralletas. No obstante, considerando eso, se puede decir que “Guasón” es un estudio de personaje fascinante, el cual muestra a un hombre que, sin llegar a encontrar mayores soluciones, decide recurrir a la violencia simplemente para sentir que la gente le hace caso. Es una suerte de llamada de auxilio, sí, pero una que no mide las consecuencias de sus actos; la cinta nunca trata de justificar los momentos más violentos en los que se ve involucrado Arthur ni mucho menos. De hecho, es con el primero donde uno se da cuenta que no podrá dar vuelta atrás, y es particularmente con el segundo, que uno se da cuenta que, por fin, se ha convertido en el “Guasón”, dejando de lado su previa identidad, la cual era mucho más humana y racional. “Guasón”, por ende, es una historia de origen que desarrolla la transformación de un hombre a un ícono; de persona a símbolo de una revolución inesperada pero (aparentemente) necesaria. Joaquin Phoenix está simplemente genial como Arthur Fleck / El “Guasón”. Se transformó completamente para el rol, perdiendo muchos kilos de peso, y otorgándole una forma muy particular de moverse al personaje, convirtiéndolo casi en un insecto que se contorsiona y ríe sin parar. No se trata de una burla de la gente con problemas mentales —creo que, posiblemente, lo sería si es que no viésemos todo desde la perspectiva de Arthur—, pero sí de una historia que nos muestra lo que puede pasar cuando alguien con muchísimos problemas y tendencias violentas no es supervisado constantemente. Se trata de una actuación intensa y prácticamente perfecta, la cual no llega a suplantar a la de Heath Ledger en “El caballero de la noche”; creo que ambas pueden convivir sin mayores problemas. Lo que “Guasón” tampoco hace, además, es glorificar la violencia. A diferencia de muchas películas de acción norteamericanas para mayores de 14 años, los momentos de violencia en “Guasón” no son muchos, y cuando se llevan a cabo, son brutales y sangrientos. Esto es para demostrar que la violencia sí tiene consecuencias; que la violencia puede acabar con vidas innecesariamente, y que puede ser el resultado de la forma de actuar de una persona que no tiene el control sobre su vida o sus pensamientos. “Guasón” no es una película para niños o adolescentes en lo absoluto; no se trata de una romantización del mundo de los superhéroes y villanos, si no más bien de un estudio psicológico y físico de alguien que toma un camino oscuro y decide no dar vuelta atrás. “Guasón” funciona no solo porque no se parece en nada a la mayoría de películas basadas en cómics que vemos todos los años, sino también porque se trata de un drama impecablemente actuado y dirigido, el cual no necesita de secuelas, precuelas o spin-offs para satisfacer. Sí, el segundo acto puede resultar un poco letárgico y redundante, por momentos, y sí, Zazie Beetz está terriblemente malgastada en un rol poco importante (aunque el hecho de que sea poco importante es eventualmente justificado por el guion). No obstante, entiendo por qué existe tanta emoción y discusión en relación a “Guasón”; es una película que no lo deja indiferente a uno, sino que más bien se queda grabada en su cerebro, debido a algunas de las imágenes e ideas más intensas e intrigantes con las que cuenta. Incluso considerando sus más claras influencias, “Guasón” es de los filmes más fascinante que he visto este año, no solo gracias al trabajo de Phillips (¿quién ya no volverá a hacer comedias, aparentemente…?), si no también a la magistral actuación de Joaquín Phoenix. Nada mal, DC, nada mal.",POSITIVE
"Oct 9, 2019"," Given that the film has broken the US box office record for October, this review of Joker will be another chapter of Did I Watch A Different Movie? An opening haul of US$96 million (S$132.5m) in the US and S$1.89 million in Singapore is impressive, and part of that success is down to the compelling physicality of Joaquin Phoenix's performance. As Arthur Fleck, there is his twisted, depleted body, his dancing and even his laughing to the point of choking. You will find it hard to tear your eyes away. The score and set design are also stunning, building the tension of a Gotham that convincingly mirrors the rundown New York of 1981, when the Big Apple really was rotting. Rather than being smart, this film is often so obvious, you have answered a flat ""Yes"" before it gets to ask, ""Do you see what I did there?"" Joker serves more as Phillips' homage to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy. To the point that you wonder if Joker has been used a Trojan clown.  Aside from sharing plot points, Easter eggs are strewn in plain view, which along with the Batman references, are just too much of a wink to the audience  for a film aiming for seriousness. The jury is out on whether the use of a track by convicted paedophile Gary Glitter for the scene of Joker dancing down some steps is misguided or a lame attempt at edginess. Either way, it has to be accepted that the mix of those visuals with a different tune was much more effective in the trailer. There are so many missed opportunities – in particular the scenes with Zazie Beetz. They could have played a much bigger role in Arthur's descent but are too casually brushed aside. You have to make a few logic leaps to get Fleck to the third act. Some point to those being down to the ""unreliable narrator"" aspect. Some could also say it's just sloppy story-telling. With no huge plot surprises, it's another case of waiting for a film to make reveals you had figured out much earlier. Less ""Ta-daa"", more ""Ta-duh"". There’s nothing here to suggest this Joker is a man with a plan. Everything happens to him, at no point is he controlling his destiny. He's almost an observer in his own story. The really annoying thing is that at the end of the day, this is a film about a man's breakdown albeit with some DC Comics properties slapped on it. And yet, Joker is the rarest of films – for all its flaws, it is still one that needs to be seen and can't be ignored.  THE SKINNY: Life is not good for downtrodden clown-for-hire Arthur Fleck (Phoenix). A carer for his mother and afflicted with an uncontrollable cackle, he loses himself in fantasies of gaining fame as a stand-up comedian. After being beaten up, he is given a gun. Then his life goes from bad to worse.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 9, 2019"," Jaundiced and judicious, deeply cynical yet not quite ready to leap into the abyss, Joker is a provocatively toxic time capsule for an era of misguided rage. It’s galling, and pretty great. Don’t laugh. For Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), laughter is a curse. Arthur suffers from something like pseudobulbar affect, a condition which makes it seem as if his emotions are on the fritz. He cackles uncontrollably in serious situations—especially when things are tense or he’s nervous. We first see him looking into a mirror, aggressively trying to form his face into the “appropriate” expression with his fingers, as if his skin was made of Silly Putty. Everyone else seems to manage their emotions so easily; why can’t he? Arthur’s frail mother (Frances Conroy) claims that his laughing means he was meant to bring joy into the world. But his awkward appearances as a clown for hire and his disastrous attempts at stand-up comedy suggest otherwise. Even in the audience, Arthur can’t laugh correctly. When he reads (or more often misreads) the social cues around him and tries to join in with others’ laughter, he unleashes a harsh, forced caw that gets uncannily cut short. As he did in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, Phoenix employs physicality to convey an internal brokenness, a man whose wires seem to be crossed. (The wayward strings in Hildur Guðnadottir’s terrific score, which seemingly swerve when they should be holding still, provide an audible variation of what we see on Arthur’s face.) In Joker, Arthur’s plight is at once personal and corporate. Outside the dingy apartment Arthur shares with his mother, a garbage strike has left filth piling in the streets and led to “super rats” breeding in the alleys. Wealth is concentrating among the few—including Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who dismisses those demonstrating against class inequality as “clowns” and pledges to run as mayor in order to clean things up. At the same time, funding is cut for social programs like the one keeping Arthur in therapy and under medication. “It is certainly tense,” his social worker tells him. And this is before her department is shut down, just one of the dominos that leads to Arthur’s fall into criminal madness, his giving over to the persona from which the movie gets its name. In Tim Burton’s Batman, Jack Nicholson’s Joker arose from a vat of burbling green chemicals. Phoenix’s clown crawls out of an existential stew, one more specific but also diffuse, in which untreated mental illness, disenfranchisement of various kinds, easy access to guns, and the failure of institutions swirl about and eventually bubble over in violent fits of horrific, self-justified anger. Phoenix’s performance is the centrifugal force of the movie, and not just because of what he does with his face. Limbs askew and limp hair flailing, he runs down alleys and hallways as if he’s wearing clown shoes, even when he’s not. There’s an arresting moment, after he’s committed his first act of violence while defending himself against a trio of abusive bros on a subway car, in which Arthur hides in a public restroom and begins performing something like tai chi. Perhaps he learned it in therapy, as a form of relaxation, but when he sees himself in the mirror he begins to morph his movements into a form of dance. It may be the first time in his life that Arthur has actually “won.” No longer seeing himself as a victim in need of healing, he begins to perform the part of triumphant entertainer. Director Todd Phillips, who wrote the script with Scott Silver, gives Phoenix’s performance a fitting frame. It’s not just the dankness of the cinematography (though Lawrence Sher does lend the film a fetid glow); it’s also the oppressive mise en scene. There is a long, tall series of steps leading from one Gotham street to another that appears a few times in the film. The first time they’re featured, we see Arthur climbing up toward the camera at the top; though he’s rising, the drab buildings on either side—and the similarly gray architecture across the horizon behind him—make him appear trapped. He can’t escape his own, or Gotham’s, desolation. Emphasizing Phoenix’s angular frame, Phillips often places him within tight hallways where the walls seem ready to squish him. There are two striking establishing shots—one in which Arthur is sitting outside a hospital and another where he enters the Arkham psychiatric facility—and the buildings loom over him, more institutions that are supposed to aid but instead oppress. Does all of this make Arthur too sympathetic, too much a victim rather than a villain? A look at David Fincher’s Fight Club might be instructive here. Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, two Martin Scorsese films about disturbed, self-pitying men who turn violent, are clear influences on Joker (made obvious in casting Robert De Niro as a late-night talk show host Arthur idolizes), but it’s Fight Club that’s the more compelling parallel. Like Arthur, Edward Norton’s Narrator is an angry, unstable loner who has some legitimate gripes, but also addresses them with disproportionate means when he meets seductive anarchist Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. Like Joker, Fight Club was criticized upon its release for glamorizing antisocial behavior; now it’s seen as slyly subversive, even prophetic—a dramatization of the consumer society we’re currently drowning in. I’d argue Arthur Fleck is a far less slippery character than Tyler Durden. Durden’s appeal is obvious: he’s powerful, catnip for women, and couldn’t care less what anyone thinks. Oh, and did I mention he’s played by Abs Pitt? In comparison, it’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to be Arthur Fleck: scrawny, rejected, unfunny, awkward. And the movie, at key points, undermines him. There’s a telling moment where Arthur tries to tell off two police officers, and while walking away he runs into the glass of an automatic door that fails to slide open. Even the sole act of violence in the film that could possibly be construed as justified—his shooting of those subway bullies—is clumsily executed, with Arthur slipping and fumbling with the gun, a depiction of chaotic clumsiness rather than cool violence. (It’s also worth noting that those bullies initially target a woman, but Arthur does nothing. She has to save herself.) Let’s also consider a later scene that takes place on those outdoor steps. Arthur has gone full Joker by now, and for a few seconds the movie puts us in his wobbly head. This time we see Arthur from the bottom of the stairs, looking up. He stands at the top, the sun blazing behind him, and begins dancing his way down to the sound of Gary Glitter’s cheesy and carnivalesque “Rock ‘n’ Roll (Part 2).” For Joker, this is a mountaintop moment, but the movie cuts it short: two cops appear at the top of the stairs, the music stops, and he goofily scrambles away. Keep in mind his direction, as well. Joker may feel exultant, but we’re literally watching him descend further into Gotham’s pit. A distinction between Joker and Fight Club is that Fight Club is a satire, with soulless consumerism as its target. Joker doesn’t have that much ambition, which is one of the reasons Fight Club is the more potent work of art. Yet Joker nevertheless captures the volatile mood of our current moment, which is a boiling cauldron of its own. Everyone is outraged for different reasons, one sense of disenfranchisement competes with another, and the institutions that should provide stability only seem to foment the distress. “All I have are negative thoughts,” Arthur tells his social worker. These days, that seems to be all anyone has, including about Joker. There’s something apropos in the fact that a film so attuned to the temperament of 2019 comes from a comic-book source. The discourse around such properties is often a variation on the vitriol in which Joker swims. What I’m left with after watching Joker is admiration for a movie that so artfully captures such societal turbulence, even as it also reminds us that violence will always be insanity—whether justified or unjustified, regretful or gleeful, the act of a superhero or the whim of a clown.",POSITIVE
"Oct 9, 2019"," I spent at least a day pondering on Joker before typing a word of this review. I left the theatre aware I watched something remarkably affecting. Something about it disturbed me, though. It certainly wasn’t the violence, as it’s really not much more graphic than your average superhero show. It was perhaps that it was hard to know how to feel about the plot, which so relentlessly pushes the unfortunate Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) past the point of no return that, his nihilism when he embraces his Joker identity was not only understandable, but cathartic and cool. It was hard to tell whether the story was empty, or whether it just made me feel empty. It was probably a kind of emotional exhaustion, as I’m still thinking about the film days later. It’s a simple story of a sad sack named Arthur Fleck who’s thoroughly boiled in humanity’s – or rather, Gotham City’s – collective bile. He starts off with very little: A miserable job as a clown for hire, a disinterested therapist, a sickly mother, delusions of fame as a stand-up comedian. But then the plot systematically robs him of those meagre things in a variety of humiliating and devastating ways. He stumbles into becoming a figurehead for a growing “Kill the rich” mood in a poverty-stricken Gotham City. Of course, the dark joke is that he is not mentally equipped to feel for anyone but himself, and he believes in nothing. And yet, when he unleashes a riot by the hellish climax and his acolytes lift him up, Christ-like and all, I felt relief instead of the expected repulsion.   Of course it’s just a movie, but what that reaction says about me isn’t very flattering. However, that’s what we like about provocative art. You can explore these complicated feelings in a safe context.  I suppose a big part of the discomfort is that Joaquin Phoenix engenders a tremendous amount of sympathy with a sensitive and transformative performance. When he goes full Joker, and pathetically strains to inhabit this flamboyant showman persona as if that will keep him from collapsing into crippling sobs, the romance of the infamous Batman villain falls away entirely. What’s left is an ugly, pitiful, and real, human being. Phoenix is completely convincing as this fundamentally absurd and cartoonish character. His emaciated form makes his emotional starvation tangible. I can’t recall a portrait of human desperation that was this vivid. Be warned that, if you’re like me, and are susceptible to second-hand embarrassment, this movie is often a mortifying nightmare. But this isn’t just a case of an outstanding performance bolstering a standard psychological thriller. Director Todd Philips came to play too. His vision is appallingly realistic: “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy” are much touted influences. Not that “Joker” holds a candle to those masterpieces, but it wears those influences handsomely, and it never feels like a bastardization. It doesn’t play like a mainstream comic book movie made in 2019 – there’s nary an action scene to be found here. Certainly, its inarticulate rage at a failed American capitalist system feels contemporary.   In Joker, you can definitely trace a direct line from this failed system to the birth of the Joker. “We live in a society” and all that. I wish the movie delved more into its themes of class warfare and economic disparity. If Joker has a major flaw, it’s that its above-the-fray ambiguity regarding these heavy themes almost abandons the movie in a pit of thoughtless nihilism. But I would be doing this work a major disservice if I didn’t mention the score by Hildur Gudnadottir, which adds a graceful layer of etherealness to an atmosphere as thick and toxic as Gotham’s garbage. I don’t think the movie is nearly as powerful without this aspect.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," Seldom has it been so hard to figure out a letter grade for a movie review. JOKER doesn’t precisely defy normal measures of quality, but its ambiguities are simultaneously intriguing and frustrating. Despite rumors to the contrary, JOKER is set squarely within the Batman universe, even if this is a Gotham City grimier and nastier than Bob Kane and Bill Finger ever imagined. As genres go, though, JOKER hews closer to TAXI DRIVER or DEATH WISH or any number of underdog-takes-on-tormentor films than it does to what we normally think of as comic book movies. It’s the late ‘70s (we can tell even before the movie starts from the style of the Warner Brothers logo). When we meet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), he’s working as a Rent-a-Clown on the mean streets of Gotham, which looks identical to New York City in that era. Arthur already has some issues, but these become much more severe after he’s mugged and beaten by a gang of kids. We see that Arthur lives with his needy, insensitive mother (Frances Conroy). Together, they faithfully watch late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur sees a social worker (Sharon Washington) in order to get the many medications he needs for stability. We also learn that Arthur wants to be a standup comedian, and suffers from Tourette’s-style condition that causes him to burst into uncontrollable laughter at times of stress. When Arthur is at last able to return to work after the beating, a coworker (Glenn Fleshler) gives him a revolver. As origin stories go, JOKER works as well as any other for Batman’s most famous nemesis. Watching Arthur’s evolution is undeniably powerful, mainly because of Phoenix’s lived-in, bled-in performance. He can go from pathetic to rational to scary in a flicker of an eyelid. Phoenix’s Arthur/Joker also dances, spontaneous physical expressions of emotion that don’t change the reality level, unlike songs in musicals, yet serve the purpose of giving voice to what simple words cannot convey. It works perfectly for both JOKER’s Arthur and Batman’s Joker. These moments are neither clumsy nor overly graceful. Rather, Phoenix makes them look wholly organic, movements that are extensions of a psyche trying to accept its true self. His work here is remarkable. There are some concerns that some viewers may identify too closely with Arthur and try to emulate him. These concerns don’t seem entirely unwarranted – it’s a lot easier for a disturbed person to lash out with a revolver than, say, for someone to successfully emulate the improbable strength and stealth of HALLOWEEN’s Michael Myers. The bigger concern, though, is context. Director Todd Phillips and his co-screenwriter Scott Silver have crafted a scenario in which their protagonist is almost always right. When Arthur first lashes out, we’re on his side; it starts as self-defense and doesn’t move far from there. Later male victims are, if not physical threats, pretty horrible people who (certainly in movie terms) deserve some sort of comeuppance. There are two issues here. To discuss this in as non-spoilery a manner as possible, a situation with a woman is handled so ambiguously that we can’t tell what Arthur has or hasn’t done. Should we assume he’s crossed the line? Should we assume he made a minor mistake? Are women supposed to be thought of as plot points rather than people? Should we think this is some sort of Rorschach test for us designed by the filmmakers? The last seems a bit pretentious, but it’s the filmmakers’ prerogative, so we can go with that. But the larger issue is that Arthur literally, verbally shames others for their lack of empathy while displaying no empathy himself. JOKER doesn’t treat this as hypocrisy, or a sign of Arthur’s psychological issues. Instead, the film seems to want us to side with him against some people who are, in their way, equally downtrodden. And JOKER is under no illusions that it exists in a vacuum. Its class divisions mirror those in the real world. Indeed, the exploitation of the poor by the rich has such an impact on Arthur that his Joker seems less an agent of chaos than a reluctant crusader. JOKER has a couple of logic glitches (like why anybody would give Arthur a gun, or why anybody in Gotham ever leaves a door unlocked). These speak to a bit of underestimating the audience. What speaks more to this is that the movie embraces its main character to such a degree that it winds up demonizing people who aren’t trying to harm Arthur; they’re castigated along with the actual villains for simply not dropping everything to help him, even though he never helps anyone. This may be at the heart of why some viewers feel such discomfort. JOKER is effective art in the service of a worldview that endorses a double standard.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," Nadie como Joaquin Phoenix, posiblemente el actor más camaleónico e imprevisible del cine actual, para interpretar a este hombre hundido en su propio infierno. Desde luego, su tarea en Guasón (Joker; Todd Phillips, 2019) resulta extraordinaria, poco más puede decirse: la cámara tiene la misma obsesión fetichista con cada gesto desmedido y cada vejación de su torso y espalda que El maquinista (The Machinist, 2004) tenía sobre Christian Bale. Cada plano está donde está para que Phoenix haga lo suyo. Carcajadas dementes, tics nerviosos, bailecitos autistas. Para los que vimos a Gabino Rodríguez retorcerse con sus walkman en Los ausentes (Nicolás Pereda, 2014), todo esto está un poco de sobra. Mejor, a fijarnos en otra cosa: en la banqueta de una ciudad desbordada hay un payaso trabajando como anuncio humano. La película se llama The Crowd (King Vidor, 1928). Su protagonista, John Sims, es un joven soñador que un día voltea a ver a este payaso con superioridad. Se burla de él con su novia. Como si se tratara de un castigo divino, The Crowd lo lleva, a través de una serie de desgracias, a ponerse en el lugar del hombre por el que inicialmente mostró desprecio. No sé si así inicie la narrativa del ciudadano heroico en el cine estadounidense, pero sin duda John Sims fue uno de los primeros ejemplos del everyman que aprende una lección de humildad para rebajarse al nivel del otro. El arquetipo ha sido enaltecido por James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, Gregory Peck, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams y otro montón de luminarias de Hollywood. Es un hombre siempre virtuoso. Casi 100 años después, Joker retoma la imagen del cartel humano haciendo el ridículo en una calle sobrepoblada, pero pone el punto de vista en el despreciado, donde incluso el más mínimo acto de solidaridad de cualquier John Sims (que no hay muchos aquí) se entiende como una señal de absoluta hipocresía. La realidad que se plantea alrededor de Arthur Fleck, el futuro némesis de Batman, parte del resentimiento colectivo a esos sujetos aparentemente bondadosos. Decíamos que el ojo de Todd Phillips está casado con la corporalidad y la locura de su personaje principal, pero también le da entrada a los rumores (a veces muy obvios, a veces no) de una ciudad consumida por la pobreza, el vandalismo y la impunidad. Fleck vive en un departamento jodido, tiene un empleo mediocre y su acceso a los medicamentos que regulan su enfermedad mental está mediado por un sistema de asistencia social precario y al borde de la extinción. En un vagón del metro, sucio de basura y de grafiti, un grupo de borrachos, uniformado con saquitos de escuela privada, acosa a una pasajera. No hay policías por ninguna parte y los únicos oficiales que vemos en toda la película son caricaturas de los detectives de alguna serie policiaca o de adaptaciones del mismo universo de Batman, completamente inútiles. Dos figuras públicas parecen vivir libres de todo esto: Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), conductor de un talk show medio ojete al que Fleck idealiza por su aspiración al submundo de la comedia de stand-up, y Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), magnate, candidato a la alcaldía de Gotham y padre de ya-sabemos-quién. Dos beneficiados del sistema que podrían estar haciendo algo para ayudar a los demás en lugar de llenarse los bolsillos de dinero. Que este señalamiento al privilegio se haga en un relato que forma parte de una franquicia de historietas y que pertenece a una línea de personajes emblemáticos de la cultura popular de Estados Unidos resalta aún más la contradicción fundamental de los supuestos superhéroes americanos y la industria que tienen como sustento: su intervención ha sido siempre aprovechada e invasiva; sus actos de caridad, una demostración incómoda de poder sobre los débiles. El clima político en Occidente sigue virando al populismo y al proteccionismo económico, con políticas extremas de exclusión y represión, mientras que la proliferación de antihéroes y la desmitificación del superhombre gana popularidad en el mainstream de la forma favorita de escapismo de aquellos que, aunque todavía no sufren las injusticias más crueles de sus respectivos gobiernos, ya la ven venir (gran parte del éxito de HBO debe proviene de ahí: todos necesitábamos ver que las princesas y los caballeros galantes eran unos cerdos en Game of Thrones o que la Liga de la Justicia es en verdad un club de cínicos y asesinos, más recientemente, en The Boys, ésta de Amazon Prime). Los ricos y poderosos no podían ser, encima de todo, justos. De nuestro lado de la balanza, el Arthur Fleck de Joker no es exactamente un antihéroe de la clase trabajadora: es un santo para purgar la rabia animal de una sociedad insatisfecha. Después de ser literalmente pateado en el piso varias veces, Fleck tiene una retorcida toma de conciencia (o algo que se asemeja a una) que repercute de manera indirecta en una violenta manifestación en las calles. Aunque la relación entre las dos cosas sí es causal, Fleck no es un líder con la iniciativa de quemar el mundo (un revolucionario, pues), sino alguien que, por la radicalidad de su salud mental, comete los actos de brutalidad que la gente desesperada en situación de precariedad siempre había querido hacer para desquitarse. Y si él puede, los demás también. Los asesinatos cometidos en Joker, además de estar desprovistos de espectacularidad o de glamour, están acompañados de una de las peores cosas que pueden suceder inmediatamente a la muerte: la risa. Será una ridiculez traer a colación el humor negro y sucio de ¿Qué pasó ayer? Parte II (The Hangover Part II, 2011) —basado en humillaciones físicas y gags que no deben hacerle mucha gracia a la comunidad trans—, pero, a fin de cuentas, es del mismo director que ahora reúne un apuñalamiento alevoso y un chiste de enanos en la misma escena. Los elementos humorísticos no aparecen para justificar el acto criminal ni para aliviarlo; por el contrario, acentúan el carácter grotesco de la violencia en contraste con una de las escenas más reveladoras de la hipocresía que mencioné anteriormente: para acercarse a Wayne, Arthur se cuela en un teatro opulento donde los miembros de la clase alta de Gotham se ríen a carcajadas de las desventuras de Charles Chaplin en Tiempos modernos (Modern Times, 1936), otra película que reúne al hombre promedio, el sufrimiento físico y la explosión demográfica. Si en la cinta de Chaplin la risa llega sin culpa, ¿por qué en Joker no? Hablando de momentos elocuentes —y sin ánimos de arruinarle nada a nadie—, la escena para complacer fanáticos, forzada como todos los requisitos del cine de cómics, coloca al mito de Batman en un círculo vicioso fascinante: cuando la negligencia de un sector político genera criminales y violencia, esta violencia engendrará a su vez a los defensores del sistema de corrupción. El héroe de los privilegiados está justificado de nacimiento para erradicar al producto de su propio descuido y, así, saltarse la parte en donde se intenta llegar al fondo de los problemas.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," Every superhero movie (or supervillain movie, as the case may be) exists first and foremost as a commodity and secondarily as a film. A quick glance at lists of the most expensive films of all time and the highest grossing films reveal them as jam packed with Marvel and DC Comics characters and their cinema-born cousins (Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean). One can point to many factors to explain the rise of this specific strand of blockbuster production—streaming and other low-cost entertainment alternatives, corporate consolidation, and the rise of box-office reporting for public consumption, to name a few—but it is clear that major studios now derive an ever-increasing share of their annual revenue from superheroes and other franchises. The result has been a much decried erosion of mid-budget studio filmmaking and growing complaints that the Hollywood no longer makes movies “for adults”—implicitly a mimetic, realist film devoid of costumed crime fighters and sci-fi/fantasy conceits—and is too concerned with money and insufficiently concerned with art. Enter Joker. From its very inception, it has been pushed as a different kind of comic book movie. It touts two big names: Joaquin Phoenix, who has long wanted to do a “character study” in the genre, and Todd Phillips, who has declined offers to direct previous comic book films because of his lack of interest in “loud” CGI spectacles. Joker was also conceived as a standalone film, free from the storytelling constraints (and commodity mindset) imposed by the need to tie in to an ever-growing number of similar films. Its budget is a modest $64 million, less than half that of the cheapest “Marvel Cinematic Universe” film and barely a sixth of that of Avengers: Endgame. It will receive a 70mm run in New York, joining a short list of the decade’s celluloid presentations of new films, including Paul Thomas Anderson’s films and the two most recent works by both Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan. Everything surrounding Joker suggests the serious, intellectual movie “for adults” that critics have chided superhero movies for erasing, and it is a good enough imitation of one to have earned the Golden Lion from a Venice Film Festival jury presided over by Lucrecia Martel.  Joker is replete with the signifiers of great cinema, all dialed up so heavily that they could denote parody if the film were not so serious. Its grimy yellows and cool, distinctly digital blues call to mind art-house and festival circuit thrillers, and most close-ups are reserved for its protagonist’s most manic moments. The score, too, is full of impressive musical compositions, but it lacks cohesion. It ranges from lush, scene-setting mid-range tones to dissonant screeches and tremolos of a violin for scary moments to grand, bombastic numbers with a full orchestra during the riots. To these it mixes in a range of on-the-nose pop songs, including The Guess Who’s “Laughing,” Sondheim’s “Send in the Clowns,” Tony Bennett’s “Put on a Happy Face,” and “That’s Life,” each one an excruciating wink to the audience, and none as bold or brilliant or brazen as Bob Dylan’s “Jokerman” would have been.  As for Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, known through most of the film as Arthur Fleck, it is a far cry from Heath Ledger’s. Ledger’s Joker is a sadist; we are introduced to him as he convinces four men to kill one another, and he forces Batman to pick between the lives of the two people he cares about most. As played by Ledger, Joker is always unhinged, licking his lips when looking straight on or otherwise glancing upward at you from his downcast head. He flips from conversant to violent on a dime, as when he unexpectedly slams a man’s eye through the end of a pencil, as if something as simple as a conversation is too civilized an action to take. He is the personification of evil, and that he tells multiple stories about the source of his scars, thereby denying origin or motivation, elevates him to the level of the symbolic. Phoenix’s Joker, by contrast, speaks in a low, earnest voice, and he reveres his mother. Where Ledger’s Joker wants to reveal the potential for psychopathy latent in every Gothamite (most especially Batman), Phoenix’s Joker has the opposite goal: to gain recognition and acceptance for the downtrodden, the ill, the “crazy,” and the misfits, to reveal their normalcy. More similar are Phoenix’s own performances as Freddie Quell in The Master (2012), who Arthur might have become if he found a charismatic cult leader like Lancaster Dodd in Gotham, or Joe in You Were Never Really Here (2017), another abused loner who takes care of his mother, instead of only finding ridicule. This time, however, Phoenix’s performance is calculated, even strained. His laughing fits all adhere to a mocking cadence, as if the goal is to foreshadow and provide simple characterizations—that Joker, he’s crazy! Even the solemn, nervous speaking he does steers the film toward its predetermined destination rather than complicating or mystifying it. “Predetermined” and “calculated” apply also to the film’s political commentary. We are quickly told early that Arthur works as a clown and lives in poverty with his mother. Despite the repeated dialogue, however, we never see anything, such as struggles to pay bills, that actually indicates poverty. Arthur also suffers from an unspecified mental illness and, like Rupert Pupkin before him in Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy (1982), dreams of making it big as a comedian like his idol, TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, finally in Jerry Langford’s place). The Scorsese influence doesn’t end there, however; Phillips’ Gotham is clearly modeled on the crime-ridden New York of the late ‘70s and ‘80s, which made Travis Bickle’s gradual undoing in Taxi Driver (1976) and the paranoia of Paul Hackett in After Hours (1985) both believable and resonant. After being attacked by a group of teens, Arthur finds himself in possession of a gun, which he subsequently uses to kill three would-be assailants with Wall Street ties on the subway. When mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (father of Bruce) condemns the killings by calling all of Gotham’s less fortunate residents “clowns,” he inadvertently sparks a wave of protests. “Kill the Rich: A New Movement?” the newspapers ask. “Resist!” the protest signs proclaim. Every story development in Joker evokes another hot button issue. The anti-capitalist and mental health themes pile up as Arthur is forced off his meds when the Department of Health undergoes budget cuts. Arthur also finds himself in the crosshairs of his idol when a tape of his bombed set at a comedy club makes it onto the talk show. No more significant within the context of the film (but the lightning rod for the discourse that has surrounded it since its premiere), Arthur tries unsuccessfully to woo an attractive neighbor; it's a subplot that, along with a scene where Arthur is berated by a woman for attempting to make her kid laugh, has cultivated fear that the film sympathizes with an “incel” point of view. When Arthur initiates his killing spree, finds his way onto Franklin's show and outs himself as the subway killer on air, then receives nonstop media coverage, tensions in Gotham boil over with riots and several copycat crimes (including one against Thomas Wayne, thus providing Batman’s origin story). People could, and likely will, argue in circles as to whether Arthur’s easy access to a gun is more or less of a problem than his mental illness, about Arthur’s mistreatment and the justifiability of his responses, about the perils of going “viral” and of media saturation and the ethics of coverage, and about the relationship between poverty, crime, and the rich. Yet underneath all this is a profoundly unrewarding film. Its primary advancement to the commercially protective Hollywood tendency of crafting a film with ambiguous politics—able to be read as either left or right depending on the proclivities of the viewer—is by making both readings, and the stakes, extremely obvious. Either killing the rich is correct because we see the squalor of Arthur’s environs, or it is wrong because, after all, the most iconic villain in comic book history supports it. Either the problem is the “other,” like the African-Americans who do not listen to Arthur, or they, as Arthur’s African-American state psychologist suggests when her department’s funding is cut, are just as disposable in the eyes of the state as he is. Either Joker is a hero to the incel Nazi right or an indictment of it, depending on whether the viewer wants to like the movie or not and which viewpoint will best support that decision. Paper-thin political metaphor has replaced genuine social commentary. We have seen this song-and-dance before. Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy brought a grim tone and shadowy, greyscale look to a genre that had generally embraced the candy colors of their source material, and outrage over The Dark Knight (2008) missing out on awards nominations led to an expansion of the Academy Awards’ Best Picture category from five nominees to ten. Later superhero films were self-consciously positioned as respectable, whether it was Captain America (2011) as a ‘70s paranoia thriller, Deadpool (2016) as an intelligent “deconstruction,” or Logan (2017) as a western. Joker is simply the next step in the battle to gain credibility among the intelligentsia for films devoid of personality or originality. It pulls heavily from The King of Comedy in its narrative and from Taxi Driver (1976) for its protagonist’s modus operandi, and it seeks out a lineage not of other superhero movies, but of the great works of cinema: Fleck watches the Fred Astaire vehicle Shall We Dance (1937) on TV and Chaplin’s Modern Times (1936) in a cinema, and the marquee of a theater showing Blow Out is featured prominently. None of this intertextuality enhances the movie, but they all enhance the perception of it. They won’t make the movie better, but they might convert some of the few remaining comic book movie skeptics into obliging ticket buyers—and isn’t that what this is all about? After watching Joker, I found myself rereading Manny Farber’s landmark 1962 essay, “White Elephant Art vs. Termite Art,” the entirety of which could have substituted for this piece. Farber argued that low-budget films and low-brow art with modest aims were often more substantial, both artistically and in the expression of big ideas, than the higher budget films with clear ambitions and high production values. When considering the comic book origins of the figures that rule today’s screens, it is clear that the termites of yesteryear have become today’s white elephants, but the economics of Hollywood have made those white elephants bigger, whiter, and more bloated than ever. Joker is purportedly the first installment of the DC Black line for standalone DC Comic films, meaning we can expect many more white elephants to fill the screen in the coming years. Until something is done to the profitable but soul-sucking production and distribution models that dominate Hollywood today, the only thing we can do is simply not watch them.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," While the perfumed and tuxedoed privileged of Gotham City are enjoying the antics of Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times (1936) inside a gilded theater, the city’s marginalized working class are outside, angrily protesting the inequities that have become blatant after three affluent yuppies were brutally shot by a clown aboard a subway train. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), the perpetrator of the crime that divided the city, finds himself walking past the crowd, completely oblivious of the political pining of the enraged public he has inspired since his beef is personal. He is a total outsider, perhaps the poorest of the poor but is still maltreated and abused by his own. His only hope is a man who represents the upper crust, a man who can salvage him and his sick mother (Frances Conroy) from their misery. If one had no idea that the title refers to one of pop culture’s most enduring villains, he would probably think that the film is a comedy brimming with punchlines, much like Phillip’s previous films The Hangover (2009) and its two sequels. However, the only real joke in Joker happens near its end and curiously involves a mass murderer, a man begging for his life and his only way out of danger a few inches too high for him to reach. The rest of the film is enveloped in morbidity.  There is not one character in the film that is untainted by either vice or brutality. The screenplay, written by Phillips and Scott Silver, isn’t really interested in creating complex creatures languishing in an unforgiving urban landscape but in seeing how villainy can be stretched and manipulated by both context and sentiment to make it teeter towards being acceptable.  There is very real danger in the film’s convincing blurring of the lines, especially since it does so for a pop culture icon who has previously represented unflinching amorality. Joker thrives in presenting the most pessimistic of world views and relies on an undisputed miscreant’s obscure and unhinged charisma mined from a modification of a familiar tale that also serves as a coarse portraiture of society’s glaring ills to keep it from being a fully exhausting misery-driven melodrama.  The film is buoyed by the spectacle that is Joaquin’s performance. He fully transforms, turning himself into a skeletal figure, a specter shaped by the broken humanity that is further rattled by the cruelty of an insensitive metropolis. He is both frightening and fragile, a monster-in-the-making whose fate has already been decided but whose journey towards there is adorned with as much machinated apathy and alienation Phillips can muster within the context of a comic book movie aspiring for arthouse gravity and elegance. If Joaquin ultimately takes care of the titular figure who is warped into some kind of martyr and tragic anti-hero, it is Phillips’ task to make the most villainous of villains feel like the subject of oppression.  Phillips turns Gotham into a vile character. While Gotham has always served as an even more tainted version of New York City, Phillip’s Gotham is rotten and feels like a nightmarish alternate version of the already corrupt and smog-filled New York City of several decades ago. This is probably the first time Gotham is shown not from the eyes of the rich and able, whose ultimate aim is to keep the status quo and enchant the citizens with deeds of heroism but from the eyes of those in despair and desperation.  It fetishizes the full extent of human savagery and rationalizes hate in a society that has become too crowded for its own good. It is both indulgent and nonchalantly incessant in its gloomy outlook of a humanity.  Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun. The first Filipino movie he saw in the theaters was Carlo J. Caparas’ Tirad Pass.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker follows struggling comedian (and part-time clown) Arthur Fleck as he attempts to find his place within a world that increasingly wants nothing to do with him. It’s clear immediately that Phillips, working from a script written with Scott Silver, is looking to deliver a low-key and almost aggressively gritty character study, as the movie, for the bulk of its admittedly overlong running time, explores the ongoing (and uniformly grim) exploits of Phoenix’s mentally-unhinged figure and the impact his progressively antisocial antics have on the various figures around him (including Zazie Beetz’s sympathetic neighbor and Frances Conroy’s demanding mother). And although Phillips has peppered the movie’s midsection with a handful of electrifying sequences (eg Arthur confronts three bullies on the subway), Joker does suffer from a meandering second act that seems to consist entirely of set-pieces detailing Arthur’s various confrontations and humiliations (ie it’s all a little repetitive, to be sure). The let’s-get-on-with-it-already vibe persists right up until the picture segues into its thoroughly engrossing final stretch, which revolves around Arthur’s inevitable transformation into the infamous (and iconic) title character – with the end result a lamentably erratic endeavor that nevertheless fares better than most comic-book-inspired releases and benefits substantially from a seriously (yet typically) spellbinding performance by its star.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," It was quite a weekend in movie-land with Todd Phillips’ “Joker” dominating the conversation on social media and beyond, for both good and bad reasons.

Join us as we welcome Batman Shane back to the show to discuss it all.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," When the Clown Prince of Gotham comes to the big screen, moviegoing audiences pay attention. Back in 1989, Jack Nicholson introduced audiences to a new kind of Joker, one that was more menacing and comical than the Cesar Romero hilarity of the television show. Mark Hamill‘s evolution of the character throughout Batman: The Animated Series and Batman: The Mask of the Phantasm gave a generation the ability to grow up on a violent and electrifying villain. Yet Heath Ledger‘s anarchic take on the character became an instant icon of cinema. It’s impossible to separate the danger and death that lingers over the performance. Even the Suicide Squad from David Ayer drew massive crowds, in part due to misplaced excitement for Jarred Leto. This past weekend, the Todd Phillips directed Joker made waves throughout popular culture. Hot off winning the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival, as well as an impressive showing at the Toronto International Film Festival, expectations were high. Of course, backlash kicked into full gear. With many fearing an actual act of domestic terrorism could accompany the film’s release, Joker quickly became the most controversial film to hit theaters in more than a decade. Sadly, the film does not live up to the lofty discourse that circulated last week. Joker ultimately plays as Scorsese karaoke, drawing heavily from both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. You can even make the argument Joker is a spiritual sequel to each of those films. The character study thrives thanks to the committed performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Yet the rest of the film struggles to find its footing. A seemingly well-intentioned depiction of mental illness gets bogged down by inarticulate storytelling and concepts you might find in a psychology 101 class. While Joker‘s ambition makes it interesting, it never follows through on the threads that deliver the most impactful messages. That’s not to say that Joker is a bad movie. In fact, part of what makes Phillip’s film so infuriating might be the way it flirts with greatness. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives out his life in the slums of Gotham City. Set before an election within the city, a crime wave sweeps the streets and places Fleck in a position to become a victim. He suffers from mental illness and uncontrollable bursts of laughter when uncomfortable. He dreams of performing standup but becomes the victim of muggings and beatings while at work. His mother Penny Fleck (Francis Conroy) believes they will find their way out of the slums with the help of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). After Arthur becomes the victim of another senseless beating, he turns on his assailants. As Arthur struggles with his own journey of self-discovery and violence, Gotham City begins to rupture at the seams. Unfortunately for Joker, a film cannot be removed from the context in which it enters the world. I do not count myself as someone who fears Joker will incite violence. Yet it is at war with itself. Despite the way the filmmakers and cast talk about Joker, the ideas that circulate throughout the film suggest it wants to comment on the modern state of the world. The depictions of mental illness are far from revolutionary, even falling into cliche at times. Joker also undermines its arguments by introducing too many aspects of mental illness. To quote one of my wise mentors, when you try to say everything, you often say nothing. The ambiguity becomes problematic as it strengthens the argument that only the mentally ill will engage in acts of violence. In that regard, the movie feeds into right-wing talking points that have surrounded mass shootings in recent months. Simultaneously, Joker bemoans the death of public funding for mental health and weaves in Occupy Wall Street rhetoric. The unfocused nature of these issues does not provide us with a grey area. Nuance disappears, and instead Joker just depicts political extremes. The muddled ideas present throughout the story leaves us without answers to the questions Joker raises and ultimately leaves the movie without convictions. The argument for the greatness within this film has to begin and end with Joaquin Phoenix. Inarguably one of the greatest actors of his generation, Phoenix showcases his chameleonic abilities as he disappears behind the role. With every breath, you can tell that Phoenix has dialed into something special. The sheer use of physicality and negative space make this a special performance, to say nothing of the unwritten aspects of the character that Phoenix displays through his non-verbals. Thanks to the incredible actors who have taken on this role, it is impossible to say this is the best performance of the character, and Phoenix has depicted more interesting characters. Yet Phoenix throws down the gauntlet, and will surely challenge for year-end awards. Turning the film so wholly over to Phoenix’s character creates its own problems. He can be enthralling to watch on screen, but his journey creates a bleak and negative outlook on the world around him. The darkness that he takes through feels oppressive at times and shockingly the lack of violence for stretches of the film causes the momentum to falter at times. Phoenix always resets the stage, but even at two hours, the bleak world can feel too heavy. Simultaneously, a talented cast that includes Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Brian Tyree Henry , and Frances Conroy feels underutilized. Phoenix sucks the oxygen out of the room, and without those characters, the stakes of Joker are severely reduced. At the same time, the movie wants to be a character study, but cannot help but intangle itself within the DC Universe. Rather than deliver on the standalone film that has been promised, it feels like Joker needs to prove it’s comic book background. Whether this came from studio notes or was always the plan, the choice to make the Wayne family loom large over this film comes off as too convenient. I’d rather spend time with the characters we’ve never met before than see young Bruce Wayne for the 1000th time. Even as a piece of connected-universe building, Joker becomes more interested in throwing things into the atmosphere without having the courage to actually ask the question. Some of the questions about Arthur’s background could be far more intriguing if the film leaned into them. Instead, it backtracks on almost all of these ideas, settling for traditional comic book lore. Yet the ideas could have far-reaching, even brilliant consequences on DC Universe if given the opportunity. Despite these issues, Joker will certainly feel entertaining for many. Phoenix’s take on the character delivers a Joker that truly feels unique. He is not simply unpredictable for the sake of anarchy. Instead, you can tell this Joker does not have a plan for anything in his life as he wildly shifts his motivations from one scene to the next. In fact, you can argue that Phoenix’s Joker is incapable of building these plans. The Gotham City of this film plays a massive role as a character in the film. Only Burton’s Gotham feels as integral to the story being told. The craft team behind bringing the dirty world of New York and turning it into a tactile Gotham deserves every bit praise they receive. The score from Hildur Guðnadóttir should become an iconic work. When this film verges into outbursts, Guðnadóttir guides you to emotional truths about the moments. It’s tough to imagine many scores in 2019 will be as integral to the success of a film. The fact that I wrote close to 1400 words on Joker makes me a little frustrated. To be honest, for a film that thinks it is so edgy, Joker comes off as rather tame. For a movie that could incite violence, there’s not that much in the film. It does not want to be identified as a comic book movie, but boy does it go out of the way to bring the Waynes into the story. The movie feels like it is constantly fighting with itself, but will certainly still appeal to those who miss Dark Knight trilogy. Joker should feel more substantial. Unfortunately, a lack of focus almost wastes an incredible performance. Sadly Joker squanders a place in the superhero pantheon and instead settles for simply being intriguing. That might be the greatest letdown of all.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2019"," In Joker, a suitably creepy lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix is undermined by heavy-handed direction and a clunky screenplay. Comedic filmmaker Todd Phillips has attempted to transcend the comic book genre by imitating the crime dramas of Martin Scorsese from the 1970s and 1980s, specifically The King of Comedy (1982). However, all aspects of Phillip’s craft lack deftness and care to reach this impossible bar. Consequently, as a heavy drama and a character study, Joker is undermined by leaden, one-dimensional themes of class and mental health and an indecisive political rhetoric that the filmmaker approaches with a nonchalant shrug. It amounts to an irritable and uncomfortable experience that is half as strong as the classic films it seeks to imitate. The film is a DC Comics origin story about how a failed comedian named Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) transforms himself into Batman’s archnemesis, the Joker. In 1981, Fleck lives a miserable life in a rundown Gotham City. As a clown for hire, he is beaten and robbed by punk kids. His boss grows impatient and his colleagues worry he is unhinged. He is further isolated by a condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably. His only friend is his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), with whom he shares an apartment. Yet he remains buoyed by his dream of being invited onto the talk show of his idol, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), and the affection of his neighbour, Sophie (Deadpool 2’s Zazie Beetz). After an incident on a train, where Fleck kills three Wall Street jerks, his actions have serious ramifications for the city’s elite, including mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Todd Phillips is not a director associated with subtlety and good taste. After directing The Hangover (2009), he elongated his path of political incorrectness with two dire sequels and the lousy arms dealer comedy-drama War Dogs (2016). His attempt to forgo comedy entirely and create an ultra-serious, bleak crime drama out of a comic book (Alan Moore’s Batman: The Killing Joke is its inspiration) is feeble and lacking solid execution. Some levity and humour, for example, would have cut through Joker’s ugliness. Instead, its bleak, dour atmosphere, in the vein of Scorsese’s grittiest features, is persistent. It opens with the old Warner Bros. logo, and classic titles, and then we are injected into the graffiti‑stained, crime infested streets of Gotham City, which mimics a rundown New York City. From here, Phillips rarely understands that less is more when asserting menace. For example, there is a scene where Fleck stumbles into someone else’s apartment. His hair is wet and matted from the thunderstorm storm outside and the television crackles loudly. A person looks on in horror at the hideous man sitting in their lounge room. To drive the point home, Fleck then puts a finger gun to his head, ala Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s loud, intrusive score pounds away on the soundtrack. The scene typifies the film’s didactic form, its desperation to dramatise the anxiety surrounding Fleck’s psychosis. In another moment, Phillip’s camera zooms in deliberately on the back of Fleck as he sits down. Every bone protruding from his thin back comes into the audience’s focus. These on-the-nose stylistic choices overstate the character’s monstrousness when Phoenix’s commitment as an actor is entirely capable on its own of being bizarre and otherworldly. He is one of the industry’s most daring chameleons and holds a monopoly on playing elusive, dishevelled oddballs. He embodies Fleck’s gaunt, contorted physicality to ensure that every loud, awkward laugh, and every stumble and clumsy run is felt by the audience. Yet just like the storm scene, there is rarely a moment where Phillips trusts the power of the actor’s self-expression. There is an ominous setup where Fleck stands on one side of a gate of a mansion opposite a boy. The image and Phoenix’s chilling presence speak for themselves. Naturally, the shot begins to echo Scorsese’s stalker thriller Cape Fear (1991), which also starred Robert De Niro. However, Phillips then adds his cumbersome writing into the scene by prolonging the moment with a dialogue-heavy confrontation. In general, Joker’s screenplay, written by Phillips and Scott Silver, needed stronger fundamentals. The film explores four different plotlines: Fleck’s personal history, his relationship with Sophie, the train murders, and his attempts to feature on Murray’s show. Unfortunately, without a persistent character goal, Phillips fumbles between the threads, leaving Joker in a perpetual state of setup. It pales compared to how effortlessly The King of Comedy establishes Rupert Pupkin’s goal of becoming a comedian. Fleck’s dream of featuring on Murray’s show wavers in and out and is resolved by chance. In this thread, De Niro is fine as Murray, but it is a minor part that does not test his dramatic edge and Marc Maron (GLOW) is wasted in a walk-in cameo. There are also at least three times where Phillips forgoes all writing and pointlessly films Phoenix dancing in slow-motion, including most cringingly to Gary Glitter’s ‘Rock and Roll Part 2’. Why we are subjected to such a sight we may never know. Meanwhile, the subplot involving Sophie is superfluous and could have been cut. She barely registers as a character and this thread’s revelation is bluntly explained by quick intercuts to earlier scenes as though the filmmakers were adamant the audience would not realise its implications. Compared to Comedy, the gimmick of the ‘unreliable narrator’, the blurring of fiction and reality inside Fleck’s head, is a cliché and lacks seamlessness. Joker’s most interesting thread leans towards a surprisingly unique twist involving Fleck’s upbringing. It will not be spoiled here except to say that the story shamelessly diverts from this potentially game-changing twist for DC, which hints at studio interference. Besides, what happened to this film being a standalone movie without ties to the broader DC universe? The film’s dialogue and characterisations lack finesse too. An early exchange between Fleck and a social worker is hampered by clunky exposition such as, ‘have you thought more about why I was locked up?’ and ‘is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?’ Meanwhile, the frequency of the ‘smiling’ and ‘happiness’ motifs in the dialogue are overused. Fleck’s mother even calls her son ‘Happy’ and says, ‘don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?’ in case it was not already apparent that he’s untalented. The film’s side characters do not resonate either. Brian Tyree Henry (Widows; If Beale Street Could Talk) is wasted by appearing in one scene as a clerk who fights with Fleck over a folder. Some of the worst storytelling involves Thomas Wayne, the future mayor of Gotham City. His inclusion results in an embarrassingly clumsy expose of class warfare echoing Hillary Clinton. Following the murder of the Wall Street creeps, the mayor describes the lower-class people as ‘clowns’, which causes great uproar. The line is a lame, transparent recap of Clinton’s ‘basket of deplorables’ gaffe from the 2016 US presidential election. There is also a line about ‘super rats’, which recalls the Clintons’ ‘super predators’ comment. Furthermore, another cringing scene sees Fleck sneak into a theatre as a bellboy while the wealthy and powerful, including Wayne, watch Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times (1936) and presumably eat caviar. Wayne’s overbearing characterisation and the image of people in their tuxedos are examples of caricatures used to depict the haves and have nots, which is certainly not what this serious drama intended. As a gritty crime story, Joker’s plotting leaves much to be desired. Apparently, the police in Gotham City are too stupid to know Arthur is responsible for the train killings despite an incident at a hospital involving a gun where he was dressed as a clown and the train ride itself where he is the only person at the station in makeup. Batman, where are you? Likewise, the premise that people would violently riot following Wayne’s ‘clowns’ comment and see Fleck as a hero is as preposterous as any Trumpian conspiracy theory. DC fans might rush to say the moment is ambiguous, existing inside Fleck’s head, except that the movie climaxes with an interesting but ultimately ham-fisted connection to a pivotal event in DC’s canon. Recent discourse has speculated whether Joker idolises dangerous white men and radical violence. Initially, the suggestion seems impossible when Fleck is clearly a psychotic weirdo. The film’s violence is hash, impacting, and upsetting, which is different from comic adaptations where death is meaningless. However, the longer Joker continues, the more in eye-rolling fashion it shifts our sympathy towards Fleck by using unpleasant side characters to paint him as a misunderstood victim of society. Consequently, Phillips is ideologically confused. He cannot decide whether he is demonising Fleck or creating a pro-fascist, Trump-like anti-hero to combat the political establishment. By subtracting Batman and making Wayne an uncaring jerk who defunds medical treatment, it is all too clear whose side Phillips favours. One hopes DC fans realise that Joker’s representation of class warfare is not a nuanced portrait of real life. In a climax channelling Network (1976), Fleck says ‘you decide what is right and wrong like what is funny or not’. The line is a cop-out, typifying Hollywood’s uncertainty about handling politics in mainstream movies. It will be also interesting how Trump voters react to this scene too given how outspoken one of the film’s actors has been against the president. Joker is exactly what the title character would have wanted: a violent crime-spree that pitches people against each other and sends them raging while he walks away with the box office cash. Phoenix is solid in his physicality and presence as Fleck, but the creepy portrayal sits below the fun and complexity of Heath Ledger’s take in The Dark Knight (2008), which was crazy and measured, but also funny, manipulative, and devious. On this note, Todd Phillips is not Christopher Nolan let alone Scorsese. His direction is too heavy-handed and didactic, too eager to ensure that every piece of insanity is underlined in red. It makes the film obvious and draining in its themes, expressions, and mood. It postures as a serious companion to Scorsese’s best films but lacks its own credible message and a clear ideological viewpoint. It is simply another comic book origin story, hampered by lumpy writing and dubious political ideas that seldom does it understand. Damien Straker is a freelance writer and film critic.

"Oct 7, 2019"," 
  “IS it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?”asks clown impersonator Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) at the start of this origins tale about the comic book villain. If ever there was a film that was desperate for cult status, for its lines to feature on T-shirts and its anti-hero to become this year’s hottest Halloween dress up character, it is Todd Phillips' drama.
 
  In America, Joker has reignited the old debate about whether movies, having great power, should also exercise responsibility when it comes to violence, and it will doubtless do the same here.
 
  Fleck, a bundle of raw nerve endings, lives in Gotham City in the early 1980s. The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter) puts his inappropriate and maniacal laughter – more of a sob than a guffaw – down to a “condition”, and his behaviour in general to mental illness and a disturbed past. Living with his sick mother in a rubbish-strewn city going to the dogs/super rats, the fuse is about to be lit on the stick of dynamite that is Arthur, and everyone should stand well back.
 
  If playing the character as Gotham City’s answer to Travis Bickle is not enough Robert De Niro worship for you, the King of Comedy star himself turns up as a late night talk show host who makes Arthur famous by laughing at, rather than with, his attempts to be a comedian.
 
  It is easy to see why Joker has been controversial. Everything about it is over the top and provocative, from the picture’s portrait of a divide, warring America where the rich are despised, to Phoenix’s bursting out of the screen performance. Even the choice of music (Gary Glitter, seriously?) seems designed to shock. It is sickeningly violent, and exploitative, too, inviting the audience to see Arthur as a victim, worthy of our sympathy, and yes, Phoenix makes him cool.

"Oct 7, 2019","The film is impressively lurid, with a freak-out performance from Joaquin Phoenix... But even as it feels very of-the-moment, the film is indulgent and rather too lurid to take seriously.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," It’s impossible to go into Joker without the heavy fog of its insufferable, endless online discourse clouding your view. The ridiculous moral panics and equally silly impassioned defences have already made it an exhausting experience. Putting that to one side, Joker is an effectively disquieting character study featuring a great Joaquin Phoenix performance that doesn’t actually court any of the controversy it’s received. A gritty reimagining of the origin of Batman’s greatest foe, Joker might technically exist in the DC universe, but it takes liberties and departures from the get go. Gotham has never been more transparently New York than it is here, a ragged ‘80s city plagued by trash strikes and awful Wall Street yuppies. Into this mix is thrown the dangerously mentally unwell Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), whose loss of his job and social worker pushes him down a dark, murderous path. One could criticise Phoenix for dipping into over-acting, but he makes Arthur a brilliantly skin-crawling figure. His mere existence is uncomfortable for both himself and the people around him, and when Todd Phillips sits back and lets Phoenix work, Joker is legitimately great. Phillips’s attempts at some ‘arthouse’ stylings are less effective, feeling self-conscious, but he does build an effectively unpleasant world that feels actively hostile. A lot of his shots look fantastic, and though the score is a little heavy-handed, it adds gravitas to proceedings. When violence erupts, it’s brief, bloody, and intimate, hardly the delirious gory explosions of other R-rated comic book movies, and it makes a real impact. Though it’s not on the same level as Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, Joker’s liberal borrowing from these films gives it weight and purpose. Not the film it was feared to be, Joker instead makes some unexpected points about class systems and social programs, and makes them well.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," Too much has already been said about Joker. Warner Bros.' new crown jewel has been the talk of Hollywood since its premiere at the Venice International Film Festival, where it later won its top prize, the Gold Lion. The director, Todd Phillips, has pivoted from comedy to serious awards fare, with the sheen of prestige that comes with it. The narrative writes itself: Director most known for bro comedies like Old School and The Hangover Trilogy grows up, gets real and justifies his place in Hollywood. Actor Joaquin Phoenix, known for his collaborations with Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze, and Lynne Ramsey, adds further weight to the project, with Phoenix portraying the titular character. Joker has been touted as a serious film, touching on issues of mental illness, economic inequality and America's favorite subject: the sad, white male loner. With prestige comes scrutiny, as Joker stands accused of being cinematic validation for incels as well as a possible catalyst for mass violence. Phoenix recently walked out of an interview after being asked by film critic Robbie Collin if he was worried that the film might inspire the kind of person the film's about, which Collin described as ""an unstable, self-pitying loner with a mass-shooter mindset."" Warner Bros. has even issued a statement saying that the film isn't intended as an endorsement of violence and that the filmmakers do not consider the Joker a hero. Much of the criticism of Joker has been rooted in handwringing over what the film supposedly stands for and the power it will hold in the public once it is unleashed into multiplexes worldwide. This panic has reached a critical mass as we all hold our collective breaths until the film's opening weekend.  Much has also been made of Joker's whiteness. There is worry that he may garner white nationalist sympathies, simply to his whiteness and alienation. There has also been speculation over the way Joker will depict race. Early trailer reactions were apprehensive, zeroing in on the way black people are featured prominently in Joker's life.  At first glance, it seems as if black people are the source of Joker's anger. A black social worker lets him down. A tired black mother tells him to leave her son alone. A black hospital clerk — portrayed by Brian Tyree Henry — stares at Joker apprehensively, as if recognizing what he is capable of. And then there's Zazie Beetz playing Sophie, the object of Joker's affection. Given these details, it is easy to imagine that Joker's relationships with black people will be a major factor in the film. Their images alone leave much more of a lasting effect on the viewer than other major characters like Joker's mother (Frances Conroy) and Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), or even Robert De Niro's character, the late-night comedy host Murray Franklin. The black faces are what we remember about the trailer, so it's not unreasonable to expect them to be a major part of Joker's eventual emotional downturn.  But there's more to being a white nationalist than being sad while white, and having seen the film I can report that neither Joker nor the Joker are anti-black. At least, not in a way that's any different than the inherent racism within Hollywood's cinematic language. The kids who beat up Joker in the beginning of the film are brown, but so are most cinematic gangs of rowdy inner-city children. The social worker and hospital staff Joker encounters are black, which is common in film as well as the world we live in. In one scene, Joker interacts with a hospital clerk played by Henry. Henry's character can tell that there's something wrong with Joker simply by looking at him and proceeds with caution. His apprehensions are correct, but his interaction time with the burgeoning madman is short and he never returns to the film. It's a role so small, it's a wonder Henry accepted it in the first place. It's like a bite-sized version of Laurence Fishburne's role in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Even Sophie, Joker's black love interest, has a cinematic precedent: Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy, a film about a struggling comedian who wants to make it big in part to impress the black woman he's wooing (played by De Niro's then-wife Diahnne Abbott). Like Abbott's character Rita before her, Sophie is a practical woman just trying to make an honest living when an unpredictable, visibly sad white man intrudes on her life with nervous energy and lofty romantic expectations. Unfortunately, Beetz gets much less to do than Abbott in a role that's more symbolic than anything else. On the other hand, there's something nice about knowing that her low screentime promises a happy ending for her far away from the Joker. And as the film goes on, it becomes apparent that Joker is more in love with the idea of Sophie than anything else. In the universe of the film, she isn't truly regarded as a human being. Joker's depiction of blackness onscreen can be easily drawn back to Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder, much of Scorsese's early work, and the films of Abel Ferrara and the directors who shaped our cinematic understanding of New York City from the '70s well into the '90s. Phillips simply can't hide his influences. Joker wouldn't exist without Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy, and its visual style is essentially a mimic of that work. Joker is a movie that has watched other movies and is aware of the shorthand necessary to make viewers believe that they're watching a realistic, important film. Phillips knows that in order to set his work apart from the white New York City of Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach films, he has to include people of color as symbols of what is ""real."" Joker is more diverse than many of Phillips' previous films, with the exception of his previous swipe at legitimacy, War Dogs. In Joker, racial diversity is an aesthetic choice, proving its own grit and presumed importance. If anything, our apprehensive reaction to Joker's open display of black characters says much more about the way cinema has trained our eyes than the film itself. When we see black people onscreen we expect it to mean something, and Phillips knows enough about movies to suspect it would elicit a response. As for the Joker himself, race rarely factors into any of his actions. He seems generally uninterested in the race of people around him and doesn't seem to have any opinions on being white — supremacist or otherwise. His interactions with people of color are mainly depicted as incidental, and when his killing spree begins the majority of his victims are white. Joker's actions are primarily driven by poverty, loneliness and an inability to feel like a functional part of the social ecosystem of the world. Joker has no agenda, even stating later in the film that he ""doesn't believe in anything."" His anger is an internal whirlwind with no clear origin or intended target. He is merely a soul lost in a hollowly crafted world. Joker is many things. It's overstuffed, politically confused, formulaic, and misogynistic. It's a ripoff of the highest order, borrowing from greater filmmakers without the nuance or intelligence to make the entire enterprise worthwhile. It falls apart entirely in the second half as gripping drama evaporates and is replaced with a predictable villain origin story narrative. It's a film with a lot of problems which will likely be dissected ad nauseam until the end of Oscar season next year.

"Oct 7, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ standalone supervillain origin story Joker is arriving in theaters amid so much controversy and concern about the potential for copycat violence that the debate has largely overwhelmed the film itself. It’s been fascinating to watch the discussion around the movie shift from “Do we really need another Joker story so soon after Suicide Squad?” to “Is Joker full of dangerous ideas that will spur its worst fans to murder?” The initial worries around Joker assumed the movie would be unnecessary, its impact negligible. The current questions ascribe it with too much importance, as if it might incite full-blown anarchy just by existing. As usual in a case where people leap to extremes, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Joker may make some people who feel marginalized feel more seen and more powerful, and they may act out in response. There are some ugly, self-serving messages in the movie, which is incongruously bent on creating sympathy for Batman’s worst enemy and one of DC Comics’ most notoriously callous mass murderers and atrocity architects. But love it or hate it, the film does spin up a tempting fantasy of persecution and relief, of embracing nihilism as a means of complete escape from a terrible world. It’s a self-pitying fantasy, certainly. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver follow in the footsteps of Joel Schumacher’s 1993 drama Falling Down in portraying the world as a cartoonishly dark and uncaring place, an almost comically vile carnival where the protagonist can’t find a hint of comfort or relief. In a thoroughly immersed performance that’s being seen as a guaranteed awards-season attention magnet, Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a part-time rent-a-clown working for a seedy talent agency full of exaggerated grotesques. Arthur is mentally ill and coping via meds and court-ordered therapy, which don’t offer comfort or represent caring. He’s devoted to his sick mother Penny (Frances Conroy), who’s encouraged him to see himself as a joyous light in the world, bringing laughter to the people. The problem is that he isn’t particularly funny. He’s painfully awkward, the kind of twitchy, social incompetence people shy away from in public because his erratic behavior feels like it could turn dangerous — or at least uncomfortable for them. It’s easy for viewers to empathize with his desire to be loved, without necessarily loving him. When he says he feels invisible, it’s clear why: he’s the kind of person people look away from on the street, out of apathy or active discomfort. That tension between sympathy and revulsion is one of the most honest things about Joker, which mostly goes out of its way to make the world awful. While working as a sign-twirler, Arthur is randomly beaten by a handful of kids, who steal his sign and then break it over his head. His boss not only doesn’t believe his story, he demands Arthur pay for the missing sign. The dramatic ironies and injustices compound throughout the film, until it’s clear that Arthur isn’t paranoid, the world really is out to get him. And then he takes violent, irrevocable action. For much of its runtime, Joker is a consciously ugly film, visually and emotionally. Arthur starts with close to nothing, and loses it all incrementally, in ways designed to hurt empathetic viewers. Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (who also DP’d for all three of Phillips’ Hangover movies) give the film a sickeningly grungy, underlit, David Fincher-esque look, especially in Arthur’s squalid home. Everything about the storytelling — the ominous, booming score; the gritty darkness; the invasive sound design — is designed to be oppressive, and to push the audience toward Arthur’s point of view as the primary victim of all the oppression. It’s hypnotic just how horrifying Arthur’s existence is, just as Phoenix’s performance is hypnotic as he spirals from fragile hope into increasingly outsized and confident acts of destruction. And then he escapes it all, by learning not to care — not about how or whether other people see him, not about whether he hurts or frightens or kills them, not about whether his final-act manifesto makes any sort of coherent sense. The important part of Arthur’s story — and the cause for so much of the concern around Joker — is that when he embraces his most nihilistic and destructive impulses, he suddenly earns the praise and attention he’s been lacking. That may not fully motivate him, but it’s meant as a message for the segment of the audience that feels closest to Arthur, those who feel most unseen and unloved: plenty of people agree with you that the world is unfair and ugly, and if you did something about it, they’d back your play.  Like Falling Down — and Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, which Phillips openly emulates and references — Joker suggests that when the leading man loses his mind, it’s an understandable, even natural reaction to an equally mad world. Viewers who aren’t already inclined to see humanity as a seething cesspit may not resonate with that level of cynicism. But to viewers who feel as abused and overlooked as Arthur Fleck, or even who harbor smaller, more rational resentments about society, Joker is a deliberate and fine-tuned provocation and promise: you aren’t alone, the people you hate really are awful, and it would be okay to act against them in any way you want. Phillips has made it clear that he doesn’t believe Joker is anything as small and dismissible as a mere comic-book movie. But while his film is grimmer and more harrowing than anything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s offering up a fantasy just as clearly as any superhero wish-fulfillment power trip: the fantasy of being a hero to some, of going from powerlessness to power, of being feared and beloved at the same time. Phillips delivers that message in a self-congratulatory way, largely by setting the film in a world where Arthur has no choice but violence, and no escape but madness. He’s portrayed as a kind of dark truth-teller because he’s learned that the world is a joke and nothing matters. That’s a fairly adolescent outlook, which Phillips embraces in the same persecution-complex spirit that recently led him to complain that he had to make Joker because the world is now too sensitive and woke for his previous brand of destructive-bro comedy. But Joker would probably be raising much less social concern if it wasn’t such a technically compelling movie, if its final moments weren’t so outsized and joyous and purposefully insane. Because Joker does play — not just to its most put-upon, angry, repressed viewers — but to the entire audience’s darkest hearts. It shows someone suffering when he lets society have its way with him, and freed when he has his way with society. It shows him weeping alone when he plays by the rules, and dancing wildly in public when he decides to break those rules. The story hurts and harms him, but Phillips suggests in the end that everything he went through was necessary to bring him the power and recognition he deserves. It’s a tempting fantasy, crafted with utter conviction.  Many critics and early viewers have responded to Joker with loathing, because that fantasy is so selfish and solipsistic. By dismissing the world as imbalanced at best, outright malicious at worst, Phillips is enabling his viewers’ worst and most destructive impulses. “I just don’t want to feel so bad anymore,” Arthur says plaintively at one point. He’s a relatable kind of villain, harmless and sad — not an Everyman, but an audience avatar for the downtrodden. And then he models a way to not be harmless anymore. That doesn’t necessarily make Joker a call to action, or an invitation to real-life violence. But it does represent a horrifying form of invitation — not just a call to sympathize with the devil, but a full-blown justification for the hell he creates.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," It feels like the new Joaquin Phoenix “Joker” movie has been out for months, as the discourse debating the film certainly has been. Was it a masterpiece or a mistake? An ode to complex humanity or violent “incel” white men? A great deal of speculative ink has been spilled, credible threats have been fielded by the FBI, and the New York City Police Department and others have stepped up security at screenings. Now, the film is finally here, and it turns out the piece of art that has caused such an uproar is nothing more than an incoherent, misbegotten and embarrassingly dull two hours. This is a movie that has nothing to say, which is ironic since so many have said so much about it ahead of time. It turns out the piece of art that has caused such an uproar is nothing more than an incoherent, misbegotten and embarrassingly dull two hours. Directed, produced and co-written by Todd Phillips, he of “The Hangover” trilogy and other painfully misanthropic comedies, “Joker” is an attempt at drama through humor. Based on the “Batman” comic villain from the 1940s, the movie tries to turn the narrative of the famous caped crusader on its head, creating an origin story from the point of view of Batman’s archrival. The Joker, who famously wears clown makeup and sports green hair, is reimagined as a former children’s entertainer and failed stand-up comic, in the vein of Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” But there’s little in the way of laughs in this film, which instead lands with sadly predictable thuds. Considering the landscape of the cinematic world is currently rife with comic book movies, it makes sense that directors are searching for new perspectives. Nor is it revolutionary to tell the villain’s side of the story. Sony did it with “Venom” this time last year, mining the Spider-verse for stories that did not include the titular webslinger — for contractual reasons. But don’t tell that to “Joker.” This is a film that is convinced of its own subversiveness, practically crowing that it is getting away with something. (Phillips himself boasted in interviews that he sold the movie to star Phoenix by telling him they were making a “real movie” under the guise of a comic book framework.) If only it had something worth getting away with on screen. “Joker” is extraordinarily frustrating because in one sense, it’s a wasted opportunity. Phoenix’s performance as Arthur, the proto-Joker, is, as usual, of the highest caliber. Robert De Niro graces the celluloid with his presence as a Johnny Carson/Jay Leno character named Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are both painfully underused in the two female roles, but are great in what little screentime they’re given. So it is confusing that the first 30 minutes are just one long cringe-fest as Arthur is routinely beaten up for little to no reason, while the next hour is a highly transparent guessing game of “what is real and what is delusion.” Throughout, the film references Scorsese so thoroughly, one wonders if the producers were giving the filmmaker residuals. But the worst part comes at the end, when the film reveals how truly confused it is. There’s something about the rich getting richer and the downtrodden getting screwed, but no one ever really puts the pieces together, least of all Joker himself. Arthur starts a “movement” after murdering some rich white frat boys, but when asked why he demurs that he’s “not political” over and over. He just likes killing people. There is a vague mush of right-wing and left-wing talking points that Phillips probably heard some intellectual types drunkenly pontificate about at a party once. But it’s really just nonsense. Then there’s the “Joker” finale, which is a supposedly political speech delivered by the main character on prime-time TV. There is a vague mush of right-wing and left-wing talking points that Phillips probably heard some intellectual types drunkenly pontificate about at a party once. But it’s really just nonsense. The Joker doesn’t give a damn about politics, anyway. He’s just mad that people laughed at him, and not in the way he meant them too. And this is where the real problem with this movie comes in. Beneath the faux-1970s New York setting, there’s no “there” there. This means that audiences can fill up the empty space with whatever they want to see. And that explains the amount of controversy that has preceded this movie. Show part of the film’s cut to survivors of the Aurora shooting, and they’re going to see a film that promotes random acts of violence. Show it to a room full of high-end critics at Venice, and they will give it a standing ovation (and the Golden Lion) for what they perceive as an investigation of nihilism of the modern age. Show it to a room full of angry white men who feel like the world somehow isn’t giving them what they are owed, and suddenly, people are asking if it’s meant as inspiration. Warner Brothers put out a statement ahead of “Joker’s” release condemning gun violence in our society, but defending the film as “provok[ing] difficult conversations around complex issues.” Both the production studio and Phillips have argued the Joker character is not supposed to be seen as a hero. But the film does ask the audience to vaguely sympathize with him as an “incel” like white male, even if it provides very little context for why we should (or why we should not). So it’s not surprising the film has been interpreted as taking these men who murder friends, family members, classmates and strangers, and saying “but you understand we should feel sorry for them right?” If “Joker” actually had a real message, that might have been easier to defend. Warner Brothers is right in the sense that society appears not to care all that much about preventing actual mass murders, so pushing back on murderous art feels hypocritical. But “Joker” is not taking a stand one way or another, and of all the things people can see within it, “complex” is certainly not one of them.

"Oct 7, 2019"," Joker garnered a lot of positive buzz after its first showing at the Venice Film Festival, where it won their Golden Lion Award. The early premiere gave the film plenty of time to bask in this glory without a wide audience, which is an odd situation for a superhero movie in this day and age. Typically, these projects care more about fandom’s reaction than anything, but Joker was very clear about projecting a different image: It was Art, not something the masses were meant to group in with dreaded popular entertainment. The film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a rent-a-clown living in poverty with mental illness, a sick mother, and a childhood head injury that causes him to laugh at moments that society would deem “inappropriate”. As he learns more about his own past and tries to assert himself in a world that ignores him, he becomes an improbable and unintended figurehead in the brewing upheaval between the elite and lower classes of his city. Set in 1981 Gotham (which is very clearly just New York, as it often is) and re-rendered in certain screenings to appear as though it was shot in 70mm film, the movie makes no bones about its influences, primarily Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as well as a hodgepodge of 70s auteur films. But while the look of the movie is frequently stunning, Joker makes a mistake that many nostalgic films suffer from—the belief that aping a lauded visual style and a few narrative cues somehow compensates for a lack of clarity in storytelling. Joker, for all that it tries to pack in themes on isolation, mental illness, societal unrest, domestic abuse, class division, and the effects of generational violence, doesn’t seem to have any idea what it’s about. It is a very sad film where terrible things happen to people who deserve better, there’s a basic progression of events, but if you were to ask what sort of messages or ideas the film intended to impart—even a half-assed, deliberately vague “all life is chaos, there’s no meaning”—you’d be hard-pressed to find it. Ambiguity, be it moral or otherwise, can serve stories well in many cases, as Scorsese’s body of work has proven again and again. But that ambiguity still requires that someone framing the story have an opinion about what’s on screen, which Joker fails to communicate at every turn. Is the titular character meant to impart our own failings to us? To make us feel bad for the people who society fails? To make us less surprised at the violence we encounter every day by attempting to explain how the world can radicalize the suffering and downtrodden? These are all (trite) possibilities, yet Joker is reticent to elicit emotions from its audience, to engage them with its point of view. Phoenix’s performance as Fleck, while haunting, seems to have no purpose beyond watching him act. Director Todd Phillips made mention of wanting to do a “character study” film on a comic book villain before taking on the project, but character studies are not the sum of whole narratives. Character studies are for cinema verité, for student short films, for actors looking to beef up their audition reels with more material. Building a whole film around a character study can only give you a performance, and no matter how skilled that performance is, it cannot be a substitute for everything else a fully realized story deserves. Many of the narrative beats are lifted wholesale by screenwriters Phillips and Scott Silver from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, but with no intention toward altering or reconsidering the statements of their predecessors. Setting the film in 1981 further shackles Joker to those specters of the past, making the time period choice an affectation rather than meaningful decision. But the real question is, why bother letting directors and writers create these odes to films of a bygone era when they have nothing to add to the conversation—thereby suggesting that odes themselves constitute High Art? Some have praised Joker for existing firmly outside the superhero studio mill that we’re now subjected to several times a year, but replicating films of the past is hardly an innovative improvement on that model, and pretending that the superhero genre has little to offer artistically is plain lazy. At least James Manigold’s Logan, while closely following the narrative of Western classic Shane, cared about placing the events of that film into an X-Men narrative. Joker doesn’t care to consider the potential of the superhero (or supervillain) narrative, and its realism comes off hollow as a result. The irony of this choice is that for all the film wants to eschew these tropes, it commits the greatest cardinal sin of all: showing the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne on film, something that only the Adam West Batman and Batman: The Animated Series have somehow been smart enough to avoid among countless iterations of the Caped Crusader. There are occasional moments of accidental brilliance in Joker that give us glimpses of the film that might have been. At one point the Joker dances on an outdoor staircase in full regalia while Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll” plays in the background, hinting at an alternate reality where this film took its pedigree less seriously, one where the Joker was—Batman forbid—permitted to have some fun. Occasionally, Phoenix reaches deep down and harnesses his own charisma, giving Fleck the ability to channel that glimmer of megalomania that makes the character both exciting and terrifying. But those moments vanish too quickly, and we’re left with more perspectiveless commentary on societal decay, mob violence, and the desperation of those living in poverty. Despite any seeming attempts to consider the plight of lower classes, Joker frequently paints these rioting mobs with as little nuance as figures in a board game: One sign during Gotham’s protests literally says “Kill the Rich”, which reads as though some studio exec saw a sign on set with the current popular slogan “Eat the Rich” and said, Nah, you know, it’s not clear to me. How would they eat us? Is it literal, I can’t tell. Maybe just simplify the message there. The fact that the film cannot decide how to depict the denizens of Gotham is a large part of what keeps the whole exercise directionless. Fleck is frequently abused by his fellow citizens, but they come from all walks of life—aggravated parents, punk kid gangs, wealthy finance bros, Thomas Wayne himself. There’s a class war narrative built into Joker, but it’s missing any sympathetic undertones needed to offer perspective. Are we meant to care about the people rioting against the elites of Gotham? Should we be frightened of them? Should we feel the way Arthur Fleck feels in their presence? If your entire narrative centers around visible violent class warfare, some strong opinions are required on the subject. The fact that there are none makes it seem as though everyone responsible in making Joker wanted to shock their audience, but not risk offending them. Which is pretty much the opposite of the point of that entire 70s auteur film movement that Joker is desperate to inhabit. The film insists frequently that the Joker doesn’t see himself or his actions as a political statement. He is asked more than once and always demurs, yet his clarifying act in the film follows a tirade in which he acknowledges that he is what comes of society’s neglect and abuse. It’s unclear if the movie thinks that the Joker doesn’t know that his statement is political, or the film itself doesn’t understand it’s own political nature, which makes the poor handling of Gotham City’s unrest and riots even more baffling. In the sharpest of ironies, Joker’s determination to build on Scorsese’s milieu while neglecting pop culture markers means the film ignores the sources that might have been the most helpful to it—V For Vendetta had no trouble building on this exact premise, but its politics were clear, deftly executed, and far more moving than anything Joker is willing to hand its viewers. But what’s perhaps more disturbing is the fact that Joker ignores the most important lesson of the character’s wooly origins. While the film takes some clear inspiration from Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke, it refuses to take the moral with it—the Joker’s insistence that Batman is just “one bad day” away from being as awful as him is met with rejection in that story. Instead this film seems to posit “But what if your whole life was one bad day?” as some bizarre justification for treading deeper into the Joker’s psyche. As though that question is unique. But it’s not, really. It’s a thought exercise that anyone could do in their head with very little prompting. Riffing on Scorsese’s greatest hits doesn’t make the thought exercise more poignant. It just gives another filmmaker a poor excuse to cue up Cream’s “White Room” when bad things happen.

"Oct 7, 2019"," You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply. Marvel superheroes, begone! It’s grownup season on the big screen, and this weekend’s new films have our critics pounding the table (and hoping you’ll hit the theaters). If you want your movie night on the sofa, check out Amazon’s rollout of 25 James Bond flicks to celebrate the franchise’s 60th anniversary (we’ve got the scoop, below). It’s a stirring weekend at the movies, so do pass the popcorn! Brace yourself for a scathing comedy that takes aim at the wealthy and the beautiful — and tosses all decorum overboard without a life vest. Set on a yacht captained by a Marxist alcoholic (the wily Woody Harrelson, 61), we encounter a luxury ship of fools, from the Russian capitalist (Zlatko Buric, 69) and the demanding privileged patrons; to the models Carl (rising leading man Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), who trade their looks and social media influence for a free ride; to cleaner Abigail (scene-stealer Dolly De Leon) and the below-deck crew. When the inevitable storm hits, a small group washes ashore on a desert island. Wealth and beauty surrender to those with survival skills, and the balance of power radically shifts. From Ruben Östlund, the Swedish genius behind Force Majeure, the English-language satire won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for its outrageous takedown of the lifestyles of the rich and Instagram famous. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Writer-director Walter Hill, 80, who’s made classic Westerns on film (The Long Riders) and for cable (Broken Trail), recharges the form with a low-budget doozy. Christoph Waltz, 66, leads Hill’s tight ensemble through taut adventure as a bail enforcement agent who tracks a New Mexico oligarch’s wife (Rachel Brosnahan), ostensibly abducted by a Black U.S. soldier (Brandon Scott), deep into Old Mexico. It’s refreshing to meet characters like Waltz’s sly, stoic “bounty man,” or the mordant roughneck played by Willem Dafoe, 67, when they’re a long way into their lives. And when they re-meet, it’s explosive. Benjamin Bratt, 58, is a dashing villain, Hamish Linklater, a skin-crawling cuckold, and Warren Burke, an exuberant sidekick who becomes Waltz’s full partner in a tale that fleshes out Mark Twain’s thought: “Laws control the lesser man. Right conduct controls the greater one.” —Michael Sragow (M.S.) Christian Bale is ferociously wonderful in Amsterdam. He sings, wisecracks, injects painkillers, has WWI battle scars and is frequently seen adjusting (or chasing) his glass eye. He leads a suitably eye-popping cast: stunning Margot Robbie; John David Washington; Robert De Niro, 79; Mike Myers, 59; Chris Rock, 57; and many more. While Amsterdam flashes back to WWI, it’s largely set in the 1930s, as veterans and compatriots Ben (Bale) and Harold (Washington) witness a socialite’s murder. Under suspicion themselves, they attempt to expose the real culprit. They gradually realize her death isn’t an isolated incident; there’s a fascist cult in lockstep with genocidal European tyrants intent on scrambling domestic democracy. From Oscar-winning showman David O. Russell, 64, there’s so much razzmatazz, artistry and comedic snap — yet the antic pastiche lacks a satisfying mystery plot and, sadly, is less than the sum of its amazing performances. —T.M.A. ​Talk about stirring the martini: Amazon celebrates James Bond’s 60th anniversary by streaming every Bond flick, from Dr. No to No Time to Die, on Prime Video. There’s also a documentary, The Sound of 007, and a recording of a charity concert of the Bond soundtracks, The Sound of 007: Live From the Royal Albert Hall, with special guests including “Goldfinger” singer Dame Shirley Bassey. If Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series about the Milwaukee cannibal, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, doesn’t slake your taste for psychological horror, try this three-part documentary, which explores the serial killer’s warped mind through his newly unearthed recorded interviews with his legal team, revealing the ways that race, sexuality, class and policing allowed him to prey on marginalized communities. We haven’t heard a whole lot from Girls creator Lena Dunham lately. But her adaptation of this 1994 best-selling novel, a medieval coming-of-age story about a young girl dodging her parents’ plans for her to marry, was well received at the Toronto Film Festival, so maybe all she needed to get her creative mojo back was a new setting (like, say, the 12th century). Our critics scanned the entire film catalog from the 1930s to now to handpick just 30 films that you must ­— must — see. We’re not talking about the best films (everyone does that list) but rather the films that are essential. You want to have seen these movies not just because they’re great (they are), but because they ensure you’re tuned into their cultural moments, the power of their time. So when someone makes a Philadelphia Story reference or deadpans, “the Dude abides,” you know exactly what they mean. It’s truly amazing how many incredible movies there are available on mainstream platforms like Amazon, Netflix and others. Our critics round up the very best for you, no matter what your interest. Check out the latest “Best of” lists from AARP critics. There’s never been a better time to catch up on movies you always intended to watch. Sigourney Weaver, 72, is staggeringly good: as in Hildy Good, a driven divorcée, mother of two grown daughters, and Realtor who survives from house sale to house sale. With a stiff upper lip, she puts on a brave and perfectly polished face. Snappy responses shoot out with a deflecting charm. But once her family stages an intervention, Good gradually realizes — after one blackout too many — that she doesn’t control the bottle; it controls her. Together with charmer Kevin Kline, 74, as her rustic high school sweetheart, the pair generate heat and heart connection in a mature sleeper that’s ultimately about the struggle to live an authentic life. The Good House dramatizes how alcohol, that demon brew, can take possession of a hardworking woman, her family and their collective future. There’s got to be a morning after, and Good ultimately confronts it with Yankee fortitude, lobster dinners and a front-row seat at A.A. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ok, maybe it’s time to worry, darling. High on her directorial debut, the delightful Booksmart, Olivia Wilde turned to Stepford Wives dystopian sci-fi. 1950s housewife Alice (magnificent Florence Pugh) makes a mean pot roast and a stiff martini. She shares a mid-century modern with husband Jack (pretty but bland teen idol Harry Styles), who returns daily from his workplace beneath a mysterious mountain and ravishes her in conjugal bliss. But there’s a crack in the dream: The next-door neighbor (KiKi Layne) freaks out; the big boss (a dapper Chris Pine) has messianic tendencies; and Alice starts to snoop at the fringes of the utopian community with dire consequences. The glossy, beautifully shot movie, swamped by incidental gossip about Wilde and Styles coupling on set and tension between her and Pugh, arrives with plenty of baggage; it’s a lot of buildup for a modest payoff. —T.M.A. Around 1995, filmmaker Tyler Perry, now 53, was a stone-broke nobody. He chanced to meet the legendary playwright August Wilson, who inspired him to write his own first screenplay, now at last a movie. It’s an August Wilson-ish melodrama about a shy 1930s Georgia musician (Joshua Boone) who falls for a beauty (Solea Pfeiffer) who passes for white. He becomes a hot Chicago musician, she marries a white racist. When they reunite in their small hometown in the 1940s, murder occurs. The movie is a mess, but ambitious and interesting, and less messy than the shambolic Madea comedies that made Perry a billionaire. The music scenes, from jumpin’ juke joint to ritzy nightclub, boasting tunes by Terence Blanchard and dances by Debbie Allen, are dazzling. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) Muscular and well oiled, Oscar winner Viola Davis, 57, vanquishes and vanquishes again as the emotionally and physically scarred General Nanisca, who cuts through rival tribes and European slavers in a war epic from Gina Prince-Bythewood, 53. Set in the 19th-century West African kingdom of Dahomey, this violent, female-driven history centers on the triumph of Nanisca’s women-only army, loyal to King Ghezo (an underused John Boyega). It’s also the tale of new recruit Nawi (The Underground Railroad’s outstanding Thuso Mbedu) and her journey under Nanisca’s critical eye from abused daughter to machete-wielding warrior. While the movie’s treatment is surprisingly conventional, the tale of women empowered to own their own bodies couldn’t be timelier. —T.M.A. Charming, happy-go-lucky and loose with the truth, Fletch, the title character of the late Gregory McDonald’s easily digestible crime series, has found joyous casting in Jon Hamm, 51. Opting not to pursue the slapstick route of the role’s previous star, Chevy Chase, 78, in Fletch (1985), Hamm’s Irwin M. “Fletch” Fletcher is easy on the eyes as the journalist-turned-sleuth. While investigating a kidnapping and art heist, Fletch is framed (pun intended) for a murder he couldn’t bother to have committed. Colorful characters abound: Kyle MacLachlan, 63, as a germaphobe art dealer; Roy Wood Jr., as a slow-but-steady barking police inspector; and Marcia Gay Harden, 63, going full Anna Magnani as a seductive countess intent on regaining her abducted husband’s priceless paintings. The result is a delightful Gordian knot of a mystery solved by a nutty guy who never breaks a sweat as he wisecracks through life while tripping over corpses. —T.M.A. No conventional music documentary could capture an artist as mercurial as David Bowie. So it’s good that director Brett Morgen, 53, banished the usual parade of talking head blowhards to, instead, turn his doc into a psychedelic swirl of sound and vision. The only voice you hear belongs to the artist himself, swiped from scores of vintage interviews. The quotes float over a dense collage of images from Bowie’s career that, once projected onto the looming screens of IMAX (it’s also in regular theaters), sweeps the viewer into an immersive dream. Contrary to the cliché of Bowie as the alien who fell to earth, his words present him as a man of urgent flesh who brought creativity, insight and awe to every living moment. —Jim Farber (J.F.) Loosely inspired by Bentley-driving Georgia prosperity-gospel preacher Eddie Long, sued by congregants for sexual misconduct, this dark semicomic mockumentary stars Sterling K. Brown as disgraced Pastor Childs, battling to revive his megachurch alongside his increasingly exasperated wife, Trinitie (Regina Hall). The plot is aimless, the writing clunky, but what carries the film is the incandescent performance of the supernal Hall as Trinitie, who covets a beaded spider-silk white hat, props up her errant man (“I would sooner kill him than leave him”), half-conceals eruptive emotions beneath a sweet façade, and whitens her face to do “praise mime” (which is a thing!). Brown is solid, but his character is muddled, and it’s Hall who shines, as does the vivid cast of parishioners and rival preachers. The arch, jokey fantasy is richly rooted in writer-director Adamma Ebo’s ambivalent love of Southern Baptist folkways: the wonderful church ladies’ outfits with serious hats, the troubled lives even a scamming pastor can inspire, the use of Bible verses as proof texts for self-serving purposes, the way “Bless your heart!” can convey seething contempt. It’s a messy film but a lively slice of life. —T.A. ​Sylvester Stallone, 76, can’t stop, won’t stop. If the legendary action star’s run with The Expendables franchise proved anything, it was that the actor still knew how to entertain audiences and demolish rivals unrestrained by age. OK, he may be creakier than in his Rocky days and, thankfully, those painful romantic subplots are a thing of the past. Here, he dips his toe into the world of superheroes as one of two mighty twins: Samaritan and Nemesis. Two decades after an explosion that allegedly eviscerated both, his character is recognized by a young boy who idolizes him (Javon “Wanna” Walton, Euphoria). Samaritan stomps out of retirement to protect the fan from bullies, and good old Red City from rampaging villains, led by the gleefully evil Cyrus (Pilou Asbaek, Game of Thrones). If you like a Stallone action pic, and giggling bad guys driving old muscle cars, this one’s for you. —T.M.A. Idris Elba is noted for arty fare (The Wire, Beasts of No Nation), but he’s terrific in this popcorn thriller about a widowed doctor who takes his realistically squabbling young daughters (Iyana Halley and Leah Sava Jeffries) to their late mom’s South African village for a safari, to connect them with her past. A lion enraged by poachers attacks their jeep, attempting to prevent their future. Director Baltasar Kormákur (Everest) consulted with the director of the superb The Revenant, which featured Leonardo DiCaprio’s hand-to-paw combat with a CG bear, to make his CG lion realistically menacing. Though The Revenant is a lot better — and this lion has a terrible sense of smell, unable to detect the doctor clinging to a limb right over its head — Beast delivers its jolts effectively. It’s 90 minutes well spent. Rogue Agent is a cunning, creepy fact-based thriller about a Ted Bundy–like serial con man. Played by the charming English actor James Norton, best known for his hot priest on PBS’s Grantchester, Robert Freegard is a sweet-faced devil — but make no mistake: He is a devil. The first bizarre act we see is Freegard’s convincing three college students that he’s an MI5 member, uprooting the trio in the middle of the night and deploying them on an undercover “mission” — really an act of kidnapping and extreme manipulation. He then seduces sharp-witted Alice Archer (ex-Bond girl Gemma Arterton). The lonely but chic-as-hell lawyer should know better but finds him irresistible enough to ignore his story’s inconsistencies, until she begins to dig into his past and gets dirt under her manicure. The true-crime tale, anchored by Norton and Arterton, is both classy and chilling on the windy road to the fiend’s comeuppance. —T.M.A. The payoff is worth the wait in Ron Howard’s 147-minute docudrama about the rescue of 12 members of a Thai boys soccer team and their coach from a flooded mountain cave — the basis of the terrific 2021 documentary The Rescue. This movie doesn’t tell us enough about the lads: Netflix secured their story rights for a miniseries. This Amazon Original film hopscotches among pressured public servants, frustrated families and heroic volunteers. But Howard pulls everything together when British cave divers (Colin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen) reach the kids and an Australian colleague (Joel Edgerton) hatches bold plans for their extraction. Legions of saviors, including Thai Navy SEALS, demonstrate the right stuff in scenes that are simultaneously spooky, poignant and thrilling. —Michael Sragow (M.S.) As Brad Pitt, 58, globe-trots promoting his latest action comedy, he’s breaking the male movie-star mold by wearing funky fashions: skirt sets (nice knees!) and shamrock-green suits. He’s equally loose and alive as “Ladybug,” an unlucky hired gun struggling to achieve work-life balance while pursuing a recon mission amidst four other assassins on Japan’s express train. Pitt’s surrounded by a dazzling cast of villains played by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, 61, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon and a sliver of Sandra Bullock, 58, all in fine form. The well-written movie hurtles along, bouncing between zingers and stingers, a runaway train of entertainment. Among the few summer blockbusters that demand theatrical viewing, leave it to Pitt (alongside Cruise, 60) to ensure that movie stars still have the potential to rule the box office — with the right vehicle, like a Bullet Train. —T.M.A. Jordan Peele owns the summer. Amid heat waves, he lures audiences back to air-conditioned theaters with a big, glossy, funny, gross, scary horror movie. A little bit Close Encounters, a little North by Northwest, Nope is nonstop entertainment. Working with Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya (his version of Cary Grant), Peele weaves a wild Western UFO tale. It follows a brother-of-few-words struggling to maintain the family’s Hollywood horse-wrangling business while a suspicious disc cruises above their inland California ranch. Joined by his fast-talking sister (a delightful Keke Palmer), an alien-obsessed techie (Brandon Perea), and a traumatized former child star (Steven Yeun), they battle to survive and capture the wily alien — on film. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard veteran character actor Michael Wincott, 64, as the dour cinematographer delivering the lyrics to Sheb Wooley’s 1958 “The Purple People Eater” in his gravelly voice. —T.M.A. Cinderella’s got nothing on Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville, 66), a widowed British housecleaner of a certain age with a dream: to own a fab frock by Dior. Though there’s a potential Prince Charming in her future, she’s the one who makes the dream happen, saving up to invade France’s haughtiest haute couture salon, guarded by formidable Mme. Colbert (Isabelle Huppert, 69, portraying a nicer version of the scary fashionista Manville got an Oscar nomination for playing in Phantom Thread). Once there, she charms all, befriends and advises young lovers, calms class warfare, wins the best dress, and overcomes heartbreak. It’s wispy fantasy, but lovable Manville and a winsome cast make it feel real. Need a mood boost right now? This is it.  —T.A. A giant of women’s fiction (12 million copies sold), Delia Owens’ novel Where the Crawdads Sing was plucked by Reese Witherspoon’s Book Club, and produced by her as a film. Naturalist Kya (Daisy Edgar-Jones) raises herself from wild child to womanhood in the North Carolina wetland, earning her the derogatory nickname Marsh Girl. Dumped by college-bound Tate (Taylor John Smith), she’s seduced by Chase (rising star Harris Dickinson). When Chase tumbles from a fire tower, Kya becomes the prime suspect. A cross between The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes and To Kill a Mockingbird (David Strathairn, 73, stars as Kya’s defense lawyer), the romance will satisfy fans of the book but suffers from abuse overload. Abandoned by her mother, siblings and drunken father, beaten and sexually assaulted, Kya’s defiance is admirable. But why create such a dynamic character only to make them fate’s piñata? —T.M.A. Baz Luhrmann’s best movie since his masterpiece Romeo + Juliet (1996) is brilliant but overlong, and Tom Hanks (65) masterfully wrestles with a flubbed role as con-man manager Colonel Tom Parker. But Austin Butler is an utter wonder as Elvis, and Baz is even better, frenetic yet nimbly precise, the camera leaping from Elvis belting the first rock hit, “That’s All Right,” to the child Elvis peeking at a Black singer performing the blues original in a wicked juke joint. Quick as a cricket, Baz’s dazzling cinematography conveys his subject’s roots in Black blues and gospel, and Gary Clark Jr., Kevin Harrison Jr., Yola, Shonka Dukureh and Alton Mason are superb as influencers Arthur Crudup, B.B. King, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Big Mama Thornton and Little Richard. Hanks does his best as Parker, narrating the King’s heroic, tragic arc while robbing and ruining him with carny marketing and god-awful films. Elvis balks when Parker tries to make him sing songs like “What Child Is This?” — Parker calls it “Whose Child Is This?” — in a cheesy Christmas special. But he permits Parker to imprison him in Vegas, doped up, instead of touring the world. Baz makes Parker almost nice, vague when the movie (and authenticity) need him to be vividly villainous. Still, you likely won’t see a more original film this year. —T.A. The charming YouTube-sensation short about a brave, inch-tall seashell (voiced by Jenny Slate) gets the full feature treatment, demonstrating a gigantic heart and an easygoing humor. The animated and live-action film follows the bighearted shell-on-sneakers as he navigates the disappearance in the night of a huge portion of his extended family, the diminishing abilities of his beloved immigrant Nana (the sly, moving vocal talent of Isabella Rossellini, 70) and a quest to recover his community with a little help from a heartbroken documentarian (the film’s director Dean Fleischer-Camp). Like wisehearted early Pixar films (Up), Marcel the Shell With Shoes On is a treat for the whole family, and a welcome respite from cynicism, sentimentality and anything-for-a-buck-ism. —T.M.A. Sometimes hard to watch but impossible to turn away from, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande tells the story of uptight, self-conscious widow Nancy Stokes (pitch-perfect Emma Thompson, 63), who hires smooth escort Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack, 29), hoping to find the adventurous sexual fulfillment lacking in her 31-year marriage. Nancy seems as if she’ll never be able let go of her fussbudget, retired teacher persona, even presenting Leo with a list of the sex acts she wants to tick off. But just when you think the film will end with Nancy abandoning herself to Leo’s confident charms, their antiseptic meetups take an abrupt, earthy turn. Nancy pries too much, and Leo’s self-assurance proves a mask concealing an interior as messy and sad as hers. Nancy has never had an orgasm, with herself or others. But their inauspicious coupling — however temporary — results in a happy ending for both. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Michelle Yeoh, 59, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, make beautiful movies together — and I hope to see them joined in everything from Westerns to crime thrillers. In this whacked-out, exuberant, multiple-timeline sci-fi actioner, Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a bedraggled Chinese immigrant living above the family laundromat with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, 50). While sandwiched between her cranky father, Gong Gong (James Hong, 93), and moody daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), she finds herself on the wrong side of IRS auditor Deirdre (Curtis in a crowd-pleasing, physically comic performance). In other words, she’s doing the everywoman juggle, except that in an outrageous series of multiverses, Evelyn has to dig deep, find her inner kung fu fighter, make peace with Joy (who often appears in outrageous costumes as her mother’s multiverse antagonist), Waymond and Gong Gong, and save the world. Spoiler alert: She succeeds — and global audiences will emerge feeling like winners, too. —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP.

"Oct 7, 2019"," “Cleave” is a fascinating word in the English language, because it is its own antonym. It means to come together as well as to pull apart. It’s also an apt term for the social atmosphere that seems to dominate the world these days. Mass communication through ever-present cell phones, social media and more means that people can find others of similar interests and connect with them. But that also gives way to a lot of bubbles in which the most important topic in that community doesn’t even register for the vast majority of the population. Ahead of the release of Todd Phillips’ “Joker,” there was a lot of discussion about a film that sympathizes (and possibly absolves) a solitary, angry white man causing violence at a time when that happens to be the profile of so many mass-shooting perpetrators and hate crimes. However, it’s probable that this discourse over a possible apologia for destructive incels never made it beyond Film Twitter, as most moviegoing audiences may not be aware that it’s a potential aspect of the narrative. Ultimately, it turns out that the handwringing over making excuses for the lone wolves preying on society is moot, because while that is certainly part of the optics, it’s buried under so many other awful elements that it doesn’t even register as the biggest issue with Phillips’ movie. “Joker” is a soulless retread that hopes to masquerade in the flesh of a Martin Scorsese/Paul Schrader film in an attempt to seem edgy or dark but is ultimately defiantly mediocre at best and an utter sham at worst. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally disturbed man trying to get by in the chaotic and uncaring Gotham. As tensions mount in the city and social divides widen, Arthur shambles through life as a poorly paid clown, wannabe comedian and devoted son to his elderly mother (Frances Conroy) as every day greets him with a reminder of how insignificant he is. Escaping into fantasies about appearing on the local late night show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), being adored by millions and connecting with his neighbor (Zazie Beetz) offers little respite from the daily debasements. As billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) runs for mayor amidst these growing hostilities, Arthur begins to find his purpose in a dark new persona. Phoenix once again physically transforms himself for his latest role, appearing dangerously thin and lithe with protruding ribs and shoulder blades. He incorporates Arthur’s neurological disorder of uncontrollable laughter (known as pseudobulbar affect) to convey a sense of a tortured man trapped within the confines not just of an uncaring reality but a body and brain that seeks to betray him. His moments of reverie aren’t joyful affairs but instead mournful breaks from reality where he can get lost in his fantasies before yet another rude awakening. De Niro appears mostly engaged for his performance – which hasn’t always been the case in his recent comedy roles – and carries a sense of authenticity and weight as he beams into Arthur’s apartment every night through the television. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher delivers some excellent shots that are a mixture of foreboding and enchanting – the whimsical nature of a clown as he teeters on the edge of sanity along with the city around him. That’s it as far as the positives go. There are other actors who deliver okay performances, but ultimately, the entire cast is let down by an awful script from Phillips and Scott Silver, including Phoenix himself. Arthur is basically “movie crazy,” which is to say that he is sporadically unhinged in ways that depend on easily explained origins but manifest differently all the time for plot convenience without being specified. He’s on a lot of “medications,” but who knows what those are or what they are meant to do except help him be less crazy. There’s some lip service paid to trauma, mental illness, abuse and the societal failings of taking care of the vulnerable, but there’s no depth to any of it. There’s nothing new, insightful or poignant about what Phillips has done here. He’s taken “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy,” added sprinkles of “The Machinist” (and basically all of Bane’s characterization in “The Dark Knight Rises“) and called it a day. The filmmaker wants to evoke a grimy 1970s New York, but with the exception of a couple of poorly staged protests/riots, there is no sense of unrest or corruption. All of the stress the city is under is told through expository radio and TV broadcasts, which means that it doesn’t feel like a city about to hit the boiling point no matter how often characters insist otherwise. Additionally, the period details are all over the place, with anachronistic technology and clashing imagery that once again speaks to a lack of specificity of time and setting. It’s fine for a film adaptation to deviate from details of the source material as long as it either captures the spirit of the story or is somehow rewarding. The only way that Phillips can feign justification that Arthur is right in his rage is to warp the established DC Comics canon of Gotham and the Waynes so that everyone is an awful person and abuses the protagonist at every turn. Even then, Phillips never settles on a stance about Arthur’s metamorphosis – not in a provocative way that leaves audiences debating, but in a “trying to have it both ways” approach where Arthur is both a regular person with no agenda as well as an anarchist and true victim. In more talented hands, this would be a compelling way to show the various shades of one character, but in “Joker,” it is a cowardly avoidance of anything substantive. In the 1988 graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke” by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland, the artists put forth a possible origin for the Clown Prince of Crime. The running theme of the story is that everyone is one bad day away from becoming a grinning psychopath; with the right push, anyone can become undone and unleash their rage on the world. Of course, that whole point is meant to be juxtaposed with Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon, two men who suffer horrible days (the death of Wayne’s parents and Gordon’s torture at the hands of the Joker) but push back against turning into what they hate. Sympathizing with the devil is a long tradition in the arts, from “Paradise Lost” to “Bedazzled,” but it requires a keen sense of perspective, a deft hand at contrasting the abuses suffered with the atrocities committed and some sense of originality. Todd Phillips’ “Joker” lacks all of those, and instead, is a poorly assembled slog cribbed mostly from the works of much better artists, revealing a hollow echo of a film without any semblance of soul or originality.

"Oct 7, 2019"," An origin story for a villain will never work in cinema. Rob Zombie's disasterpiece on Michael Myers is the definitive proof. I could write a thesis on that abomination. Some of the most iconic villains in cinema are the ones with no backstory, and that's what makes them so terrifying; we know nothing about them: Michael Myers, Heath Ledger's Joker, the killers in The Strangers, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's Nurse Ratched. Even the shark in Jaws counts. What makes all of these characters so fascinating yet scary is their never-revealed, mysterious past. They have no motive, and if they do, it’s simple and that’s what makes them haunting. (For simple yet haunting, The Strangers comes to mind when Liv Tyler’s Kristen McKay asks the killers why they are terrorizing and trying to kill them, and their answer is short and shocking, “Because you were home.”  For Jaws, we don't see how enormous and colossally terrifying the shark is until the very end. A wandering mind is one of the most effective ways to suck in an audience because of curiosity and often, fear. We don't know why these villains are so evil; we just know they take great pleasure in harming others. To paraphrase Alfred (Michael Cain) from The Dark Knight, ""Some just want to watch the world burn.” Moreover, these villains don’t feel what they are doing is wrong. There’s nothing more horrifying than that.  There are myriads of problems with Joker. Co-writer and director Todd Philips (The Hangover) attempts a fresh portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime by borrowing other movie plots and using his mean-spirited storytelling to give the character of Joker a facelift. I don’t think it’s fair to compare Phoenix’s Joker to Ledger’s, and I felt the same about Ledger’s to Jack Nicholson’s. They are all different renditions, and it’s a waste of time to compare. The same goes for who plays Batman, and so on. Different styles of movies, different styles of Joker. That said, Philips went for a realistic version of Joker, but we already got that in The Dark Knight, and Ledger made a realistic psychopath funny and entertaining by doing what he’s set out to accomplish while hilariously antagonizing people in unique ways. However, Dark Knight’s director Christopher Nolan makes it clear that everything the Joker is doing is awful.  Joker’s Joker is praised for committing murder and Fleck’s dreadful day-to-day is no joy to watch. I’m confident most people don’t want to sit through a movie that will make them miserable and depressed, so what we should be asking is, “What’s the point of this movie?”  Philips’ result is a dangerous, pointless, tiring, and very depressing movie. I’m glad I saw it but I will never recommend it or see it again. That’s a real shame because Joaquin Phoenix — one of the most quintessential actors alive — gives one of his best performances of his career; he disappears and we don’t see Joaquin Phoenix the actor playing Arthur Fleck, we see Arthur Fleck, a schizophrenic who just can’t catch a break and descends into madness. Phoenix’s performance is the only thing good about this movie. The rest is just background noise.  The man who takes up the eponymic title, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix, again, who is phenomenal but wasted) is a down-on-his-luck sap who just wants to make people smile. His gaunt stature makes him an easy target for bullies to pick on and beat the hell out of. Fleck laughs uncontrollably when he feels uncomfortable and hands out a laminated card that reads that he has an unmanageable condition where he has random outbursts of laughter for no reason, like Tourette's Syndrome. (This fascinating mystery is ruined when Fleck eventually reveals the answer.) Fleck wants to do comedy, but he's not good at it, he's delusional, his reality is plagued with fantasies that aren’t real, and he lives with his equally broken mother (Frances Conroy) in a rundown apartment in the seedy underbelly section of Gotham City. Things just keep getting worse for Fleck. He loses his job as a clown-for-hire due to a no-good at his job giving him a gun after Fleck gets beat up one day. Another bad day, while on the subway, his compulsive laugh explodes and three young white guys in suits beat him to the ground. In a panic, he pulls out the gun and kills them. This is where things get worse for Joker, both the movie and the clown.  Joker is an angry, depressing, joyless, plodding, mean-spirited movie that glamorizes violence. Worse? It’s frightening and dangerous, and after seeing Joker, for the first time in my life, I feel a movie could inspire mentally unstable people to commit extreme acts of violence. After killing these three rich white guys, the public, poor and ignored with no help from the rich, describe and salute the unknown killer as a revolutionary because s/he shot rich people to death. The media catches up and writes all about this unknown vigilante. The story is in every newspaper on the front cover and Fleck begins to love this attention. He inadvertently becomes a deranged Robin Hood to the poor, and co-writer-director  Phillips plays that up when Fleck is walking out of his apartment in full Joker attire, with real-life convicted pedophile Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2” blasting overhead. This is a colossal insult to the audience. The film wants us to sympathize with Fleck because of his lifetime of mistreatment and abuse, but this scene encourages the viewer to fist-pump that the once-dull Fleck is now in full-confident Joker mode, smiling as he heads out, ready to murder. Joker is not an anti-hero. He’s not a revolutionary. Joker is a terrorist. In his delusional mind, he wants to relish the fame surrounding the praise of the killing of the three rich goons on the subway, who only deserved to be arrested and jailed. Fleck once felt invisible to the world, but now in his polluted fantasy, he believes that killing is the only way to get anyone’s attention. Joker stands in a long line of movies that exploits and falsely identifies mental illness. Fleck is described as mentally ill when he sees his psychiatrist (who does not listen or care about him) and we see “mental illness” scribbled in his journal. Joker passionately implies mental illness is why he kills and becomes the Joker. This inaccuracy is why people are afraid of individuals who really are mentally ill or why folks are afraid to tell loved ones that they suffer from mental illness out of fear of being ostracized because of the stigma that mentally ill means dangerous. Not all mentally ill are dangerous. Most are scared and want to live a normal life. Phillips is tone-deaf and doesn’t understand the difference. Fleck is not mentally ill; he's mentally unstable — a significant distinction —  and so was his mother. All of Fleck’s life's recent major upsets and constant bullying makes him vulnerable to a variety of mental punishment, so his behavior slowly becomes erratic and alarming. Nobody notices or understands he’s hurting or cares to help him get proper care for his shattered and exhausted mental state. Most of Arthur’s reality is all in his head — it can be fairly argued this is his way of escaping from the slums from the harsh everyday life he’s living, however, we learn that’s not how he was coping. His visions of a better life were real to him and when he realizes they were only in his delusional mind, he eventually snaps and becomes the Joker.  Phillips was the perfect choice to co-write and direct Joker, and that’s not a compliment. All of his comedies are cruel and mean-spirited. He’s since moved away from comedy (because of his false idea that woke culture ruined comedy — there’s plenty of great and beloved comedy that isn’t cruel) and makes a major misstep by playing it safe and using many movie tropes to turn a man who needs proper healthcare into a psychopathic terrorist: society rejection, mental illness, bullying, and loneliness. Elements we all endure at some point in our lives. We’ve seen Joker the character countless times in various mediums of pop culture and there is no originality here. Joker is just a Martin Scorsese-obsessed exploitation of a sick man who is deemed a hero because he kills the wealthy. Joker also has no moral compass and we only see this film through the eyes of the Joker. In other renditions, we see a moral side. It’s explained through storytelling and shows Batman’s or someone else with a moral compass’ point of view that Joker is dangerous, cruel, and thrives on chaos, and needs to be stopped. Philips omitted this on purpose and he fails to see why this is dangerous.  A lot of people are going to love this movie (which is perfectly fine) because Arthur’s abuse and pain are scarily relatable.  It’s OK to love the movie and feel for Arthur — I definitely did. My heart broke for him but I draw a line with sympathizing when he stops caring and carries out his romantic fantasy that he’s finally being noticed by murdering because he feels people will continue to notice and shower him with love nobody else has. My sympathy evaporated when he becomes the Joker. There are movies out there similar to Joker that do a better job with characters suffering delusions of grandeur and are slippery with their emotions. One of the notes I scribbled down says, ""If you have seen both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, then you've already seen Joker.” Joker is derivative and pointless, as well as a complete waste of Phoenix's gift. Remove the clown paint and title, and it's a movie about a fragile man who’s hungry for attention but needs gentle and understanding psychiatric help. That's it — the end. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," Absolutely not for kids. Joker is also not for the superhero movie crowd. This has the look and feel of a gritty, independent film than a massive blockbuster from the DC or Marvel Universe. Joker lacks conviction behind its social and political commentary and seems to simply want to agitate and unnerve its audience. Some will think its edgy, others will see right through it. Sadly, some may find it speaks to them personally. Let’s set aside all the comparisons thrown at Joker, the new origin story for one of Batman’s most menacing foes. We could talk at length about the fact that the film is very similar to Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy or calls to mind Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, both which starred Robert De Niro (who has a supporting role in this film).Instead, let’s just focus on what’s in front of us, as if the film is a wholly original creation. Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover series, Old School), who has gone on record as saying that “woke culture” has ruined comedy nowadays, Joker is a movie which primarily tells us that there are horrors within a bleak societal comedy of how we fail to help or support those struggling to live day-to-day. Naturally, when your main character moves from part-time clown to a full-time murderous supervillain, it becomes easy to feel profound in making those assertions, citing one specific fictionalized example.If only Phillips had the courage to stand behind his positions, perhaps Joker would be a film of substantive meaning and power. Instead, this movie puts a bunch of topics on the table and then kind of just looks around, dances around in front of you, as if that’s all it needs to do to make its case.Without a doubt, Joker is powered by an incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix, who transforms himself into a ticking timebomb of a man - Arthur Fleck. After a stint in a mental health hospital and seven different prescriptions to keep him functional, he takes care of his infirm mother (Frances Conroy) and works part-time as a clown-for-hire. He spins signs, performs at children’s hospitals, both of which turn out terribly for him as we will witness.An attack on Arthur results in a fellow clown giving him a gun and a handful of bullets for protection. Like pouring gasoline on a fire, Arthur has a new tool in his coping toolbox. He’s intimidated by its presence at first, until it saves him from another attack on a subway late one night. Once Arthur stands his ground, if you will, the death of three young Wall Street stockbrokers becomes not just a mystery as to who the shooter happens to be, but the action is seen by many as something of a heroic deed in a polarized early-1980’s Gotham City. Eventually, his obsession with a late-night talk show host (De Niro) turns Arthur to stand-up comedy, and, in turn, he befriends a single mother in his apartment complex (Zazie Beetz). With escalating income disparity, and wealthy businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) running for Mayor, his son Bruce (yes, that Bruce Wayne), will soon cross paths with Arthur, as will Wayne’s family. To focus on the Batman lineage is something of a misnomer, as Joker is almost exclusively about Arthur and his rapid unraveling from sanity. Phoenix lost over 50 pounds to transform himself into something resembling a skeletal, dying animal. His ribs and spine are alarmingly visible, his body resembling a bag of bones tenuously held together by a primal will to survive. Arthur suffers from an unnamed neurological condition, causing him to laugh when feeling anxious or upset. The manner with which Phoenix digs from within to make these laughs guttural, unsettling, and raw, only heightens the film’s desperation to be unnerving and feel as dangerous as frayed wires throwing a spark.

Shot like a gritty, independent film, cinematographer Lawrence Sher works within shades of darkness, making blasts of color profound and meaningful. The Emmy-winning composer Hildur Guðnadóttir creates an imposing, perilous landscape of music, increasing in its metallic grinds and jarring symphonic transitions. From a technical standpoint, it is hard to argue that Joker does not deliver effectively.However, then we deal with a script which, again, says a lot without really saying anything at all.If Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver’s intent was to make a political commentary on how society marginalizes, shuns, and discards the mentally ill, I am listening. If Joker is focused on using a supervillain origin story to point out the empty rhetoric many politicians use to try and curry votes, when nothing really ever changes for the disadvantaged in our country, this is absolutely worth exploring.And yet, again and again - as bad things continue to happen to Arthur and his world unspools before him - we are given nothing of substance and merely one-note circumstances. Phillips’ film is so simple in its observations, that it creates the biggest mistake it could ever make: The only success it achieves is by being the loudest, most overbearing person in the room.What happens to Arthur sends him on a path of nihilism and unrepentant criminal activity. Not every individual suffering the same circumstances he encounters finds that same escape. To throw a number of tangible, real-life arguments at a character who takes drastic and improbable steps to solve his situation is not only dishonorable, but borders on the offensive.And at no time in Joker does Arthur have a reason for the things he’s doing. His actions are not, with one main exception on the subway, a direct cause-and-effect from one thing to the next. And again, if we are claiming that Arthur’s madness is a product of bad people doing bad things to him for essentially a lifetime, well Phillips can’t go to the media and claim “woke culture” is ruining pop culture and entertainment, then also claim we are not “woke” enough to pay attention to society’s failures to be considerate to those in need.Are we leaving people behind because we are too politically correct and worried about offending people’s sensibilities? Or, are we blind to what’s happening around us?Joker has no actual opinion, rendering the ultimate experience of sitting through this movie meaningless.

If Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver’s intent was to make a political commentary on how society marginalizes, shuns, and discards the mentally ill, I am listening. If Joker is focused on using a supervillain origin story to point out the empty rhetoric many politicians use to try and curry votes, when nothing really ever changes for the disadvantaged in our country, this is absolutely worth exploring. And yet, again and again - as bad things continue to happen to Arthur and his world unspools before him - we are given nothing of substance and merely one-note circumstances. Phillips’ film is so simple in its observations, that it creates the biggest mistake it could ever make: The only success it achieves is by being the loudest, most overbearing person in the room. What happens to Arthur sends him on a path of nihilism and unrepentant criminal activity. Not every individual suffering the same circumstances he encounters finds that same escape. To throw a number of tangible, real-life arguments at a character who takes drastic and improbable steps to solve his situation is not only dishonorable, but borders on the offensive. And at no time in Joker does Arthur have a reason for the things he’s doing. His actions are not, with one main exception on the subway, a direct cause-and-effect from one thing to the next. And again, if we are claiming that Arthur’s madness is a product of bad people doing bad things to him for essentially a lifetime, well Phillips can’t go to the media and claim “woke culture” is ruining pop culture and entertainment, then also claim we are not “woke” enough to pay attention to society’s failures to be considerate to those in need. Are we leaving people behind because we are too politically correct and worried about offending people’s sensibilities? Or, are we blind to what’s happening around us?

"Oct 7, 2019"," “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” the soon-to-be supervillain asks his counsellor in this magnificently gritty, socially conscious skew on the comic-book origin tale. It turns Batman’s arch-nemesis into an incel-like loner, languishing on the sidelines of life. Infused with the grimy splendour of a Martin Scorsese picture, it’s a film that substantially simmers, with outbursts of shocking, impactful violence. With the laser-focus of a character piece and boasting an original story, Joker is a pretty radical departure for both the genre and for director Todd Phillips, best known for men-gone-wild comedies like The Hangover and Due Date. Intended to launch a series of standalone comic-book films, it’s set in Gotham City, 1981, and stars Joaquin Phoenix as protagonist Arthur Fleck. First seen grotesquely pulling faces as he lacquers himself in clown war paint for an inauspicious street gig, this hard-up, mentally ill loner is prone to spasms of hollow, high-pitched laughter that he tells people are the result of a neurological condition. With his life an endless succession of public humiliations and nights in with elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy), Arthur fantasises about stand-up success and romance with neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz), and develops a fixation on cheesy talk-show host Murray Franklin (an enjoyably over-made-up Robert De Niro). Meanwhile, his mother writes begging letters to her wealthy former employer Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) hoping he will take pity on them. The product of a cruel, cruel world, Arthur is part Travis Bickle, part Rupert Pupkin but strange, unpredictable and multi-faceted enough to also evoke both Charlie Chaplin (seen here in Modern Times) and Fred Astaire in his occasionally graceful physicality. There have been several iconic takes on the Joker (who first appeared in comic book form in 1940 in Batman #1) – from Cesar Romero’s camp goofball to a smirking, quipping Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning agitator – yet it feels like only Phoenix could have brought this particular manifestation so vividly to life. Drawing on the psychotic intensity he displayed in Lynne Ramsay’s masterful You Were Never Really Here, Arthur’s anxieties seem to course through the actor, infesting every inch of his body as he contorts his emaciated frame like a man possessed. It’s a chilling, wholly compelling turn, worthy of structuring an entire film around, which Phillips does skilfully, though supporting talent like Shea Whigham, Bill Camp and Brian Tyree Henry are little more than a classy wallpaper. Although the character is as nihilistic as ever, the film has enough political fervour in its swipes at healthcare cuts and widespread poverty to feel like it stands for something. Arthur’s psychological problems pile up like the bin bags on the street, while his sense of entitlement – to women, success, his place in the spotlight – fuels his rage. Following a credible trajectory, there’s an overarching sympathy for Arthur’s predicament but, as his capacity for violence is unleashed and his confidence grows, he begins to loom terrifyingly large and the familiar pieces begin to shift into place. Rather than leaven the tension with smatterings of his traditional bad-taste humour, Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver make us stew in the discomfort; it’s two hours in the close company of a truly disconcerting individual, placed smack-bang in the middle of a combustible context, as resentment toward the rich threatens to erupt into riots. For all their real-world references, superhero movies tend to function as escapism, a way to examine our failings from a comfortable remove. Joker, on the other hand, feels like a damning indictment of societal ills, a study in how real monsters are made; it’s a film that’s desperately, maybe even depressingly relevant.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," In the canon of onscreen violence wrought by chillingly malevolent men, two scenes loom large: Malcolm McDowell’s macabre rendition of “Singing in the Rain” in A Clockwork Orange, and Christian Bale’s axe-swinging jive to Huey Lewis and the News in American Psycho. Both graft hallmarks of innocuous spectacle onto violent assault, and as their critics aver, obscure patent immorality with the seductive tempo of fun. Of all the images that stuck after the first trailer drop for Todd Phillips’s Joker, one was strikingly familiar: Joaquin Phoenix as proto-villain Arthur Fleck, grooving to a guitar solo in a turquoise shirt, yellow vest, and a rust red suit in lieu of the usual purple, his vertiginous stage a cascading staircase on an empty city street. Joker is filled with these balletic bursts: after his first, pivotal kill, Fleck preens mesmerically in the flickering fluorescence of a grimy bathroom, framed by cinematographer Lawrence Sher in lambent greens and reds; before a big night out, he dances in his underwear while dyeing his hair that toxic, seminal green, like a teen girl mid-makeover sequence. His solo choreography might loosely bookend violence, but never actually coincides with it—a fact which has yet to deter some of the moral hand-wringing. But the derivative patina of a Sinatra-backed slo-mo reveals one of the film’s main failings: in aping the ambition and prestige of its motley influences, it winds up with a bungled understanding of its own relation to violence. The missteps begin at inception. Where prior incarnations of the Joker have confined his characterization as  Batman’s foil, Phillips’s is the first film adaptation to detail, in protracted, psychorealist devotion, the Joker’s backstory, mostly absent Bruce Wayne. In a ’70s New York–inflected Gotham of neon-flecked grime, this Joker is reanimated as Fleck, a middle-aged white man who lives with his mother and works sporadic rent-a-clown gigs. He suffers from a neurological condition that prompts convulsive bouts of laughter, caused by a brain injury from childhood abuse. Every week, he sees a state-funded psychiatrist in her cramped office, amassing RX bottles and Travis Bickle–haunted diary entries that double as joke rehearsals. He is subjected to constant violence: beat up by a group of listless brown kids in an alleyway, then a trio of drunk white yuppies on the subway; sucker-punched by a rich white man in a gilded bathroom. In Heath Ledger’s Joker of apocryphal motive and origin, there is an echo of Alan Moore’s canonical Joker monologue from The Killing Joke, largely taken to be the character’s apotheosis: “All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy,” goes the climactic axiom, “That’s how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.” That catalyst for apocalypse is singular, but Phoenix’s Fleck has only ever had bad days, the dark accrual of trauma after trauma in a life now teeming with it. Some of Fleck’s characterization is initially compelling, but eventually struggles under its comic-franchise aegis. In the confines of a generic origin story, the tense is always future anterior: by the time of whatever plot machination, the character will have become X, will have done Y. Even the modulations that emerge in every new version of the character have a teleological drag. There is, however, the specific physicality of each new actor’s performance, and here, the way Phoenix’s body is used as a dichotomous site of revulsion and easy spectacle. The concern that Fleck’s pathologization would invite too much sympathy is, from the first shot, countervailed by the framing of Phoenix’s body as grotesque, often arced in shapes that seem to defy the very build of his skeleton, back and shoulders pocked by shadows that mark strange concavities.  A palpable air of pure exertion pervades everything from Phoenix’s well-publicized weight-plummet to his near-asphyxiating contrivances of laughter: the body collapsed into its emaciated self, straining against its bare physiology. It’s a whole performance that stakes itself on corporeal self-defiance, a spectacle that repels as it enthralls. Unlike the abstract desires of previous Jokers, circumscribed by their role as nemesis or diffused by their anarcho-nihilism, Fleck, at least initially, wants some reasonable things: not to be ostracized for his mental illness; not to be senselessly pummeled by strangers; to access his medication; not to work a shitty job for a pittance; not to live in a dysfunctional building with his mother, whose own delusions have disfigured his entire sense of self. Maybe the only desire beyond the minimal exigencies of dignified survival is Fleck’s crush on his beautiful neighbor (Zazie Beetz), a fantasy subplot so minor and anodyne it could be excised entirely (he wants kindness, affection—that, we already know). In Phillips’s construction, Fleck is less interesting as a character than a cipher for social malaise; the structural causes of his personal ills are glossed but never probed. Trash-strewn and super-rat infested, the image of Gotham’s collapsing infrastructure is an anachronistic bricolage of the urban crises that beset New York across the late ’60s and ’80s: the 1968 garbage collector strike; the clampdowns on postwar social welfare systems across the ’70s; the racist subway vigilante of ’84. Halfway through Joker, Fleck’s shrink tells him that the city has cut her funding, and leaves his medication to fate.  Newspaper headlines lambast the wealthy: “GROUNDSWELL OF ANTI-RICH SENTIMENT”; “KILL THE RICH.” On the night of his final gig as a rental clown, Fleck makes citywide headlines for a violent altercation on the subway, but only as an anonymous, clown-faced vigilante, an image soon co-opted by Gotham’s denizens for sundry causes. Fleck spends most of the film impervious to the revolutionary rhetoric ascribed to him—the legend of the clown circulates with a life of its own, and even when it returns to him, he dissociates from its symbolic import entirely. After Fleck is invited on air by talk-show host, Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro (in an oblique throwback to his turn as wannabe star comic in Scorsese’s The King of Comedy), he’s asked if the clown makeup donned for the night is an expression of political dissent, but Fleck demurs: “I don’t believe in that. I don’t believe in anything.” Even after he divulges his identity as the clown-faced vigilante, he stresses to an increasingly incensed studio audience that he is not political, and the subsequent boos suggest they’d be more forgiving if he actually was. At a protest outside a billionaire’s soirée, someone brandishes the sign “WE ARE ALL CLOWNS”, which briefly rings parodic but speaks to the easy recuperation of popular iconography for ideologically disparate ends. Joker doesn’t understand its representation of violence because it doesn’t know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy à la V for Vendetta, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets. Somewhere, in the back of a police car, a post-Fleck Joker admires the burning vista of his gonzo orchestrations. It’s a dehistoricized rendering of protest that flattens the varied and complex history of public demonstration into photogenic rioting (though you’d be remiss to expect more from this film), and in so doing reiterates a useful point: anyone can single out an image or an object, charge it with a volt of personal animus, and resuscitate it as something else. Appropriation can be a consolatory response to structural frustrations, though there remains an obvious, mutual causality: that a mass shooter might appropriate this particular Joker for their own racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, ethno-nationalist aims indicts a world that has set the stage for their vitriol, as much as it does any individual film’s “responsible” representation. The problem here might be better framed as one of media literacy. At The New York Times, Dan Brooks identifies a reductive misreading attributed, ironically, to a certain critical class. “Ostensibly too sophisticated for superhero stories, our critics have accepted the Joker’s power to corrupt the masses in real life, on a more literal level than the most addled comic-book fan ever would.” The moral concern for those susceptible masses who are bad at reading is so pervasive as to be moot: everyone is prone to decontextualizing, and co-opting cultural objects, just as Joker does, self-seriously gleaning those weightier themes from early Scorsese with only a vague sense of how to repurpose them. Towards the end, Phillips even indulges a moment of self-congratulating medium-reflexivity, with a shot of a dozen security screens, each displaying footage of prior violence, in yet another echo of shots that already happened in the ’70s. Maybe the film would’ve felt surer had it found another shape for all its references (something more playful?), one that wasn’t also cramped by the übermensch fantasies of the franchise enclosing it.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 7, 2019"," The Alamo Drafthouse has a tradition of showing a funny clip before screenings to remind the audience of its no phones or talking policy. Sometimes it’s a scripted bit featuring the actors in the movie, like Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson before Captain Marvel. Sometimes it’s a homemade clip that’s better than the movie itself, like the stop motion animation of Godzilla toys before Godzilla: King of Monsters. For Joker, the “gritty” new take on the infamous Batman villain, it’s one of the theater’s favorites: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Dr. Fries/Mr. Freeze from 1997’s Batman & Robin icing a henchman who interrupts his wedding video viewing. Though Joel Schumacher’s film is supposed to look silly in comparison to director Todd Phillips’ interpretation of Gotham City, of the two, it’s actually the film with both more coherent storytelling and artistic integrity. Co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a party clown with aspirations of becoming a stand-up comedian, who turns supervillain because of the way he’s beaten down by an unjust world. Everyone is mean to Arthur from the woman on the bus who scolds him for making her child laugh, to his own mother, who responds to his career aspirations by suggesting he’d have to be funny to be a comedian. Phillips and Silver’s Gotham is a crappy town not just because of a garbage strike and an infestation of “super rats,” but because — as the film literally tells us repeatedly — the people of Gotham are angry. Mostly, the film blames that on the income inequality embodied here by Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a rich businessman who’s got his eye on the Mayor’s office. The problem with that “eat the rich” reasoning, though, is that the film never actually justifies Gotham’s anger on either a macro or micro level. Instead, Phillips relies too much on the viewer’s own experience of real-world Occupy Wall Street sentiments and the grimy New York City milieu he copies from Scorsese films about similarly disaffected men like Taxi Driver or, more importantly, King of Comedy. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with using those films as visual and ideological shorthand, it also exposes Joker’s weaknesses. The film is allegedly set during the ’80s like King, but the production design suggests the previous decade and not giving the viewer a clearer sense of time and place makes it even more difficult to draw parallels between the film’s universe and ours. Still, even that incoherence could be dismissed if it didn’t carry into the character work as well. Thanks to neurological damage Arthur sustained before we met him, he has a condition where he laughs uncontrollably at inappropriate times. It’s a distinct tick and one that not only makes up the meat of Phoenix’s performance, but also not bad enough to really justify how horribly people treat Arthur. Instead, the reason he has to be repeatedly beat down is in order to justify his eventual acts of violence and the script feels as if it knows it has to get to that point but doesn’t do the work to get there. And yet by the time Arthur shoots three finance bros who bully him on the train, Arthur has been portrayed as so harmless that the decision seems to come out of nowhere. Rather, for a film that’s so determined to ignore its comic book pedigree, it’s when it goes baroque in its final act and stops trying to ground Arthur’s arc in causality or even reality that it finally begins to work. Watching Phoenix in full clown make-up cause a riot on a crowded subway full of Gothamites already inspired by his earlier violence or spar verbally with Robert DeNiro as talk show host/comedian, Murray Franklin, it’s difficult to deny what a great Joker he could have been in a better film. And while that anarchic, disturbed incel triumphant ending is precisely what’s made the film so controversial in the first place, the work done to get to that point is so shoddy that it’s hard to imagine it making much impact at all. For all the handwringing over Joker’s release to call it dangerous simply imbues it with more coherence and power than it actually has. The last act is undeniably effective, but the reason it works is because it leaves behind all the self-aggrandizing realism of the central conceit and becomes the outlandish comic book material Phillips and Silver have tried so hard to reject. Maybe a few misanthropic boys with an unjustified victim complex and a penchant for violence will see a rallying cry in this story, but it doesn’t make them look like products of a broken society, it just makes them look pathetic. Maybe you’re just too fancypants to “get” the movie, Marisa. It’s bigger than “people are mean to Arthur” and “he has a neurological disorder”. The mental health system lets him down. He wants his medication but funding is cut. He tries to be a good person, time and time again. If you got the crap kicked out of you and were unstable to begin with, and you learn he is abandoned and lied to be EVERYONE HE KNOWS (with the exception of Gary, who was always nice to him), you may snap, too. You obviously didn’t want to like the movie so, you didn’t.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," Prepare to be devastated by Joker. Not so much by the intense madness and blood-spewing violence that is sometimes hard to watch, or the overwhelming central performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, but by the vision and artistry of the film itself. Even if you hate it, it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen before—like waking up next to a poisonous snake nestled on your blanket, poised and ready to strike. You’re horrified but unable to move. Regardless of my mixed feelings, I think it’s the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. Vigorously directed by Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the unique if uneven screenplay with Scott Silver, and beautifully shot by Lawrence Sher, Joker traces the history of the popular DC Comics villain and Batman’s arch enemy in totally original terms. After award-winning performances by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the role, you may think you know the Joker, but who is he and where did he come from? JOKER ★★★1/2
(3.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Todd Phillips
Written by: Todd Phillips, Scott Silver
Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Frances Conroy
Running time: 121 mins. In this film, his roots are clearly and hair-raisingly defined. Born Arthur Fleck, he’s a mentally deranged social reject with a history of insanity, which he shares with the weird mother he lives with who tried to burn him alive as a child (another unsettling, creepy triumph by Frances Conroy). In the past, both mother and son have spent time in the same mental asylum. Now they share one common bond: a passion for watching Murray Franklin, a nightly TV talk-show host played by Robert De Niro. A brain injury has left Arthur with a rare medical condition that produces uncontrollable shrieks of laughter in the most tragic moments of life. Unable to hold down a job, Arthur ekes out a living as a grotesque clown, entertaining tourists and kids until he gets fired for carrying his loaded gun into a children’s hospital. After that emotional setback, he is, needless to say, never the same. Director Phillips wastes no time getting straight to the chase. In fact, the movie opens with a dire premonition of things to come when Arthur is smashed in the face with a wooden sign and nearly kicked to death by a gang of hoodlums. It gets worse from there. When he isn’t killing businessmen on the subway or struggling to be a standup comic in empty clubs, Arthur becomes a vigilante, joining the underground forces in corrupted, criminal-infested Gotham City. One of his victims is the wealthy politician running for mayor, Thomas Wayne, who Arthur’s delusional mother believes is the father who abandoned them both, prompting the Joker to stalk Wayne’s son Bruce, who grows up to be Batman. Many homicidal acts of revenge ensue, including, at last, one that will knock you out of your socks when the infamous Joker finally gets his big chance as a guest star on a “live” network broadcast of his hero Murray Franklin’s talk show. At the risk of revealing too much, I will say no more. This is one movie you have to experience for yourself.  It’s comic-book fantasy is so feverishly close to today’s deranged tabloid news that I began to wonder if the Joker might be somewhere in the theater planning his next move. Every time you think no creature so vile could ever exist in real life, along comes another headline. I can’t tell you how it ends, but what I can tell you is Frank Sinatra singing “Send In The Clowns” adds some badly needed humor, the cinematography is so incredible that the camera becomes an important character in the middle of all the action, and the schizophrenic performance by Phoenix blazes like a bonfire. Joker is most definitely not a movie for everybody, but in the greatest performance of his career, Phoenix is electrifying. Weeping, shrieking, dragged screaming through police stations and mental asylums, then pausing after each evil slaughter to dance balletic tour jetés, he’s a cross between Jacques D’Amboise’s Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake and James Cagney’s Cody Jarrett in White Heat. As a sick, twisted failure in life who takes his torment out on the rest of the world, he reveals the soul of a monster in Hell, in a movie that borders on genius—repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.

"Oct 7, 2019"," Pese a los esfuerzos de algunos sectores que gustan de impulsar una mejor lectura del cine y de discriminar las distintas significaciones de las imágenes en movimiento, lo que se impone hoy –triste realidad– es la percepción comercial del cine como espectáculo. Así, el afán de convertirlo todo en mercancía es lo que predomina por ahí ante una película de calidad al menos dialéctica o polémica y de la cual no podemos ignorar sus aciertos. Sí, hablo de Guasón (2019), filme dirigido con sapiencia por Todd Phillips, de quien recuerdo con admiración su inteligente sátira con el título de Amigos de armas (2016). El barullo alrededor de Guasón es el que, de manera inoportuna, se manifiesta igual con las películas de superhéroes (más en serie que en serio). Sin embargo, al separar la paja del trigo, uno va descubriendo virtudes fílmicas que –sin duda– se gestan desde el guion del propio Phillips, junto con Scott Silver. No estamos ante una película que uno pueda catalogar de original, lo cual no es cuestionamiento alguno, porque sus méritos están en el excelente tratamiento de su historia. En lo personal, Guasón me recordó dos excelentes filmes como lo son Taxi Driver (1976) y Hardcore (1979). Lo cierto es que estamos ante un personaje que es la voz particular de lo general, de una sociedad enfermiza, inescrupulosa, individualista, consumista y dominada por políticos de oficio. La nuestra es una sociedad hiriente con aquellos que más necesitan de la solidaridad. Por eso, se vale la pregunta del neuropsiquiatra francés Boris Cyrulnik: “¿Cómo amar cuando uno está herido?”; este es tema unificador de la trama del filme (su foco). Al Guasón es posible verle la herida abierta que los medicamentos no sanan emocionalmente. El mandato de su madre es el de hacer felices a los otros, pero en lo profundo de la emocionalidad del Guasón hay un drama interno. El personaje se halla marcado por el signo de la crueldad de que es objeto. La suya es una historia de pobreza, rechazo y abuso; cuando él vive una situación de felicidad, esta se le manifiesta tan solo en el mundo de la imaginación, en el ámbito de su locura (concepto narrativo de la película muy bien manejado). Las carcajadas patológicas del Guasón pueden interpretarse como un oxímoron neuronal, que ocurre cuando en situaciones adversas alguna gente expresa risa. Ese rasgo se asemeja a la violencia estructural por la que se sienten explotados los ciudadanos de Ciudad Gótica (símil de Nueva York) y que se revierte en violencia de turbas disfrazadas de payasos. Aunque en un callejón se alude a la figura de quien será Batman, lo cierto es que Guasón tiene una narrativa con sentido completo en sí misma: no hay necesidad de establecer ningún tipo de referencialidad externa. El lenguaje fílmico que uno puede desglosar (actuaciones, montaje, banda sonora, fotografía, montaje, dirección de arte, etc.) tiene un logro unívoco: darle al filme el código de una épica clásica y evitar la banalidad de un cómic sin significado alguno.

"Oct 7, 2019"," 
It's barely been released and yet the talk around Joker (dir. Todd Phillips, R16) is already exhausting. The dubious winner of the prestigious Golden Lion Award
at the Venice Film Festival, this expansion and exploration of the backstory of Batman's greatest nemesis has arrived amid a flurry of bad press. With fears (not entirely unfounded) that Joker may serve as some sort of Incel (involuntary celibate) anthem for men and boys who find themselves aligning with the outlook of this particular iteration of the character, the off-screen saga peaked this week with director Todd Phillips (The Hangover, Old School) claiming that ""the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda"" and decrying ""wokeness"" in general.
 It's the latest tiresome development for a film that ultimately ought not to generate this much feeling, positive or negative. Aside from some engaging moments - a rich cinematographic palette and a committed performance from Joaquin Phoenix - Joker is a largely uninspired riff on the clown prince of crime; an ideologically empty, inconsistent and bleakly reductive story of a man pushed to the limits of sanity in his genesis as the iconic villain. Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who lives with his mother in a squalid 1970s apartment in Gotham, working as a clown-for-hire between intermittent, uncontrollable fits of laughter caused by a brain injury. Appearing scraggly and emaciated, Phoenix commits 100 per cent to Fleck's downward spiral as things go from bad to worse for the put-upon performer but somehow the character never quite manages to click into place satisfyingly. So intently focused as he is on crafting an edgy and grown-up vision of the Batman world, Phillips sacrifices consistent character development, good scripting and editing. Fleck is, according to the requirements of each scene, either a helpless, innocent man-child led to mimic the cruelty of the world around him or a cold, calculating monster devoid of beliefs. It is a portrait of mental illness and poverty very clearly borne from the mind of someone who has never truly experienced or struggled with those very demons and yet uses them as tools for his lazy, unearned cynicism and nihilism. The laundry list of plot devices Phillips uses in his film without understanding the context of what he's suggesting by deploying them is staggering - not only mental illness but suicide ideation, physical and sexual abuse, the Resistance movement, the plight of women of colour and even dwarfism become unnecessarily nasty punchlines or philosophically empty attempts to be relevant to the state of the modern world. Joker very clearly bears the influence of Scorsese classics like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, among others but possesses none of the self-awareness or irony that made those films so powerful. While Joker is a film with ambition and occasional flashes of brilliance and it is undoubtedly refreshing to see a lengthy character study with only tangential moments of action gobble up the zeitgeist in the way this film has, it's also easy to begrudge a film that claims such classics as inspiration when those very films couldn't be made today without being lazily grafted on to a pre-existing piece of intellectual property like this one. Ain't it funny? Rating: Two stars.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 7, 2019"," Amidst an equal wave of praise and controversy, Todd Phillips' Joker arrived with heightened expectations. The winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival 2019, the movie came with a prestigious title around its waist but also carried a dark burden on its shoulders – the looming threat of gun violence from certain factions who could be inspired by the movie’s events. With the critics and the FBI in tow, the real question is – was Joker really the masterpiece that the world would seemingly have you believe? It’s not the masterpiece, but it’s still very, very good. Phillips delivers an origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime that’s bereft of any vats of skin/hair bleaching acid (thank god) and instead presents Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck as a failed comedian and a man riddled with mental and neurological issues living in a Gotham City that’s teeming with crime, poverty and little time for those beneath the bread line – a world that consumes Arthur into eventually taking on the famous, titular mantle. In terms of comic book movies, it’s the least ‘comic book movie’ feeling effort I think I’ve seen – this is more a hard-hitting, psychological thriller that deals with supposed real-life issues and spares no punches or softens any blows than the colourful, CGI-stuffed affairs of the past decade. The tone is dark and disturbing and visually, the movie is no different – there’s a grimy filter that assaults every scene and the dark shadows permeate the narrative wonderfully. The early-1980s setting goes some way to aiding the overall atmosphere of Joker, but it’s Phoenix’s hurricane performance that steals the show. Phillips runs the risk of portraying Fleck as the victim here and presenting us with a sympathetic anti-hero, and despite assurances to the contrary, it’s hard to agree with Phillips’ assessment – Fleck is made out to be a victim of a society that didn’t listen or take him seriously. This may have been the idea in terms of getting the character from A to B, but in terms of the character's actions, Joker is never someone we should be rooting for. As for Phoenix, he is equal parts menacing, vulnerable, evil and scheming, it’s a juggernaut showing from a magnificent performer. It would be pointless to compare Phoenix to Ledger, Nicholson etc as this is a vastly different representation. He is, however, far better than Jared Leto’s – this Joker didn’t require the word ‘damaged’ to be tattooed on his forehead. De Niro is just fine as the face of Gotham’s media, talk show host Murray Franklin, whereas Zazie Beetz doesn’t really have an awful lot to do, sadly. As a story, Joker is light – it borrows heavily from Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both Scorsese movies (Scorsese was originally attached to produce this movie) but lacking the overall style of both – and the attempt at real-world social commentary is half-baked. Phillips attempts to tackle mental illness, poverty, class systems and the role of the media and society in ‘creating’ the murderers and bad people in the world, however, there’s no real depth to these or a solid idea of where to run with each of them. They’re very much dealt with on the surface level. It’s Scorsese-lite. That’s not to say that none of these work because they do (just not as heavily as Phillips intended), there’s a real unnerving atmosphere that hangs over the movie, one that builds as hauntingly as Hildur Guðnadóttir's majestically creepy score does, and there are moments that will stop you in your tracks – especially as Fleck spirals into his alter-ego. What effects the movie, however, is the need to tie in the Wayne family – this just felt shoehorned in and took away from some of the Joker’s story, instead becoming a pseudo-Batman origin story too…and, of course, we really don’t need to see that done again. Some of the writing in the movie's big finale was weak but the crescendo was marvelously chaotic. Given the praise and controversy the movie received, Joker stands up to most of this and emerges to be a very good movie. Though it aims for Scorsese and falls short, it’s still a heavy portrayal of a man’s decline into madness and murder, all set to dirtily good cinematography and a cello-led nightmare score. It’s hard-hitting, affecting and, in places, magnificent. Whilst the movie lacks depth somewhat, it’s undeniably haunting and unnerving – Phoenix is monstrously good in the titular role. It’s no laughing matter.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019"," After its big surprise win in Venice, a big splash (and some backlash) in Toronto, a storm (in a teacup) of opinion on social media, self-generating fear of cinema violence and even incel insurrection, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by The Hangover’s Todd Phillips, arrives on our screens to a resounding, “hm.” It’s a fine enough film, extremely well crafted, but, in direct opposition to its buzz, there is no discernible need to see it. Indeed, if you’ve seen Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy both, there is truly nothing for you, as Joker, aping those films and setting itself in 1980 squat between them, doesn’t even update their concerns for our own troubled age. Cinematography, art direction and Phoenix’s performance are the draws here; the story is so derivative, drawn out, empty and vapid that the film’s biggest fault is that it drags. Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy had wit and style; Joker has no wit and all its style is stolen. Its tale of a poor down-trodden wannabe urban comedian who descends into violence has been often told, with minor variations, and resonance to real-life events, most specifically to “subway vigilante” Bernhard Goetz, does not come with any insight. Ugliness is on display here purely for its own sake. The best takeaway from this film is as a set-up for an upcoming Batman (like we need another). The final scenes are suitably baroque, befitting the Joker’s origin story as operatically linked to Bruce Wayne’s; try as Phillips, his marketing team, and everyone else at Warner Bros. may have to deny it, this is just another comic book movie, in a darker than usual key. So Rotten Tomatoes has this as a “fresh” review. Do you agree with that? Personally, I find it leaning more towards the negative. Please let me know. Thanks! Yep, fresh is correct. I do think that the film is worth seeing, and that some people will love it (and clearly they have). It’s a major 2019 film, contributing to the cultural conversation, getting awards, featuring an incredible performance and so on. The key is in the first paragraph: “it’s a fine enough film.” If it’s “fine enough,” that’s ‘fresh’; if, say, I’d written, “this is not a good film”, that’s ‘rotten’. Fine enough implies worth seeing (therefore ‘fresh’), a ‘rotten’ review is stating that the reviewer feels there’s no reason to see the film.

"Oct 7, 2019"," Joker is a brave and daring film. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker creates a fully realized unique character. The screenplay by director Todd Phillips and Scott Silver gives the arch villain of DC’s comic books a riveting, highly complex psychological profile. His childhood is not presented as an excuse or a sympathy grab. It’s message is stronger than that. The structure is clever and surprising, but it is Phoenix’s complete transformation that mesmerizes. Sometimes, but not with stars of Phoenix’s magnitude, a strong director (and editor) can craft an actor’s performance. In Joker, we see Phoenix in total command of expressing the inner life of Arthur. His movements could not have been choreographed, it is his unwavering instinct driving his portrayal. There are scenes of Arthur bringing to life the complex essence of his inner self. He’s alone and moving his body – the movements are not feminized but primal, like a pansexual Hindu deity. It is as if the liquidity of his body was finally freed to express itself. You will see it and understand how deeply Phoenix inhabits this character. This is not the kind of performance that is constructed in a screenplay. The camera is always on Phoenix’s face. Phillips doesn’t give Phoenix many props to distract you from seeing and feeling the subtle range of emotions crossing over his face. It’s not words or scenes with others that informs us about Arthur. It’s the way Phoenix uses his body to explain himself. The story is brilliant. It takes what you know about the Batman hagiography and twists it. The hallowed image of the Bruce family is corrupted – who okayed this at DC Comics?  The comical portrayal of the Joker, the buffoon madman with the exaggerated smile, is not here. Joker’s life is crafted out of squalor. Arthur has an empty life, a faceless presence, and severe mental and emotional problems. Following  real-life – unlike the fantasy world of Tony Stark – the path from nobody Arthur to Joker is built on society’s cruelty. What makes a super villain of comic books? Usually it is a man with boundless money and an overwhelming need to satisfy a megalomaniacal ego. I have never heard of a villain who is dirt-poor, living on government assistance and with quirky facial expressions, becoming a driving force of social injustice who disrupts society and causes a movement that requires a superhero’s intervention. No comic book villain ever explains himself thusly: “I had a wonderful childhood. I just like killing people. It’s a calling.” The life experiences that creates a villain is never explained. Never before has a villain been given a story that encompasses the tragedy that formed his character. Gotham City is a decaying city, one step away from the current situation plaguing San Francisco – human feces on the sidewalks has made the rich city one big open toilet. Nothing can stop it. There is no law against it and no one seems to be caught in the act. There does not seem to be an adjacent toilet paper problem. Gotham, like New York City, is home to the fabulously wealthy and the unwashed masses. Arthur lives with his sick mother Penny (Frances Conroy). He works as a clown and cares for Penny, who needs feeding and bathing. Their one pleasure is watching a late night talk show, Live With Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Like so many people dreaming of starring on a reality show or being a guest on the 3rd hour of the Today Show, Arthur rehearses the banter he will have with Murray. Then, during a show Arthur attends, Murray plucks him from the audience and Arthur has a real-to-him moment with Murray. Arthur, who has always been told by his mother “to smile” begins to prepare a career as a stand-up comedian. Perhaps the medicines are to blame for Arthur’s compulsive laughing and distorted bodily movements, so when he does approach an audience at open-mic night at a comedy club, he can only deliver his awkward contortions and dissociative laughter. Arthur’s performance at the comedy club is played several times on Live With Murray Franklin. Murray’s mocking of Arthur is the match that lights the fire birthing Joker. The Batman oeuvre has never explored the causes that fuels the rise of an anti-social villain. What has eaten all the joy out of  Gotham City? Dark, ugly, wet, graffiti-ravaged Gotham has cut its social services and Arthur is left without his mood-altering medicine. He’s beaten by thugs while working as a clown holding an “Everything Must Go” sign. His co-workers think he’s a freak, except Gary (Leigh Gill). I do not know what the Academy’s criteria is for the Best Supporting Actor category, but the one scene Gill has with Phoenix, he’s terrific. It’s about not acting – Gill is living this scene. Arthur and Penny have a unique connection to the Bruce family (and a troubling intimacy, to boot). Penny had been a housekeeper at Wayne Manor and writes to Thomas Wayne every day pleading for help. When Arthur finally opens a letter, it’s contents brings him to Wayne Manor where he meets young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) and perhaps Alfred (Douglas Hodge). Arthur wants to confront Thomas Bruce with details in his mother’s
letter. If you think Joker is set up for us to pity Arthur, screenwriters Phillips and Silver, director Phillips and Phoenix smash our sympathy for Arthur as his rage conquers his insecurities. And he does it with such nonchalance. Joker is not Best Picture material – it’s too radical a departure, even though there are some sick kids in it. But it has my votes for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor. Member of Las Vegas Film Critics Society: www.lvfcs.org/.

"Oct 7, 2019"," Ever since Joker debuted at the Venice Film Festival, and then made its North American bow at the Toronto International Film Festival a few days later, arguments about Joker have escalated. There's one faction consisting of those who believe Joker is a great movie and the new definitive depiction of the famous villain. There are others arguing that the film's very existence is irresponsible, due to the its shocking violence and its potential to set off real-life bloodshed from the ""incels"" of the world, who’ll undoubtedly see Joker as a validation of their worldview. The U.S. Army put out a warning about the possibility of incel-related shootings at screenings of the film. Arguments about Joker have also slotted into various pre-existing narratives about Marvel vs. DC, ""cancel culture,"" and the wokester/comedy wars, with director Todd Phillips (who directed Old School and The Hangover) telling an interviewer this week that political correctness is the reason he stopped making comedies. Overall, the arguments about Joker have consisted of several weeks of passionate exultations and denunciations of the film—about 99 percent of which came from people who’d not yet seen it. Most of the Joker controversies are overblown. It's almost certainly not going to inspire violence, and the titular character's involuntary celibacy is a relatively minor part of the film. Most of that fear of real-life violence seems to come from those misremembering Aurora shooter James Holmes having dressed as or invoked The Joker (contrary to reports, he never did.) Even the violence in the film, while plentiful, isn't all that shocking by modern-day R-rated movie standards. The biggest takeaway is that Joker isn't nearly as compelling as the weeks of controversy leading up to its release would indicate. It's both completely ridiculous and ill-conceived, sporting an over-the-top and irritating performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Overall, the wildest swing Phillips takes with Joker is that instead of ripping off Goodfellas and Casino like so many other filmmakers, he's instead built an entire film out of plot elements of two other Martin Scorsese films, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Scorsese was even on board as a producer around the time the film was first announced, although he was not ultimately credited. Phillips’ previous film, 2016’s crime saga War Dogs, was straight out of the Goodfellas/Casino template. Phoenix stars in Joker as Arthur Fleck, a troubled man in a Gotham City that bears an uncanny resemblance to the New York City of the late-1970s and early-1980s. Living in a run-down apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy) and diagnosed with unnamed but plentiful mental illnesses, Fleck is employed by a clown-for-hire service, while he dreams of a career as a stand-up comedian despite never showing any indication that he’s funny. His dream is to appear on the talk show of Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro, sliding over into the Jerry Lewis role from The King of Comedy. While most of the plot is assembled from bits and pieces of the two Scorsese movies, Joker's main inciting incident is a confrontation Arthur has on the subway, which resembles the famous Bernhard Goetz shooting of 1984, and much like with Goetz, it turns Arthur/Joker into a folk hero. The difference is Joker somewhat haphazardly retcons the Goetz incident so that instead of black teenagers, the guys he shoots are white Wall Street douchebags. We get a proletariat revolution against the rich, with Joker masks standing in for those of Guy Fawkes. And that, in part, is where Joker lost me. Not only is the movie’s treatment of the “eat the rich” revolution half-hearted, but the character doesn't really do anything to earn being a master criminal and leader of men, and he just sort of stumbles into it. I'm not a comic aficionado and I’d imagine there exists decades of on-the-page Joker lore I'm not aware of that's perfectly in line with what's in the Phillips film. But the most interesting on-screen Jokers of the past—especially Jack Nicholson in Batman '89 and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight—were interesting precisely because they were criminal masterminds. Phoenix's Joker isn't that; he comes across as a garden-variety twitchy serial killer from a Criminal Minds episode, who just happens to be dressed as The Joker. Phoenix is one of the greatest living actors, but this won't go down as the best of his work. It's a performance that's all twitches, and silly dances, and this thing where he repeatedly laughs/cries to himself. It's certainly a lot of acting, but not great acting. He did, apparently, starve himself so much for the role that he's left with a weird upper body physique that barely looks recognizably human. The very talented Zazie Beetz gets very little to do as a neighbor on whom Arthur nurses a crush; the same for Frances Conroy as his mother. The most impressive aspect of the film is its production design, which recreates the New York of circa 1980 but skews it slightly, a la Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. The street names, subway stations and names of restaurants and theaters look like they should be real New York landmarks, but they're just a few degrees off. But that's undercut by a highly intrusive musical score by the Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir. And the film is full of musical needle drops that sound like the exact ones that Scorsese would use, although I did enjoy its deployment of Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll Part 2."" Are we going to have a Walter White problem here, where large numbers of the audience start believing The Joker is actually the hero? I don't think so. This Joker isn't an anti-hero; he's an actual villain, and his villainy is crystal clear. Some viewers of the film may misunderstand it, but probably not to the point of taking up arms on its behalf. It never made much sense that this movie’s Joker was compared to young incels, since we’re given multiple explanations for how he got the way he is, and a lack of getting laid is not among them. Plus, despite the character being called “kid” by De Niro, Joaquin Phoenix is 44 years old. Even if Joker isn't actually about an incel, there's another movie coming out this week that is: it's called Cuck, and while it won’t be seen by nearly as many people, it much more resembles the movie those panicking about Joker had in their heads than the actual movie does. Heading to VOD channels and a handful of theaters this weekend, director Rob Lambert's Cuck tells the story of a guy who resembles the worst liberal stereotype of Trump supporters: He lives with his mother, and is generally dim-witted, sporadically employed, involuntarily celibate, inept with women, violent, racist, and likely dealing with untreated mental illness. Ronnie (Zachary Ray Sherman) spends his nights toggling between porn and alt-right conspiracy YouTube channels. By the end of the movie, he's dabbled in making both. Minus the porno, a better movie was made from this general premise a decade ago, and that was Observe and Report, with Seth Rogen; that movie's protagonist also had an invalid mother and was even named Ronnie. Observe and Report, which arrived 10 years before the rise of incel culture, deserves credit for seeing what was coming—and its director, Jody Hill, has gone on to become a primary chronicler of a certain type of impotent male rage, as demonstrated on his and Danny McBride's HBO series Eastbound and Down, Vice Principals and now The Righteous Gemstones.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 6, 2019"," Audacious and transgressive, Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is clearly influenced by the work of cinematic legend Martin Scorsese, particularly his 1976 classic “Taxi Driver” and the 1983 cult of celebrity dramedy “The King of Comedy.” It also happens to be deeply rooted in comic book lore, taking on the origins of a classic Batman villain already played to perfection both by Jack Nicholson in 1989’s “Batman” and by Heath Ledger in an Oscar-winning turn in 2008’s “The Dark Knight.” There shouldn’t be a need to take on this maniacal character yet again, but Phillips’ film is exceedingly unique in its interpretation and cements its place alongside movies like 2006’s “V For Vendetta” and 2017’s “Logan” as auteur comic book cinema. Set in the backdrop of a downtrodden New York City during the late 1970s, “Joker” serves less as an origin story for a Batman villain than as a character study of a deeply disturbed man. Professional clown-for-hire Arthur Fleck has dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian like his hero, Murray Franklin, but acts of violence and delusions of grandeur set Arthur down a path he’s unable to come back from. “Joker” is a better film the further writer/director Phillips stays away from the movie’s comic book origins and hones in on Arthur’s wavering grasp on sanity. The film only works as well as it does thanks to three-time Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix dropped more than 50 pounds in order to transform into Arthur Fleck. Phoenix infuses the character with a chilling realism that transfixes and haunts viewers as he descends into madness, adopting clinically diagnosable conditions like uncontrollable laughing and paranoia to add intricate flourishes to his complex performance. Though “Joker” doesn’t fully focus on mental health issues, Phoenix takes great care to deliver nuance throughout in a turn that rivals Ledger’s more chaotic work in the role. Just as disturbingly provoking is the physicality of Phoenix’s performance as the actor twists and contorts his body so intensely that his spine and ribs almost burst through his skin. There is a considered theatricality to the way Phoenix moves throughout scenes, often gliding across the screen in a frantic, unchoreographed dance. Robert DeNiro was cast as talk show host Franklin more for his performance in Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy” than for what he could bring to the role itself. Phillips keeps DeNiro’s Franklin at a distance, often only allowing viewers to see the character through Arthur’s pensive gaze. Zazie Beetz is considerably effective in limited screen time as Arthur’s neighbor and love interest, though the film fails to fully realize their connection and one or two additional scenes between Beetz and Phoenix could have cemented these unlikely kindred spirits. Violence in “Joker” is gaudy and unapologetic, though rarely as terrifying as the general sense of inevitable dread that lingers and haunts most scenes. There isn’t as much as gun usage as one might expect given the dialogue surrounding the film, yet when Arthur commits violent acts, there is considerable carnage to the scenes that younger audiences used to comic book films will not understand. “Joker” feels ripped straight out of another filmmaking era, stylistically and visually, with a gritty texture to each frame. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher harnesses the energy of 1970s crime dramas into his work and frames the entire film around Phoenix’s contorting body to enhance the eccentricity of his performance. There’s an all or nothing prospect to the film’s award season chances. “Joker” will either be a top contender for Best Picture, cinematography, original score, adapted screenplay and direction or will get largely shut out altogether. The exception here is Phoenix, whose special performance as the titular character should be a mainstay in the lead actor category regardless of how the movie performs as a whole. Winner of the Golden Lion top prize at this year’s Venice Film Festival, “Joker” played to considerably less enthusiasm at the Toronto International Film Festival and has divided critics and regular audiences alike ever since. “Joker” requires considerable buy-in from viewers in order to be effective. Those accepting of the way the film washes over audiences will find Phoenix’s Arthur complex to be complex and compelling as “Joker” struts its way to an almost nihilistic conclusion. The year’s most divisive and sure to be most talked about film, “Joker” is definitely worth seeing either on the big screen or at home for any ardent cinephile. Hey Matt,
The movie this film most reminded me of is … ‘Sophie’s Choice’. Not for thematic reasons, but if you watch Alan J. Pakula’s film, you realize this is, largely, a tribute to the lead: Streep’s image is captured, cameo-worthy, at the end of the film. ‘Joker’ is a love letter to Joaquin Phoenix’s acting.
Of course ‘Joker’ is a tetch more than that – a kill-the-rich critique of modern society; an extension of the DC Universe. We’ll see if the next DC/Batman film acknowledges the rich are [redacted] the poor. I agree with your premise, but you’re also giving Todd Phillips a bit more credit than he probably deserves. To me, Phillips doesn’t look at this film any more than a Scorsese love letter and it relies too much on a perfect Phoenix performance. It’s a great movie, but Phillips backs into it more than he’ll ever admit. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," Earlier this week, filmmaker Martin Scorsese gave his comments on the rise of superhero films, comparing them to theme parks and stating that such works aren’t “the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.” The publication of said comments in Empire coincides with the critical frenzy surrounding Todd Phillips’ villain origin story, Joker, a film which relies heavily on (read: impersonates) Scorsese’s masterpieces, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. But if Joker is a theme park, it’s mostly akin to a grim abandoned sideshow, creepy clowns and all. At the depraved center of Joker is Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, an isolated man with a history of mental illness living in poverty in 1980s Gotham City. Working as a clown, he cares for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), with genuine concern, though there’s good evidence that she is not fully living in reality. She’s obsessed with contacting billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) as much as Arthur is obsessed with watching and emulating popular talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Repeatedly beat down in life, both metaphorically and literally, Arthur’s acquisition of a handgun from a co-worker empowers him to fight back against the powers which appear to prevent him from happiness. As the violence escalates, so does Arthur’s self-confidence, culminating in his public transformation into the psychotic clown of Gotham. Emaciated and gangly, Phoenix’s performance as Arthur is turned up to 11; he laughs and dances with a disturbing glee in this unhinged and daring portrayal of a man who sometimes seems frighteningly sane in his unsettling antics. Though the characters are similar, this is a far cry from Phoenix’s muted PTSD-laden performance in You Were Never Really Here, a far stronger film which Joker often seems to mimic (particularly the mother-son relationship). In a scene following Arthur’s first murders, Phoenix dances slowly around a decrepit bathroom with a sinister sinuousness, his motions hauntingly calm in the wake of such distressing behavior. While the film strives to make Arthur sympathetic, it also frustratingly draws overt links between mental health and (in a strange plot twist) adoption as possible sources for Arthur’s spiral into violence. (As an adoptee, any time a film script equates “adopted” with “evil” or “broken” it gives me hives.) The supporting performances from key character actors, such as Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives investigating Arthur’s crimes, and surprising cameos from Bryan Tyree Henry and Marc Maron, ground the film in an empathetic humanity. Cullen’s Wayne is underwritten, as is a supporting character of a neighbor played by Zazie Beetz (her role sadly serves little purpose in the film apart from Arthur’s fantasies). Phillips borrows so heavily from other films and directors, and my suspension of disbelief was often challenged; a scene at Wayne Manor with a young Bruce Wayne is too unrealistic even in this madcap cinematic vision, and certain actions during the final act drag on unbelievably. Thus, I found Joker‘s strengths to be less about the script and direction, and more in the amazing and textured costumes (Mark Bridges) and makeup (Nicki Ledermann), the incredible haunting score from Hildur Guðnadóttir, and the production design of the gritty garbage-infested Gotham (Mark Friedberg). And again, Phoenix is totally bewitching—even when he’s displaying the worst of human tendencies, you just can’t look away. If Joker has anything interesting to say about our present culture at large, with its protests of angry anarchists and above-it-all billionaires running for political office, it’s as simplistic as “look at how crazy it is out there.” Indeed, Joker is faux-profound, albeit mostly well-crafted in its pseudo-profundity. It provides no answers nor catharsis, no good explanations nor visions of possibility for a broken world. Arthur and Phillips are simply along for the wild ride, laughing uncontrollably as they go. So it’s an appropriate film for its eponymous antagonist, one of the most popular comic book villains of all time: repellent in its wanton depravity, it’s still maddeningly captivating, and sure to spark strong reactions. Whether those reactions bring out the best in us remains to be seen (I’m not holding my breath) but I imagine we’re all meant to be the punchline. I respectfully disagree with your opinion that the adoption piece is not important. I am also an adoptee, and I have lived through the trauma. I work with adopted and foster youth. I see every day how adoption and it’s secrets define and mold life. The decline in mental health of an adoptee is so painfully played out in the Joker character. That, with the relentless bullying,fueled his decline into madness.  I hope that the adoption connection is discussed- it’s once again the subject that is so right in your face but people want to ignore, because it’s supposed to be a beautiful thing. You’re “saving” a baby from a horrible life with a birth parent. Obviously not always the case, and the depiction of it in this film is a prime example. Michelle, my observation about using adoption as a trope to explain someone’s immoral behavior was not dismissing it as “not important” as much as lacking nuance and care. There are films and books which tells adoptees stories with honesty and empathy, and explore the complexity of the situation. “Joker” is not one of those stories; it *uses* adoption—just as it uses depression/anxiety and genuine mental health concerns—as a manipulative tool for excusing or explaining Arthur’s violence. As an adoptee, I find that troubling.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 6, 2019"," The year is 1981, and Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as an advertisement clown caked in white makeup and a green wig, twirling a yellow sign on the grimy streets of Gotham. He suffers from a neurological condition known as “pseudobulbar affect,” which causes him to laugh uncontrollably. Because of such, Arthur carries a card explaining his condition to worried and fearful strangers. Nevertheless, a series of violent events upends his life and sends him into a maddening descent.  Phillips based Arthur upon two white characters consumed with delusions of grandeur: Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976) and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy (1982). Like them, the mentally unstable Arthur exists in anonymity. He watches Wayne from afar as his mother Penny (Frances Conroy) writes to the mayoral candidate—who also happens to be her former boss—from their meager apartment for financial assistance. For his part, Arthur has only three goals: to make his next-door neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) fall in love with him, to take care of his mother, and to become a great comedian like Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) whose show he and his mother watch every night. The women in Joker are rendered through the veil of Arthur’s psychosis and moments of self-perceived grandeur. Initially, he befriends his next-door neighbor and crush, Sophie (Zazie Beetz). One day he barges through her door and forcibly kisses her, and somehow, they begin dating. She supports him during his standup performances and comforts him whenever tragedy strikes. This arc should leave most viewers uneasy—a foreboding air saved only by Phillips revealing these events as hallucinations within Arthur’s mind. In reality, Sophie barely knows the struggling comedian, nevermind dates him. While this twist should cause relief, the information arrives too late. Why spend an entire act grossing out your audience with scenes of sexual harassment as a gambit? The intention of painting Arthur’s deteriorating mental state through example might work in theory, but the execution doesn’t land.  The only other woman in Arthur’s life appears through his mother Penny, who solely exists as a stan for the men in her life, whether it be her son or Mr. Wayne. Arthur adores her because she believes he has a higher purpose: “to bring laughter and joy to the world.” Penny also fills his head with loftier ambitions, intimating to him that he’s the son of Thomas Wayne, born from an affair while she worked as a nanny at Wayne Manor. That brief dream devours Arthur. And when his mother falls ill, he goes on a quest to meet the millionaire to implore him to help her.  Black characters also exist on the periphery. But unlike the women who play supporting roles in Arthur’s mind, he sees Black characters as representatives of an ineffectual bureaucracy. More broadly, they personify a society that hates him.  For example, Arthur’s state-ordered psychologist, a Black woman, demands to see his notebook—the place where he writes his violent jokes. Even though she holds the rubber stamp to approve his mental health reports, she barely listens to Arthur’s problems. Later, Arthur sees a Black mother and her son on a bus. He entertains the son through comedic facial gestures until the mother scolds him, telling Arthur to leave him alone. Finally, a Black file clerk (Brian Tyree Henry) who works at Arkham Hospital refuses to give Arthur the records he seeks. So he steals them, dashing down the halls of the hospital in a scene that undermines Henry’s character.  Joker also paints mental disabilities with broad strokes that oversimplify. While Arthur is described as having pseudobulbar affect, he also takes medication for a wide array of unknown ailments. When the government shutters the program that provides his state-ordered psychologist and psychiatric drugs, Arthur sinks deeper into hallucinations while committing murderous acts driven by increasingly shaky logic. He goes from defending his safety on the train to killing an innocent social worker at Arkham Hospital for no reason at all.  Ultimately, Phillips’s Joker suggests that issues of mental health require government funding and assistance—a narrative that would actually be progressive, if the film stopped there. However, Phillips also stokes fear by relying on the tired and dangerous trope of characterizing people with mental health problems as violent, even though this group is over ten times more likely to be a victim of violence than the general population. Moreover, Americans from all walks of life experience mental illness—fully 1 in 5 adults, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Government services should indeed be provided, but not because this population is dangerous. They should be supported so that all Americans, including those with disabilities, can reach their full potential as members of society. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," In a destitute Gotham City with social services being cut and trash piling up in the streets, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) scrapes by as a clown-for-hire when not caring for his mother Penny (Frances Conroy). Dreaming of becoming a stand-up comedian to one day appear on his favorite late-night show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), circumstances are rarely in Arthur’s favor… up until a fateful night involving three young men harassing a young woman on a train. With Arthur out of a job and out of meds, his ailing mother is inexplicably convinced Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) would help them both if he only knew of their circumstances. Meanwhile, the overlooked citizenry is on edge, ready to riot against city leaders if presented with the right spark… or the right smile. From Cesar Romero in “Batman” 1966 to Heath Ledger’s The Dark Knight take and even Mark Hamill’s mind-bending animated vocals, “The Joker” has had plenty of incarnations. Revealed backstory or not, this particular member of the Dark Knight’s rogues gallery offers a glimpse into unaccountable madness and has always been more fascinating than the hero fighting him. Viewers seeing early peeks and trailers for Joker have poked fun at the newest interpretation, including him being the product of a “forty-hour work week” rather than a PTSD sufferer or falling into a vat of chemicals. Joaquin Phoenix has played similar characters in Arthur’s overlooked circumstances — the exemplary film Her, for example — but in a similar way that Christopher Nolan reinterpreted Batman Begins for his trilogy, director Todd Phillips chose to strip away the hi-tech comic book trappings to focus upon a down-to-earth, gritty wallow in the dirt. Are audiences ready for a superhero-less Joker origin story designed to walk the line between nihilism and gratuitous violence?

While painted as an origin story for a character who never needed one, Joker cribs elements from known sources before going off completely on its own. It works as an entirely alternative universe story, recasting a mysterious rogue as the one wronged with nothing to lose… not to mention incidentally starting a movement. For this incarnation of a familiar comic and cinematic character, Joaquin Phoenix appears to embrace the emaciated appearance of Christian Bale’s The Machinist (prehaps Batman and Joker have the same dietician) and a descent from resisting madness to embracing it. Less Falling Down and more Fight Club, an anti-hero discovers the power of invisibility, self-delusion, and murder before bringing all three to bear in choosing evil, and it’s hard to look away while still being hard to watch. Two factors stand out in this storyline. One is Arthur being invisible to the point of feeling as though he doesn’t exist — a highly relatable state of being — before discovering it’s kind of a super-power… and can be used for good or evil. The second is a production design that feels intentionally 1970s while standing in as a modern model of social relevance in today’s political climate. Violent protesters brandishing “resist” signs manage to seem both crazed and yet prophetic, a warning of mob mentality when many feel wronged or forgotten without strictly passing judgment. While Arthur’s story is more personal than the suffering masses reaching a boiling point, the herd is looking for a symbol… or at least someone they believe can be held up as one. With so many scheming and clever Jokers who’ve come before, Arthur is very nearly incidental, planning nothing and allowing circumstance and chaos to guide him; you can’t get much more Joker-ish than that. Still, the “Batman aesthetic” is essentially a candy coating that helps the medicine go down, and like today, can be seen in one of two ways. Arthur comes to believe he was doomed from the start in a society stacked against him, driving him to desperation as wealthy nobles are allowed to play at the expense of the less-elite. The societal point-of-view is that Arthur’s motivations are a suggested self-sustaining delusion, a continued circumstance of his own making while he selfishly chooses to blame others who callously overlook him. In truth, blame is on all sides, and whether fantasy or reality, the film suggests polite society breeds Arthurs who could erupt into Jokers if pushed enough. The solution is as simple as it is impossible: having empathy for others and contributing to work together for the benefit of all. Whether intended as a strong statement or a dire warning, it’s a literal shot in the face that makes one think, and that is worth the price of admission.",POSITIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," “So, when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your head where the screaming is unbearable, remember there’s always madness. Madness is the emergency exit. You can just step outside and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away…forever.” That dialogue is from The Killing Joke, alternately the best and worst story about The Joker ever written. On its face, the story is simple. The Clown Prince of Crime has kidnapped Commissioner Gordon, and his plan is to drive Gordon mad, proving to both him and the Batman that anyone can lose their mind and descend into insanity. All it takes is one bad day. The best stories seem to be simple, but a little investigation reveals hidden complexity. That complexity is why The Joker, a character originally created in a 1940 issue of Batman, still endures. He’s appeared in hundreds of comics, video games, artwork, and other media. It’s film, however, where the character has truly come to life; no wonder actors love playing him, as you can take him in an infinite number of different directions. Cesar Romero played him as a campy clown with a painted-over mustache. Jack Nicholson played him as a peacocking narcissist. Heath Ledger played him as an urban terrorist without a past. Jared Leto played him as a deeply annoying Juggalo. Hell, Mark Hamill might have delivered the definitive portrayal of him as a mischievous agent of chaos. There’s a single kernel of truth within the heart of The Joker: giggling nihilism. To him, nothing matters. Not love, not death, not responsibility or decency. It’s all a twisted joke, and he’s the only man who can see that. The right portrayal of him depends on empathy and fearlessness, while never forgetting that core fundamental concept. With Todd Phillips’ new film, Joker, we have an up-to-the-moment take on the character made with skill, intelligence, and no small amount of confusion. You can’t blame Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) for feeling a little crazy. He’s got a screaming head full of mental issues, barely managed by numerous medications. One issue that can’t quite be managed is the laughter. Specifically, when he feels stressed, he’ll erupt in a high-pitched cackle at the most inopportune times. Arthur carries a card that explains his condition and urges a modicum of compassion, but nobody seems to care. Compassion is in short supply in Gotham City. A garbage strike has deposited thousands of pounds of trash throughout the city. Economic catastrophes, crime, and income inequality have transformed Gotham into a simmering powderkeg, and all it takes is one man to light the fuse. Who would have thought that man would be Arthur? Certainly not him—at least not initially. He makes a meager living working as a street clown and dreams of becoming a famous stand-up comedian. If things really worked out, maybe he could even meet his idol Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), a glib talk show host. For now, that doesn’t seem likely, particularly since he needs to care for his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), a woman suffering from profound psychological problems. All Arthur needs is something to believe in, someone to give him a chance. There’s the slimmest thread of hope when he meets Sophie (Zazie Beetz), the pretty single mom who lives down the hall. But then there’s the gun he receives from a cruel co-worker, the social worker who informs him that budget cuts have removed access to his medication, the mayoral campaign of business titan Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), and a pack of Wall Street bros who just won’t leave him alone. Up against all of that and more, all Arthur can do is laugh. I still kind of can’t believe Joker even exists. Consider that we have a film about Batman’s greatest nemesis that only briefly portrays Batman as a frightened 7-year-old boy.* The main character is played by Joaquin Phoenix, one of the most talented actors on the planet. The film is directed by the guy who made The Hangover trilogy. That simple narrative would indicate a clusterf–k of epic proportions, no? No, as this simple story hides complexities. Director Todd Phillips deserves credit since he’s made a superhero movie that’s less an action movie and more a gritty character study. His film shares DNA with 70’s classics such as Taxi Driver and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. His Gotham City is a decaying metropolis brimming over with despair, and we can feel Phillips luxuriating in gorgeous sleaze. From a technical perspective, Phillips has made an excellent film, one with strong cinematography, creepy editing, and (mostly) solid pacing. Before we go too much further, I can hear you thinking, Hold up there, hoss. Should we really be taking a movie about a cartoon clown seriously? We should because The Joker can be interpreted as a trickster archetype or a means of blowing up a corrupt economic system a la Occupy Wall Street. I even read an interesting argument about how The Joker represents a Nietzschean superman who creates his own rules and rejects conventional morality through a will to power. That’s great and all, but the script by Phillips and Scott Silver is frustratingly inconsistent. If we’re going to have a character study where a man is broken by an unfeeling society, we should have a series of moments plotting Arthur’s fall and rise. The path should look “insane,” but in hindsight, the pieces should fit together and feel inevitable. There should be a moment or moments where Arthur chooses to be The Joker. Instead, it feels like Arthur’s character is yanked all over the place in a crazy-quilt of trauma. Yet speaking of inconsistency, there’s a sequence late in the film where Arthur achieves self-actualization, and I thought, “There he is. There’s The Joker.” When the script works, it works. Their screenplay does have a number of clever details. I particularly enjoyed Thomas Wayne portrayed as a Trumpian tycoon entering politics** and Arthur’s spiral caused by conservative budget-cutting. There are a few moments of humor, but only a few. You’d think that a movie about The Joker would be…y’know, funny.  I literally cannot imagine any scenario in which Joaquin Phoenix doesn’t receive an Academy Award nomination. He’s that good as Arthur, and it starts with Phoenix losing over 50 pounds and transforming himself into an emaciated scarecrow. If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve seen him twitching, dancing spasmodically, and laughing. His performance, thankfully, is more than a collection of tics. Phoenix lets us into Arthur, showing us a man who might not necessarily be good, but the potential is there. He’s mesmerizing, and he’s ably supported by a number of strong actors. I’m pleased that, between this and The Irishman, Robert De Niro seems to be on a career upswing. I was also highly amused to briefly see Marc Maron, a noted hater of superhero movies, showing up as Murray Franklin’s producer. The great Brian Tyree Henry has a strong scene as a clerk in a certain asylum you might be familiar with. I can’t say that Joker is a great film. Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix, and the cast and crew have made a very good movie that’s sure to polarize audiences and, like Fight Club, is sure to be misunderstood. Is it the right movie for today, for times that feel like we’re tipping into the abyss? Perhaps, and perhaps we always feel that way. Near the end of The Killing Joke, The Joker is pleading with Batman, begging The Dark Knight to understand his point of view. He says, “It’s all a joke! Everything anybody ever valued or struggled for…it’s all a monstrous demented gag! So why can’t you see the funny side? Why aren’t you laughing?” How does Bats respond? “Because I’ve heard it before…and it wasn’t funny the first time.” *The nerd part of me got upset here. “If Bruce Wayne is only seven here, while The Joker is, let’s say 40, then we have a big-ass age discrepancy! Figure after his parents are killed, Bruce spends the next 15 years going to school & doing pre-Batman stuff. If he dons the cape when he’s 22, Bruce is going up against a Joker who’s pushing 60! The Joker should never be concerned about prostate health!” Then I thought, “Relax, it’s just a goddamn movie.” **A smart friend of mine said that nothing in movies is an accident. Look at how two of the three Wall Street bros on the subway are dead ringers for Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.",POSITIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," “The chilling take away I got is that the cackling laugh of the Joker gets into your head, as if the filmmaker thinks that’s enough to explain this sad mental illness story.”  The Joker first appeared in comic book form in 1940 in Batman #1. Other noteworthy Joker portrayals include Cesar Romero’s campy TV one and the smirking cinema supporting roles of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. This is the first where Joker stars and there’s no Batman.The Joker was a rare mainstream Hollywood studio film to win the Venice film festival’s Golden Lion (Don’t ask how!). Director Todd Phillips (“The Hangover”/”Due Date”), best known for his superficial, lewd and popular comical films about young male adults, offers us this artless film that gives us the chance to see how the mentally ill Joker became the arch-nemesis of Batman. Phillips puts across a drama that has muddled messages about mental illness and unrealistic riot scenes of white professional clowns rioting in a       fictionalized downtrodden NYC of 1981 (one facing a garbage strike and large layoffs of city workers due to a downturn in the economy caused by greedy bankers that’s based on what happened in the real world). The Joker is co-written in a cynical and sub-standard way by Scott Silver and Phillips, looking for an entertaining rather than a probing film.  It only offers easy answers to explain complex problems and never gets  into the Joker’s head despite going over his journals and his narration.Phillips has said he was  influenced by Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976). But this film leaves only shrill social conscious messages compared to Taxi’s ability to accurately capture the mood of a city shaken by a bad war and also through its thoughtful victimized anti-hero–the former Viet-Nam war soldier, Travis Bickle (played by De Niro), going on an insane one-man crusade against society. It also channels Scorsese’s The King of Comedy    (1983), where De Niro played a delusional wannabe comedian named Rupert Pupkin. Both Bickle and Pupkin as misfits can somewhat explain the character development of Fleck, who is however more creepy than insightful.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," Since opening to an eight-minute standing ovation at the Venice film festival in August, where it scooped the top prize, Todd Phillips’s origins picture about the birth of Batman’s cackling nemesis has become the focus of a moral backlash, with critics using words such as “toxic”, “cynical” and “irresponsible” to describe its relentlessly embittered (and allegedly glorified) tone. That such terms should be applied to a populist studio picture from the director of the Hangover movies is perhaps unsurprising. Phillips has previously struck gold by appealing to his audience’s basest urges with the kind of nastily nihilistic gross-out comedies that he recently complained have been killed by “woke culture”. Joker, which seems to draw in equal measure on Martin Scorsese’s scabrous media satire The King of Comedy and Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, has a similarly dyspeptic worldview, full of characters drunk on a destructive cocktail of enraged self-pity and self-gratification, the latter indulged with an obliterating disregard for consequences. The difference is, this time no one’s laughing. Like Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn in The Dark Knight, Joker has an ace card in the form of Joaquin Phoenix’s mesmerisingly physical portrayal of a man who would be king. Reduced to a skeletal state (think Christian Bale in The Machinist, but worse) by a diet of nicotine and pain, Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck is a tragicomic nightmare, a beleaguered, sign-twirling clown who suffers from a medical condition that turns his internal screams into cackling laughter. Bullied, abused and increasingly enraged, Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in Gotham, a city befouled by garbage strikes and overrun by mutant rats. He dreams of becoming a standup comic but has no idea what other people find “funny” – a lethal combination. As Gotham rots, Arthur seethes, licking his wounds while pasting pornographic pictures into his journal-cum-joke-book. “Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?” he asks his unappreciated healthcare worker (fat-cat cuts are killing care-in-the-community programmes), sounding more like the illegitimate spawn of Travis Bickle every day. Meanwhile, Robert De Niro’s smarmy talkshow host Murray Franklin flashes his wall-toothed grin on TV, reminding us all what The King of Comedy’s Rupert Pupkin might have become after stealing Jerry Langford’s crown while a nation watched. The ghost of Pupkin hangs like a putrid spectre over Joker, from Arthur’s fantastical dreams of stardom to the narrative’s queasy themes of the media making heroes of villains in uncertain times. When wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) calls Gotham’s impoverished masses “clowns”, his words echo around endless TV screens, providing a V for Vendetta-style mask to rioting protesters carrying “Kill the Rich” placards. Meanwhile, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s brilliantly brooding score seems to throb up from the pavements of these mean streets, full of ominous low strings and prowling bass growls – doom-laden voices prophesying war. Through this desolate landscape dances Phoenix’s lonely man, treading a path from victimisation to vengeance previously trodden by everyone from Charles Bronson in Death Wish to Michael Douglas in Falling Down. Yet while Jack Nicholson’s weirdly lovable Joker may have described himself as “the world’s first fully functioning homicidal artist” in Tim Burton’s Batman, Phoenix’s Arthur is simply a pathological narcissist desperate to get his own back on the world. Like Pupkin, he craves unearned adoration and gets the same validating buzz from violence that fired Michael Rooker’s titular monster in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Whether stalking his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz), stabbing a former colleague in the neck or prancing obscenely to the imagined sounds of Gary Glitter’s Rock & Roll Part 2 (subtlety has never been part of Phillips’s palette), Arthur is hardly a sympathetic figure. Rather, he is pitiful – a key distinction. Visually, Joker has a studiedly retro feel, from the Saul Bass-designed 1972 Warner logo that opens the picture to the long lenses used by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, repeatedly focusing on faces partially obscured by fuzzy foreground figures, as if the film was peering over someone’s shoulder, spying on its subject. There are sly nods to key 1970s texts such as Sidney Lumet’s Network, alongside movie theatre marquees advertising such early-80s releases as Blow Out and Zorro, the Gay Blade. We also get an extended sequence pointedly played out against a revival screening of Chaplin’s 1936 classic Modern Times. As I said, subtlety is not Phillips’s strong point. What he does have is an eye for a well-chosen location, an ear for a provocative line of dialogue and a finger on the pulse of very marketable, confrontational (if also “cynical”) entertainment. Add to this an incendiary central performance by Phoenix and Joker looks set to have the last laugh.",POSITIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," The reason I chose this venue turned out to be a fitting metaphor for just how seriously Joker takes itself. This was one of the few theatres playing the movie on 70mm film, a presentation often tied to spectacle and prestige; Paul Thomas Andersonâs The Master which also starred Joaquin Phoenix, was filmed and shown this way. Joker, however, was shot with digital cameras, so in order to fit the format, its image had to be blown up. Its self-importance feels just as inflated. This makes it all the more difficult for Joker himself, a.k.a. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) to feel like a product of his environment â which the film so desperately desires. Whatâs more, the Gotham of the end of the film, which bubbles over with Joker-inspired chaos, doesnât really feel like a product of the Joker either. A whole social movement springing up in response to such a meaningless crime ought to feel nihilistic (to us, since we know the bigger picture), but the ensuing revolution is pushed well into the filmâs margins. Arthur doesnât seem to care about it, so itâs barely given the time of day. Arthur, on occasion, mentions he has no political ideology (or ideology of any sort), but heâs less âchaotic evilâ a la Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and more a symptom of a film that doesnât have any ideology either. It makes vague allusions to Arthurâs mental health and how social programs have failed him. Gothamâs proletariat responds to mega-rich politicians with protests signs from modern movements (âResist!â), but at times, the filmâs platitudes resemble the much-maligned
Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad
, which featured the idea of a protest in service of a recognisable brand. Weâre neither made privy to anything underlying the Wayne agenda, nor to whatâs actually happening in Gotham â its spike in crime, its economic downturn, or why Thomas Wayne calls its citizens âclownsâ â and so why its people might take after a clown-faced murderer is something of a mystery. The âwhyâ of crime in Gotham might not be necessary to explore, but the only crimes that ever unfold on-screen are groups of people ganging up on Arthur for fun. Joker may be nominally âaboutâ class, but it makes the rich and the poor seem equally shitty. And sure, refusing to tie violence to mental illness is the more socially conscious choice (the jokeâs on
âwoke cultureâ decrier Todd Phillips
, I guess) but this leaves Arthurâs violence without any ideology that can be fully dramatised. He only ever acts out of petty vengeance or self-defense â which wouldnât be a problem, were it not for the film alluding to some deeper impetus behind him combating social malaise. The film insists that ideology doesnât matter to Arthur (he says as much, and the film makes sure to divorce him from the larger political backdrop) and yet, Arthur also frames the lack of social safety nets as a reason for his violence. What is Phillips really saying with his references to Scorsese? Nothing much, it would seem. The iconic close-up of Travis Bickle pointing a finger gun to his own head is re-created verbatim, but the action is performed by Zazie Beetzâs Sophie, whoâs barely a character at all, let alone one for whom such a gesture would hold any sort of meaning (the gesture appears elsewhere, but a brief flashback to Sophie sees the shot unfold with the exact same lighting and slow-motion). This, despite the fact that Bickle and Arthur are both branded vigilantes. The film is filled to the brim with ideas based on other, better filmmakers and on relevant social themes, but it all amounts to a meaningless jumble. Itâs a copycat movie that steals from too many things at once to make sense of any one of them. Arthurâs constant pull-and-push between laughter and horror is only ever narrativised in two specific instances. In one, slapstick embarrassment collides with the discomforting weight of cops questioning him about his murders on the night his mother has a stroke. Just as they interrogate him about his condition, he walks into a clear glass hospital door. In the other moment, Arthur, still employed as a clown, drops a gun while dancing to entertain kids in a cancer ward. The jolting mix of humour and concern elicited by these scenes makes the film feel most alive â and most like it wants you to question your own impulses. But Joker never really builds on this idea. Beyond these two instances, Arthur is never funny enough to be likeable, nor is he shocking or unpredictable enough to be truly revolting. He exists, instead, in a lukewarm middle-ground where the thunderous clash between laughter and whatever else afflicting him (I want to say depression? Itâs unclear) is rendered meaningless. A middle ground where we, the audience, arenât torn between conflicting emotions, but rather, confused by what weâre meant to be feeling at all. In the film, Joker is eventually worshipped for catalysing a movement. The unrest in Gotham adopts his very face, even though heâs mostly unconcerned with the revolution (in fact, heâs out cold when it climaxes). People have a tendency to latch on to any powerful imagery if it suits their cause (see also: the Nazis), but regardless of the Jokerâs function within the text, his aesthetic never manages to permeate the screen. It holds meaning for the citizens of Gotham, who frolic and riot while projecting a Che Guevera-like spirit onto some clown makeup. But this symbol remains trapped in the world of the film, shackled to insipid Batman Easter eggs that feel out of place in something so self-serious (including one from the Adam West show?) and visual references a-plenty to far better filmmakers.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," La primera acción de Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) es mirarse frente a un espejo mientras trata de forzar una sonrisa. Un acto de mímica simple que permea a lo largo de Guasón (Joker, 2019), la controversial película de Todd Phillips (¿Qué pasó ayer?) que se alzó con el León de Oro en la pasada edición del Festival de Cine de Venecia. El trabajo de Phillips convierte este ejercicio de mímica de perturbadora naturaleza en el principio que dirige el relato. Tomando la ruta trazada por Travis Bickle y Rupert Pumpkin, dos personajes icónicos de Robert De Niro a las ordenes de Martin Scorsese, Todd Phillips recrea la década de los 70 con impecable detalle para presentar a Arthur Fleck, un hombre con una seria patología mental que cuida de su madre mientras trata de sobrevivir como payaso en la violenta urbe de Ciudad Gótica. Fustigado por una obscena risa que se presenta cuando está ansioso, Fletcher va gradualmente asimilando el profundo odio y enojo de una ciudad que lo rechaza y de instituciones que lo consideran indeseable, desechable, esto lo lleva a convertirse en el héroe de una sociedad harta del crimen y el desdén del privilegio. El descenso de Fleck a las tinieblas de su psique resulta efectivo por el compromiso de Joaquin Phoenix y por la mitificación inherente del Guasón, una figura que concentra el miedo, no tanto a los payasos, sino a una patología mental en la que la felicidad se distorsiona hasta convertir la risa en un síntoma, determinada aquí no por las instituciones sino la sociedad misma. Como El caballero oscuro (The Dark Knight, 2008) o El caballero oscuro asciende (The Dark Knight Rises, 2012), el proyecto de Phillips toma una postura política clara respecto a la ambigüedad de sus personajes y aquí es donde la mímica es más evidente. De manera similar a Bickle o Pumpkin, el Guasón no es capaz de distinguir una cualidad moral en sus actos y los justifica con base a lo otorgado por “la sociedad” o, más bien, el lugar que percibe le ha sido negado. Quizás es en este sentido donde la película presenta una primera polémica, que con facilidad puede asociarse a un discurso reaccionario, aunque tal asociación no es explicita en pantalla. La cuestión atañe al contexto social más allá de la pantalla en el que se presenta Joker inevitablemente la lleva a ese lugar. El mimo puede simular una acción, mientras sus espectadores pueden imaginar muchas otras con el mismo movimiento de manos. En términos cinematográficos, Joker no es “desafiante”, “atrevida” o “arriesgada” en lo más mínimo, al contrario, se adhiere con disciplina a las reglas del ahora viejo Nuevo Hollywood y Todd Phillips demuestra ser un dócil estudiante, no un visionario. Teniendo la anarquía y el caos como ejes temáticos, Joker no podría ser más controlada y regulada –incluso en la actuación de Phoenix–. Hay un poder que ni siquiera el Guasón es capaz de vencer: el económico. Por muy malito que esté, Guasón no deja de pertenecer a una franquicia y como tal, tiene obligaciones contractuales y responsabilidades con DC Comics y Warner Bros., entre las que destaca ser lo más siniestro y perturbador posible. Mi muerte hace más sentido que mi vida, dice Arthur Fleck en una de las muchas epifanías que tiene a lo largo de la historia, determinando que la única forma de revertir su trágico destino es imponerlo a los demás. Primero a través de la risa y posteriormente por medio del horror. La fascinación por el personaje viene dictada por esa morbilidad, Arthur deja de ser un personaje repulsivo hasta que se pone el disfraz, eso es lo que le permite convertirse, dentro de la película, en un símbolo, pero él no mata por convicciones políticas sino personales. Los motivos del sociópata podrán ser unos y la lectura que se hace de ellos, inevitablemente le rebasa. Joker es una película sin héroes ni villanos, aunque eso no le otorga en absoluto una naturaleza ambigua. Al contrario, la película es más que transparente, obvia en sus posicionamientos, primero estéticos/fílmicos y finalmente políticos. La sociedad, desde su concepción más abstracta y vaga, crea los monstruos que la destruyen y rescatan ¿De qué lado está el Guasón? En una secuencia, Arthur ve una escena de Chaplin patinando peligrosamente vendado de los ojos, mientras la audiencia espera que el intrépido vagabundo termine la proeza, Arthur parece esperar que caiga estrepitosamente para poder estallar en risas. Cuando el peligro se disipa, Arthur calla. Sólo el dolor de un payaso puede ser hilarante, a condición de que el mundo que le rodea sufra tanto o más que él. El Guasón defiende su dolor, un torcido privilegio.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 6, 2019"," Bridget Jones’s Baby apart, Renée Zellweger has been missing from British cinema screens for nearly a decade, the handful of films she has made during that period apparently not meriting a release on this side of the Atlantic.  But just when we might have been writing her off as a fading has-been, the former Chicago star comes storming back with a performance that may just land her a fourth Oscar nomination. The only potential problem is that while she gives exactly that sort of performance – big, mannered and playing a much-missed Hollywood legend – she does so in a British-made film that doesn’t quite measure up to its American star. It’s good, but it’s Zellweger that’s great. Structurally, it’s similar to both My Week With Marilyn and Stan & Ollie, in that all three take a famous American star and revisit an often short period when Britain played a small but important role in their lives. With My Week With Marilyn, it was Marilyn Monroe’s troubled time here as she filmed The Prince And The Showgirl with Laurence Olivier. With Stan & Ollie – a film that Judy resembles very strongly indeed – it was a final theatre tour of Britain the comedy duo embarked on in a doomed attempt to revive their film careers.  And with Judy it’s a troubled cabaret season at London’s Talk Of The Town, which Garland took on in a desperate attempt to restore her wretched finances. Barely six months later she would be dead. Zellweger, who’s a good match for Garland in so many ways (age, size and apparent fragility), gives it everything she’s got to convince as the deeply troubled singer. She’s twitchy, nervous, wide-eyed – to some extent it’s a masterclass in conveying vulnerability and desperation.  But it’s a little one-note – sometimes rather lacking in light and shade, at others just a little too much. Once or twice I thought I spotted the briefest glimpse of Julie Walters’s great comic creation, Mrs Overall, the tremulous caricature she once dreamt up with Victoria Wood. The film is adapted from Peter Quilter’s stage play End Of The Rainbow, and directed by Rupert Goold, the British director far better known for his many theatre productions than his, to date, modest film work.  It wouldn’t be fair to say that its theatrical origins are obvious, but it would be fair to describe it as a film that – for all its qualities – isn’t quite cinematic enough. Zellweger apart, it’s all just a little small and contrived. Garland’s troubled childhood and teenage years are beautifully established, however, through a series of flashbacks to the late Thirties, when she was under contract to MGM, run then by the bullying and intimidating Louis B Mayer (played here with suitable menace and looming physical presence by Richard Cordery). In scenes that suggest there is nothing new about #MeToo abuse, the young British actress Darci Shaw is terrific as the younger Garland, who, as she makes the transition to womanhood, is told what she can eat (the studio throws a 16th-birthday party for her with a cake they forbid her to eat), is force-fed with Benzedrine diet pills, and is then given sleeping pills when she understandably can’t sleep. Thirty years later it was a similar toxic cocktail that would accidentally claim her life. Musically, the first half of the film is a subdued affair, as Goold concentrates on establishing Garland’s situation – broke, lonely, vulnerable and, eventually, even deprived of her children.  But he more than makes up for that as the action moves to London, the sequin-clad showgirls kick up their heels, and Garland – after a considerable case of nerves – finally takes to the stage.  Goold slightly overcooks the big emotional climax but Zellweger can certainly belt out a tune, and with Over The Rainbow clearly on its way, we know we’re definitely not in Kansas any more. Or anywhere near a happy ending come to that. For one extraordinary moment in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix looks so like the late Heath Ledger that it takes your breath away, as the baton is symbolically passed from one great portrayal of Batman’s arch enemy to another.  Ledger, of course, won a posthumous Oscar for his performance in The Dark Knight in 2009, and no one would surely bet against Phoenix picking up a golden statuette in person next year. The only difference would be that Phoenix would be accepting the Best Actor Oscar rather than the Best Supporting Actor award, because this is a film that not only invites us to feel sorry for the Joker but places him absolutely centre-stage. Batman, even in the shape of a still-schoolboy Bruce Wayne, barely gets a look-in. Instead, Todd Phillips, hitherto best known for directing the Hangover films, focuses his camera and co-writing responsibilities on Arthur Fleck, a lonely man in early middle age who still lives with his mother, scrapes a white-faced living as a not-very-funny clown and nurses deluded dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian.  The fact that he has a mental illness that causes him to laugh maniacally at the most inappropriate moments is going to do nothing to help that ambition or lessen his mounting sense of social isolation. He has been in and out of institutions from an early age, and we soon get the firm impression that a tough Gotham City is not going to accommodate someone as odd as Arthur. Unless, of course, something snaps inside his head – or he comes off his medication. Phoenix, an actor capable of overcooking a performance, gets it spot-on, delivering a tour de force. Yes, he’s eventually overindulged a little and, yes, the film is probably ten minutes too long. It’s also noticeably short on action, although be warned, when it does come it’s as nasty as anything in The Dark Knight. With Robert De Niro leading the supporting cast as Arthur’s favourite chat-show host, comparisons with the films of Martin Scorsese are inevitable. Both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy come to mind in a film that is beautifully made but empathises so wholeheartedly with the loner who eventually picks up a gun – so often a real-life nightmare in modern-day America – that it’s possible to be both very impressed and deeply disturbed at the same time. ",POSITIVE

Both play characters with names beginning with J; both wear trademark white make-up beneath a shock of dyed hair; both solicit pathos with tales of the world’s great cruelty towards them; and both win our admiration for smiling through the tears and putting on a show.

"Oct 5, 2019"," Edwin Arnaudin: Three years after Jared Leto's much-ballyhooed turn as Joker in Suicide Squad wound up being little more than an extended cameo, Todd Phillips gives the character proper feature treatment in the 1981-set origin story called, well, Joker. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as mentally ill aspiring comedian Arthur Fleck, the film is an unapologetically dark and violent take on the Gotham villain. In turn, it's a treat for viewers like me who are fascinated by artistic, intentional looks at humanity's grim side (e.g. Taxi Driver and Se7en), and therefore extremely polarizing. Where do you fall on DC's latest flick? Bruce Steele: But is it, really, DC's latest flick? It's got the title and the DC logo and a rich guy named Wayne and a few familiar makeup and costuming choices, but this character has almost nothing in common with the mad criminal mastermind from the comics and many previous movies. He’s just an unlikable nut job who can barely hold down his job as a rent-a-clown. When a fellow clown gives him a gun to defend himself — need I say more? He couldn't plan his way out of a trash bag. (By the way, how tired is the garbage strike as a symbol for a decaying society?) When Fleck appears to have moments of lucidity, it's often not clear whether we're watching reality or his self-aggrandizing distortions of reality. This is no Joker origin story. It's some sad parallel universe where the Joker is a nasty case study in the failure of the mental health system. Phillips isn't rethinking comic book movies. He's just borrowing some set dressing to give Phoenix a showcase. Edwin: This is the kind of rich, complex movie DC has been trying and failing to make ever since The Dark Knight Rises. After the blessedly light Justice League and Aquaman, a return to darker subject matter is likewise welcome — as is another fresh perspective, one strengthened by narrative ambiguity that post-Nolan comic book films haven’t dared attempt. In that way, Phillips is definitely reconfiguring the genre landscape, and anchoring it to a true feat of acting — something that peers likewise haven’t required of their stars. But if viewers aren’t curious about this gritty Gotham and its hyper-relevant societal woes or dialed into Phoenix’s disturbed performance, full of maniacal laughs that are truer to the character than any previous incarnation (Heath Ledger’s overall superior turn included), it’s going to be a long, unpleasant sit. Bruce: It’s certainly unpleasant, and Phoenix is definitely more impressed with himself than I was with his repetitive, indulgent performance. How many times do we have to watch Fleck nervously handle a cigarette, laugh maniacally, bare his scarred and bony body, or do his tiresome madman dance? (Answer: many, many times.) Phoenix is in love with his own repulsiveness — to what end, I have no idea. I didn’t find Joker rich or complex, just monotonous and sour. There’s exactly one decent human in all of Gotham, Fleck’s neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), whom he stalks and whose storyline is a dead end. I’m all for moral and narrative ambiguity, but it needs to be anchored in a clear point of view, like the Scorsese and Fincher movies you mentioned earlier. Phillips’ purpose in concocting this dreadful vision eluded me all the way to the two unresolved endings. Edwin: Phoenix is terrific. Arthur’s tics may be few, but they never grow stale and the actor gets plenty of mileage out of them as they help intensify Joker’s suspense on the way to a showdown with late night talkshow host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, essentially playing The King of Comedy’s Rupert Pupkin in the twilight of his would-be career). The TV stardom angle is part of a clear critique by Phillips of society not merely ignoring underserved populations, but ridiculing them for their imperfections. In addition to the shortcomings of mental health professionals that you mentioned, the film sets up Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen, who ironically played a congressman in The Dark Knight Rises) as a Trump-like, out-of-touch gazillionaire who spews empty rhetoric while seeking political office — and who may or may not have a special tie to Arthur. Surrounded by such systematic ineptitude, it’s only a matter of time before the 99 takes action against the 1 percent. I get the sense that Phillips is suggesting revolt can take many forms, but by focusing on one that's primarily violent, he’s being honest about the way many fed-up citizens can and will likely react in volatile times — similar to what many Americans face today. The film’s relatability is staggering. Bruce: The unrest that Fleck accidentally inspires isn’t a revolt, it’s anarchy. I’m happy to acknowledge the movie’s trendy tropes — the cold-hearted media, the wealthy demagogue, the shoddy support for the mentally ill — but with an unbalanced solipsist at the center of the movie, it doesn’t add up to anything coherent. It’s just flag waving. It’s relatable in the sense that outbreaks of meaningless violence are familiar, but there’s no insight offered. The fed-up citizens here are faceless, their motives unknowable; Fleck only communicates with a few co-workers, a social worker, a couple cops (the ubiquitous Bill Camp and Shea Whigham) who are terrible at their job, his neighbor and his mom (Frances Conroy), who’s as unhinged as he is. Rupert Pupkin and Travis Bickle were warped, but they had clear world views. Fleck’s only belief is that life is meaningless. That lack of meaning seems to be all the meaning Joker has to offer. Credit to Phillips for trying to break out of his Hangover rut, but while he’s got style, the substance is thin and toxic. Edwin: I guess you didn’t see the excellent War Dogs, which hints at the social consciousness that Phillips goes all-in on here. Or maybe you did and it didn’t make much of an impact?  Bruce: I saw and enjoyed War Dogs, but like the Hangover movies, it’s essentially a comedy about men overestimating the power of their masculinity. Its patina of social consciousness seemed beside the point. Edwin: Either way, Joker shows him to be a filmmaker in full control of his visual and narrative gifts. Regarding world view/motivation, Arthur wants to be a comedian and has been told by his mother that his purpose is to make people laugh, so when those dreams are dashed in spectacular fashion and he has nothing left to lose, you better believe he’s going to lash out. I see similar motivation in his nameless, often faceless (behind clown masks) comrades, whether scrawled on signs or in their actions. It’s a message that resonates with me and hopefully other viewers who are willing to go dark for plentiful cinematic rewards. I give Phillips’ best film thus far a B-plus. Bruce: I also thought Fleck’s dream of being a standup rather beside the point. It wasn’t essential to his being, as it was to Rupert Pupkin. it was more of a psychotic whim — and a sick joke on Phillips’ part, since there’s nothing the least funny about this Joker. And therein lies my main problem with the film. Despite its admittedly admirable visual flair and Phoenix’s “gimme an Oscar” contortions, the notion that this creature ever becomes the great nemesis of Gotham is just ridiculous. It essentially erases the DC character and replaces him with dysfunctional psychopath, then declines to make a case for why audiences should care. I’m glad you saw something I missed, but like the shaky reality in Joker, I don’t think what you see is really there. I’ll grant the film a full grade above complete failure for its production values, but not its content. D.",POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2019"," Last night during my screening of Todd Phillips’ Joker in midtown Manhattan, a lone thirtysomething white man snuck a bottle of Tequila into the theater. During the opening credits he poured the entire thing into his Slushee and by the middle of the film he was stone cold drunk. By the hour mark when Joaquin Phoenix’s mentally tortured clown-for-hire Arthur Fleck had fully assumed his newfound Joker persona, he began clapping and cheering wildly whenever he killed someone or ranted about society. It wasn’t the applause itself that was disturbing; Phillip’s deliberate class-based provocations against the rich and powerful were so effective that during an earlier scene when Arthur killed three businessmen who attacked him on the subway, the entire audience whooped its approval. But this man kept clapping when Arthur—now fully the Joker—and his army of clown-faced vigilantes began killing innocent people and he continued clapping long after the carnage ended. Soon people in our audience started yelling for him to shut up. Then they tried talking to him. Finally a good third of the audience, visibly disturbed by his belligerence, fled the theater. Eventually security escorted him out, but not before he started spitting on passersby. This whole experience rattled me more than I care to admit, and the same can be said for my fellow moviegoers who nervously talked in the refund line in the lobby about the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting where a maniac  shot up a movie theater during a Batman movie. But it proved to me that all the critics who’d condemned it for supposed incel sympathies were right: this film is going to speak to a subset of socially maladapted men in the worst way imaginable. And for that reason it’s dangerous. But in a way that’s what makes it so vital. Perhaps more than any other recent movie Joker reveals something ugly and true about how part of our society (specifically its white men) sees itself and for that reason it should be studied. What bothers me are arguments from fellow critics that it’s a bad film. This also is madness. Unapologetically derivative of Scorsese? Certainly. But it’s brazen rejection of subtext in favor of brash surface literalism is downright Samuel Fullerian. With a feverishly tight screenplay, gorgeous cinematography, haunting music, and a truly inspired performance by Phoenix, it’s a powerful, disturbing piece of pop-art.",POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2019","The crowning achievement of Joker, other than Joaquin Phoenix's acting, is the film's score. Hildur Guðnadóttir composed one of the most iconic scores of the year. It is not an understatement that her score made the film for me.",POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2019"," Synopsis: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a mentally disturbed outsider in an increasingly inhospitable and grimy Gotham City, undergoes a journey of ironic epiphany that will see him become The Joker (or simply, ‘Joker’, as this film imagines him). Review: Todd Phillips’ earnest and self-important Joker is a near-conceptual disaster: it has the worst inflections of comic book origin fetish, alongside a little dash of misinformed, faux Scorsese homage, and is a naive attempt to piggyback onto zeitgeisty social concerns like the disaffection with austerity and a general air of protest and revolt. Now I’ve no issue with a bleak nihilistic film per se, but I do think if you tackle the subject, you have a responsibility to dramatise it three-dimensionally, not merely as a fatuous device to drive your story towards its (in this case) mega conceit of the origin of two mere comic book characters. Phillips has clear pretensions towards the same themes of solipsism, psychosis and delusion as Scorsese’s masterly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but Joker doesn’t possess one iota of those films’ perception, subtlety, psychological acuity or moral clarity. This is betrayed by the need to explain the scenes of Arthur Fleck’s fantasy sequences through expository flashback, rather than trusting audience intelligence and/or the murk of ambiguity à la The King of Comedy. Also, the ending is misconceived. Having a fantasy sequence of Fleck imagining further success on the Murray Franklin show juxtaposed to the chilling reality of him about to slay, personally, the Wayne family would have been a more revealing ending, but Phillips’ proclivity for gorging on the obviousness and gratuitous violence of the Joker’s ‘rebellion’ wins through. Biggest bullshit review I’ve read in a while. You talk, but don’t say anything. You just like the look of your words on paper. You clearly have never read a Joker comic as you have no idea who he is. What qualifies you as a film critic? Because you have a blog? What a joke. Like Arthur says at the end of the film, “you wouldn’t get it”. He’s talking to dipshits like this.  So many critics keep saying this is “piggybacking” off of Scorsese, and then bash it for not potraying Fleck exactly like Travis… it makes no sense!  Phillips was clearly not trying to just copy Taxi Driver by evoking a different emotional response to the audience: a take that calls us to sympathize and understand with our feollow man, or else our world will become even more chaotic. Scorsese was not trying to evoke sympathy for Travis, which you seem to understand. So why do you say this is just “piggybacking” before spending the rest of your review complaining about how it is not doing the same thing as Taxi Driver? I think most of these American reviews, who just dont seem to get it, and even want so badly to hate Fleck (one review wanted Fleck to be racist so she could project more hatred onto him), just show that America’s morality is deteriorating. Americans don’t want to sympathize or understand. They want a clear excuse to hate and blame.  I thought this was a good movie, I just don’t think it’s a masterpiece like some people have been saying it is. Sure, the script could’ve been better, however I think everything else is done pretty masterfully, from the acting (especially the mesmerizing performance from Joaquin Phoenix), editing, cinematography, the film’s handling on the message mental illness, and score. I just thought the script held it back from being a masterpiece and how the movie pales in comparison to the films it was inspired off of, such as Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy. I would say it’s like a 7.5 or 8/10.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 5, 2019"," The best known villain in the realm of comics is Batman’s arch nemesis, the Joker. The so-called Clown Prince of Gotham. The Jester of Genocide. The Ace of Knaves. Since his introduction in Batman #1 in 1940, the Joker has made an appearance in nearly every on-screen outing of the Caped Crusader, played so notably by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, voiced in animation by Mark Hamill and Zach Galifianakis, and now returning in the emaciated form of Joaquin Phoenix. Director Todd Phillips re-imagines the notorious supervillain and gives him a new origin. One rooted in realism and set against the backdrop of a Gotham City that closely resembles New York circa 1981. The city is plagued with a garbage strike, rising unemployment, and a staggering crime wave. For Arthur Fleck, life is joyless and unfulfilling. He does his best to suppress the dark cloud that accompanies him, scribbling jokes into a battered notebook and making regular visits to a social worker for access to his collection of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Arthur works as a clown for hire, one of Gotham’s most overlooked citizens. Much has been made of Joaquin Phoenix and his physical transformation. While his appearance is striking, he is hardly the first actor to go to such lengths for a part. But his protruding ribs and sunken abdomen are flaunted ad nauseum to hide the reality that this is character as hollow as his cheeks. Sure, Phoenix has a lot of big moments. He gets to laugh a lot and very loudly, he commits horrific acts of violence and sings and dances at odd moments. Much like the Joker himself, Phoenix is a performance artist who uses audacity and shock as substitutes for depth. It is the type of character work that mesmerizes some and induces eye rolls in others. Neither side is necessarily wrong, but the problem with Arthur Fleck, and by extension Joker, is that he never stops talking while also not managing to say anything either. Arthur’s version of Gotham City, Phillips wants us to understand, is a city in decay. Morally, physically, emotionally. It is a city on the brink of collapse, and the only one in a position to be a hero is billionaire businessman, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Wayne is treated like any other wealthy one percenter with political aspirations, though. We mostly only see him through television interviews, but it is clear there is no hero waiting in Gotham’s wings.  The script, co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, gives the illusion that it dives deeply into parallels between Gotham’s woes and ours, but it never really does. Through a series of incidents that could be real or could be in Arthur’s head, the story relies on gory violence, off-putting jokes, and glimpses into his mundane life. He goes to work, rides the grimy subway, takes care of his home-bound mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and dreams of a career in stand up comedy. Other than a disconnected series of voice overs, there is very little to connect us to Arthur’s life in a more than superficial ways. Everything that happens, from a brutal beating by a gang of sign stealing teenagers to his pharmaceutical access being eliminated by budget cuts, is supposed to lead us to understand how someone like him could become a ruthless supervillain. Perhaps that isn’t a stretch. But considering Phillips himself has insisted that this is not a film designed to elicit sympathy or empathy for the Joker is preposterous. His rise to evil is presented as a collection of wrongs that happen to him. It feels inevitable in the way that a perpetual victim will eventually fight back. And when that is the case, how is it not asking us, the audience, to sympathize with him? Joker doesn’t work well as an origin story for a supervillain, but it does succeed in its craftsmanship. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography captures Michael Friedman’s design of a crumbling city’s neglected corners. Oscar winner Mark Bridges relishes in the drab color palette of the 1970s, giving it slight hints of a comic book spin, without crossing into overtly cartoonish style.  Music is the most impressive part of the production, with a score from Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir that is jarring and off-kilter, like the film’s main player. But unlike the Joker, Guðnadóttir’s score has a logic to it and a playfulness that makes it feel like it belongs.  With the exception of Frances Conroy as Arthur’s shut-in and possibly abusive mother, the rest of the supporting cast is mostly relegated to the background. Zazie Beetz could have had an interesting part in the narrative as Arthur’s neighbor, Sophie. But the story is so focused on him and his wants and desires that she does nothing more than take up space in his mind. Both women exist to serve different facets of Arthur’s psyche. In his version of the world, his mother is there to suppress his dreams while Sophie sets him free. These women are not treated as real people that live beyond Arthur’s fractured mind, which is in line with Phillips’ usual treatment of female characters. Look no further than the nagging wives and wild party girls of The Hangover films. Joker is a frustrating mess of a story that uses all the conventional tropes and stereotypes of a sad guy with no opportunities to improve his life. He is the eventual nemesis to Batman, a man who also faced tragedy and trauma in his life, but who, through privilege and opportunity would eventually grow up to save the world. These two could be perfect foils of each other. But what Phillips and Silver give us merely blames mental illness and poverty. It could have been so much more, had the story been told by people that truly understood humanity. Instead, they give us a tale that is stripped of it. What a cliche. From the tiny photo I knew this pink haired “critic” would be a feminist. You are insufferable. You are not a film critic. You are a political agendist. There is no place for people like you in film criticism and that’s why true film criticism is dead. They let anyone be a critic these days and the lunatics have taken over the asylum. You don’t have the brain power to not force your own political agenda into everything. Not everything is an attack on you. What a sad life you must live that you can’t sit back and enjoy a work of art, without getting worked up with your own misconceived notions of how the film pertains to your feminist fundamentalist stronghold. Your review history is as predictable as the sun.  The absolute low point of this “review”, was you actually had the audacity to try and dismiss one of the greatest actors alive’s, clear best actor performance. It’s not even up for discussion. I’ve read a lot of bad reviews of this movie and your are the only one to even try to make that claim. I bet you thought Brie Larson was good in Captain Marvel too. No honey, “others” are not “rolling their eyes” at his performance, as you said. Just you. Only you. You are alone. But you’re probably used to that. I would like to respond to your comment below that was in reply to a comment of mine, but there is no reply option there. Perhaps you turned it off? So I’ll put it here.  You and I both know “Nick” hasn’t seen the movie. If he had, he would have made a point. Instead, all he had was some base level name calling, the last bastion of someone with no grounds. I have responded to many male critics, but of course you think I’m attacking you because you’re a woman. I’m “attacking” because I think your review is crap, not because you’re a woman. No matter how much you want to believe that, it’s simply not true. Every feminist critic thinks if you disagree with them, you’re anti-woman. No, I’m anti-bad opinion. Again, not everything is a personal attack. And I’m not attacking anyone. If anything I’m counter-attacking. Your review is the attack. Yes, art is subjective, but the perception of it can still be 100% wrong if viewed from the wrong angle as you and many other critics have. The MacBook Pro/latte thing is what you fix on? That was filler. Come on. Taking that as a bias/stereotype? I have a MacBook Pro and drink lattes! Again, not everything is personal attack. Lastly, I have seen a growing number of “film critics” judging a film based on viewpoints that they bring into the film as a criteria checklist. Feminism, diversity, representation. That’s not film criticism. I don’t know what that is. Diversity judgement? So you’re a feminist judge to me, not a critic. And there’s many more of you and it maddening. When you go in to review a film, you should check everything you know and feel going into it at the door. Two objects floating in space, tethered by a string. That’s you and the subject. No outside noise. You may find, you like a lot more than you think. The fact is, you came into this review with a pre-conceived notion of what I would write, based on an avatar in which I did have pink hair, and probably because the tagline for our site uses the word “feminism.” However, in my entire review of “Joker,” I only dedicate one paragraph to writing about what I perceive as being a problem with female characters, and Todd Phillips’ general handling of them. The bigger concern I wrote about, as I’m sure you noticed since you read it thoroughly, was more to do with the fact that Phillips has given us a Joker that demands sympathy or empathy, even though we are supposed to believe we aren’t supposed to feel such things about him. Also, as I’m sure you noticed, I praised the technical aspects of the film, because I was critiquing the entire work, not only a portion of it. That’s what good critics do.  I can see no point in continuing this conversation. You did, in fact, come in here looking for a fight. By calling me (I assume a stranger since I only have a letter to go by for your identity) a political agendist, insufferable,  and a “critic” with quotation marks, you are attacking me, regardless of how you try to claim otherwise. The fact that your attacks don’t bother me doesn’t make it any less of an attempt. It seems to me you would be much happier seeking out like-minded individuals and groups and relishing in your love of Joaquin Phoenix and Arthur Fleck and the film they have given you. I’m happy for you. I’m glad you like it. Regardless of how you have decided to interpret my intentions, I am not telling anyone not to see this film. Everyone has the right to make up their own mind and everyone should. This is simply one person’s feelings about it.  And to respond to one your earlier comments, yes, I did enjoy Brie Larson in Captain Marvel. Almost as much as I liked Chris Hemsworth in the Thor films and Robert Downey Jr in the Iron Man films and Chris Evans as Captain America. And I also liked Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Zachary Levi as Shazam.  You said exactly what I feel about this “review”. It’s pathetic how many critics give negative reviews and how meaningless their opinions are. The world doesn’t need these trolls and sycophants. Thanks for your reply she is what’s wrong with the world. My heavens, Steve, you are certainly most upset about a review that you think is meaningless. So upset that you’re using a lotta big words, there, Steve. Someone needs a better thesaurus, Steve. “Kiddo”? Welcome to the discussion grandpa. Are you her father? Not important. I appreciate you calling up the grandkids to teach you the internets so I could take in this, (clearly, very well thought out), response. Lots of great material here to chew on. First, I know you haven’t seen the movie, so that kind of kills any value you may have in this discussion. As for what you call a “tantrum” (again, showing your age), you’ve confused that for passion. Yes I’m passionate about my favorite art, film. And I’m sick of no talent, hack “critics” giving a bad name to film criticism and affecting art and my potential future exposure to said art. You see, these movies are a business, and when these critics go on their beat up MacBook pros and leave unjustifiable negative reviews in between latte sips for great films that they either don’t understand or have just made up their mind that it’s bad because it doesn’t fit their own personal political agenda, that pisses me off. That’s not being professional. That affects the chances of a continuation of the story. It affects sequels. It affects future work for actors, directors, writers, etc. Thus it affects me, because I want that art. It gives me life. Surely you care about something, right, “Nick”? I mean, I know your “normal” and all, but normal people gotta care about something too, don’t they? Lastly, I thank you for insinuating that I am not normal. Again, showing your age for thinking that is an insult. Normal is a setting on the washing machine. Normal is plain, boring, simple, easily consumable, easily digestible, easily forgettable. Like a Marvel movie. I guess that was in style in the 50’s or whenever your from, but not anymore Pop’s. Human beings are inherently complex, so anyone worth talking to wouldn’t be considered “normal”.  This film, for instance, is not “normal”. Thus, I would suggest you probably not watch it. It’s not for simple minds. As Arthur said with the last line of the film, “you wouldn’t get it.” Pretty funny that you accuse Nick of not watching the film when you got all up in arms about a review you clearly hadn’t read all the way through.  How many male critics have you attacked for disliking the film? Because I’m sure someone as enlightened as yourself would never set out to simply try to tear down women with differing opinions. The very idea you foster, that art is objective and there is only one way to look at this or any film is actually in direct contradiction to this film itself. Perhaps you are the one who doesn’t get it. I’m sad for you, “C.” I have had really interesting, thoughtful conversations with colleagues who more closely align with your opinion of this film. Our conversations have been respectful and mutually enlightening. If you weren’t so bent on trying to attack dissenters, your message might be better received and you might actually have a shot at making the difference you are clearly so desperate to make. “His rise to evil is presented as a collection of wrongs that happen to him. It feels inevitable in the way that a perpetual victim will eventually fight back. And when that is the case, how is it not asking us, the audience, to sympathize with him?” Couldn’t one somewhat compare the Joker in the regard to what you said in the above quote from your review with Alex from Clockwork Orange? The loathsome lead character is offered some extra sympathy by grace of them being the main character and having seen them suffer on screen? I think there are certainly parallels in regards to societal, environmental and mental health cross over between the two films. Batman is one of the only comics I’ve actually read, I’ve watched almost every version of the character, and my pet bunny is named Bruce Wayne. Please tell me more about things I don’t understand. >These women are not treated as real people that live beyond Arthur’s fractured mind, which is in line with Phillips’ usual treatment of female characters.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 5, 2019"," The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work. One can imagine the Joker cackling with glee at the chaos this rendering of his story has caused, provoking audiences from every direction. It’s exactly what he’d want. As we fight over Joker’s meaning and get triggered by it in a panoply of ways, the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank. All movies are mirrors, even when we don’t like what we see in it, and even when the movie isn’t particularly thoughtful about how and what it reflects. Joker reflects us, and our cultural moment, in ways we’d do well to consider.  What does it say about us that a grim, disaster-in-the-making origin story about the world’s most famous comic-book villain will likely be one of the highest-grossing movies of the year? Why do we flock to see the making of a psychopath, with gleeful anticipation for the bloody spectacle we know will conclude the film (and which some people clapped for, quite disturbingly, in the theater where I saw it)? It’s the same reason why we can’t look away from a fiery car wreck on the highway, or why we are often glued to the TV during the latest terrorist bombing, mass shooting, or natural disaster. It’s why the O. J. Simpson trial and Gulf War basically invented cable news. It’s why the slow devolution on Breaking Bad was utterly captivating to watch. It’s why horror is the most bankable Hollywood genre. Something in us is simultaneously repulsed by and attracted to the macabre, the grotesque, the horrifying.  The first words we hear in Joker are “the news never ends,” and throughout the film the press coverage of Gotham’s crime figures prominently. A shocking act of violence on live television catalyzes the film’s climax, bringing to mind recent films like Christine (2016) and Nightcrawler (2014), which have explored the intersection of media and violence (“if it bleeds, it leads”). Why are we—dare I say it—entertained by watching destruction and calamity unfold? I include myself in these questions. Why did I find Health Ledger’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) both deeply unsettling and kind of cool? When he walks away from the exploding hospital wearing a nurse’s outfit, or wields a bazooka from a speeding semi, audiences delight in his glam-goth style and undeniable showmanship. Certainly there are moments in Joker where Joaquin Phoenix—albeit a more clumsy, nerdy, and less confident Joker—channels that same underworld swagger.  The Joker, like Satan himself, knows that humans are inherently perverse creatures, lured in by spectacle, addicted to novelty, prone to amusing ourselves to death. In this way Joker is the perfect bogeyman for our age, embodying the toxic, corrosive power of an entertainment-obsessed, hyper-mediated society of spectacle.  If we feel gross being “entertained” watching the Joker’s dark descent (and in Joaquin Phoenix’s hands it truly is a captivating spectacle), it’s exactly the feeling Philipps wants to evoke. As we watch the grotesque and oft-repeated slow-mo sequences of this homicidal maniac dancing to Frank Sinatra, we should ask ourselves: Is this what entertains us today? Why? For Christians especially, the questions seem urgent: Why are portrayals of evil and brokenness so compelling,  even “cool”? Could this be one manifestation of our culture’s increased emphasis on the “badge of honor” value of brokenness, relatability, and #nofilter “authenticity”? It’s harder to identify with “good guys” these days, if we even trust that good guys exist. But the fragility and darkness of Arthur Fleck in Joker—now that we can relate to. If it’s even partially true that a transparently broken, “I’m a mess” villain like Fleck is more compelling and identifiable to audiences than a more stable, morally driven hero, then the Joker is truly on us.  Perhaps the most iconic line from Ledger’s Dark Knight Joker, “Why so serious?” could be asked of Joker, a film that, unlike its comic-book kin, is not very fun at all. Indeed, the film’s bleak aesthetic—a seedy, early 1980s Gotham that invokes Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver—fosters a tone of gloom that feels fitting for our cultural moment. But the “why so serious?” question could also be turned on us. The seething anger and joyless nihilism at the heart of Joker is apt for our “American carnage” moment, is it not? If Joker makes a fetish out of rage and cynicism, it’s only because this is what our media environment does too. If Joker thinks it is more important than it is, “a project drowning in self-seriousness,” it’s only because this is our daily bread on social media: where everyone’s hot take seems (to them) very important, and where every new outrage is of utmost urgency.  Today’s world is constantly angry, everything is politicized, and anything remotely pleasurable is quickly suffocated under the weight of piled-on chastisement and woke deconstruction. Almost anything popular or pleasant will inevitably inspire waves of backlash, then backlashes to the backlash, and so forth. Takes upon takes upon takes. It’s exhausting.  To be sure, entertainment can be culturally astute and “relevant”; certainly there are crucial issues we need art, and criticism, to engage. But Christians especially should fight for the value of joy, pleasure, leisure, enjoyment, beauty—things that are valuable precisely because they’re often irrelevant. A world with no time or space for such things—where everything is a battle, subtext, and commentary—is a world where an abundant, grace-giving, Sabbath-creating God will feel increasingly distant and undesirable. Speaking of a distant God, this is another way Joker holds up a mirror to our cultural moment. It’s a movie that continues the trend of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films: superhero movies where the supernatural is conspicuously absent. It’s a world where good and evil as transcendent categories don’t exist and thus, as Alissa Wilkinson points out, “the terror of the Joker is curiously defanged.” Indeed, even in Nolan’s otherwise soul-less Dark Knight universe, Ledger’s Joker is undeniably evil: disturbing because he doesn’t have a backstory; an unstoppable force with no apparent whence or wither, rhyme or reason. But in Joker, Philipps and Phoenix take great pains to explain Joker’s evil. Not to justify or defend it, to be sure, but to situate it within an immanent world where horrific behavior must be the effect of some natural cause.  It’s interesting that earlier this year Phoenix starred as Jesus in the awful Mary Magdalene, a film that grounded Jesus in a thoroughly immanent, disenchanted world, just as Joker grounds its devilish villain in a human and humble context. Playing both sides of the good-and-evil spectrum, Phoenix is certainly interesting to watch; his acting chops are formidable. But to over-nuance evil in Joker is foolish. I’m not even sure Phoenix or Phillips would use the word “sin” to describe what’s going on with Fleck. By giving such a logical, “here’s why he went bad” spin to Joker’s story, the film reflects a society that struggles to know what to do with evil.  As scary as it sometimes is, Joker made me think of the (far scarier) Las Vegas massacre in 2017. It’s the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, but the lone perpetrator had no apparent motive. In a secular age, we don’t know what to do with this. It doesn’t make sense. We’re desperate to find containable causes for evil behavior, because the alternative—that our fallen nature means any of us could become a villain too—is for some too unsettling. There are a lot of mirrors in Joker—many shots of Fleck looking at himself, his clown makeup smeared by blood and tears. But the ghastly images of Fleck are less disturbing than what the film reflects back to us: a society strangely intoxicated by macabre spectacles but oddly resistant to confronting the realities of evil, least of all in our own hearts.  Brett McCracken is a senior editor and director of communications at The Gospel Coalition.

"Oct 5, 2019"," Joe Friar is a member of the Critics Choice Association (Los Angeles) and the Houston Film Critics Society. A lifelong fan of cinema, he co-founded the Victoria Film Society, Frels Fright Fest, and is a Rotten Tomatoes approved critic.  The gritty look and dark tone of Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is exactly the origins story needed for the sinister supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson almost 80 years ago. Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances of his career as the imminent Caped Crusader’s rival, one that eclipses Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning performance in 2009, in what could be dubbed this generation’s “Taxi Driver.” DC purists may be vexed by Phillips and Scott Silver’s storyline while some moviegoers will be alienated by the film’s senseless violence in this zero-tolerance era. Still, the villain portrayed by Phoenix is a product of society, a disturbing fact often overshadowed by the violence itself but front and center here in Phillips’ interpretation. Early 80s Gotham City resembles the sordid ambiance prevalent in Scorsese’s 1976 masterpiece “Taxi Driver” and in many ways, Phoenix’s character Arthur Fleck is similar to De Niro’s Travis Bickle. Both are loners with delusional anxiety who are transformed after committing senseless acts of violence. There is nothing in the film’s first half that indicates you’re watching a story unfold in the DC universe, but as the Wayne family and Arkham Asylum (known here as Arkham State Hospital) are incorporated into the storyline, Phillips reminds the audience that this is an origins story as Phoenix sinks to depth’s unexplored by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger. Phoenix plays a clown for hire named Arthur Fleck who lives with his mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy) in a small dilapidated apartment in Gotham City. Mental illness runs in the family, the extent revealed late in the film. We watch as Arthur is physically and mentally bullied and beaten by teenagers, colleagues, and even his own mother as the character’s psyche is shaped by those around him. There are signs of Batman in the film who is only a child here (played by Dante Pereira-Olson who played the younger version of Phoenix in 2017’s “You Were Never Really Here”) as the young Bruce Wayne who has an unforgettable encounter with Arthur outside the gates of Wayne Manor as Alfred the butler (Douglas Hodge) intervenes at just the right moment. Brett Cullen plays Bruce’s father Thomas Wayne who is running for mayor of Gotham City. His campaign may be seen by some as a reflection of the current political climate as the millionaire frowns upon the less fortunate while declaring himself their savior. Phoenix lost 52 pounds for the role, similar to De Niro who lost 60 pounds to play Jake La Motta, in a transformative performance worthy of an Oscar nod. Here De Niro plays a Johnny Carson replacement (complete with Ed McMahon substitute) named Murray Franklin who invites Arthur to come on his talk show after making fun of him by airing a clip of his horrible standup routine. The scenes with De Niro recall Scorsese’s “King of Comedy” where the actor played a mentally unstable standup comic (like Phoenix’s character) who kidnaps talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) in order to gain a slot on his popular television show. De Niro is playing the Langford role in “Joker” which is saturated with Scorsese references. Director Todd Phillips is known for comedies that include “Old School,” “The Hangover,” and “War Dogs,” but recently he revealed that he chose to shy away from those type of films because it’s hard to be funny in today’s ultra-sensitive climate where people are easily offended. I’m not sure how that’s going to work out for him since there will be some pushback from moviegoers upset by either the violence in “Joker” or its interpretation of DC’s supervillain. Someone will always be offended about one thing or another. If Phillips had “Taxi Driver” in mind while creating his vision he has succeeded in placing us back into the seedy, dirty world of Travis Bickle. Kudos to cinematographer Lawrence Sher (his sixth collaboration with Phillips) who used the ARRI Alexa 65 to give the digitally shot film a vintage 35mm aesthetic. Production designer Mark Friedberg magically transports us to late 70s-early 80s New York for Gotham’s look shooting in parts of the city that aren’t familiar enough to break the illusion that we are in another urban landscape apart from NYC. The violence in “Joker” isn’t glorified or gratuitous. Phillips is going for realism and he accomplishes that goal. Still, there are moments of violence that feel surreal which loses some of the impact intended by the director. The film is so engrossing that when gun violence takes place on screen the audience isn’t immediately reminded of our current real-world climate. It’s only after reflecting on the film that it begins to sink in. It’s the same effect you may get today after viewing a classic from Sam Peckinpah or Quentin Tarantino. Phoenix is amazing in one of the best performances of his career. The freedom given to the actor to adlib results in some unforgettable scenes and an iconic moment on a staircase as the fully transformed Joker moves to the music of Gary Glitter’s “Rock n Roll Part 2.” The soundtrack runs the gamut from Jimmy Durante’s “Smile” to Frank Sinatra’s “Send in the Clowns,” Patsy Cline’s “The Wayward Wind,” to “White Room” by Cream. The supporting cast features good performances by Zazie Beetz as Arthur’s neighbor and possible love interest, Frances Conroy as Joker’s mom, and Bill Camp and Shea Whigham as a couple of Gotham City detectives. “Joker” is one of the best films of 2019 even though it jumps the rails with an ending that ditches the film’s persistence for reality by giving the audience a climax that you could only exist in a film based on comic book villains and heroes.

"Oct 5, 2019"," There is a scene, near the beginning of Todd Phillips’s brutal, cinematic deconstruction of Batman’s fiercest enemy, when Arthur Fleck, an emaciated performance clown who ends up becoming the Joker — wonders what has become of his world. “Is it just me,” ponders Fleck, “or is it getting crazier out there?” Well, a quick glance at Twitter suggests things are as crazy here as they are in Gotham City. Yep, the exhausting Joker controversy continues. Some see Phillips’s grimy, grounded character study of DC’s most iconic supervillain as a masterful, cautionary tale for our times. Others look at Phillips’s film as a genuine threat to society. There are those who have expressed concern that this new and unhinged Joker could become something of a cinematic folk hero for the ‘involuntary celibate’ movement — a horrifying online sub-culture of misogynistic males who are angry at the world because they don’t have girlfriends. We could go on. Most of this tiresome pre-release chatter is coming from those who haven’t yet seen the damn film. These people have already decided that Joker makes a hero out of the masked sociopath in the cheap suit. But it doesn’t. Yes, Joker is a bleak and deeply unsettling piece of work about a lonely, white male who loses the plot after one too many bad days. It’s intense, it’s grim, and it owes more to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy than it does to Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. But it rarely, if ever, asks us to sympathise with its troubled protagonist. Arthur Fleck (a frighteningly committed, Joaquin Phoenix), is a performance clown who lives with his ailing mother, in a decrepit apartment block in 1980s Gotham, a filthy, economically deprived city that has seen better days. Arthur isn’t well. He’s struggling to keep a roof over his head, is on several medications and is afflicted with a long line of conditions, the worst of which is a crippling, involuntary laughter, which occurs whenever he is stressed. The only thing that brightens this chap’s day is his dream of becoming a stand-up comic. He’s also obsessed with a chat show host named Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), whose nightly show he watches with his mum. Things go from bad to worse one day, when Arthur gets fired from his clowning job after he shows up at a gig with a gun in his pocket. It’s on the subway home that the clown finally snaps. Three smarmy, upper class Gothamites attack Arthur, and he responds by shooting them dead. Next thing you know, this mysterious ‘murderer clown’ makes the front pages, and becomes a symbol for Gotham’s struggling underclass. Certainly, Phoenix’s terrifying portrayal of the cackling anarchist, who has always had Batman to put an end to his madness, is every bit as unnerving as you’d think. Likewise, Hildur Guõnadóttir’s haunting score adds to the dread. Instead, it positions Phoenix’s Joker in such a way that, when it comes time to don the white make-up and green hair dye, he is utterly irredeemable. It’s impossible to root for a man who’s capable of the atrocities committed in this violent, occasionally gruesome display. Joker, in that respect, is a horror film — albeit a strangely beautiful one — that puts the baddie front and centre, pushing buttons and holding a mirror up in places where it knows its audience will be uncomfortable with the reflection. But that does not make it dangerous. It’s a piece of art; a dark, devastating yet mesmerising offering, in which Phoenix – whose magnetic and eerily graceful Joker hobbles and dances his way from mentally unstable loser to despicable murderer — gives the performance of a lifetime.",POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2019"," Starring: Joaquin Phoenix (The Master), Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), Frances Conroy (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), Brett Cullen (The Dark Knight Rises), Douglas Hodge (Red Sparrow), Marc Maron (G.L.O.W.) It’s hard to talk about Joker without addressing how controversial it has become. When it was first floated that Warner Bros. was going to start a new brand for gritty reinterpretations of DC Comics characters with no ties to the ongoing DCEU, starting with an origin story for The Joker, opinions were immediately polarised, and the reaction has only grown more heated once people finally saw it. Some have hailed it as a revolutionary next step for comic books becoming a basis for legitimate cinema, whilst others have trashed it as a tone-deaf and conceited piece of Oscar bait that is harmful to the community it attempts to spotlight. In these troubled times, it is impossible to remove Joker from the socio-political culture that spawned it, making it a film that is absolutely impossible to critique objectively (well, more so than any piece of art, at least). So for what it’s worth, what do I think? Well, get your torches and pitchforks ready, because I am about to get honest. A word of warning: if you struggle with your mental health to any degree, be wary if and when you see Joker. It’s an unrelentingly bleak movie that tackles abuse, trauma, and the general unfairness of the world, all through the lens of an unhinged man who’s had one too many bad days. It’s a phrase that has been ruined by the Internet, but Joker is going to be a triggering film to many audiences in a variety of ways; it certainly affected me during and after watching it. With that said, the film has very little to say of value after subjecting you to its horrid outlook. It is very obviously cribbing its style and lens from Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and those movies at the time had similarly twisted but original and thought-provoking views of the culture that spawned them. Joker, however, only seems interested in parroting the ideas of its inspirations without the originality or depth. There’s a fine line when homage drifts into theft that Joker dances around constantly, and when it can’t just copy Scorsese it instead rambles off with the same “look what society has turned me into” talking points that are tired to the point of parody. Most damningly, it fails to grasp the core of why Scorsese’s tales work: they remind you not to fully sympathize with their protagonists. Whilst it is easy to assume a general audience’s moral compass will kick in, the film completely negates to frame Arthur (Phoenix) and his actions in an appropriate context. His victims are always people who seemingly deserved it, those who criticize him are usually hypocrites, there’s no effective moral compass character to anchor the audience in sanity, and there’s never that moment where a line has clearly been crossed and we completely lose sympathy. It’s not just a poor way of framing a character with psychotic tendencies, but an irresponsible one than benefits neither a general audience nor those who suffer from poor mental health. I wouldn’t say the film condones the actions and views of its protagonist, but it does absolutely nothing to safeguard itself from such an interpretation, and that’s highly concerning. What singlehandedly saves the film from being an entirely despicable mess is Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck. Whilst not necessarily a great interpretation of The Joker per se, the character has fascinating potential and Phoenix wrings every piece of character detail out of the material. Though it has faint echoes of Heath Ledger’s iconic interpretation from The Dark Knight, Phoenix and the screenplay takes a vastly different approach to exploring Joker’s psyche, and removed from the context of Batman it is a compelling character transformation. However, the payoff is ultimately unsatisfying, as once Fleck goes full Clown Prince of Crime he just devolves into the aforementioned living embodiment of the “we live in a society” meme. That’s more the fault of the screenplay than Phoenix, whose work here is certainly worthy of Academy Award consideration, but it does hurt his portrayal nonetheless. In regards to the rest of the cast, most of them barely get enough screen time to leave an impact. Robert De Niro essentially just plays himself via Johnny Carson in the film’s most blatant homage to the tale of Rupert Pupkin, with Marc Maron essentially rendered to a cameo as his producer. Zazie Beetz is utterly wasted as Arthur’s neighbour Sophie, left with a mere blank slate character whose only purpose is so blatantly obvious that it’s hard to believe the filmmakers thought it worthy of a twist, whilst Frances Conroy has potential as Arthur’s delusional mother Penny but she gets written out of the movie just as their relationship gets interesting. Brett Cullen is completely underutilised as the film’s cynical reinterpretation of Thomas Wayne, with again the film opting for the obvious direction for his character journey, and Douglas Hodge apparently plays Alfred Pennyworth in this movie? He only gets one scene and is barely even recognisable as the character, so why even include him? Though the film’s aping of aesthetics rarely goes beyond the superficial, Joker does absolutely nail the grimy atmosphere of 1980s New York for the film’s period-inspired imagining of Gotham City. It’s easily the most distinctive and imaginative portrayal of the locale on screen since the Burton/Schumacher era, and everything from the production and costume design down to even the lighting and sound just oozes with seediness. Laurence Sher’s cinematography is the only aspect of the film that feels remotely comic book-inspired, shooting the film with a composition and palette that evokes the dark graphic novels of the 1980s in a vivid but grounded way. The film’s music by Hildur Guðnadóttir is also suitably eerie and uninviting, perfectly evoking the warped mindset of its protagonist; it’s a score worthy of a far better film. Joker is to Martin Scorsese what Battleship was to Michael Bay; an empty attempt at imitation that confuses aesthetics and homage for quality and flattery. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance may be worthy of all the hype, but it cannot carry a film that without him is just an edgelord fantasy that thinks it is poetry. Phillips feels completely out of his depth like a toddler trying to talk at the big kids’ table, repeating the naughty words they heard on TV and hoping everyone thinks they’re cool, and just reeks of a filmmaker who thinks they are better than the material they are working with. The concept of making DC films outside of continuity with radically different takes is a great one, but Joker is a wasted opportunity to do something far more subversive with the material. Comic book movies shouldn’t have to pretend to be Oscar movies to receive respect. As Black Panther proved, you can get there by just being the best version of what you are. Because I am trying to demonstrate that a comic book movie can receive critical acclaim and Oscar attention by simply being a great example of the genre it is from, rather than adopting the trappings of “real cinema” in order to deemed “worthy” as Phillips himself has admitted. Also, I understand The Joker. I even understand this Joker. I just didn’t like it. There’s a difference. If there’s any misunderstanding here, I think it’s that you have misunderstood my review, possibly wilfully so. Do you enjoy anything? Or are you just another millennial getting their joy and sense of self-worth by hating everything.  “Critics” like you forget why we go to the movies. Portraying headliner 2019 issues doesn’t make a good movie, only makes you sheep by easily hopping on the emotional bandwagon. Where everyone has to give a crap about every single person’s feelings or otherwise be outcasted. Get off your computer, go watch a movie, eat popcorn, and enjoy the created Entertainment! If you want “real cinema” get back on that high horse and go watch CATS when it comes out for all you pretentious goons. The word different is around for a reason, as well as genre, style, taste, interest, fun, boring, sheep, hermit, dumb, annoying, heaton, and jennifer. Dude, you’re the one who gives enough of a crap about my opinion to send me this screed. You like the movie? That’s fine! Go enjoy it. You are as entitled to your opinion as I am to mine. If anything, you’re the sheep for joining in with the herd bombarding me with the same angry crap.  And yes, I enjoy plenty of movies. If I didn’t like movies, I wouldn’t be a critic. And if I hated on everyone who disagreed with me, I’d be a troll. Sound familiar? I’m not sure we saw the same film – I found this utterly compelling from the first moment to the last, and the reveal (which maybe I should have seen coming) of his relationship with his neighbor being entirely in his head worked perfectly for me. I found that Phoenix’s impeccable acting made him vulnerable, and his backstory made him sympathetic, and the masterful music score reinforced both. I believe this will be as well regarded as the dark knight. That’s great! Nothing wrong with liking the movie. I don’t disagree with you that Phoenix and the score are fantastic. Cinema is subjective, and we simply diverged in opinion here. I think the movie just went over your head. Anyone who doesn’t give this film a positive review is uncultured swine. This is high art; not a happy, children’s comedy, Marvel movie. Treat yourself to a juice box and some fruit snacks and let the adults take it from here. Send in the clowns. Black Panther proved? Yes, I’m sure a film underlined with many memes is such a great example of what a movie should be pertain too. Also, may I include that many people believed the Black Panther shouldn’t have won, but due to negative reviews of the oscars and it’s exclusivity towards certain race groups is what got the Oscar handed to them. Their are many versions of the joker, and I respect yours, but I believe some people don’t mind this gritty dark side that’s revealed. It’s actually gives a sense of reality instead of some marvelous DC or Marvel depicted character with 3/10 movie rating like captain marvel. It might also be that some people are tired of seeing the same depicted bad guy like Loki. I believe this movie wasn’t intended to sympathize and idolize a bad guy, but to shed light and understand the tragedies certain individuals go threw, and in today’s society recognize and understand the signs for whatever that may be. And reading other reviews from this movie, other people can certainly relate with the prejudices society has unto itself. Is it family friendly? No, but should a director change his vision just to fit certain people into this category? Absolutely not. With that being said I don’t understand why a movie must meet comic book requirements when comic movies themselves are way off.  And if people don’t like it, they can create their own movie. Problem solved. I am not saying every movie should have to like Black Panther. I want a wide variety of different comic book movies. I am saying explicitly draping your movie in the aesthetics of another beloved filmmaker in an attempt to be deemed “real art” as if comics books aren’t is limiting and demeaning to the form. Also, Black Panther didn’t win Best Picture. It was nominated and won some technical awards. But considering you seem to think it was nominated because of “race groups” and go on to deride Captain Marvel out of nowhere, I don’t exactly take your opinion seriously. Lol I agree this post is lame and i also loved the movie.  I thought it was brilliant.  This was the first negative review that came from the critics column on Flixter app.  I decided to read it and am leaving with the impression that anyone can be a critic.  I’ll file this review under the same categorie as those amazon reviews that flag a solid product as a 1 star because the shippent was late a few hours.   The audience reviews is where its at. I never said you couldn’t like the movie. You are entitled to your opinion, as I am to mine. The fact you admit you found my review by clicking on the first negative one you saw on Flixster proves a point: you are purposefully looking for negative criticism. Plus, dismissing me by saying “anyone can be a critic” and then saying audience reviews are better is somewhat of an oxymoron, ain’t it? It’s a shame to hear, I was looking forward to this movie thinking it may buck the trend on terrible DC movies. I will of course see it myself and make my own mind up. I love the Joker as a character but I find the way he is almost idolised is disturbing, the same way Walter White in breaking bad.  I enjoyed Man of Steel, yet I think that was the only I did enjoy of the DCU. I turned Suicide Squad off after an hour (I’m cautiously optimistic for Suicide Squad 2 given the director.) I also turned Justice League off after twenty minutes.  This is a joke of a review. You sure you saw the movie? Your review was so interesting that I feel asleep halfway.
I would appreciate you if I could find atleast one worthy reply to your review here complementing it. Also, I don’t do this because I want to be unanimously agreed with. I do this because I want to share my opinion. I’m not some mindless troll who has to agree with their tribe and hate on everyone who disagrees with me. Or is that how things work on your planet? If I delete, they’d just call me a coward or say I’m “silencing” them. I let them stand to demonstrate the ridiculousness of the trolling, and I comment to put their words in context and show them up for the fools they are. It’s hard, but it’s how I roll. Any way. I watched the movie and I do say it was one of the best movies I have seen lately. For the time span of some 2 hrs, the movie was very well made. Joaquin Phoenix did a very good job with his acting which is worth every appreciation. The direction was good.
The movie clearly depicts how dark and unethical our world has become which I feel is apt in today’s scenario. The character ‘Arthur’ has given well to go messages through out the movie on different aspects of Human’s sinister behaviour, whether it be through himself or be it through other characters.
The movie wasn’t about the ‘Hero’ Joker or a character on whom we are supposed to sympathize on, it’s about the rise of Joker. How various traumas in his life, starting from his childhood turned his the way he now is.
I feel every movie is different on its own and so is this one. I don’t understand thrashing a movie just by comparing it with some other movies or with directorial factors. Your rating of 4/10 just because you found some meek dislikes doesn’t justify the fact that you are a ‘Critic’.
Some ‘poor excuse to be a movie’ movies have better ratings one of the best examples being ‘Captain Marvel’. You are literally criticising me for doing my job. It isn’t my duty to like a movie. It is to give my honest opinion. You disagree? Great! Stop trying to explain to me why I am wrong. You are not going to bully me into suddenly liking it. If you don’t like what I had to say, you can leave it and find plenty of other critics who do agree with you. 4/10 is hardly a terrible score; it simply means bad but with bright spots. No one dictates what I score a movie except me, and I think 4 is fair.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 5, 2019"," The supervillainous character created in 1940 by Bill Finger, Bob Kane and Jerry Robinson has always had a scary mystique, although he tends to appear in movies without any kind of backstory, because that would detract from his freaky mystery. In the camp Batman TV series and film from the 60s (with Cesar Romero) and the recent Suicide Squad (with Jared Leto), the Joker is an established menace, while in The Dark Knight (with the late lamented Heath Ledger, naturally) he just appears from the shadows. Only Jack Nicholson’s Joker in Tim Burton’s Batman gets close to the character’s usually accepted origins, with his betrayed mobster falling into a vat of chemicals. But that’s not how it all happens in this psychodrama from co-writer, co-producer and director Todd Phillips (The Hangover), as we open in what looks like a grimy, scuzzy late 70s in Gotham City – shot on the grunged-up streets of New Jersey and New York. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) works as a clown and entertains ambitions to be a comedian, but he’s a fragile guy and evidently has a background in self-harm and institutionalisation. Heavily medicated, Arthur cares for his frail Mom Penny (Frances Conroy from TV’s Six Feet Under) and grows increasingly obsessed with Murray Franklin, a Johnny Carson-like TV talk show host played (with surprising restraint) by Robert De Niro. And yes, the roles are reversed from Martin Scorsese’s The King Of Comedy, in which it was De Niro’s Rupert Pupkin who idolised a talk show host (played by Jerry Lewis), but Scorsese is also evoked as things grow seriously Taxi Driver-esque and Arthur starts to lose his already tenuous grip on reality. However, you might too after all the mocking, bashing, humiliation and general abuse, during which Phoenix allows us to see him at his most grotesque and abject. He cries, bleeds, dribbles, contorts his rubbery gob, frequently reveals his emaciated physique (and icky Y-fronts), winces in pain (or is it eventual ecstasy?) and keeps breaking down in fits of maniacal laughter due to an uncontrollable neurological condition. It looks like Arthur is simply going to flip out and become a standard bad guy, recruit a few dispensable goons and dash off to be an evil influence in and around Gotham but, somewhat controversially, he instead starts an uprising and becomes a kind of revolutionary figure. And it’s here that Phillips’ film is at its most dangerous, with Arthur/Joker inspiring – or radicalising – Gotham’s poor into violent action. Although, of course, amid the riots and flames we can plainly see that they’re all men. But, then again, perhaps all the moral concerns about this one are nullified by the fact that, in the end, despite its smash-the-state/rise-of-the-dispossessed edges, and no matter how much Phillips, Phoenix and the DC/Warner Brothers corporate brains trust want it to be some profound examination of masculine malaise, this too is just a comic book movie.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 5, 2019"," It’s the role of a lifetime. Indeed in the past, screen legends such as Jack Nicholson and the late lamented Heath Ledger have portrayed the DC Comics super-villain (in Batman, 1989 and The Dark Knight, 2008, respectively) to rapturous acclaim. Now Joaquin Phoenix, unarguably one of the finest actors of the current generation, steals the thunder from his predecessors in this standalone reinvention of the titular anti-hero. Director Todd Phillips conveys such command over the medium that it’s difficult to accept that this is the same man who made the execrable The Hangover trilogy (2009-2013). Happily, Hollywood still springs an occasional pleasant surprise. Disregarded and brutalised by a society on the brink of chaos, the mentally-ill Arthur eventually morphs into the Clown Prince of Crime known as Joker. After a somewhat subdued opening segment, in which Phoenix too is unduly mannered, the narrative gains momentum and descends into a maelstrom of grotesque violence. Drawing upon the work of the movie brat generation of the post-1970s, the director particularly references such Martin Scorsese classics as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Incidentally, in a clever bit of role reversal, Robert De Niro is cast as a TV talk-show host like the one played in the latter film by Jerry Lewis. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a truly miraculous, awards-worthy performance in the title role.",POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019"," It’s when a movie is not just a movie that the whole idea of film is at its best, and also at its sewer-muck, junkyard-inferno, snakes-in-moats worst. So god bless and, seriously, just go to hell with Joker.  This is one of those special, ghastly, insightful cases where criticism becomes warfare, fandom is assault, and discourse is a meaningless cacophony. It’s meaningless in that, as you ping-pong from extreme opinion and flash hot take to concerned safety warning and vehement defense, you’re no closer to gleaning an answer to what should be a very fair and simple question: Should you see the damn film?  Joker has earned polarizing reviews, extreme on both ends, but much praise for Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. In the same news cycle in which the film stunned the industry by winning the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, critics warned that its content might actually be dangerous, arguing that it glorifies the ethos of angry loners, disaffected white men, and “incels” (so-called involuntary celibates) proliferating in the country’s mass shooting epidemic.  Vanity Fair wrote that the film may be “irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes.” Police forces around the country have publicly stated that they’ve beefed up security at opening weekend screenings. Critics against the idea that violent cinema begets violent action retaliated against this “overreaction.” Fans eager to see the film decried yet another blizzard of “snowflakes” trying to sanitize culture.  One side screams. The other screams back louder. The volume of the cacophony is thrilling, insinuating that something important is going on. But in the end, it’s an unpleasant distraction. No actual point is made. You may find it provocative, or you may find it insufferable. You may find it intellectually ludicrous and philosophically empty, but still be impressed by Phoenix. Both things can be true. (And kind of are.) That the film has become this line in the sand when it comes to “where we stand as a culture” is the real danger. Maybe we need a self-examination. This film, of all films, ain’t the one to trigger it.  The single most annoying thing about all this has been the comments made by writer-director Todd Phillips, whom you probably know best from the Hangover franchise and Old School, in response to criticism.  “Woke culture,” however you might define it, isn’t cancelling or stopping comedy, or banning irreverence or edginess. As my eyes go cross-eyed seeing the number of zeroes attached to the comedy deals being made with multiple streaming and cable services, I’d say the industry is booming. So is the interrogation of that industry.  That interrogation, sure, is amplified and perhaps not always as nuanced as it needs to be thanks to social media. But as any industry grows, so does the consideration of the value of its output, and what responsibility accompanies its surge.  If a person truly loved comedy, as Phillips purports to, then this should be something they welcome: true refining and consideration of their art form meant to better it, not get rid of it. That this refining and consideration is happening in real time, thanks to the blogosphere and social media, is fascinating. That these arenas give voice to previously marginalized groups whose voices, opinions, and criticisms had been silenced—and this is the reaction we’re seeing to their voices finally having a platform—is telling.  For what it’s worth, I’d say the straight white man who made the Hangover trilogy should have no hardship getting another comedy made in Hollywood. For all the hand-wringing over the responsibility of a film like Joker, there is no doubt that it will draw blockbuster crowds this weekend, something that will give him more opportunity and more creative license. What he seems uninterested in doing, based on these comments, is making an effort to evolve.  As critic Louis Virtel said on Twitter, “‘Comedy got hard because people are smarter now’ is a fun way to tell on yourself.” From my vantage point, the issue isn’t cancel culture or woke culture or PC culture. It is creators who only want their work to be applauded and celebrated, not discussed and dissected. That is not culture at all.  The Joker discourse is so exhausting because everyone thinks they’re doing something different, something renegade, something disruptive here. But it’s the same old song over and over again, a cultural record scratch. Send in the clowns, the clowns, the clowns, the clowns.... In 2012 when I was working for The Atlantic’s website as an entertainment writer, my boss went out of town and I was in charge of editing and posting the regular columns (we called them blogs then). When my editor returned a week later, she was disturbed to receive an email from one of those columnists with the subject line: “We need to talk about Kevin.” She was aghast. What could her baby gay protegee Kevin Fallon possibly have done?  Turns out the writer was filing a story about the film starring Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller, which was soon to be released. It was not an extremely fun time to be named Kevin, given the fact that the Kevin in the film was a disturbed teenager who commits mass murder at his school. You’d be surprised how many people would find ways to joke about that, somehow mocking my name and the film title.  That first Atlantic email, however, was a beautiful, innocent, hilarious mistake. We eventually memorialized it in a fake article for the website, terrified the entire time that we’d accidentally activate it.  I was reminded of that story this week after receiving a confusing email myself, one with the phrase “Kevin Can F**k Himself” in the subject line. AMC has apparently greenlit a new series with that very title. Looks like my trolls finally landed a development deal. (Hey-o!) According to a press release, the series “probes the secret life of a type of woman we all grew up believing we knew: the sitcom wife,” and “looks to break television convention and ask what the world looks like through her eyes.” This is JUST FANTASTIC when you’re reminded of a little bit of showbiz absurdity from two years ago.  There was another “Kevin” show, Kevin Can Wait, starring Kevin James and Erinn Hayes. At the end of the first season, Hayes’ character was unceremoniously killed off the show. When I say unceremoniously, I mean the only time her death is acknowledged is when a coupon flyer addressed to her is sent to the house. James went on record to say that the decision was made because they were “literally just running out of ideas” for the character. Plight of the wife.  To catch you up: In a viral video from earlier this summer, it was revealed that Gwyneth Paltrow did not know she appeared in the film Spider-Man: Homecoming. In a viral video from this week, Paltrow herself revealed that she also never saw it after it came out. There is such a purity to this level of being out-of-touch that I find it as endearing and adorable as I do incorrigible.  The finest, most affecting stage performance I’ve seen on the Broadway stage was Cynthia Erivo’s turn as Celie in The Color Purple revival. Sometimes reviews are subjective opinions. Sometimes they’re just plain facts. Erivo’s unparalleled talent, on display in that production: Fact.  Anyway, she was just cast as Aretha Franklin in the new season of National Geographic’s Genius series, which is another fact: Perfect casting. Look what God has done.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Joker is on the surface the origin of a supervillain but more subtly an exploration of empathy and the personal impact of a society devoid of it. As Joker gets grimmer and descends further into bloody violence, it becomes little more than a horror show, bludgeoning its viewers out of any chance at insight. It’s certainly worth seeing for Phoenix, whose mournful eyes and choking laugh perfectly embody his character’s lifelong query: “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” A movie with the message this one hammers home again and again… feels too volatile, and frankly too scary, to separate from the very real violence committed by young men like Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in America almost every day. Indeed, this is not a movie that feels remotely invested in expanding the DC comic universe. It feels perversely stand-alone, befitting its anti-hero, the most alienated screen loner since Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle. That would be Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a guy who lives on the edge of destitution, both spiritual and economic. He cares for his bedridden mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in a slummy apartment. When he’s not meeting with social workers, or walking the rainy, garbage-strewn streets of Gotham City, he works as a clown for hire. He also aspires to be a standup comedian, dreaming of the day he might appear with the host of his favourite talk show, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). (This plot point is an overt nod to Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, which starred De Niro as the pathetic would-be comedian. It is one of many nods to classic Scorsese in particular, and grungy ‘70s films in general.) But fortune smiles not on emaciated Arthur. One problem: he’s as creepy as hell, afflicted in particular with an involuntary manic laugh that possesses him at the worst possible moments. Yet hope rests with a single mom-neighbour, Sophie (Zazie Beetz) who is mysteriously not repulsed by Arthur’s attention. Things spin out of control when Arthur is spurred to commit a vigilante act of violence on a subway car. Arthur is driven ever more to the edge as he starts investigating his past, which may be tied to a certain wealthy Gotham City family. From these ghastly beginnings will come… the Clown Prince of Crime. Director Todd Phillips, who co-scripted Joker with Scott Silver, may have a kinship with the title character. Phillips made his bones in comedy (The Hangover, Road Trip) but one can assume over time the man’s sense of humour soured. (We can all agree Hangover 3 put that writing on the wall.) In radically changing course, one has to admire how Phillips takes extraordinary, unprecedented liberty with the genre. This is a grim, gritty and entirely unique depiction of madness. The sheer grunge of the thing is impressive, especially in the context of the comic book movie, which is usually more visually antiseptic. Phoenix is down for it all. The Joker has always invited a certain operatic approach by actors who embrace the character’s inherent theatricality. Phoenix commits to the character’s tragic origins with startling feeling. In advance of opening, the film endured some consternation about Arthur/Joker coming off as some kind of incel messiah, a potential rallying point for sociopaths. But he’s no more a hero than Norman Bates or Patrick Bateman. The fact he ends up attracting a following in the movie is dismayingly credible in an era when the United States lives under the dark shadow of a personality cult. From a purely practical standpoint, the more serious problem with the character is that the Joker is… um, not terribly bright. He can barely spell. Where does he get the traction to become a future master criminal without even a semblance of outlaw guile? In the greater DC universe, he bears no connection to, say, Jack Nicholson’s canny hoodlum-gone-psycho in Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) or Jared Leto’s best-forgotten sado-masochist punk from Suicide Squad (2016). One guesses Phillips is trying to draw a line between Arthur and Heath Ledger’s Joker from The Dark Knight (2008) as the ultimate nihilist — as Michael Caine so astutely described him: a man who just wants to watch the world burn. Phoenix’s take on the character, whose scars are all on the inside, might explain how a person gets that way. Beyond that, it’s best to watch Joker under the assumption it’s a one-off. An expensive, risky, impossibly gloomy one-off.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Arthur Fleck trata de recuperar el aliento. Sus intentos por respirar normalmente se mezclan con los restos de uno de esos tantos ataques de risa que lo han metido en muchos problemas. Con la mirada clavada en el suelo, de pronto descubre que sus manos están llenas de sangre. Los ojos de este hombre atormentado se abren como nunca antes lo habían hecho. Algo ha cambiado en él. Sus brazos y piernas comienzan a moverse como parte de una macabra coreografía. El baile termina con sus brazos extendidos y su rostro mirando hacia el cielo. Ahí, frente a nosotros, el Joker se presenta al mundo. Y lo hace como siempre lo habíamos imaginado: cubierto de sangre, con una mirada delirante y una sonrisa demoniaca.  El primer acto oficial del Joker ha terminado. Y como espectadores, no podemos más que estremecernos por lo que nuestros ojos acaban de presenciar. Todo ha cambiado también para nosotros. Ya no estamos en una Ciudad Gótica donde el crimen hace de las suyas de vez en cuando. Donde, a pesar de todo, es posible vivir bien. Ahora, la urbe que nos rodea es la versión más sórdida de sí misma que habíamos conocido hasta ahora.  Como si una montaña rusa que desciende a lo más mundano de la humanidad, la pelse vuelve más incómodo a cada momento. “¿Soy yo o el mundo se ha vuelto más loco?”, pregunta un Arthur Fleck cada vez más lejano al que conocimos al inicio. Este hombre, incapaz de aguantar una carcajada, ya no se reprime más. Si antes luchaba por aguantar esa risa incontenible que incomodaba a muchos, ahora parece no importarle las consecuencias de su felicidad y de esa «estabilidad emocional» que tanto anhelaba.  “Me parece importante que una industria que se preocupa por los negocios tomara el riesgo de hacer esta película. Está hecha para la taquilla, pero que es una reflexión sobre los antihéroes y en donde el enemigo no es un hombre, es el sistema”. Así dijo la destacada cineasta Lucrecia Martel al darle a Guasón el León de Oro en Venecia.  Inspirado en los pasajes oscuros de la cinematografía de los años 70. Sobre todo los filmados por Martin Scorsese. Así, el responsable de sagas como ¿Qué pasó ayer? o Starsky & Hutch coescribe un guion con Scott Silver, autor de filmes como El peleador (2010) o 8 Mile: Calle de ilusiones (2002). Su libertad sólo había sido vista en la trilogía dirigida por Christopher Nolan de 2002 a 2012. Aquí, sin embargo, el rumbo tomado resulta mucho más incómodo y desolador. Uno como el que sólo se había visto en el mundo de los cómics o en los filmes animados inspirados en estos personajes.  Llevar esa maldad del papel a la pantalla grande sólo podía construirse con los elementos cinematográficos que Joker presume de principio a fin. Aquí la fotografía de Lawrence Sher –que a ratos se mete al caos de su historia y luego prefiere mantenerse alejada de la acción– se mezclan a la perfección con las cuerdas estridentes del score compuesto por la islandesa Hildur Guðnadóttir. Ella ya había musicalizado nuestras pesadillas en producciones como la ganadora del Emmy Chernobyl.  Estos elementos consolidan un camino que avanza peligrosamente en la delgada línea fronteriza entre la cordura y la apología del crimen, con el uso de la violencia como única escapatoria de un mundo cada vez más despiadado. Y ahí, en medio de esa locura, se encuentra un Joaquin Phoenix que brilla como siempre y que hace de toda esta oscuridad su mejor reflector. La maestría con la que el nominado al Oscar se desenvuelve en este personaje –imposible de comparar con el resto de su filmografía camaleónica e impecable– se atreve a señalar todas aquellas cosas que, como sociedad, llevamos haciendo mal desde hace años.  Ese descenso al infierno que va trazando Joker recae enteramente en sus hombros. En esas carcajadas cada vez más incómodas, que pasan de sacarle lágrimas de dolor a permitirle sonreír de forma cada vez más estremecedora e inhumana. La transformación de Arthur Fleck al enigmático Joker termina siendo una cubetada de agua helada para el espectador. Porque lo que vemos en la pantalla ha dejado de ser parte de un universo de ficción para convertirse en un reflejo de la realidad.  ¿Qué tanto puede Guasón glorificar la violencia y el uso de la ira en un mundo, en una realidad en la que ambos elementos forman parte de nuestro ADN? ¿Qué tanto el filme es responsable de todas aquellas cosas que han existido desde siempre, como el fácil acceso a las armas de alto calibre en EE. UU., o la falta de apoyo y oportunidades para quienes padecen alguna enfermedad mental? El cine, desde luego, transforma realidades y modifica la forma de pensar de sus espectadores, pero jamás será responsable de los errores que la humanidad –y específicamente EE.UU.– ha cometido a lo largo de su historia. Si de algo debiera ser responsable el filme de Todd Phillips o la actuación de Joaquin Phoenix, quizás sería aprovechar la libertad creativa y la exposición de un estudio tan grande como Warner para atreverse a incomodar a los espectadores.  Si el Guasón fuera una persona real, y el filme de Todd Phillips se tratara de un documental basado en la vida de alguien que existe en nuestra vida, estaría sumamente complacido por la locura que ha desatado en el mundo su llegada a los cines. Porque todo lo que ha ocurrido desde aquel León de Oro –y seguramente hasta el final de la temporada de premios– es únicamente obra de un agente del caos, capaz de transformar una sonrisa inocente en el gesto más inhumano.

"Oct 4, 2019"," Guasón es la más reciente entrega de Todd Phillips, cuya filmografía está llena de altibajos: de las mediocridades de Starsky & Hutch (2004) a las medianías de Amigos de armas (War Dogs, 2016) a las maravillas de ¿Qué pasó ayer? (The Hangover, 2009). Ahora da cuenta de las miserias de Arthur Fleck (Joquin Phoenix), un hombre de mediana edad que se ocupa de su anciana madre y se gana la vida como payaso. Después de una serie de desgracias responde a la hostilidad ambiente con el personaje epónimo. Y su debut es en horario estelar. Phillips propone un discreto trabajo de cámara. Ésta evita todo lucimiento y se convierte en un testigo atento, en un acompañante de Fleck. Por otra parte, los resultados en la puesta en escena son notables: la luz de Lawrence Sher –cinefotógrafo de cabecera del realizador–, las escenografías, vestuarios y maquillajes dan cuenta de las diferencias sociales, de los abismos económicos, pero también construyen un ambiente de sordidez (evita, eso sí, disgustar al que mira, y si, por ejemplo, los noticieros hablan de ratas gigantes que asolan la ciudad, éstas nunca se ven). Es ocioso hablar de la actuación de Phoenix, sobre la cual por todos lados hay una avalancha de elogios (no obstante, si el primero comentario sobre una película es la actuación, creo que nos quedamos en la superficie… y algo no funciona en la película). Tan sólo subrayaría que su desempeño está anunciado en su filmografía previa y en este caso es natural la exacerbación: la mayor parte de los personajes a los que dan vida manifiestan particularidades mentales y comportamientos atípicos; el desgaste físico es habitualmente notorio; creo que el actor se ha convertido en el personaje. En la banda sonora se expande el campo de batalla emocional, con enrarecidos ambientes y las músicas de la islandesa Hildur Guðnadóttir y algunas canciones que sirven para hacer hincapié en asuntos relacionados con la locura y la risa; entre otras, “White Room” de Cream. Phillips entrega, para empezar, un melodrama a carta cabal: carga a su protagonista de una serie de desgracias que traen a la mente los hitos del género. Hace de Fleck un completo desecho (huérfano, abandonado, engañado, despreciado, maltratado, violentado; un ser humano a quien no le queda ninguna ilusión, pero sí un propósito) para hacer una crítica social: a la indiferencia ambiente, a los ricos, al Estado, que en este caso deja de proveer asistencia psiquiátrica. Esboza un estudio de caso sobre una patología, pero mantiene al espectador en zona segura: el cineasta concibe una cinta que por momentos echa mano de cierta ambigüedad, pero evita llevarnos a la mente del criminal potencial y luego en funciones, pues si bien deja algunas cosas en el aire, se esmera en construir una objetiva claridad: no vaya a ser que el espectador salga de la sala confuso por no entender lo que realmente pasa y lo que está en la mente del personaje. Si bien explica los síntomas de la enfermedad de Fleck, sus reacciones a menudo parecen forzadas. El dispositivo –y la presencia de Robert De Niro, quien da vida a un personaje secundario pero importante– tiende puentes con el Taxi Driver (1976) de Martin Scorsese. Pero Phillips no apuesta por la sutileza (ni en lo moral ni en lo formal). Así, echa mano de un maniqueísmo poco plausible y hace de Thomas Wayne un malo de telenovela que sospechosa y oportunamente se parece demasiado a Donald Trump: rico y soberbio, con ambiciones políticas y una inocultable megalomanía. Phillips da voz –y risa– a los que viven al margen. Deja ver cómo la masa está enojada y se suma sin pensar a cualquier postura que se enfrente al sistema, incluso cuando quien la encabeza no tiene ninguna intención en ese sentido: ¿en estos tiempos los líderes de opinión no tienen una verdadera opinión? Muestra cómo es fácil que el coraje se traduzca en destrucción, que la felicidad, hoy día obligatoria y no alcanzada, se traduzca en frustración. Todo esto es más bien una demostración, y un tanto simplista, porque tampoco se exploran a fondo los mecanismos sociales que llevan a ello. Al final me parece que este Guasón –que resulta ser un moralista que comenta que nadie se preocupa por el otro, que manifiesta su dolor frente al monumental egoísmo actual, que hace ver, cual Sartre de Gotham, que el infierno son los otros– se queda corto como agente del caos: porque tiene una razón, una historia, una explicación, una causa… pero no una voluntad. A diferencia del Guasón de Nolan, que sí tiene la voluntad caótica, se mantiene en la ambigüedad y es pura gratuidad. Y si bien la cinta de Phillips cierra bastante bien y genera cierta inquietud, nada es más inquietante que el vacío al que Nolan nos encara. Diste en el clavo: «el actor es el personaje», la actuación por la actuación; al fin y al cabo el personaje es un payaso. Pero no encuentro natural su exacerbación. Es el abuso del renombre y la reputación de Phoenix y de nuestra expectativa.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," ¿De verdad vamos a ponernos a discutir sobre si Joker es una película reaccionaria o todo lo contrario? ¿De verdad queremos ver discursos progresistas o feministas en las actuales cintas de superhéroes de Marvel o DC? ¿No es más interesante centrarnos en la gama de grises, en las contradicciones y ambigüedades que aparecen en las historias de Batman, Superman, Spiderman, X-Men y, ahora, El Joker, como ocurrió en los cómics de Linterna Verde y Flecha Verde de los años setenta urdidos por Dennis O’Neil y Neil Adams? ¿No nos explicaron muy bien Frank Miller y Alan Moore las paradojas del héroe y las del villano (la eterna historia de las dos caras de la misma moneda) en aquel enfrentamiento entre Daredevil y Bullseye titulado Ruleta rusa, cortesía de Miller –que no es precisamente un tipo con conciencia izquierdista–, y en la novela gráfica La broma asesina, una de las obras maestras incuestionables de Moore y génesis de todos los tratamientos de la figura de El Joker que han aparecido desde 1988? ¿Vamos a viajar en el tiempo hasta mediados de los cincuenta, cuando La invasión de los ladrones de cuerpos de Don Siegel fue saludada por igual como una película contra la caza de brujas y un alegato anticomunista? Los miserables, el reciente (y excelente) film de Ladj Ly ambientado en un violento 'banlieue' de París, tiene un final parecido al de Joker y, sin embargo, no se han esparcido por las páginas de las revistas y periódicos y por las redes más “inquietas” comentarios sobre si esa apología final del caos es fascista? ¿Va a resultar que el desenlace de Joker, con el villano de la eterna sonrisa y el pelo verde instigando una revuelta callejera no muy distinta a las organizadas tras el caso de violencia policial sobre Rodney King en 1992, puede iniciar un decenio de violencia social? ¿Ya nadie recuerda lo que pasó en Reino Unido después del estreno de La naranja mecánica y cómo su director, Stanley Kubrick, retiró la película de circulación cansado de que dijeran que su filme instigaba a la violencia en las calles? ¿O es una maniobra más de 'marketing' para que vaya más gente a verla, algo posiblemente innecesario porque ya es la película del año más allá de su coronación en Venecia (sorprendente, hay que decirlo, sobre todo con un jurado presidido por la muy íntegra Lucrecia Martel) con el León de Oro? ¿O quizá deberíamos pensar que ese premio no le ha hecho mucho bien, ya que pese a no ser un filme de superhéroes, no deja de pertenecer al ecosistema DC, y que una película sobre el villano más peligroso de Gotham City sea refrendada en uno de los festivales “serios” más importante y tenga a más del setenta por ciento de los críticos (entre los que me incluyo) a favor, no deja de resultar incómodo, vamos, como si El Caballero Oscuro de Christopher Nolan se hubiera presentado a concurso en Cannes y le hubieran dado la Palma de Oro? Son tantas las preguntas, la mayoría extracinematográficas, y tan rotundas, creo, las respuestas, que todo esto debería ser innecesario. Pero no lo es. Se ha abierto la veda y en tiempos perversos en la sociedad y la política estadounidense, todo, incluida la conversión de un tipo antisocial que solo desea hacer reír a los demás y acaba convertido en villano maquiavélico e instructor de un apocalipsis social, se mira con lupa de aumento. El Joker facturado por Todd Phillips –y por Joaquin Phoenix en un trabajo realmente estupendo y lleno de matices que hereda muchas cosas del de Heath Ledger en El Caballero Oscuro y filtra otras del realizado por Jack Nicholson en el Batman de Tim Burton: nada, por supuesto, del bufonesco César Romero de la teleserie 'kitsch' y 'camp' de los sesenta– es un drama contenido, pese a lo que cuenta y las características estridentes del personaje, sobre la incapacidad de relacionarse y de socializar en un mundo egoísta y violento. Con otra máscara que no fuera la de El Joker, el personaje sería visto quizá de otro modo. Phillips lo ha colocado en una tesitura similar a la del Travis Bickle creado por Scorsese y De Niro –quien repite aquí como mediático 'showman' televisivo– en Taxi Driver, un filme realizado en la época en la que más o menos acontece Joker. No es casualidad. La América hiperbólica de Trump puede reflejarse en aquella (la de Nixon, después la de Reagan) pero con más miedo a lo que verdaderamente puede ocurrir. Joker es un reflejo de muchos tiempos –no olvidemos que fue creado por Bob Kane en plena Segunda Guerra Mundial como némesis de Batman, y que la conciencia oscura del justiciero de Gotham empieza a forjarse cuando las imágenes del filme de Phillips empiezan a declinar– y, sobre todo, un síntoma de nuestro tiempo.",POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019","Joker is certainly an interesting and worthy experiment, bringing a dark, unrelenting nihilism to a genre that's built on morality.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ Joker is the most radical film released by a major studio since Fight Club in 1999. In fact, I find it amazing that Phillips was allowed pretty much free reign for what amounts to the most shocking and disturbing film based on a comic book. And here’s what you may find the most disturbing, that Joker is relatable because just like Arthur Fleck, we all have negative thoughts sometimes. We all face bullies in some form. And we all struggle in some way just to get by and hold onto some form of sanity in this increasingly crazy world. So when we first meet Arthur working his job as a clown, we actually feel sympathy for him. But when Arthur’s negative thoughts come to gruesome fruition, that’s when that sympathy turns to revulsion and Fleck is reborn as the murderous clown we know from the comics, graphic novels and other incarnations of the character in movies, animation and on TV. This is a bias article full of subjectivity. The film brought nothing new to the table. What they should have done was just adapt The Killing Joke and made that into a film. Joaquin Phoenix was not the right person for this role either because if I wanted to see him revealing sadness and despair I would have watch The Master or if I want to see some comedy I’ll would have watch Inherent Vice instead and that’s another film that disappointed me. I was expecting more out of it and the only good part of the film were visuals and the third act and that’s it. I suffer from psychotic depression  myself and could identify myself with Joker .I found watching him in this movie deeply therapeutic.
Mr Phoenix’s performance was brilliant and he deserves Oscar for this. We’ll be hitting the bumps, you’ll be hitting the slumps. Bro, you and a very small percentage hate this movie and i find it amusing. Amusing how people choose to hate on a movie that tackles a very sensitive topic. Todd and everyone did beyond amazing for how serious the topic is. Some find it therapeutic because they know what it’s like to have a REAL mental illness, and for some bum to come along and trash on a movie, you must be one of those who cant handle the truth, cant handle the real world. How about another rant mark? Hard to believe that this is the same guy who was able to convince us for a couple of hours that he was the legendary Johnny Cash in the movie “I WALK THE LINE”……That seems so long ago that I had forgotten what a truly gifted actor this guy really is…as much as I loved Heath Ledger there is no doubt that this performance is the new gold standard. A corporate-tentpole-franchise movie is still a corporate tentpole-franchise-movie, even when it’s pretending to be an art film, and a tour-de-force performance is really not a tour-de-force performance when it possesses all of the monotony of a single low note of “dysfunction” being struck over and over again relentlessly, a vase already cracked instead of cracking, without any real
 or organic sense of gradual human disintegration other than slickly executed dance moves, external tics, and Method-like histrionics rather than Method itself (did the audience see or feel any REAL tears flow, other than “symbolically” painted-on ones?) Here is an even more pertinent issue: In 2019 Hollywood, would a mainstream studio like Warners Brothers, instead of making and releasing an imitation TAXI DRIVER, re-release the real TAXI DRIVER from 1976?  Would they re-release Terrence Malick’s BADLANDS from 1974? Or Peter Bogdanovich’s TARGETS from 1968? Richard Brook’s IN COLD BLOOD? I can assure you they would have no interest in that whatsoever. So you can make comic book homages to THE EXORCIST staircase, THE FRENCH CONNECTION subway chase, the APOCALYPSE NOW mirror dance,  the end shot of Sidney Lumet’s NETWORK, but god forbid you actually expose a younger generation to discover and appreciate the actual films from that venerated 1970’s Golden Age of art and commerce working together in rare harmony. Hey anonymous. You make some valid arguments. Taxi Driver was actually rereleased in theaters in 2015 through Fathom Events and received a wide release. I watched Taxi Driver with my son (he’s over 18 and has great taste in movies) in a nearly empty theater unfortunately. I wish there was a wider market for classic films, but the truth is that mainstream audiences don’t care all that much for films more than 5 years old. And just try getting someone to watch a black and white movie. In any case, thanks for reading my review and your comment. You’re spot on Chris. I’m not a comic book movie junkie, admittedly I’ve seen probably 25% of the latest comic book movies and have been entertained no more though then an episode of Impractical Jokers, what we have here is Fight Clubesqe, yet where in Fight Club we learn later we’re dealing with mental illness… here we know from the first 3 minutes of the Joker it’s mental illness. Beautiful movie… beautifully shot… so many scenes where my eyes are just scanning the screen I can’t name them all. I loved it!!! The Joker is one of the most legendary comic book characters ever created; the DC Comics villain has been Batman’s long-running nemesis since his first... One thing that I can confidently say about Aquaman is that it tries really hard not to disappoint. I mean, this movie really goes for it! In...

"Oct 4, 2019"," De la noche a la mañana, Todd Phillips dejó de ser el hombre detrás de la trilogía de ¿Qué pasó ayer? para convertirse en uno de los directores más respetados del cine, al dejar en claro que además de dirigir o producir comedias sosas y ligeras, puede llevar al espectador a viajes emocionales y sicológicos profundos gracias a lo que hizo en Guasón, cinta que dejó boquiabiertos a más de uno en la pasada Mostra de Venecia al alzarse con el León de Oro, máxima presea del certamen. Mucho de ese gran logro como director se lo debe, sin duda, al tres veces nominado al Oscar, Joaquin Phoenix, quien entrega una de las mejores actuaciones de su carrera al interpretar a Arthur Fleck, un hombre en apariencia normal que trata de salir adelante todos los días en un ambiente poco favorable, plagado de violencia, injusticias y bullying, en un contexto en el que la sociedad lo tacha de extraño y lo señala a la menor provocación. La presión externa e interna le obligan a poner muy buena cara y a aguantar todo lo malo, pero hacen que un día ese personaje, con tintes de Travis Bickle en Taxi Driver, explote y saque su lado sicópata. Con distintas lecturas sobre la corrupción, la miseria, la violencia y el bullying es inevitable pensar en una de las frases del filme en la que se plantea qué pasa cuando dejas solo a un enfermo mental con una sociedad que lo humilla y pisotea. Guasón dará mucho de qué hablar y seguramente estará nominado en los Premios Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019",All the positive things you've heard about [Joaquin Phoenix] as the Joker are true. He is absolutely fantastic... That performance alone is worth the price of admission.,POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Three-time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix's compelling performance fuels the atypical origin story ""Joker,"" but it can't quite push the leaden crime drama to cinematic greatness. Directed by Todd Phillips (""The Hangover"" films), the story still ties into Batman lore, but the script from Phillips and Scott Silver (""The Fighter"") isn't drawn from a particular comic book and eliminates the fantastical superhero trappings. Although a time period is never specified, the gritty character study looks to be set in the 1970s in fictional Gotham City, which is plagued with familiar real-world problems like economic inequality, social unrest and a sanitation workers strike that has left mounds of rotting garbage piled high on every sidewalk. Struggling to navigate the mean streets is Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), a low-rent clown who dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian and idolizes local late-night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur lives with and cares for his needy and delusional mother Penny (Frances Conroy), while receiving cut-rate government counseling and taking a sackful of prescriptions for an array of mental illnesses, most notably an unfortunate condition that causes him to burst into uncontrollable laughter when he is upset. Arthur's already grim reality gets worse when a gang of thugs beats him up, funding cuts eliminate his social services and his boss fires him. When a trio of sleazy stockbrokers accosts him on the subway, Arthur responds with an outburst of violence that gives him a newfound sense of power and turns him into a twisted symbol of revolution, setting him on course to become the nihilistic future nemesis of The Dark Knight. Complicated, violent and bleak, ""Joker"" makes for an effective cautionary tale, on both the individual level — it urges people to handle others with care since you can never truly know who you're dealing with — and on the societal level — with Arthur bluntly warning that if we leave mentally ill people untreated, abused and shunned, then we shouldn't be surprised if some of them become a danger not only to themselves but to others. A powerhouse actor who lost significant weight to create a hauntingly wounded character, Phoenix's riveting performance — coupled with Hildur Guðnadóttir's unsettling score — provides a vast blank canvas of potential for storytelling greatness. But ""Joker"" is overly long, thematically murky and narratively uneven, with an unnecessary ending that, like a bad greasepaint job, ruthlessly highlights the film's flaws rather than concealing them. Oscar-nominated documentarian Irene Taylor Brodsky composes a deeply personal film as well as a tuneful tribute to living with deafness in ""Moonlight Sonata: Deafness in Three Movements."" A 2019 Sundance Film Festival selection, ""Moonlight Sonata"" is essentially the sequel to her 2007 Sundance Audience Award-winning film ""Hear and Now,"" which chronicled the decision by Brodsky's parents, Paul and Sally Taylor, to get cochlear implants at age 65 after living their entire lives with deafness. But it's not necessary to see the Peabody Award-winning 2007 documentary to follow her new cinematic memoir. Although Brodsky and her siblings can all hear, she and her husband get a stark reminder that hereditary hearing loss can skip a generation when their oldest son Jonas goes deaf as a toddler and is quickly fitted with his first cochlear implants. The story picks up when Jonas, an ornery, action-packed 11-year-old taking piano lessons, becomes enamored of Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata."" He is determined to learn the piece even though his teacher warns him that it may be too difficult musically as well as emotionally for someone his age. Even as the boy's youthful enthusiasm flags and his frustration levels rise, Jonas' fascination with the iconic piece inspires his mother, who learns through her research that Beethoven composed what's formally known as ""Piano Sonata No. 14"" as he was losing his hearing. Impressionistic watercolor animations by Jordan Domont and Brian Kinkley weave Beethoven's story into the family narrative, which gains its third movement when Brodsky's father, Paul, an engineer and inventor who helped pioneer TTY telecommunications technology for deaf people, begins to experience memory loss and confusion. Intimate and engrossing, ""Moonlight Sonata"" perhaps isn't as narratively sound as it could have been. But the documentary accomplishes a fundamental goal of art by allowing us to experience other people's lives, struggles and triumphs, hopefully furthering our understanding of what it means to be deaf in a world wired for sound.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Controversy and media coverage aside, Joker is a fairly miserable origin story with a bleak, nihilistic outlook on society as a whole. It's about an hour of Joaquin Phoenix—a mentally ill, poverty stricken man—getting beaten down and abused by society, followed by an hour of him using that to justify himself doing absolutely horrible shit. It has very little to say, and its vague message is part of the reason the film has been so polarizing. In the end, Joker has succeeded in sparking chaos and riots in Gotham—a class war of sorts built upon nothing, for no reason. It is a deeply unpleasant movie. You'll walk away depressed, wondering if there's any good left in the world.  And that's exactly where a sequel—starring our hero, Batman—might make the experience of seeing Joker worth it. If Joker succeeds in one thing, it's in creating a truly visceral origin story for a villain, while building a world desperately in need of a hero. When the film ends, the Joker leaves Gotham burning. When I left the theater, I felt that despair. I really remained engrossed in the horror of Gotham and its problems—and was annoyed that this movie had nothing to say about any of them, didn't solve anything, and left me with no sense of closure. In that sense, the movie felt like a failure, desperately lacking any sort of emotional resolve. But if you think of it as the beginning of something bigger, Joker seems like a pretty powerful opening to something of a trilogy. To be clear, when asked if Robert Pattinson's Batman and Phoenix's Joker would appear in a film together, director Todd Phillips has said, ""No, definitely not."" Phillips did, however, leave the door open for a Joker of some sort to return. “Oddly, in the states, comic books are our Shakespeare it seems, and you can do many many versions of Hamlet,” Phillips said. “There will be many more Jokers, I’m sure, in the future.” So consider this. In Joker, Phoenix's character is about 30 years old. In the film, we watch as he interacts with a young Bruce Wayne of about nine or 10 years old. If Pattinson's Batman is in his 30s, that would leave Phoenix's Joker in a future movie somewhere in his 50s—closer to the actor's actual age. But if, as Phillips said, Phoenix's Joker won't appear in a future movie with Pattinson, is it possible that one of the many hordes of clowns that Arthur Fleck inspired becomes the super villain? Is Phoenix's disturbed party clown just a symbol to influence who we know as the Joker? At the end of Joker, one of the people in a clown mask, inspired by Fleck, murders Bruce's parents as they're leaving a show—echoing the real Batman origin story. Though it has become the most profitable genre in Hollywood, I’ll admit, I’m one of the few people who’s growing tired of superhero movies. And I applaud Phillips and Phoenix for making such a bold, adult film. That said, I never thought I’d find myself begging for another superhero to appear on screen. The film is set up perfectly to have a sequel that introduces Batman—Pattinson's or otherwise. And we're also primed for a very interesting and personal conflict between Batman and Joker—Phoenix's or otherwise. Without a companion movie, what are we doing here? We're simply introducing a miserable chaotic world parallel to our own with no protagonist, no hope, and nothing to really say. This isn't a character study that can stand alone in the way something like Taxi Driver (to which Joker is very indebted) can.  This is a comic book story. This is something that demands, or at least deserves, a complete emotional and narrative arc. Otherwise, we're just left stranded in Joker's hellscape, hopeless, in need of a hero. I'd hope we deserve more than that.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," ""Joker"" arrives in theaters after nabbing the Golden Lion for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival. This standalone DC origin film stars Joaquin Phoenix as the iconic villain. If “Joker” was not packaged as a DC film I might have liked it better. One of the main problems I have with the film is its inability to decide what it wants to be and I think if it was not tied to the Batman comics world — even though the connection is only tenuous and the Wayne estate should seriously consider suing for slander — it would be freer to pursue a darker and more interesting story. As it stands, the film contradicts a lot of what some fans have grown up with as canon yet it doesn’t forcefully create something new to satisfyingly take its place. It occupies an odd limbo of not really being part of the current DC cinematic universe yet not creating something new that you can imagine future stories building on.  DC has been far less successful launching a current film franchise off its famous comics than Marvel has. DC’s Christopher Reeve “Superman” film was perfection for its time and Christopher Nolan hit pay dirt with “The Dark Knight” thanks mostly to Heath Ledger’s stunning incarnation of the Joker. But recent DC films — “Wonder Woman” being the exception — just seem to be all over the place in terms of tone, style, and quality and mostly they seem humorous and weighed down by big budgets. “Joker” is at least taking a more inspired risk with its standalone effort. But the fact that it is yet again an origin story reveals a lack of confidence on DC’s part. I mean how many times do we have to see Bruce Wayne’s parents killed. There are plenty of Joker storylines both old and new that have yet to be tapped for the big screen but studios just want to play it safe and recycle already used ideas than venture out into completely new territory.  This “Joker” gives us Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, who works minimally as a clown at whatever gig he can get while he dreams of a career as a stand-up comic. He gets tormented on the street by kids, assaulted on the subway by Wall Street bullies, and picked on by co-workers. He still lives with his ailing mother and makes visits to a social worker so he can stay on his meds. But as he tells her when she asks if he is still having negative thoughts, that’s all he has are negative thoughts. Let’s face it, his life sucks. “Joker” comes close to painting an interesting and disturbing portrait of what goes into creating a white male mass shooter but shies away from committing fully to that realism or going that dark. (The film is also careful to make the victims mostly white males.) But it effectively lays out the things that can make a person feel so alienated and hopeless that he would write in a journal, “I just hope my death makes more cents than my life,” (sic). But the problem I have with the film is what’s its point? Are we meant to sympathize with Arthur? Feel his pain but just reject his choice of violence later in the film? Or agree with him that the world is so crazy that we all need to throw our hands up and embrace the violence and the chaos?  “Joker” opens in San Diego at the same time as Takashi Miike’s “First Love” and it’s interesting to see how two films both present excessive violence but how Miike’s tight control of the chaos he depicts makes his film clearer in its intent. Miike’s excess is meant to be absurd and not of the real world. But Phillips’ direction comes across as less certain. He delivers some nasty violence and the brutality is effective in rooting it in the real world. Yet it’s unclear what his point is in doing this.  Arthur is our protagonist yet he is no hero and not even an anti-hero. But there is no one who represents any contrast to him. Thomas Wayne is presenting like a kind of Trump in training — rich, out of touch with people, pretending to care about the poor while mocking their plight, and blind to the kind of bullies that work for him. On a certain level, I feel like we are meant to applaud the “kill the rich” rallying cry of the film.  A film that does not have a likable protagonist or a clear moral compass is not necessarily problematic for me. That dynamic is something Martin Scorsese excels at in films such as “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy,” a pair of films that are both heavily referenced here by Phillips. “Joker” even casts the star of those films, Robert DeNiro, in a role ripped right out of “King of Comedy” (DeNiro essentially plays a character much like the Jerry Lewis comedian). But Scorsese, like Miike, is a meticulous director and while you can debate some of his themes or methods his intent feels clear. “Taxi Driver” is chilling because the explosive violence of Travis Bickle is ironically interpreted as an act of heroism, and “King of Comedy” explores the dangerous side of obsessive fandom and the modern hunger for fifteen minutes of fame.  This raises another problem I have with the film, Arthur Fleck and Joker. To me, the Joker has always represented chaos be it the silly mayhem of Cesar Romero’s Joker in the old “Batman” TV show or Jack Nicholson’s comic anarchy in Tim Burton’s “Batman” or Heath Ledger’s scary nihilism in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight.” But Phoenix’s Fleck/Joker is just a pathetic, dim-witted child-man who accidentally causes chaos and half-heartedly thinks it’s kind of cool. It is hard to imagine this Joker ever finding the motivation to commit the kind of crimes that could make him Batman’s nemesis. He seems barely able to rise out of bed and acts as if he doesn’t have two brain cells to rub against each other to spark an idea.  There are occasional moments when he bursts out of his apathy for a sudden gust of violence but for the most part, he just floats in a haze. Perhaps my frustration is that there is enough good stuff in the film to make me see what it could have been but that’s coupled with so many missed opportunities and pretension that the ultimate feeling I left with was frustration and dissatisfaction. Phoenix is also a problematic actor for me. He’s like that little girl in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem — “when she was good she was very, very good but when she was bad she was horrid.” So he’s been brilliant in films such as “You Were Never Really Here” and “Inherent Vice” but horrid in “I’m Still Here” where he seems to channel the worst of Marlon Brando’s self-conscious ""Acting"" with a capital A pretension. Phoenix seems dedicated to playing the part and losing weight to look particularly creepy but Phillips gives him so much needless screen time to dance and preen and suffer that the film grows tiresome and boring. There was never a moment when I felt I was watching Arthur Fleck on screen, I was always aware that I was watching Phoenix craft a performance of a character called Arthur Fleck and that always kept me outside the film. “Joker” is likely to upset those who have an affection for the Batman of the past or for those looking to find a film to point a finger at for excessive violence but it is likely to please audiences who may have no strong connection to the original Joker and the hardcore DC fanboys and girls who like everything DC puts out. It is also likely to score at the box office with nothing to really challenge it this weekend. I’m not sorry I saw the film but I’m not likely to ever seek it out again. It definitely starts to find its way in the second half but it seems too little too late. And it does make me want to cue up “The Dark Knight” and savor Ledger’s riveting performance.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," What makes Joker one of the most anticipated films of 2019? Apart from it depicting the origin of one of the most popular villains in all of pop culture and starring talented actor Joaquin Phoenix, this is the kind of film that breaks new ground for DC movies and certain kinds of superhero cinema in general. This is not the kind of comic-book movie that welcomes cosplay, or toys, or family celebration. It's actually not meant to be a superhero film the way you would traditionally think of comic-book DC superhero films like Batman V Superman, Wonder Woman, or the Justice League movies. Joker is an exceptionally ambitious project from writer and director Todd Phillips, which focuses on the most popular comic-book villain of all time, but without any ties to the broader DC Universe. Instead, this is a high-octane R-rated crime drama in a dark, realistic tone, and digs deep into character study and meditation on a single character in this tale of madness, revenge and betrayal. Honestly, by looking at his long timeline of goofy comedy movies -- namely, the Hangover trilogy, Due Date, Starsky & Hutch, and more recently War Dogs -- Phillips is probably not the first person you would think of to direct a Joker movie. But after watching the film, it's apparent that he definitely had an angle and a unique vision for what he was creating. In Joker, Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a man who is just about as down on his luck as he can get. He's a social outcast who lives in a dilapidated apartment with his fragile mother Penny (Frances Conro). Arthur is a failed clown at his work during the day, and a failed stand-up comedian at night. While he can't hold down any job, he is also struggling with mental illness, depression and emotional incontinence (uncontrollable episodes of laughing is one of them). Despite his hope to be noticed and bring joy to people as a comedian, he has a bleak outlook on life. There's a scene where we see Arthur talking to his psychiatrist about his condition and all his dark thoughts, and it's scrawled in his journal, ""I hope my death makes more cents than my life"". This is almost a perfect profile of the birth of a serial killer, and here, we get to witness his descent into becoming and fully embracing the Joker persona later in the film. Joker is set in 1981, Gotham. It's during a time when there is a garbage strike so the whole city is basically a dump. The environment designed for Gotham in this film parallels that specific era of New York City in the 70s. There is also extreme levels of poverty, the distance between the wealthy and the struggling reflecting what's happening in society today. I found this to be a gorgeous-looking movie. The cinematography is absolutely on-point. And despite how dark and depressing it is, it's an incredibly colourful movie. Every single shot looks like it has been done with care, and was such a treat to look at. Even if you happen to dislike the movie, there's no denying the absolute beauty of the way the film is shot. As the title suggests, this movie is Phoenix's show. The story stays with the main character for, like, 95% of the time, yet he still manages to command our attention in every single frame. This is by far the most mesmerising performance delivered by Phoenix. He's successfully brought this iconic villain to life. Some may debate his performance with the classic Joker versions of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. But trust me, Phoenix's version will definitely take you to different place. He's committed 100% to his character, not just psychologically but physically, too. There were certain shots in the film that show the contortion of his skeletal body with some unnatural poses -- something that reminded me a lot of Christian Bale's skeletal appearance in The Machinist. And it was actually horrifying and disturbing to watch. Robert De Niro has a significant presence as Murray Franklin, a famous talk-show host Arthur admires. De Niro isn't in the movie by accident. The mood and tone of Joker is obviously like a supervillain homage to Martin Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, both of which starred De Niro in the lead role. His appearance here is very effective. Other players, like Frances Conroy and Zazie Beetz, are just wonderful in their roles as Arthur's mother and love interest, respectively. Although their roles are relatively small, they do get enough moments to shine. As a graphically violent tale with a villain as its lead character, the film will generate divided opinions. Some will say it's going to inspire violence. But no, you're not meant to root for the main character like this. That's not what this movie is about. At first you may sympathise with the character, but as he shows more and more rage, the very same thing that makes you feel sorry for him now starts to get super-scary -- and this turnaround is done brilliantly. And by the time the movie is over, you will find yourself fully invested and ready to watch his journey continue. Well, if there's ever another one.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Brooding performances. Crepuscular light. Decrepit cityscapes. Ominous sound design. And a gaunt frame that exudes coiled rage. “I used to think that my life was a tragedy,” says the hollowed-out figure. “But now I realize that it’s a fucking comedy.” Todd Phillips’ Joker is not joking around. To paraphrase another movie: Why so self-serious? At some point between Caesar Romero’s cackling ’60s goofball and Jack Nicholson’s heavy-lidded ’80s menace, pop culture decided that Batman’s nemesis was a villain of Shakespearean proportions. Alan Moore’s acclaimed 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke probably had something to do with it. “An exceptional piece of literature,” raves a fanboy review on Amazon’s website. There you go: apparently the Joker is legit lit. The white-faced, green-haired criminal with the creepy cackle dates back to 1940, appearing in the same comic book where the caped crusader made his debut. But this time around, he’s a troubled soul named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a virginal bachelor who lives with his infirm mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in what looks to be Gotham City circa 1981. A sanitation strike has turned Gotham into a stinking pile of garbage, where scores of super rats plague the streets and porn movies fill the multiplexes. Fleck suffers from a medical condition that causes Tourette’s-level spasms of guffaws. “Forgive my laughter” reads a card he carries around. “I have a condition.” Ironically, Fleck is an aspiring stand-up comic. “Don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?” says his well-intentioned mother. Ouch. During the day, he ekes out a living as a rent-a-clown. But after a bunch of punks beat the crap out of him, a colleague loans him a handgun. That’s not so good when it accidentally falls out during a routine at the local kid’s hospital. But it sure comes in handy when a bunch of drunk Wall Streeters pick a fight on the subway. Bernie Goetz would approve. After that spasm of violence, Fleck starts to feel more empowered. And in between bouts of bathroom tai chi and a soft-shoe routine on a long stairwell, Fleck’s alter ego begins to emerge. The film indicates this with a series of slo-mo reveries, plus a budding connection that seems delusional until it actually reveals itself to be a delusion. Gotcha. Darkness visible. It wasn’t always this way. Christopher Nolan cast Heath Ledger as the Joker in 2008’s The Dark Knight, and between them they hatched a delightfully wicked portrayal that reveled in anarchy. Ledger defied psychological profiles by confessing to ever-changing origin stories. He chronically flicked his tongue out like a frog, simultaneously invoking and mocking the idea of menace. He even dressed in drag and did some prop work with a detonator. It was chilling and ridiculous. But never deep. And he got a posthumous Oscar for it. In the decade since, superheroes have become the default blockbuster of our time, costing hundreds of millions and earning back billions. With numbers like those, comic-book IP’s need to be safe, which is why Disney’s Marvel movies are rigorously calibrated to be preteen-edgy but never dirty. 20th Century Fox pioneered the R-rated superhero, with Deadpool, and then reached for maturity with Logan. Warner Bros knows they can’t make a splash unless they somehow pivot. So their movie versions of DC comics, overseen by 300 auteur Zack Snyder, are overtly gloomy. Snyder’s influence has waned somewhat, leading to the notable bubblegum exceptions of Shazam! and Aquaman. But DC movies are still darker than Marvel’s. And now, they’ve taken the next logical step and embraced the R rating, too. Which leads us back to Joker. Phillips pitched Warner Bros on an ingenious idea: give interesting directors a crack at their fabled stable of superheroes, keep the budgets relatively low, and let them play around with it. He proposed that they release the films under an alternate label called DC Black. His version of the Joker was a prime example, a throwback to the Scorsesean worlds of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy where Robert De Niro embodied masculine alienation. In fact, he got Martin Scorsese’s producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff interested. And De Niro even agreed to join the cast, as Murray Franklin, the host of a talk show—the exact position De Niro’s King of Comedy antihero Rupert Pupkin so desperately wanted. To its credit, Joker is definitely a kindred spirit to Taxi Driver. Scorsese’s twisted neo-noir anti-romance so freaked out Columbia Pictures that, in 1976, the studio quietly released it on a handful of screens the weekend before Valentine’s Day. No matter: People lined up around the block as soon as it opened. Critics raved, the movie went on to win the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and eventually it even nabbed four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Warner Bros is hoping for an equivalent reception. It may get its wish. Last month, the Venice Film Festival gave Joker its top prize, the Golden Lion. The film is already certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and the Oscar oracles predict good fortune. Unlike Taxi Driver, though, Joker will open wide on 4,300 screens. The supervillain origin story could bring in as much as $95 million on its opening weekend. People aren’t discovering Joker; it’s being thrust upon them. Most viewers won’t know what hit them. Like Taxi Driver, Joker has a dark power that just doesn’t jibe with Hollywood movies, and that is more than a little exhilarating. It’s also unsettling, mainly because the film feels like it’s in over its head. Taxi Driver is a brilliantly cathartic exploration of one person’s existential crisis. Joker is pure nihilism, presented with a mischievous shrug. The characters don’t really feel that human, so the film lacks in human insight. There’s no there there. Phoenix’s skeletal lookit-me! weight loss, sucked-in gut and rib-cage protrudent, is, at best, a shallow character trait for someone who spends way too much time shirtless. At worst, it’s a gimmicky actor quirk and a stand-in for the hard work of storytelling. Maybe it’s a reaction to the superficial script, which offers up Psychology 101 answers to Arthur Fleck’s laughaholic trauma. Fleck never knew his father. He was abused as a child. His mother was in a mental ward. He didn’t take his meds and didn’t get enough hugs. Boo-hoo? Ho-hum. It’s a get-out-of-jail card for all the rest of us. Scorsese never gave Travis Bickle a clinical pathology, and the character resonates that much more because we recognize his aching loneliness not as a medical condition but as a human response to a world riddled with vice. Deep down, we could all be Travis Bickle. Arthur Fleck, though, is stubbornly freakish. Defiantly alien. He’s a head case. We can comfort ourselves knowing that at least we’re not him. Still, Joker has two scenes that are absolutely brilliant. In one, a kabuki-faced Fleck has two old friends over to his apartment for some cold vengeance. In the other, Fleck realizes a lifelong dream of appearing on Franklin’s show. Both are directed, and acted, with a chilling intensity that’s hard to shake. What better way to paint that smile on your face than with a bright red gush of blood? Stephen Garrett is the former film editor of 'Time Out New York’ and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years. A Rotten Tomatoes certified reviewer, Garrett is also the founder of Jump Cut, a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent, foreign-language, and documentary films.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 4, 2019"," It features a well-considered score and some beautiful framing of sequences, but it is the rage that pulses under the surface that gives the film its heartbeat and Joaquin Phoenix is disconcertingly mesmerising as its vehicle. Phoenix’s aspiring comedian Arthur Fleck is a character who is discomforting – he doesn’t fit neatly into the world and he perturbs people. Awkward and gaunt, he can’t keep a lid on the crazy, and people don’t know how to handle that, which makes them fear him. A clown by day, aspiring stand-up comedian at night, Fleck believe his purpose in life is to bring joy to people, but the world doesn’t quite “get” him. Then there’s the mask he wears to try and fit into the world, his normal person mask, but this too is slipping. Phoenix doesn’t try for Heath Ledger’s insouciant menace but he does run the full gamut of psychosis, and by the end of the film you have to wonder how much of what happens, happened in his head and how much happened in the real world. His is a Joker that is more gritty anti-hero closer to Darkman than to Jack Nicholson’s garish cartoon clown Joker. While comic book Joker has always been a nihilistic character who has given up on society and is hellbent on destroying its structures and institutions, this film character shows us why. Rooting his motivation partly in his psychosis is problematic (not all mentally ill people are going to turn to violence if they’re off their meds) but this is countered by his showdown with late night TV show host Murray Franklin (de Niro in non OTT mode is quite good, actually). Fleck’s most fervent wish is to make it as a stand-up comedian and a slot on the show is where Franklin calls BS on his behaviour, saying responding with violence is a choice. All of this plays out in a crime-ridden 80s Gotham, New York which is rife with strikes, huge rats and incivilities big and small. Fleck inadvertently sets off a political movement of ordinary people sick of the rich Wall Street types telling them what to do and much violence ensues. The “narrative of anxiety” (thanks The Atlantic) around fears of mass shootings at screenings which has taken on a life of its own, seems to be as much about this part of the plot as it is about the state of American pop culture. So, too how you read this film depends on your outlook. Is director Todd Phillips dissing incel culture or trying to explain mass shootings in the US? Phillips has expressed surprise in interviews at the film becoming a lighting rod for violent behaviour, saying it is not his job to teach an audience morality. True, but the film both glamorises Fleck’s behaviour even as it goes tut tut over his violent ways, which is either disingenuous, or genius, depending on what you take out of the film. Either way, watching it is not going to be a bland experience.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," I went in to the media screening of The Joker unaware of the controversy that has shrouded this highly anticipated release by Warner Bros studios and DC Comics. Hailed as a masterpiece at the Venice Film Festival, it took home the Golden Lion – the top honour this festival can bestow. The Joker, for the first time, tells the origin story of Batman’s famous nemesis. And this time, it is Joaquin Phoenix wearing the white paint and scarlet grin. The Joker starts is a man trodden down by society at every turn. Named Arthur Fleck, he is mentally ill with delusions of being a comedian. By day, he works as a clown, twirling an advertisement sign on the streets of Gotham and visiting children’s hospital wards. He then returns to his grubby domicile where he takes care of his ailing mother. At one point, government cuts funding to social services, which is how he received counselling and medication. But the last straw is when he is accosted by three men on a subway. At first, he just defends himself, but then a dark violence takes over and he ends up killing them. It turns out The Joker’s attackers are three Wall Street types, and news of the incident becomes a tipping point for the angry, disenfranchised Gotham public. Fleck becomes a symbol of how those at the top will be held accountable for how they could live with so much and leave so little for the rest. The fact that the film seems to justify the violence Fleck later engages in is what has had critics buzzing. Parallels have been drawn to the lonely Fleck and members of the incel community, an online subculture of involuntary celibate men who define themselves as unable to find a romantic or sexual partner. I couldn’t disagree more. The mass shooters in real life usually talk about how they feel rejected by society, particularly when it comes to matters of love. Yes, Joker is infatuated with a woman in his building – played by Zazie Beetz – but his aggression is not rooted solely in his romantic desires. Critics say the film could incite violence, but how exactly would a villain such as The Joker or the masses of displeased Gothamites get the attention they deserve without violence? The leading men are sublime in this story of a villain who takes centre stage with a much needed gust of fresh thought. But how exactly are you going to watch a story of a villain such as The Joker and not see some disturbing things? The Joker isn’t a being with superpowers like Thanos.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Joker: The BRWC Review.  Evocative, dark, twisted and utterly mesmerising, that is what Todd Phillips has done with Joker. When the announcement first came in 2017 that we were getting a Joker origin story, I had no idea what to expect. The seemingly constant failure of the DCEU had continued with the release of Justice League, after only briefly being salvaged by Wonder Woman, and snarky laughter and insults met everything attached to the brand.  Yet here was something Warner Brothers told us was going to be completely separate, with no CGI upper lips and, most importantly and interestingly, no Caped Crusader. Soon Joaquin Phoenix was attached, and all we knew was that he would be The Joker going around Gotham with no one capable of stopping him.  Now we know what that’s like and the best way to describe it is a punch in the face quickly followed by an ice bath. This Joker origin story plays very much like the clown prince of crime himself is giving us a list of excuses for his actions, everything is from his perspective, and it’s crucial to understand that. The world Phillips puts us in is a cruel one, a distressingly cruel one that, had the man introduced to us as Arthur Fleck not become The Joker, would generate empathy from audiences for our main character.  However, we are only seeing what our demented antagonist is allowing us to see, and we can’t trust him, so we are left to our own devices, subject to only disturbing behaviour from disturbing people.  Our leader through this world is the relentless Joaquin Phoenix, who gives what is very possibly the finest performance of his career. He summons the feeling that he was born to play this role and brings back all the mental chaos that the character lacked in Suicide Squad. The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) placed all their cards in the Joker character with the film relying on him in every scene, and phoenix delivers to an incredibly high standard. Robert De Niro is also excellent as funny man talk show host Murray Franklin, who serves almost as a reminder that we have been forced to follow The Joker down a path no one would ever actually tread. In other words, he reiterates that the world isn’t all that bad, at least compared to how Arthur sees it. The architect behind the entire film, Todd Phillips, has plain and simple never directed a better movie. The Hangover and War Dogs don’t even come close; this is work from an entirely different filmmaker and of a calibre, I’ll admit, I didn’t believe him capable of. I was so foolishly wrong, and I’m so happy to write that. His direction is gobsmacking as he paints his depiction of a treacherous descent into insanity.  In working with cinematographer Lawrence Sher, they have managed to make something so captivating that even when the images make you want to look away, you never will. From his eerie dancing to his harrowing laughter, they capture The Joker in an entirely unforgettable fashion making this depiction of the famous character one of the most impactful ever.  There are parallels to the real world, ones that are quite unsettling. At times it’s unclear if the film was trying to acknowledge these or not. They may be a minority, but there are people out there who agree with the psychopathic ramblings of the Joker, and every so often they mimic his style of deranged violence.  I wholeheartedly believe Joker is a film that condemns these people and acknowledges their legitimate threat to the world as we know it. For some, the story will come on a little strong because the world in the film takes the real-life problems and turns them up to 11. The violence is unrelenting as a result, and that is where the debate of the films potential to incite real crimes arises, I hope it doesn’t, but I can’t say for sure that it won’t. We aren’t at the stage where criminal members of an audience should be dictating how to make a film though, that is something I know for sure. So even if you are against the narrative, Joker had an unequivocal right to be made, and as of the time of writing, I’m sure happy it did.  The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is bone-chilling and gut-wrenching. 2019 has been a particularly good year for film scores, and this one further extends the ever-growing terrific library of music. The editing is also first-rate as it never lets you fully settle from the insane acts before the next one occurs. In the grand scheme of things, the violence is quite sparse, coming in bursts rather than smothering the whole experience, so not being able to settle is a sign of a director and editor that has you well and truly on a hook.  I could go through the other aspects of the movie and sing my praises, but I mean it when I say that in every category this is one of the year’s best films and it will make a significant impact this awards season. Joker is a
disturbing look through the eyes of a mad man who blames the world for his
insanity, one told via career-best work from Todd Phillips and the performance
of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix. We hope you're enjoying BRWC. You should check us out on our social channels, subscribe to our newsletter, and tell your friends.  BRWC is short for battleroyalewithcheese.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","If there is a meaningful difference between performing and acting, Joaquin Phoenix surely exemplifies the former here, creepily contorting as the Clown Prince of Crime in Todd Phillips' timely, toxic take on the Making of a Murdering Madman.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 4, 2019"," Monsters aren’t created in a vacuum. There are outside forces of pressure and heat that bubble and churn to the point the monster is almost an inevitability. This is probably the least comic-book “comic-book movie” ever, as writer/director Todd Phillips (with a writing assist from Scott Silver) shows us a bleak world devoid of heroes of any shape or form. “Joker” is set in an early 1980s Gotham City evocative of New York City of the same era, where violence and crime were sidewalk occurrences as common as fire hydrants and newsstands. The easiest comparison to make in terms of the tone and progression of “Joker” is “Taxi Driver,” which is not exactly what we’ve come to expect from Phillips, who is best known for rowdy comedies like “Old School” and “The Hangover” trilogy. Our subject is the mentally and emotionally fragile Arthur Fleck. Arthur is played by Joaquin Phoenix, one of the most daring actors around who delivers Oscar-caliber performances anytime he works with a director willing to push him. In “Joker,” Phillips shoves him down an elevator shaft. Phoenix lost an incredible amount of weight to play Arthur, a man with an array of mental health issues and a Tourette-like condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably, which often makes him a target of derision and disgust. Arthur is a devoted son to his home-bound mother Penny (Frances Conroy) and struggles to make ends meet as a for-hire clown. In spite of the world kicking him around, Arthur does have hopes and dreams that involve becoming a standup comedian and wooing his kindly neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz). Arthur’s greatest dream would be to make it to the stage of a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro as a sort of proto-Johnny Carson. But in the world of “Joker,” dreams coming true is probably the worst thing that can happen. As Arthur descends into madness, he’s not a sympathetic character as much as he is a pitiful one. Dread and unease soak through to this movie’s core and even as it culminates with violent, homicidal outbursts, the audience is never granted a feeling of relief or release. The Joker becomes a rallying figure for the downtrodden and destitute of Gotham, but he seems almost bewildered with the attention. “I’m not political,” he says at one point. “I don’t believe in anything.” This movie touches an exposed nerve in American culture here in 2019 and doesn’t let go; so much so, that police presence is being requested at movie theaters all around the country lest this movie inspire Joker wannabes to participate in violence and mayhem. To me this movie is less about creating new jokers in society and more about the fact we have already been living for years under the assault of solitary, broken, demented men bringing bloodshed and horror to our schools, churches and city streets.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","Ultimately, Joker is near Shakespearean in its tragic scope. It's Macbeth for the comic book movie generation, and easily the most morally complex comic book film since The Dark Knight.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Arthur Fleck walks into his kitchen late one night, carefully removes the food and shelves from the refrigerator, then crawls into it, shutting the door tightly behind him. We never actually see how Arthur (played in a powerhouse bit of agonizing by Joaquin Phoenix) escapes from his self-made death trap, but he goes on to inflict more damage to himself, and to significant others, in Todd Phillips’ wondrously downbeat Joker, which despite its unrelentingly grim and despairing mood is one the year’s most important films. America (the world?) is in a particularly foul mood these days, and there are some who want to blame entertainments like director Phillips’ and screenwriter Scott Silver’s action-filled character study, the latest example of “DC darkness” for audiences in love with the Batman comic-book franchise. But even moviegoers who have little time for comics can find something to relate to in actor Phoenix’s portrait of Arthur, a desperately lonely ex-mental patient – and walking-wounded standup comedian — who lives with his aging mother in a rundown apartment and works as a sign spinner on the streets of Gotham City, dressed as the archetypal scary clown.  Enter the Joker, a further “anarchic” echo of Heath Ledger’s vision of the character in The Dark Knight (2008). Arthur’s query “Is it just me?” is his calling card in dealing with such antagonists as mocking late-night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, superb); Randall, a provocateur colleague from the clown-hawker agency (Glenn Fleshler); and Arthur’s true nemesis, aloof plutocrat Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who may or may not be our anti-hero’s father. Their conflicts, essentially the struggle for Arthur’s soul, are set against a recognizable cityscape – all chaos and confusion, with business-bros gunned down on a subway train, “kill the rich” protestors in riot mode, and newspaper headlines screaming “Clown Vigilante!” The real Arthur under the greasepaint is far more disturbing than the circus freak. The anchor for all this is Phoenix’s Arthur, whose emaciated physique and tortured expression instantly recall actor-madman Antonin Artaud, or the ominous side of Daniel Day Lewis. Or maybe De Niro’s Travis Bickle, “God’s lonely man.” The Martin Scorsese connection to Phillips-Silver-Phoenix’s Gotham Grand Guignol is there for everyone to see, from Arthur’s repeated “shot to the temple” finger gesture (from Taxi Driver) and his fevered journal entries (writer Paul Schrader’s Robert Bresson riff in Taxi Driver), to the Rupert Pupkin-like antics (borrowed from The King of Comedy) on the talk show.  Actor Phoenix seems consistently attracted to roles of troubled characters (The Master, Irrational Man, Two Lovers, You Were Never Really Here, etc.). Arthur Fleck is one of his most complex, an unwanted person searching for acceptance from people either unable (his mother Penny Fleck, played by Frances Conroy) or unwilling, like haughty Thomas Wayne, to gather him in. The film’s only tender moments show Arthur’s budding love interest in his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), another big-city castaway. But of course nothing comes of it. Arthur’s downward spiral is irreversible and absolute, with only a smattering of grace notes – his restroom ballet, a love clinch with Sophie – to briefly distract us. All the while Phoenix puts on a master class in physicality, set to composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s hypnotically evocative music score. Arthur’s gyrations thrill and repel us in equal measure, but never let us lose sight of his essential neediness. We cannot look away and cross the street. He’s in our face for the full two hours. Arthur’s ordeal really has little to do with Batman or any other comic-book character. It is possible to come to Joker with no knowledge of the DC empire, or the avalanche of superhero vehicles. The only prerequisite is a taste for some of the most provocative storytelling we’ve seen on the big screen in a long, long time. Joker will grab you and hold you. Listen to it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker is discomfiting, physically as well as emotionally taxing (both, presumably, for Phoenix to go through and for an audience to watch) — and undeniably impressive. After shedding 52 pounds, Phoenix seems twisted up, his muscles and bones caving in just like his psyche. An unspecified condition that causes his character to break into bouts of painful laughter only exacerbates the effect. The rigor is in service of a movie without anything to say. Though sad sack Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) dreams of being a stand-up comedian, he’s stuck in a thankless day job as a clown, twirling signs outside of stores and performing for sick children. At night, he returns to the apartment he shares with his mother (Frances Conroy), who has been writing letters to one Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) in the hopes that he might take pity upon them and offer them some financial help.  Arthur’s growing woes — the public funding providing him both therapy and medication is cut off, he’s fired from his job, and his ambitions at becoming a comic continue being stymied — reach a turning point when he commits an act of violence under pressure. He doesn’t feel torn about the murders he commits, but when every news outlet catches wind of the crime and clowns become the symbol of Gotham’s equivalent of Occupy Wall Street, he finally starts feeling some sense of recognition and validation. The transformation that ensues feels like watching the changing moods of a child, shyness giving way to tantrums, then sudden, frenetic dancing that barely seems under his control. Phoenix excels in conveying the blurriness between control and chaos. Though it may be the fulfillment of his childhood dreams, watching Arthur do stand-up is easily one of the most painful scenes in the film. The set is sweaty, literally and metaphorically, as Arthur struggles to get his joke out as his laughter takes over, and as his expectant deliveries meet with stony silence. It’s not clear whether he’s managing not to break down out of sheer perseverance or the delusion that he’s doing well. Phoenix makes him easy to pity; director Todd Phillips makes that hard to maintain. The magnetism of Phoenix’s performance wears off as Phillips reaches to find meaning. The works that the Hangover writer-director pulls from in order to paint a fresh portrait of an old character (specifically, Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver) traffic in the kinds of complex characters that Arthur is supposed to be, and succeed by exposing society’s ills. Joker, by contrast, paints a shallow portrait of a loner turned killer, who is, even by his own admission, removed from the anti-rich fury to which he becomes a symbol. Even Phoenix — so compelling in The Master and You Were Never Really Here — can’t make Phillips’ kiddie pool seem deep, which goes a long way toward explaining how Robert De Niro, who appears in just a few scenes, almost steals the show. As Murray Franklin, the talk show host Arthur idolizes, De Niro is playing a neat reversal of his King of Comedy role, in which his character, the delusional Rupert Pupkin, takes his obsession with Jerry Lewis’ talk show host to an extreme. He also seems like the only actor in the film having fun, shimmying his shoulders and playing to the rafters, as a TV host should. He doesn’t have anything to prove, whereas the rest of the film feels hell-bent upon proving (with ultimately little success) that it’s not another comic book movie. Other characters, like Zazie Beetz as the neighbor upon whom Arthur has a crush, Bill Camp and Shea Whigham as police officers, and Glenn Fleshler as a fellow clown, simply come and go. Though the people in his orbit give Arthur a little more dimension as an unreliable narrator (and give the film a little more dramatic cred), they fail to stop the movie’s descent into the exact territory it eschews. It’s called Joker, after all, and the Clown Prince wouldn’t exist without Batman. No amount of emulating 1970s cinema is enough to cover that up. The problem with Joker isn’t whether Arthur is a hero or a villain; the problem is that the film seems more concerned with proving its worth than saying anything meaningful. It’s beautifully shot and well-acted, and its most violent and shocking scenes land with visceral impact. But Phillips’ flashes of style are all in service of a grimdark image rather than a message about the haves and have-nots, or the treatment of mental illness, or any of the other real issues so easily within reach. It’s all show, and no substance. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","It's impossible not to feel empathy for this excruciatingly sad clown... Ultimately though, Joker fails because of its genre. The character has to hit those DC marks.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Watching an emaciated creeper do several “kooky underpants dances” is definitely somebody’s idea of a good time. It is just not mine. Joker isn’t quite the incel love letter I feared. Instead, it is mostly a cliched bore with a final act that validates dangerous psychopathological misperceptions of reality. Because clearly what we need right now is a film from the director of Due Date that ultimately suggests lunatics who think they’ll be celebrated for murdering people are probably right. Joker is set in whatever year is Martin Scorsese’s favorite, likely the late 70s or early 80s, whichever had less women. The life of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lazy amalgamation of every real-life serial killer’s origin story. He has a history of head trauma, mental illness, mommy issues, and an obsession with a celebrity, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the host of a late night show. As his therapist is taken away and he goes off his meds, Arthur attempts to find out the truth about his parents and finally make people “see him.” Again, it cannot be stressed enough just how much this process involves a skeletal Phoenix, dressed only in his tighty-whities, gyrating while his vertebrae pop up and down like anxious groundhogs. Press junkets for Joker have focused extensively on Phoenix’s obnoxious method acting, writer/director Todd Phillips’s inability to mature with the culture around him, and how the film’s script was mostly improvised. Having now seen the film, that last point reads more like an apology than a revelation. Without spoiling anything, the conceit upon which the entire third act hinges is that the downtrodden in Gotham choose to celebrate a murder-clown because his victims were rich. Here in the real world, if somebody gets diarrhea once after eating lettuce, nobody has a salad for three months. Yet the premise in Joker is that everyone super loves a dude John Wayne Gacy-ing people because there’s an ongoing garbage strike. But hey, who cares about the plot, right? Allegedly the reason Joker exists and is already winning awards is because of Phoenix’s “masterful” performance. Although what makes acting good is wholly subjective, where is the masterwork in random twitching, hacking up laughter like hairballs, and mamboing in greasy Fruit of the Looms? Heath Ledger’s portrayal was a departure for both the character and the actor. This Joker is stunningly expected and so completely in line with Phoenix’s body of work. It’s not “bad” so much as simply on par with every cosplay impression of the character we’ve collectively endured for the last decade. What is unique is the almost nonchalant endorsement of a truly horrifying worldview. Again, without spoiling things, audiences are told rather explicitly that Fleck’s fears are accurate, his inherent beliefs about people are true, and his strategy to gain recognition through violence is an effective one. This is not interpretation. The film’s closing moments literally confirm the validity of the very worst things a troubled person can think. That seems, I don’t know, kinda bad, right? Making any major film about a violent, awful person is a choice that comes with a massive level of social responsibility and requires significant awareness. Censorship is abhorrent, as cultural progress requires that artists are allowed to work unchecked. That said, there were cops at my theater. If the very existence of your movie makes people afraid that some who are inclined to see it may shoot other people, maybe you’ve made a bad thing?",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," “Joker” is an origin story with a twist – a deeply disturbing descent into madness driven by a tour de force performance from Joaquin Phoenix. As the title character, Phoenix is an unnerving ticking time bomb that slowly erupts on screen – building to a explosive crescendo in the excellent final act. “Joker” tells the story of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), a mentally ill young man who is trying to find himself. Fleck has dreams of going into stand-up comedy, specifically appearing on a late-night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), but he is saddled with a dead-end job and the responsibility of caring for his ailing mother (Frances Conroy). Fleck has been considered an outcast by society throughout his life, constantly ridiculed and picked on by others. One day, Fleck fights back and discovers he has no remorse for his actions. While Fleck comes to terms with his new feelings, he also starts to uncover secrets from his past – further awakening the demons from within. Director Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver, might not seem to be the right fit for this material considering his previous work (“The Hangover” films and “Old School,” to name a few), but he brings an intimate, cynical view that works quite well in “Joker.” This is a script that has drawn comparisons to a couple of Martin Scorsese films – “The King of Comedy” and “Taxi Driver” – but I feel is more in line with the recent Dan Gilroy film “Nightcrawler” in its portrait of a disturbed individual. It helps that Phillips has an actor like Phoenix willing to do whatever is necessary to make the material work. Phoenix completely morphs into this role, with a startling physical transformation, but also makes Fleck so guarded that it’s easy to at least understand why he morphs into the madman that he eventually becomes. Phillips and Silver try to fill out the screenplay around the performance with spotty success. There are some interesting nods to Batman that bring the two stories together in an intriguing manner, but the attempts to add social commentary about class structure and mental illness don’t always hit the intended mark. It all comes back to Phoenix, who is a one-man show. Whether he’s talking to a social worker, a sympathetic neighbor (Zazie Beetz) or going toe-to-toe with De Niro in the film’s magnificent final act (if the first two acts were as good as the last we would be talking about an instant classic), Phoenix commands your attention like no other performance from 2019.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," “Joker” is a comic book movie as filtered through the lens of gritty, brutal New York films like Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.” Robert De Niro is even here as a snarky TV comedy show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in “The King of Comedy,” where De Niro was the delusional Rupert Pupkin, a character not far from Joaquin Phoenix’s severe, tormented Joker, aka Arthur Fleck. It’s the early 1980s, during a notorious garbage worker strike in Gotham City. Arthur works as a professional clown, dancing and holding signs for going-out-of-business sales or singing for sick kids in a hospital. He lives with and takes care of his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), who hopes her fleeting association with the wealthy, powerful Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) will pull them out of poverty. Arthur also takes meds and sees a social worker weekly; the only thing said about his condition is that he tends to burst into sinister laughter at inappropriate times. Unfortunately, after some kids steal his sign and beat him up, and a co-worker gives him a gun, he is fired. Then he’s informed that a struggling city has cut funding to social services, leaving him without support and pills. Meanwhile, he meets Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a pretty neighbor and single mother, and takes her to see his nightclub comedy “act.” The act is videotaped and sent to Murray Franklin (De Niro), who airs it, then invites Arthur on the show. “Joker” is filled with despair, set in a world in which the rich and powerful promise to save everyone, but honestly don’t care about anyone who’s not already rich and powerful. In one sneeringly ironic scene, clown-masked downtrodden people on the verge of rioting protest outside a gala showing of Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times,” attended by the city’s elite, all laughing in delight at the exploits of a homeless clown. But his career began with a remarkable and terrifying 1993 documentary, “Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies,” about hardcore punk rocker Allin, who died at 36 after a career of doing unspeakable things onstage — either because he was angry, artistically intense or merely bonkers. While Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson (at the top), Cesar Romero (in the middle) and Jared Leto (elsewhere) have gone to extremes to portray this most prominent pop culture villain, Phoenix has the luxury of not having to share the screen with Batman. He sears into Joker’s psyche like a hot poker. Nearly skeletal, and with eyes permanently shaded by overhanging brows, he moves like a balletic contortionist spider, all limbs and big shoes and flapping bell-bottoms. In the comics, Batman catches Joker and puts him away, like garbage, but in “Joker” it’s the anger, hate and ignorance of humans that made him in the first place.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," The Joker may be the most iconic villain in pop culture
because he touches a nerve that is dormant within us all — the urge to commit
the unspeakable, to create chaos and to instill fear for its own sake. These all are dark notions we, as humans, harbor in our deepest recesses. They are mostly held in check by the mores of civilization, the environment in which we grow up and the influences — be it parents, teachers, coaches or religious affiliations — that set our paths on a righteous trajectory. The version presented by Joaquin Phoenix in “Joker” reflects
today’s fractured landscape that is filled with resentment of the very rich few
who seem to float above the vast majority of people who live, as many
politicians like to continually say, “from paycheck to paycheck.” And director Todd Phillips’ reiteration of the Joker taps
into that divisive society, even though the movie’s setting is more reminiscent
of 1970s’ New York City, when the Big Apple was rotting at the core. Phoenix’s character, Arthur Fleck, lives in a Gotham City
overflowing with trash, because of a garbage strike, and “super rats” that
threaten residents. Fleck, who earns his living as a clown for hire, reminds me
of Joe Btfsplk, the character from the old “Li’l Abner” comic strip who was a
walking jinx with a dark cloud always over his head. From the outset, Fleck appears to be a doormat for people to
step on or over. Working in front of a store that is failing, he carries a
going-out-of-business sign that is stolen by a group of youths who beat him
when he finally catches up with them. He is continually harangued by his boss, and his frail
mother asks Arthur, who dreams of being a stand-up comic, “Don’t you have to be
funny to do that”? Phillips and Silver are trying to make “Joker” a Martin
Scorsese-like supervillain origin story. They create situations that recall
moments from “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy,” going so far as to cast
Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a late-night entertainment host patterned on
Johnny Carson, who also served as the template for Jerry Lewis’ Jerry Langford
in “King of Comedy.” But raising the movie above these shortcomings is Phoenix’s
performance. Looking wan, he is fully committed to showing the human side of
this soon-to-be monster. All Fleck wants is to be noticed and respected, but he is
denied and betrayed at every turn — and by those he considers closest to him,
his mother and Franklin. His gradual transformation is frightening to observe, as is
his physical alteration. At the outset, he trudges around Gotham, but as the
movie progresses, his steps become lighter, more graceful and dance-like. It is
as if he is shucking off a withered husk to reveal a straighter, more sure-footed
creation. The performance is mesmerizing. You can’t take your eyes off
Phoenix and can’t wait to see the mayhem he inspires when he finally reveals
his true nature. Two peripheral subplots are distractions — one involves
Fleck’s single-mom neighbor with whom he conjures a romantic involvement, and
the other centers on Gotham’s most prominent citizen, Thomas Wayne. “Joker” is a character study of an individual pushed past
the breaking point and, as Phillips and Silver infer, it gives Gotham City the dark
jester it so richly deserves.  Many moments in “Joker” are pretentious and derivative, but when Phoenix turns his dead eyes toward you, all you see is him and the nightmare scenario surging in his heart and mind.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," ""Joker"" is a movie that you ignore at your own peril. Its fans will no doubt complain that this review focuses on politics, but the movie's political implications are so explicit and intentional (despite the main character's last-minute protestations to the contrary) that ignoring them would be the film critic equivalent of dereliction of duty. If you're going to be a ""message"" picture, then your message defines your artistic merit. Is it a dangerous manifesto that could inspire incels to commit acts of violence, as some of its critics fear? An edgy character study teeming with social commentary, as director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver seem to have intended? Is it a dark comic book adventure like ""The Dark Knight"" or a perverse ode to mentally ill social rejects, like the Martin Scorsese classics ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" (and ""The Dark Knight"" as well)? The answer is yes to all of those questions, but explaining why is not so simple. It's best to start by describing the skin of the film, its meandering plot, before trying to disentangle the messy entrails. ""Joker"" is the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a mentally ill and impoverished street clown who has absurdly, cruelly implausible dreams of succeeding as a stand up comedian. The problem is that nothing in his life is particularly funny, an irony that does not escape the future Joker. He suffers from pathological laughter, is socially awkward, depends on numerous psychiatric medications, lives with an abusive and neglectful mother, has no real friends, and is prone to humiliating himself. A series of rejections and setbacks — some economic, some social, some in the form of physical persecution — gradually transform him into a violent criminal. In the process he inspires protests and riots from countless other self-declared ""clowns"" like himself, with major consequences for both himself and Gotham City. As a traditional comic book movie — which this does not aspire to be — ""Joker"" would be a failure. This is, emphatically, not a film for children, and not just because it mostly waits until the end to provide the requisite elaborate action sequences and special effects. ""Joker"" aims to be Heath Ledger's iconic iteration of that character from ""The Dark Knight"" by way of Martin Scorsese's gritty narrative style, flaunting its R rating with gruesome gore, an unremittingly bleak tone, vulgar language, and deeply disturbing subject matter. Yet while it succeeds in aping the superficial aspects of Scorsese's style, ""Joker"" lacks the intelligence or gravitas of Scorsese's best work. If anything it reminded me of Phillips' first film, ""Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies,"" a documentary about a punk rocker whose shows included nudity, self-harm, violence against audience members, and eating various bodily excrements. Allin infamously befriended serial killer John Wayne Gacy, a fact that Phillips tellingly found to be cool and subversive instead of sinister (he even commissioned Gacy to design the film's poster). What's more, Allin's music was about as good as Fleck's comedy (that is, not very), and as a result, both movies mix their ostensible sympathy for their subjects with a sense of smug superiority. The end result, on both occasions, is simultaneously provocative and shallow. And yes, there is good reason to worry that this film will appeal to incels. The character of Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) exists for no other purpose than to be a supposed love interest who is stalked, obsessed over, has her apartment broken into, and is eventually reduced to a plot gimmick. She is, in other words, an object in Fleck's world rather than a three-dimensional character, with her main function that of reinforcing Fleck's sense of failure and justify his resentments against the world. This is perhaps an intentional parallel to Cybill Shepherd's Betsy from ""Taxi Driver,"" but we actually saw Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle interact with her in meaningful ways and learned about her as a person. While Sophie isn't vilified, the simplistic and objectifying nature of her story arc is problematic, and meshes uneasily with a movie that is aimed at the violently embittered. There is a different type of problem in the film's approach to economic issues. Like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, it wants to acknowledge social and political injustices, but lacks the courage to define itself as anything other than generically populist — a creative choice that means it can be easily used for inspiration by both left-wingers and right-wingers. To be sure, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), the father of future Batman Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson), has a clearly defined ideology: He is a loathsome oligarch who fancies himself the hero of an Ayn Rand fable. At no point does he question that his wealth and business success reflect on his worth as a human being rather than unearned privileges. He openly derides those who struggle in life as ""clowns"" who should simply accept their inferiority to him and be grateful that he wants to be their mayor (almost certainly as a Republican). When the Joker murders three of Wayne's obnoxious yuppie employees, the billionaire never questions that they are innocent victims of a jealous loser. Yet those who oppose this unjust establishment aren't given a specific ideology, just explosively violent rage. It offers no solutions beyond ""burn it all down,"" with the Joker openly (and somewhat disingenuously) disavowing any interest in politics during a climactic monologue. The desire to kill elites is instead driven by primal vengeance, not a desire for a new world order like the anarchism preached by Ledger's Joker and Tom Hardy's Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Given the movie's ultra-violent conclusion, the malleability of this aspect of its identity is also potentially dangerous. Finally there is its handling of mental illness. When I first saw trailers for the movie I was concerned that it would stigmatize people in this community, of which I am a member. My fears weren't entirely founded — Fleck is a sympathetic character and the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting some aspects of how society mistreats the mentally ill — but it still characterizes Fleck as prone to violence and crime. His unemployability is partially blamed on social cruelty, but there is still the sense that he is incompetent and undeserving of the success he seeks. Phillips doesn't explore Fleck's soul so much as present him as a spectacle, an act that objectifies mental illness as much as using it to make a character into a MacGuffin (which happened in 2018's ""The Predator"") or a monster (such as in 2017's ""Split""). This cinematic trend of objectifying mentally ill characters for plot convenience has become so ubiquitous that it warrants a term. Would I recommend the movie? If you want to see a memorably idiosyncratic Phoenix performance or are tickled by the idea of Robert De Niro in the Jerry Lewis character from ""The King of Comedy,"" sure. If you enjoy Scorsese's style of filmmaking, yes — as long as you are willing to accept a lesser-grade substitute. If you want to see a fun comic book movie, absolutely not. Yet that isn't the big thing that matters here. The more important point is that, because ""Joker"" wants to be a deep movie and is almost certainly going to be a huge success due to the ongoing popularity of the Batman franchise, it is likely that many people will identify with Fleck and consider the movie to be thought-provoking. As a result, the ideas in ""Joker"" will have consequences. How we proceed with our conversation about them will help determine whether they are for good or ill.

"Oct 4, 2019"," A comic book movie in the form of an existential nightmare, “Joker” ranks among the greatest tricks played by a director, in this case Todd Phillips of the underappreciated, similarly hallucinatory “Hangover” films, on a major American studio. Tasked with making a spin-off DC origin story about the Batman character known as the Joker (previously played by Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Cesar Romero, etc.), Phillips and co-screenwriter Scott Silver have given us a “Taxi Driver” for our turbulent times. Our new Travis Bickle is Arthur Fleck (a skin and bones, deranged looking and sounding Joaquin Phoenix), a clown for hire, living in 1981 in a tenement with his invalid mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and working for a cruel showbiz agent (Josh Pais). In the opening, Arthur holds a going-out-of-business sign in front of a “super-rat”-plagued and garbage-bloated Gotham City storefront. A gang of kids hit him over the head with the sign and beat him severely in an alley. It’s not exactly the life of a comic book super-villain, yet. Arthur is arguably insane from the start of the film, which might explain the “circular editing” that whirls us like a crazy carousel around the story and gives us subplots that may be figments of Arthur’s tortured mind. Phoenix has gone all out in this performance, which notably resembles the one he gave in Lynne Ramsay’s 2017 psychological drama “You Were Never Really Here.” Chain-smoking Arthur, who is handed a loaded snub-nosed revolver by a fellow clown, claims to be afflicted with a condition that makes him laugh riotously for no reason. You might call such a madness, in the tradition of psychiatrist R. D. Laing, a proper response to what is going on in the world around us. What can we do, but laugh like insane clowns? In spite of his physical and mental problems Arthur has started a relationship (Or has he?) with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), the young, beautiful mother who lives with her daughter in the same tenement. Phoenix shows us Arthur’s protruding ribs in several shirtless scenes, as if psychic distress is sucking the life out of him. He is in clown make-up or remnants of it so much of the time you feel like you’re watching a contemporary version of “Pagliacci.” Taking a cue from “The King of Comedy,” another Martin Scorsese (“Taxi Driver”) film, Arthur decides to get into stand-up comedy and becomes the cruel plaything of TV late night show host Murray Franklin (Travis Bickle himself Robert De Niro, playing a version of TV legend Joe Franklin). Murray’s theme song is the Sinatra hit “That’s Life” with its “stompin’ on a dream” imagery. At the same time, an unknown subway vigilante has shot and killed three “Wall Street guys,” and Gotham City is full of young men in clown make-up protesting the inequality of wealth and clashing more and more violently with police. In addition to being a “never happy,” arguably Bressonian clown, Phoenix’s Arthur is also capable of a nice little jig here and there. The violence in the film is brief, but intense. There were walkouts. Arkham State Hospital and Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of Bruce Wayne, will figure importantly in the fiendishly diabolical and clever plot, and at the end Phillips gives us a glimpse of nothing less than Miltonic pandemonium in the streets.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," I’ve got to hand it to Joker. In a world where every almost movie is a setup to a larger cinematic universe or a sequel or team-up, it does the incredibly refreshing thing of ignoring that irritating style of storytelling. That are certainly moments shown that tie to larger ideas of the DC Universe, but not anything we don’t already know as readers/viewers and nothing that will be picked up in a later movie (hopefully). For that, it has my respect. But when you get into the details of the film itself, it doesn’t entirely come together cohesively. Some might argue this is intentional, that the subject character is so mysterious that of course a movie about him would be spinning a lot of plates. The problem is that it only spins a few of them well while most crash on the floor to a jaunty tune. Joaquin Phoenix leads the film as its titular clown, elevating the sophomoric script with a performance that owes a lot to Robert De Niro (his co-star) in Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, while also picking up the baton Phoenix put down with The Master. It’s always interesting to watch, but frankly never feels like new territory for him. That is until he puts on the character’s version of the Joker make-up near its climax. As the film dives into its Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer descent, there’s little to enjoy, but when he puts on his happy face and jaunts around to Rock & Roll Part 2 (the infamous song from many an American sporting event as performed by convicted sex offender Gary Glitter, yet another grotesque and sleazy choice from the filmmakers) it feels like the kind of instantly recognizable “Joker” motifs that have become fan favorites over the years. The rest of the cast of Joker feel like shadows in the wings of a one man show. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, and Frances Conroy all have sizable parts in the tale at large (and do good work), but this the Joker movie and Phoenix takes the spotlight. A major highlight of the film is in its cinematography, as DP Lawrence Sher paints a broad a beautiful picture of a disgusting city. It has the highs and lows from Tim Burton’s Gotham in 1989, but has a legitimacy that can’t be replicated on a New York decorated back lot. The lights and shadows of each corner and alley feel real and lively in a way that most CG-overloaded comic book movies can’t even dream of. There’s a tactile nature on display that keeps the visuals from never going into dull and dreary territory. Joker looks amazing, and would be breathtaking in a 70 mm presentation. The primary issue is the film’s screenplay, which has all of the depth of a freshman dorm room wall. Director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver have built a foundation with interesting ideas, but whose sloppy support beams can’t shoulder all of its ambition. There are so many different ideas at play with regard to social-political movements and ways of life, but few come together in a way that is satisfying, interesting, or even has something to say. Therein lies perhaps the actual thesis for Joker, do these big social movements get started for reasons unintended by the person that kick-started them? Does society sometimes prescribe a connotation or belief onto something where there isn’t one? Can one person ignite a movement larger than themselves when there was no intention behind their original action? It’s an interesting idea that certainly requires contemplation with how the film handles the material, but it gets lost in a slog of critiques of PC culture, wealth inequality, and union busting that all ultimately go nowhere. In the end I don’t think even Joker knows what it wants us to consider about these larger questions, but I think that it does bring up interesting points about them. Joker is not a movie that should exist to be frank. It’s not a sequel, it’s not developing a niche corner of a world, and it’s not a bridge ahead of a team-up. It’s a dark descent that feels gross and underwritten at times, but familiar and impressive in its final moments. I wasn’t sure when the film was over if I liked it, and I’m not even sure now if it’s something I would say that about, but I haven’t stopped thinking about it. Joker is a tough watch that is not entirely rewarding but is ambitious enough to swing for the fences when it sees the opportunity.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 4, 2019"," Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill man. He’s either been ignored or disregarded his whole life. People have no problem telling him that he’s “weird” to his face. This is an origins story, but in the R-rated comic book movie world, we have moved from “Deadpool” (satirical comedy) to “Logan” (tragedy) to “Joker” and its dark cautionary tale. And he makes some valid points about society turning its back on people in need only to later say, post-horrific events, “how did something like this happen?” Writer-director Todd Phillips (“The Hangover” movies) might have seemed an odd choice for such a movie. However, look back at his films and you’ll see darkness amid the comedy. But it is the enigmatic Joaquin Phoenix who proves to be astonishing in his portrayal of the seriously disturbed Arthur/Joker, creating a man who exists in his own world. Phoenix is fearless in his ability to disturb all of us, whether that be through Arthur’s crazed laugh (always at inappropriate times, which is off-putting) or his physicality, which involves his having lost more than 50 pounds (many shirtless scenes show a strange angularity to his physique). And then there’s Arthur’s “in his own world” dancing, like a slow mix of martial arts and ballet that he seems to perform as if on his own private stage. It’s creepy and it’s unforgettable, and despite Phoenix turning 45 this month, he is so tiny here that it made me think of his teen performance in 1989’s “Parenthood,” in which he played a confused little boy. His Arthur is not that different from that description, but without the loving family to give him guidance in early 1980s New York City, itself a disturbed city with crime rampant and a garbage strike making matters worse. In this case Arthur only has his troubled mother (Frances Conroy); his co-workers at his rent-a-clown employer; and a woman in his building (Zazie Beetz) that he sees as a potential friend in his friendless world. The only person he speaks with about his life on a regular basis is a social worker who listens and regulates his medication — until her job is cut. The only other real conversation going on in his life is with his journal, a disturbing litany of how the world has wronged him and his death having meaning that reads like a mass-shooter’s manifesto. That’s from a lack of compassion to a lack of funding (the poor vs. the “1 percenters” is another prominent theme here) to a summation that “in a world this crazy, it’s surprising that more people don’t go crazy.” A subplot of the awkward, unfunny Arthur seeing himself as a stand-up comedian — whose dream is to appear on a “Tonight Show” program with Robert De Niro as a Johnny Carson-knockoff — feels stilted from the start, and that affects the ending, too. But “Joker” effectively tells a story with themes borrowed, but not stolen, from movies like “Taxi Driver” and “Network” and makes them its own platform through its own disturbed form of avenging angel. That is astounding considering what Heath Ledger achieved not so long ago with a version of the same character, but in a very different film.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," When you've been scuttling around the cultural zeitgeist for nigh on eight decades, you're bound to have had a range of iterations. The Joker started in 1940, as yet another adversary for the fledgling Batman character in DC's comic book adventures. A dude with a perma-clown face, a twisty bit of sadism, and a lousy sense of humor, he quickly became Bats' ne plus ultra villain, one that has changed considerably to better suit the flavor of the time period.  This wasn't just in the comics, of course. On the small screen, he premiered ignominiously in the campy Batman TV show of the '60s, with Cesar Romero famously playing him without even bothering to shave his mustache under the clown makeup. Things stepped up considerably when no less than Jack Nicholson played the clown prince of crime in Tim Burton's winningly obtuse big-budget Batman movie from 1989. Nicholson's scene-chewing gluttony and hammy charisma were enough to win audiences over to the point where it was easy to root for him over Michael Keaton's caped crusader.  It wasn't until Heath Ledger played him nearly two decades later that the character became known for more than purple suits and broad jokes. Under the portentous tutelage of director Christopher Nolan, Ledger, who won a posthumous Oscar for the role, unforgettably played him as a leering maniac with a deep understanding of the human condition, capable of trapping his mortal enemy in an ethical bind from which he couldn't emerge unscathed.  Such was the power of Ledger's performance; he about closed the book on the character. Or would have, if Warner Bros. wasn't so able and willing to reboot the character yet again, as they saw fit. Most recently, the Joker made an appearance in the ill-fated Suicide Squad, played by Jared Leto, who let his freak flag fly to full-staff but still couldn't bail out David Ayer's flatlining film. Nicholson used his charisma to make the humorless Batman seem secondary in his own movie, Ledger created a portrait of a sinister psychopath that dominated every scene he was in and has reverberated ever since. Given those performances, it makes sense Warner decided to go ahead this go round and dispense with the hero altogether (although we do see a young Bruce Wayne from time to time).  By design, Joker isn't even really a comic book movie, per se (perhaps what some of the approving critics found most refreshing). It is an origin story, of sorts, and it does feature a miserable, lonely man, who works as a street clown, beaten down over and over until there's nothing left of his sanity. But director Todd Phillips attempts to keep the world around him gritty and recognizable. There is nothing miraculous here, no capes, heroes or superpowers; only one man's slowly listing descent into the chaotic vortex of moral abdication. Gone, too, is any sort of fancifully fictive sense of place. It might still be called Gotham, but the reference isn't even thinly veiled: This is early '70s New York during a garbage strike, as depressing, foul and pitiless as anything from Midnight Cowboy or The French Connection. The buzz about Phillips' film was palpable at the Toronto International Film Festival a month ago, especially after it was announced it had improbably won the Golden Lion at Venice. Critics flocked to the press screening wondering if the director best known for the Hangover triad had actually gone and made a comic book-based film of gloomy resonance.  Reader, he did not. True, the film is certainly dark to its core, a bleak sustained that in the day and age of endless comic bounce, is strangely commendable. Not so surprisingly, Joaquin Phoenix is almost excruciatingly good as the titular villain-in-the-making, Arthur Fleck: a marvel of physical grotesquerie, like something out of a Diane Arbus photograph. No other American actor working today goes more all-in than Phoenix does for his roles (even in the middling Gladiator, it was impressive how fully he embraced the role of the incestuous emperor). Gaunt as a late-afternoon shadow, with his pasty complexion, and his predilection for laughing in inopportune moments, he perfectly captures the dreary misery of his character, a mentally ill would-be stand-up comic, who lives with his sickly mother (Frances Conroy) and seems more lonely and degraded than any human psyche could withstand.  Essentially, the film pits him against the city, striking him down again and again (often literally), no matter what release he attempts to find from the horror of his life: His and his mother's obsession with a slick late-night talk show host (Robert De Niro) who ends up humiliating him; a possible romantic contact with a sweet neighbor (Zazie Beetz) turns horribly, disturbingly sour; he loses his job as a clown-for-hire after unwittingly taking a handgun to a children's party; even his most basic sense of identity turns out to be a false apprehension. The film stacks everything so much against its protagonist, it offers him no other place to go but villainous madness.  Despite the sympathy it attempts to draw for the deeply disturbed Arthur, its brand of studied nihilism doesn't feel entirely unearned -- Phoenix is too good, too committed to the role for it to feel lightweight, and the distinctive art direction and cinematography sell Phillips' dour vision uncannily well. But, at the same time, it doesn't lead us much of anywhere. If the idea is to suggest we, as a society, are approaching our collective breaking point, that hardly feels worth the slog through the murkiest of bilge water to get us there. Despite the imagery, and the lead performance, there's still a strong sense that Phillips is brandishing this bleakness as a kind of affect, like the rich kid who wears his brand new black leather jacket to a punk show but only after intentionally scuffing it against the grill of his Bentley first.  Essentially, it's a film about Arthur's dank metamorphosis, but it also handily serves as a prop for all the disillusioned, disavowed creatures who troll the Internet, embracing chaos, and sowing discord whenever possible. Phillips has made a densely serious comic book film, but despite its various Scorsese appropriations, as much as it wants to be Taxi Driver, its lightyears away from that singular vision.  The genesis of that 1976 classic was screenwriter Paul Schrader's unrelenting insomnia. Driven half-mad from lack of sleep and feeling ever more paranoid about the state of the world, he wrote his dark masterpiece line by agonizing line, breathing in the stink, as the lyric goes, until finally, he stunk. The script, masterfully realized by Scorsese, was a vision as genuinely bleak and uncompromising as the era in which it was made.  Clearly, Phillips wants us to be deeply moved by the film's dingy seriousness. Instead, it's just another chapter in a multi-billion-dollar franchise that sets itself up smoothly for its inevitable sequels: '70s cars, flickering neon bulbs and garbage in the street doesn't make the film any less obvious in its stated purpose. Its unrelenting grimness -- especially in the final act -- does affect you (it is likely you will leave the theater feeling vastly worse than how you entered). But it does so as a means of further inducing your forced participation in this new Batman entertainment industrial complex.  The Joker has been many different things to many different eras, but this is the first time his dark psychosis has been played up as sympathetic. Even before its release, the film has already galvanized its potential fanbase, calling out critics who dare disparage it, before they've seen it themselves. It will be interesting to see how these hyped-up fans actually react to Phoenix's disturbing, vulnerable performance. They think they're getting a forceful anti-hero to root for, do they? Wait'll they get a load of him. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an anti-hero beaten down by society in Todd Phillips’ Joker, a film that’s already sparked controversy for its “unrelenting grimness,” it’s protagonist’s embrace of nihilistic violence.

"Oct 4, 2019"," At this point, it’s undeniable to say that The Joker is one of the great, iconic villains of cinema. For over 50 years, we’ve seen amazing actors take on the legendary role, including Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger (and to lesser effect, Jared Leto). Each performer has brought their own unique talents to the part, imbuing it with specific traits to make it all their own, making you wonder if, after all this time, it would even be possible for anyone to come up with a new rendition. To find the answer, director/co-writer Todd Phillips enlisted the great Joaquin Phoenix to take on the iconic role for “Joker,” a new, gritty take on the villain’s origin story that seeks to tell us how the Clown Prince of Crime became who he is. It was certainly a bold move, but with such casting, it hardly seemed like it could go wrong. As the film opens, we meet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a struggling clown performer who has dreams of being a stand-up comedian. He lives with his mother (Frances Conroy), and constantly has to put up with all the hassles that life throws at him, such as a condition that has him laughing hysterically for no reason. Eventually he is pushed to the edge, causing him to start a kind of riotous movement in the city. This, coupled with a secret that his mother has kept from him all of these years, makes his life spin even more out of control, ultimately turning him into a dark product of his circumstances who feels the need to unleash his anger. Not only was it a bold move to think that another actor could come up with yet another iteration of the popular villain, but it was also rather bold to divert from accepted canon to tell his gritty origin. However, this is what makes “Joker” such a fascinating experience. As an origin story it’s rather compelling to see what drove the man down the path we know he has to eventually tread, and as a character study it’s equally captivating to see the effects it has on the man himself (i.e. the transition from harmless wannabe entertainer to someone quite dangerous). This isn’t a somewhat simple case of falling into acid and going mad, but rather the case of a man beaten down by society and pushed to the edge. In order to portray this transformation in a realistic manner, they opted to go with one of the very best actors of our time. Joaquin Phoenix has always had a remarkable ability to transform himself as his roles require, a talent that has earned him three Academy Award nominations throughout his incredible career. As Arthur Fleck, he continues to show us this talent as his character is beaten, mocked, and pushed around to the point where he goes from being the loving, devoted son to taking out his frustrations on others. At times, it’s a very subtle performance, while quite intense at others, but Phoenix plays the range marvelously, and it wouldn’t be a surprise at all to see him earn his fourth Oscar nod. So how does he stack up against the other actors we’ve seen portray the infamous clown? Well, it’s kind of hard to say, as Arthur Fleck doesn’t really fully become the Joker that we’re familiar with, nor can we even be sure if he’s meant to be THE Joker that we’ve come to know and love. This could be seen as the starting point for his future endeavors, or it could be seen as the inspiration for the eventual true iteration of the character (the one that falls into the vat of acid). What’s important is that Phoenix makes it his own. With his dead stare and creepy, spontaneous laugh, what he does with the character is downright chilling, and at times, darkly humorous (a trait that many of the previous actors have shared). In short, he was simply the perfect choice to take it on. Overall, this look at the Joker’s origin is a mostly-compelling tale that will provide comic book fans an interesting glimpse into an alternate take at how the infamous villain came to be. It’s intriguing, funny, and at times, shocking. It can be a little languid here and there, but Phoenix is always at the top of his game to keep it moving along smoothly. In the end, it’s quite gratifying to say that a film that many questioned as being unnecessary, on top of being from a director who’s mainly known for making bad comedies, turned out pretty well, showing that there can still be life in a character even after they’ve seemingly been done to death. 3/4 stars.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Thereâs an inherent worry saying Joker is a bad movie, particularly with the knowledge that female writers have been threatened for stating just such an opinion. But itâs telling a telling statement, both from the angle of women being terrorized to readers being so riled up over a review that they would go to such lengths. Maybe thatâs what happens when a movie so unabashedly strives to give justification to the Clown Prince of Evilâs actions as Todd Phillipsâ Joker does. Phillips wears his inspirations more proudly than Quentin Tarantino, but where Tarantino finds reverence in his source material and, more importantly, understands the tone of those inspirations, Phillips perverts and twists the meaning of all his homages, from Taxi Driver to Network. Slather on so much pretension masquerading as high art and you have an insufferable, two-hour snoozefest that should make you look askance at anyone who tries to justify their appreciation of it. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a clown by day and a wannabe stand-up comedian at night. When he loses his job, it takes him down a path of darkness, complemented by the horrors of a â70s-tinged Gotham City thatâs already decrepit. Arthur will unleash his id, known as Joker, and spark a revolution from which thereâs no return. Itâs impossible to separate Jokerâs narrative from what director Phillips wants to gain with it. Set in the garbage strike world of 1970s New York (er, Gotham City), Arthur lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in a pretty decent apartment considering the near chronic reminders that theyâre struggling. Itâs a world where people are so cruel that black and Latino children beat on Arthur just for kicks, leaving Arthur as the broken man whom no one believes, purely because his boss doesnât like him. The only one to throw any kindness his way is a young single mother (played by Zazie Beetz with just slightly more lines than Margot Robbieâs Sharon Tate). The problem is watching this in 2019, with Phillips acting to remind you that, apparently in 1976 this was actually OK. Arthur plays with a little boy only to be told off by the kidâs mother, yet the audience is meant to perceive this as an overreaction. A woman is harassed by three men on the subway and at one point looks to Arthur for kindness only to have him do nothing. Is Arthur supposed to be a repressed hero beaten down by society? Itâs unclear because the script doesnât seem to understand what everyoneâs problem is. When all else fails (which happens too much in this movie), Arthur falls on minutes of unhinged laughter. These moments, which go on forever, are passed off as indicative of Arthurâs mental disability; he has a card he shows to people during his laughing jags. This is actually a real illness called, in laymanâs terms, emotional incontinence, but thereâs no belief anyone associated with the film knows of this. Instead, his âdisabilityâ (in quotes because the third act leaves some questions about it) is utilized to explain away bad actions. His personality isnât weird; heâs disabled. His actions arenât bad; heâs disabled. This is contrasted with an actual disabled character, a little person who is routinely ridiculedÂ by another friend of Arthurâs and, in one scene, is placed as a punchline because he canât reach a lock. If this is what Phillips says he canât joke about, heâs wrong, as my audience was howling (with me, the lone disabled critic, cringing). Thereâs no doubt Phoenix commits to the character. His Arthur is creepy and off-putting, but itâs obvious Phoenix wants to infuse vulnerability and nuance into the character. When he first performs onstage thereâs an earnestness to him. He wants to connect with people. But since the script is so content to have Phoenix dance around his underwear or laugh, itâs hard for Phoenix to really promote the character beyond that. It presents a disconnect between the actorâs intentions for the character and the directors. With the film clocking in at two hours, this disconnect also extends to the plotline. Not much happens in this movie despite so much happening. There are several plot points that develop, but they ramp up heavily toward the third act, leaving the first 45 minutes or so as an aimless pastiche of â70s features and mind-numbing sequences of Joker laughing, dancing, or otherwise just watching things in silence. And when a character does talk, itâs in a somnambulant monotone, as if theyâre being put to sleep on-camera. After the rough first hour, there are plots involving the Wayne family, Arthurâs background, and his interest in talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) â which are interesting, but theyâre all stopped dead by moments of Joker justâ¦ being weird. Thereâs not a sense of plot so much as a sense of discomfort, and thatâs not enough to sustain 120 minutes. When the violence does happen, itâs brutal, uncompromising, and way too authentic. Much has been written about what type of people a movie like Joker will attract, and itâs hard not to plainly see what the script thinks of Joker: Heâs a deranged revolutionary failed by a crumbling government system. (Seriously, if Phillips wants to hear about the crumbling government system involving people with disabilities he should pull up a chair.) Itâs hard watching Phoenix baldly chase down people and shoot them, or blow someoneâs head off in long shot and not think of our times. Phillips wants you to, but itâs unclear what he hopes youâll gain from it. At the end of the day, Joker is just boring. Thatâs the cold truth. Joker believes it has such a new and unique message, that itâs a piece of art. But really itâs as tacky as a velvet painting. Phoenix is great, but he always is, and because no other character is really that defined this is pretty much a one-man show.

"Oct 4, 2019","The most audacious comic-book-inspired film ever made; one that doubles-down on its depravity with no remorse. That said, it's impossible not to become hypnotized by its external beauty and indiscriminate brutality.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," The DC Comics villain Joker is in no way, shape, or form a hero. On the surface, the psychological thriller that explores his origin story could be seen as a glorification of a deplorable character with a long list of victims. Does the movie manipulate the viewer into sympathizing with a man descending into madness? Not exactly. Although the film walks a fine line between exploration and validation, Joker is ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters. It’s a gritty and morbidly beautiful journey with little comfort to spare, but many messages to mull over.
Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy) who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver (8 Mile), the film is produced by DC Films, Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative, and Joint Effort, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It stars Joaquin Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here), Robert De Niro (Taxi Driver), Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), and Frances Conroy (Catwoman).
Joker takes place in the fictional Gotham City (similar to New York City) in the year 1981. The country is going through divisive and rough political and economic times. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man who suffers from mental illness attempting to begin a stand-up comedy career with failed results. He struggles with earning a living, taking care of his sick mother, and functioning in a world where he is often ostracized and marginalized. Arthur will eventually lose his battle with being “normal,” but before then viewers are taken on a journey of how this came to be. For two hours we bear witness to a tragic breakdown, not only of Arthur but of the society he belongs to.
The most obvious highlight of the film is the performance by Phoenix. The actor plays Arthur with nuanced layering. He’s already a broken man trying to function like he’s whole. Phoenix does well not to portray Arthur like a completely innocent character who is merely a victim of circumstance but at times one who thrives in the darkness always right beneath the surface. He makes clear choices and doesn’t outright try to compel the viewer to like Arthur, but to see him as a real person. Arthur is not a caricature or one-dimensional would-be villain. He’s not a villain at all really in the beginning, but a person who has highs of joy, lows of sadness, and conflicting feelings over which path he should ultimately take. Phoenix conveys all of this in an engrossing way.
The less obvious, but perhaps the most compelling, aspect of the film is the interweaving of class politics and social commentary. Phoenix gives a great performance of someone on the brink of insanity, but by placing his downfall in the larger context of systemic ills of society, a more resonating story is told. Arthur is both victim and villain at different times under a system that can push many people to their breaking points.
It seems purposeful that the film begins the origin story in 1981. The beginning of the 1980s in the United States was a turbulent time for working people. Poor economic conditions and political shifts brought about a nation of people frustrated with the status quo and looking for change. The movie makes multiple references to this somber atmosphere as many are out of work, public assistance programs are being defunded, and a general feeling of unrest hangs heavy in the streets. Arthur himself is restless, feeling overlooked, unseen, and unheard. He has a low-end job that gives him little respect, and subpar public assistance for his mental health issues. There is little help for Arthur systemically. He needs it, but it’s not there for him. He’s one of the many left behind. He’s one of the many feeling oppressed and frustrated.
This makes sense as the 1980s is classified as being a time when what was considered the New Right continued to gain more power. President Ronald Reagan ushered in what has been classified as the “Reagan Revolution” of conservatism, where social programs were cut along with a lasting impact being made in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, and the Cold War. If nothing else, Arthur’s lack of proper medical treatment is definitely a result of it, as he’s a victim of budget cuts.
In this regard, the movie walks a delicate line between justifying Arthur’s actions and simply exploring some of the circumstances that may have gotten him to this point. Is the film trying to say that any one of us can potentially be a Joker? Not necessarily, but it does present certain turning points in a way that asks the viewer not to outright condemn Arthur, but to understand him better. This will make some people uncomfortable. The film clearly attempts to ease this concept of understanding by making many of Arthur’s victims characters one may believe “deserve” to be punished. This too will make some uncomfortable as it could be seen as an attempt to water down his villainy.
Lines are drawn in the movie between the rich and the poor. The story is shown parallel to a growing movement of disgruntled working citizens demanding something different, along with an elite wealthy class that looks down upon the poor as a burden to society. The working people are angry, and that anger is shown to be just as dangerous as Arthur’s but on an even larger scale. The movie shows that with no emergence of capable leadership anarchy can fill the vacuum. It seems clear that Arthur’s character is being explored as a symbol of this chaos and destruction.
Yet, even if there is conflict over just how justified Arthur is in his actions, the movie does a fine job of showing the insidiousness of the system he ultimately becomes a product of. He’s not the only villain. Those in power are shown to take advantage of those without power. Certain lives are held in higher regard than others depending on what class they belong to. The media pushes propaganda that is in favor of those that own the networks. People march in the streets with protest signs displaying slogans against fascism and oppression. There’s an internal battle we witness on screen with Arthur, but there’s a larger battle going on between the haves and the have nots that is just as engrossing to watch.
The one shortcoming is the lack of more fleshed-out female characters. When anger and frustration are shown outside of Arthur it is usually male. This seems like a missed opportunity given that those most adversely affected by poverty in the 1980s were women, often women of color. The film does well to showcase Black women actresses, such as Beetz and the various caseworkers Arthur interacts with, but none are shown to have much perspective beyond the function they serve to Arthur.
Overall, Joker goes beyond the usual comic book movie fanfare. There are references to Batman, Joker’s arch-enemy, that will serve as a treat to those who know the comic books, but are not alienating for those who do not. The violence is brutal and not for the faint of heart. This is not a happy film, and one can argue that it doesn’t have much optimism for humanity, but it does explore some concepts of the human condition that will have plenty of people talking long after the credits roll.
 The DC Comics villain Joker is in no way, shape, or form a hero. On the surface, the psychological thriller that explores his origin story could be seen as a glorification of a deplorable character with a long list of victims. Does the movie manipulate the viewer into sympathizing with a man descending into madness? Not exactly. Although the film walks a fine line between exploration and validation, Joker is ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters. It’s a gritty and morbidly beautiful journey with little comfort to spare, but many messages to mull over. Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy) who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver (8 Mile), the film is produced by DC Films, Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative, and Joint Effort, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It stars Joaquin Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here), Robert De Niro (Taxi Driver), Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), and Frances Conroy (Catwoman). Joker takes place in the fictional Gotham City (similar to New York City) in the year 1981. The country is going through divisive and rough political and economic times. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man who suffers from mental illness attempting to begin a stand-up comedy career with failed results. He struggles with earning a living, taking care of his sick mother, and functioning in a world where he is often ostracized and marginalized. Arthur will eventually lose his battle with being “normal,” but before then viewers are taken on a journey of how this came to be.

"Oct 4, 2019"," “Joker” centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen. Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society. A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. There’s no need to beat around the bush. Joaquin Phoenix nailed this performance from beginning to end. At no point does he falter in his portrayal of a troubled and mentally ill man that gets pushed over a dangerous edge. Phoenix brought a lot of depth to the character for audiences who may not be familiar with how complex “Arthur Fleck” can be. I think the strongest aspect to his acting is how he’s able to portray the internal dysfunction of his character into an external expression of his fractured perception of reality. That, in itself, carries the movie the whole way through. You can’t help but to be captivated by Phoenix every time he’s on screen because you’re always wondering just when will he finally break.  His maniacal laugh is both awkward and offsetting. Some of the best moments will come from his extremely uncomfortable scenes that are cringe-worthy (ie: his stand up scene) or the random acts of violence. Regardless of the situation, his performance will bring forth some sort of reaction from you as the movie goes on. One obvious highlight for this film will be found in both the editing and overall cinematography. There are moments in the film that are shot in a way that almost make you feel like you’re experiencing the world with and through the Joker character. Without getting into spoilers, the way the movie is edited also creates a fun experience for audiences to not only challenge our perceptions of the film, but to probably even warrant multiple viewings. I do believe that director Todd Phillips accomplished his goal in presenting a city (Gotham) that eventually will need a caped crusader to save it. The setting and atmosphere of the film is well established by borrowing some of the feel and flair from the 70’s era of filmmaking. You get a really good sense of the state of the society in the fictional city of Gotham. As a matter of fact, the city essentially becomes a character in itself which also compliments Joker’s character as well. Another plus for Joker can be found in its unique approach to the Batman mythos. What I appreciated here as a comic fan, is that this film took some leeway with giving us a different take on how the world of Gotham came about in this rendition. It was intriguing to see how this film took a unique angle to show the political and sociological situations that feed into the character of Joker. What makes this all work is that Batman or Bruce Wayne really don’t have to be centralized in this story for you to care and that is a real strength given Joker’s direct connection to the Batman character. A personal issue I had with this character (so pop your grain of salt here) was how overly sympathetic they made the Joker. While the film may try to go for a more realistic and grounded approach with the character, it still ends up pushing some unbelievable situations for dramatic effect. It’s basically one issue on top another that becomes inescapable for Fleck’s character. There’s no denying the fact that at every single turn of this film, whenever Fleck does something bad, the movie gives some sort of rationalization behind it. While his actions may not be justified all the time, there are enough reasons provided where audiences may sympathize to the point where they understand his actions, even if they may not condone them. In fairness to the movie, there are some instances in the film that do refute this, but that would get into spoiler territory. What I will say, however, is that the imagery of a film carries much more weight than a simple line of writing that tries to undo this or that, or explain something else away.  The last thing I’d want to do is feel for the Joker. This film, regardless of his actions, leaves too deep of an impression, from a visual standpoint, where you can’t help but understand him more than you may want to. Joker is a captivating and insanely brilliant presentation of the classic comic book villain thanks to the award worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Joker isn’t a typical comic book movie and it’s also not your typical arthouse film that only the purest of movie buffs enjoy. Joker was an interesting blend that tries to appeal to both audiences, and I would say that despite any divisiveness, it does accomplish that goal. Comic fans can look forward to yet another story within the Batman world, and non comic book fans can watch a dramatic tragedy befall an extremely damaged character. This movie practically demands to be seen multiple times. There are some insanely deep nuances in the story that a lot of people will miss with a single viewing. I’ll fully admit one other thing too. I had to change my ratings and reviews for this based on my second time seeing it, and it caused my score to up even higher because of the things that I initially missed. I’m definitely recommending this to be seen in theaters and have a great time. Joker is in theaters now.  Be sure to follow E-Man’s Movie Reviews on Facebook, Subscribe on YouTube, or follow me on Twitter/IG @EmansReviews for even more movie news and reviews!",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","Phoenix's performance is monumental, a black hole of agony and despair that attracts everything else in the film towards him, consuming it in its deep and inescapable darkness. [Full Review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," DC Comics movies have always been darker than Marvel, and in the hands of directors like Christopher Nolan and Patty Jenkins, the darkness is balanced and intriguing. Not so with Todd Phillips’ Joker. Yes, the same writer/director/producer who brought you A Star is Born and The Hangover movies has come up with one of the most gratuitously grim films of the decade. You can’t help but wonder for whom the film rolls. Really, is anyone, even the most aggravated incel, interested in seeing an annoying misanthrope with a chronic laugher problem go from unbalanced and depressed clown to unhinged and brutal murderer? Put him in a rotten and corrupt Gotham, which is literally portrayed as a festering garbage heap, and you have grim, unrelenting violence and misery. Just what everyone’s looking for in a relaxing night out at the movies after a hard week at work. There are those who say the ugliness of the film is made endurable by Joaquin Phoenix’s riveting performance as Arthur Fleck, the poor, mistreated comedian gone wrong. And he is extraordinary… to the point of non-stop scenery chewing, leaving talented actors like like Frances Conroy, who plays the mother Arthur rooms with, (where else would a guy like this live?), Robert De Niro, as the talk show host Arthur adores, and  Zazie Beetz as his attractive neighbor, with all the responsibilities of animated props. I will say the cinematography is intriguing in a gruesome sort of way, and the music is curiously compelling. But I’m really reaching for positives here. In essence, Joker is a thoroughly uncomfortable and unlikable film. Go if you really must, but keep the kids away. There are certain things no one really needs to see.

"Oct 4, 2019","Joker is an impressive achievement on many levels, but the sloppy mixed message of the film and the near torturous dread of the entire outing leave very little entertainment to be had.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 4, 2019"," Before attending the press screening for Todd Phillips’ “Joker,” I wondered if Joaquin Phoenix’s comic book villain was supposed to integrate into the greater DC Universe. The trailer seemed so moody and visceral — even by DC’s comparatively dark standards — that I got the sense “Joker” would be more of a standalone film than a cog to fit Marvel-style into some larger story. My instinct was right, but I was still completely unprepared for what I saw. Even now, I’m not entirely sure how I feel about it. On the surface, “Joker” is an origin story for Batman’s most iconic nemesis, but that description is laughably insufficient. In fact, the Batman ties are probably “Joker’s” biggest weakness; Phillips’ film is such an immersive character study that hearing names like Wayne and Gotham almost shake you out of the experience.  And yet, “Joker” is set in a pre-Caped Crusader Gotham City, in the midst of a garbage strike that has inflamed class tensions throughout the city. In the midst of the decay, sickly, fragile Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) works as a clown-for-hire, and dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian. He lives with his ailing mother (Frances Conroy) and suffers from an awkward condition that leads to sudden bursts of involuntary laughter.  Arthur has spent time in an institution and struggles with delusions. He watches a popular late night talk show and imagines himself getting spotlighted in the audience. He wants to make people laugh. As he explains to his social worker (Sharon Washington), he wants people to know he exists. After Arthur gets jumped in an alley, a co-worker (Glenn Fleshler) gives him an unregistered gun, which leads to tragic consequences when a trio of drunken Wall Street-types decide to harass him on the subway. After losing his job, Arthur finally gets up the nerve to try stand-up, and he bombs.  Arthur and Gotham are on a collision course. As Gotham drops deeper into despair, Fleck loses touch with reality and normalcy. “Joker” may be set in Gotham City, but what we see screams New York in the ’80s, and that offers us an insight into what Phillips is up to.  At its heart, “Joker” is the spiritual sequel to “Taxi Driver,” Martin Scorcese’s surreal tale of a New York cabbie turned vigilante, and his protagonist is Travis Bickle 2.0. It’s no coincidence that Robert De Niro plays Arthur’s favorite talk show host, or that Arthur exists in a nihilistic porn-infested urban neighborhood that inspires its residents — like the pretty single mom down the hall (Zazie Beetz) — to point imaginary guns at their heads. Lots of comic book movies will try to integrate contemporary political and social issues to make them appear more relevant. “Joker” flips that trope, the same way it flips the superhero origin story formula. Here the comic book origin story is merely a device; it’s an excuse to explore the relationship between mental illness and violence, and hold up a mirror to the dark side of contemporary society. The result is utterly engrossing. Driven by Phoenix’s staggering performance, Phillips’ pitch-perfect directing, and Lawrence Sher’s haunting cinematography, it might be the best film of the year. But “Joker’s” open-ended ambiguity also makes it dangerous. It defies the idea of a simple good/bad rating, and to categorically recommend or condemn “Joker” feels incomplete, if not irresponsible. This hesitation only partially comes from the R-rated content, which mostly comes in the form of some late graphic violence, scattered profanity and fleeting flashes of the dirty pictures Arthur tapes inside his joke journal. The hesitation largely comes because “Joker” is so successful at portraying conflict and chaos. We know the Joker is a “bad guy,” but Gotham isn’t so sure, and Arthur draws our sympathy, at least early on. There are no heroes in this Gotham City. Even the usually beloved Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is portrayed as an out-of-touch, philandering elitist. Arthur’s Bernie Goetz-like encounter on the subway accelerates him on his path of villainy, and it also acts as the flashpoint in a growing class war. “Joker” wants to connect the dots between mental illness, cultural tensions and terrible violence, but what will amount to a thoughtful warning for some could send a different message to others. Ultimately, “Joker” is a portrait of a man toppling from a state of exasperated fragility to a state of unhinged violence, set against a backdrop of our own worst tendencies. Its ties to the world of comic book heroes are completely incidental. It’s dark, violent and unsettling, but it’s also extremely thoughtful and executed to perfection. If you do choose to see it, it will stick with you for a long time.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Todd Phillips‘ “Joker” is a film of images. That is what lingers more than its plot. What will surely generate the most attention is the searing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, which cackles and smiles a lot, but is one of the year’s most depressing, nihilistic turns delivered by any actor. Those walking in should be warned, this is not a Batman movie, or has any credible link to what is generally perceived as a “comic book adaptation.” It is its own brooding thing, devoid of heart and absorbing all that is sick of our times without fully commenting on any of it. Much of it is effective as pure aesthetic. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a lonely soul working as a clown for an agency in 1980s Gotham City, which feels more like New York. One day he’s jumped without reason by some local kids who steal his sign and beat him up. He takes a co-worker’s advice and gets a gun. His evenings are spent in a rundown apartment with his ailing mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who babbles endlessly about seeking financial help from local billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who she claims to have known years before. Arthur would like to get closer to his neighbor, the nice Sophie (Zazie Beetz), but he’s a loner dreaming of becoming a standup comic even though he’s never hit the stage. It doesn’t help that he has an unidentified mental condition which provokes sudden, spontaneous laughter. Then events begin to spiral out of Arthur’s control. One night on the subway he shoots a group of Wall Street jerks who were harassing a female passenger before turning on Arthur. When he finally gives standup a try at a local club he bombs, only to have a tape of his performance be used for laughs on a show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur’s fragile psyche can only take so much, and it’s not long before he snaps. Phillips is not a name one would readily associate with themes of loneliness in the decay of modern, urban capitalism. A king of raunch, his movies like “The Hangover” series and “Due Date” celebrated debauchery with shallow glee. “Joker” is Phillips attempting to prove he can make a serious movie, even an arthouse one. Visually he succeeds and any appeal “Joker” will have with audiences might be based on the way Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher craft baroque images of a rotting city and Phoenix’s skeletal frame wandering through it. There is genuine eeriness in shots of Arthur, decked in a crimson suit and clown makeup dancing his way down some steps or waiting behind a curtain to appear onstage, cast in a neon glow. The best moments in this movie are the ones without dialogue, when the camera lingers on Arthur’s demented and sad face as he sits at home lost in his thoughts, or stares out a bus window. He has dreamlike fantasies of dating Sophie and even rushing home after his subway murder to kiss her at her doorstep. These are effective moments that capture the tragic delusions of a lonely, volatile person. Giving it all tension is the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, who composed the atmospheric music for HBO’s “Chernobyl” and here gives Arthur a theme that sounds like a metallic cello screeching to capture his growing insanity.  But if the movie works visually the screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver, who knows about grit with credits that include “The Fighter” and “8 Mile,” is a shallow exercise essentially recycling elements from Martin Scorsese movies like “Taxi Driver” and particularly “The King of Comedy.” As in the latter, Arthur wants to be a comedian but hasn’t ever really put effort into it, he prefers to fantasize about being embraced by Murray Franklin on his show in the same way he daydreams about Sophie without actually engaging with her. It’s a repeat of Robert De Niro’s character in the Scorsese movie as a wannabe comic who stalks Jerry Lewis and tries to impress a bartender he likes with lies. This makes the De Niro casting more of a wink than anything else. Of course those who follow film news know Scorsese himself was originally a producer on this project. But what exactly Phillips wants to say with this material is unclear. Arthur is told his medication and counseling sessions will end because of budget cuts, he’s fired from work for doing a clown show at a children’s hospital and forgetting about his gun which slips out of his costume, essentially he becomes the quintessential time bomb who can’t get a break. Fame comes after he shoots the Wall Street bros and the downtrodden of Gotham begin wearing clown masks at protests against the elite. In “The Dark Knight” Heath Ledger’s unsurpassable Joker was a feral, anarcho-terrorist who was driven by the need to demolish civilized order, Arthur Fleck is invited onto Franklin’s show after his tape becomes a hit and admits he believes in nothing. He’s simply a “loser” who ends up representing the 1% by shooting down some Wall Street suits, one of whom starts swinging around a subway car pole singing “Send in the Clowns.” What Arthur is meant to represent or convey is a mystery only Phillips might understand, because all he evokes on screen is aimless pain, which many people do actually endure but should a film simply be despair for entertainment and nothing more? The storyline involving Penny’s obsession with Thomas Wayne leads Arthur to discover horrific truths about his childhood which develop little in terms of narrative, they are merely another episode in his march towards the film’s calculated, bloody climax.  At the center of this symphony of distress is Joaquin Phoenix, who again proves he is an actor of great skill. His physique alone becomes a map of suffering. Like his religious acolyte in “The Master,” Phoenix’s shockingly thin frame becomes part of the film’s visual power. He bends himself or dances with a creepy elegance, we never even see him eat and when he stretches a smile with his fingers he looks like death. This isn’t the manic Joker of the Batman movies, but a sad man who cackles and does a jig to at least distract himself from the crumbling world of his life. If Phoenix is nominated for an Oscar it wouldn’t be a surprise, he dominates every scene with unnerving presence. Some actors can absolutely take a weak script and elevate it, this is what Phoenix does in “Joker.” Even when the final scenes turn into an absurd riot, with one ludicrous moment connecting the whole affair to the Batman franchise, you can’t deny the cosmetic, visual flare of Arthur rising above the rioters with a crimson smile illuminated by burning cars. It’s a bizarre case of the imagery saying more than the movie itself. It’s such moments that work better than Phillips’s crass use of violence, as in one scene where Arthur bashes in someone’s head in his apartment. It’s not provocative or shocking, just needless. Some might consider Arthur’s final act of vengeance when he finally goes on TV bold, but it feels more like a gimmick.  There has been much chatter in the media over “Joker” possibly influencing potentially violent subgroups like “incels.” It’s hard to say. Some might just find it cathartic since it’s so depressed. Even Trump haters might interpret something of the Donald in the dismissive billionaire Thomas Wayne. “Joker” isn’t even much of a straight forward plot, but instead a collection of sad moments. It’s not a comic book movie, but a shallow requiem. Take from it what you will, but it surely won’t be hope.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," His long career has been marked by much weight lost and gained in the service of his craft, while working with some of the great directors and crafting memorable bad guys. I’m speaking of course of Robert De Niro, for it is his cinematic soul that brings Joker to life. De Niro and director Martin Scorsese surely had no idea they were laying this film’s foundations, 43 years ago, when the actor played a mentally unstable, gun-obsessed loner in Taxi Driver. Nor did they likely give it much thought when they re-teamed six years later for The King of Comedy, with De Niro as an unsuccessful stand-up who fixates on a talk-show host played by Jerry Lewis. And yet here is De Niro, a spry 76-year-old, as a brusque late-night figure named Murray Franklin, who books Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck after seeing a videotape someone shot of him flailing and failing ignominiously at a Gotham comedy club. (“Check out this joker,” he says by way of introduction. Arthur asks him to upper-case the J.) Arthur has long dreamed of being on Murray’s show – literally so in one scene that finds him half-asleep in front of the TV and hallucinating his way inside. Ok, I’ll grant that Phoenix’s performance is also strong. Arthur is a socially awkward citizen, living with his mother (Frances Conroy), crushing on his single-mom neighbour (Zazie Beetz), but unsure what to do about it, and working as a rent-a-clown, which involves everything from hospital appearances to holding up going-out-of-business signs. Going out of business looks to be a growth industry in Gotham, which combines the worst bits of mid-century New York, including subway graffiti, rampant muggings, failing social services and a garbage strike to rival the one in ’68. Production designer Mark Friedberg has worked on Autumn in New York, Synecdoche, New York, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, so his N.Y. cred is solid. And there’s a great, cello-heavy score by Icelandic cellist Hildur Gudnadóttir, who has worked with Denis Villeneuve on Arrival, Prisoners and Sicario, and probably wishes she were old enough to have been part of the Jaws theme. But the real behind-the-camera surprise is the director, Todd Phillips, who for the last 10 years stopped making Hangover movies only long enough to make the road-trip comedy Due Date with most of the same cast. He also made 2000’s Road Trip. And, ok, 2016’s dark comedy War Dogs. But that darkness has nothing on Joker, which is R-rated – like Deadpool, but not for the same silly/naughty reasons. This is a fascinating movie, but I wouldn’t call it fun. It heaps derision, scorn and misfortune on Arthur until you wonder how he can handle any more. Of course, he soon can’t. We know where Arthur’s going to end up, even if we don’t know the precise route. And what a film Joker would be if it were sprung on audiences unawares, without a half-century of clownish baggage courtesy of everyone from Cesar Romero to Jared Leto. But every generation gets its own Joker. Jack Nicholson’s was acid-dipped into his perpetually grinning mug. Phoenix’s wears simple face paint, but carries his own psychic scars in the form of a Tourette’s-like condition that causes him to vomit out laughter at inopportune times. He even carries a little card to alert people, although (A) it shouldn’t require a “MORE ON BACK” flip-over and (B) he really should produce it at the first sign of trouble, not the third or fourth. I don’t mean this to sound like victim blaming, though that is what happens to Arthur through most of the movie. Gotham’s a rough town, the thinking seems to go, and people should tough it out or get out. Trouble is, Arthur has nowhere to go but down, especially after coming to the conclusion that billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who briefly employed his mom, is in fact his dad. Wayne violently rejects this accusation. (He also has a legitimate son, Bruce, with whom you may be familiar.) The scene in question follows a sudden explosion of graphic violence. Soft-shoeing on the stairs, Phoenix looks almost skeletal, so much weight did he lose for the role. But he’s added something intangible for the scene, something that completes the transformation of his character. It’s disturbing, but you can’t take your eyes off him.

"Oct 4, 2019"," FILM REVIEW – JOKER. With Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen. Written by Todd Phillips & Scott Silver. Directed by Todd Phillips. Rated R for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images. 121 minutes. One of the most anticipated films of the year, JOKER is likely to divide moviegoers and critics alike. It may well develop a strong cult following, but for many it will come across as overwrought and disappointing. In spite of an intense performance by Joaquin Phoenix, the movie can’t overcome director/co-writer Todd Phillips’ character arc for him where the protagonist turning into a homicidal sociopath is what passes for a satisfying ending. The movie is set in the “Batman” universe but focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who works as a party clown for hire and aspires to be a comedian. The location is Gotham City and the time is unclear but from various cues seems to be sometime in the ‘70s or ‘80s. For three-quarters of the film’s two-hour running time we watch Fleck be abused and humiliated. Spinning a sign in front of a store, teens steal the sign, beat him with it, and then savagely attack him. The result is his boss telling him he must produce the sign, or it will be docked from his pay. His mother (Frances Conroy), is a doddering old woman who keeps writing to businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) asking for help. One of the few things brightening their bitter lives is Murray Franklin’s (Robert DeNiro) TV talk show. Fleck dreams of performing on Franklin’s show and gets his “break” in as cruel a manner as possible. Fleck also becomes attached to Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a single mom who lives down the hall. There are a number of twists in the story – none to be revealed here – that brings us to the final half hour where Fleck, having hit bottom, assumes the identity of the Joker. The film has a number of problems. Its depiction of Gotham City is beyond bleak. Except for Sophie and the children we see (including future Batman Bruce Wayne played by Dante Pereira-Olson), everyone is evil or indifferent. There are two scenes where total strangers brutally attack Fleck, simply because they can. The city is in the midst of a garbage strike, so piles of refuse – and the rats it attracts – are the constant background. And Thomas Wayne, who is running for mayor, declares that those who do not help themselves are “clowns.” As a psychological study of watching Fleck become so destroyed that it causes him to go mad, the film is of interest, but ultimately it makes Fleck the hero of the story by not providing any sympathetic viewpoint but his. It will be noted that the movie owes something to two DeNiro movies by director Martin Scorsese, “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.” Phoenix’s Fleck is kin to the De Niro characters in both films, both the borderline psychotic Travis Bickle of the former and the obsessive aspiring comedian Rupert Pupkin of the latter. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His latest novel is Father of the Bride of Frankenstein. He is the 2018 recipient of the Skylark Award given by the New England Science Fiction Association. He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts. Seems like you missed the entire point of the movie, your perspective seems childlike. I suppose you wanted a Marvel-esque Joker movie with bright colors and overly done CG. No, didn’t miss the point of the movie at all.  Just had a different opinion than yours, one that many other people share.  You’ll just have to learn that not everyone agrees with you.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 4, 2019"," Well before its official release, Joker already had an armlock on our attention. The movie's trailer made clear that this was not another slick comic-book epic, but rather a grim, R-rated story of homicidal madness set in the bad old New York (well, ""Gotham"") of the early 1980s. And it was immediately apparent that the picture's star, Joaquin Phoenix, was up to something unusually interesting. Now, at last, the movie is here, and Phoenix gives, as expected, a bombshell performance as Arthur Fleck, the tormented protagonist, whose miserable tics and twitches never abate, and whose journey—his horrid mutation into Gotham's cackling scourge, the Joker—is the picture's dismal subject. The movie gets off to a strangely muted start, and even fans of the DC comics in which the demented clown has been giving Batman so much guff for the past 80 years may grow restless. The film takes its time demonstrating Arthur's many problems (among other things, social-service budget cuts have deprived him of the several medications he must take for his mental instability) and sinking us deep into this dank and rancid world. There are a lot of laughs along the way, but they all emanate from Fleck, who has a neurological disorder that causes him to break into sudden storms of laughter at the most inappropriate moments. (He carries cards that explain his problem: ""I have a condition""). But the movie gives us nothing to laugh about—or even smile about, really—since its only non-basket-case characters are Sophie Drummond (Zazie Beetz), a sweet single mother whom we see bestowing on Fleck the only uncomplicated affection he's ever experienced, and a kindly dwarf named Gary (Leigh Gill), an employee of the same tacky rent-a-clown operation where Arthur works. (We see Arthur in big floppy boots and a cap of clown hair dancing around on the sidewalk in front of a store, waving a going-out-of-business sign.) Director Todd Phillips (purveyor of the Hangover movies) and production designer Mark Friedberg have created a hell-pit Manhattan of rats and trash and roiling, rain-lashed streets that beats Arthur down at every turn. He's stomped in an alley by a pack of feral kids, and on a subway car by a trio of drunken stock-market louts (employees of a company called Wayne Investments, hold that thought). When a coworker gives Arthur a pistol to defend himself, we know that downward is the only direction in which this already bleak story is likely to go. Arthur still lives with his loosely wrapped mom, Penny (Frances Conroy), in a dingey apartment where they while away time watching a popular talk show hosted by the smug Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur has long harbored the impossible dream of being a standup comic—now, suddenly, that dream comes true. After trying out his pitiful act at a comedy club open-mike night, a tape of Arthur's disastrous performance makes its way to Murray, who plays it on the air as an exercise in pointless cruelty. But viewer response is enthusiastic, and Murray is compelled to invite Arthur to come on his show. This aspect of the story is of course an upside-down reference to Martin Scorsese's 1982 film, The King of Comedy, in which De Niro played the delusional loner with the unlikely showbiz dream and Jerry Lewis was the frosty talk-show host. In fact, Phillips's whole movie can be read as a salute to Scorsese and De Niro: the scuzzy exteriors are highly reminiscent of Scorsese's 1976 Taxi Driver—another tale about a combustible loner—and even the name of De Niro's character here, Murray Franklin, seems like a nod to a pair of streets in Manhattan's Tribeca district, where De Niro has long presided over an annual film festival and also runs a number of restaurants (one of them on Franklin Street). Arthur comes to believe that he and Wayne have a secret connection. Showing up unannounced at Wayne Manor, he has an uneasy conversation, through a barred gate, with Wayne's young son Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), and then an angry confrontation with the family butler (Douglas Hodge). As the movie proceeds toward its climax, there's a startlingly gruesome assault, and then another one, as Arthur comes into his destiny. As appropriately dark as the movie is, no one of sound mind is going to be driven to murder or mayhem by it. (I'm not sure I'd want to watch it sitting next to someone seething on the edge of sanity, however.) The movie's unrelenting darkness is occasionally monotonous, but the picture has some standout supporting performances (Zazie Beetz is virtually a burst of sunshine whenever she shows up) and a mesmerizing score by Icelandic composer and cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir that suggests deep tidal currents. The prospect of unnecessary sequels is always dismaying; but Joaquin Phoenix is so good here, and the movie's plot structure is so inventive, that you could find yourself actually wondering what might happen next.

"Oct 4, 2019"," THIS movie will hit you hard emotionally and also leave you conflicted over how you feel about the title character, who is considered one of Batmanâs biggest foes but also one of the most formidable villains in the entire comic-book universe. The drab world that the man who will be Joker lives in is similar to any big city that is struggling economically, politically and socially. Eking out a living as a clown, having a strange condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably and being just awkward around people, Arthur is often the subject of stares and the target of bullies. Living in a squalid apartment and trying to be a good son to his loopy mother Penny (Conroy), Arthurâs one source of comfort is watching late-night show host Murray Franklin (De Niro) and dreaming of being recognised for his own talents as a comedian.",POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019","Who knew that Phillips had this kind of haunting, violent and grime-encrusted effort in him?",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," In the comics, the Joker has no definite origin story. Heâs an enigma who goes on to become one of entertainmentâs greatest supervillains, often referring to his past as âmultiple choiceâ like in The Killing Joke or tailoring his story of how he got his scars depending on who heâs talking to in Christopher Nolanâs The Dark Knight. He believes that people are one bad day away from becoming just like him. Thatâs all it takes. Joker depicts that one bad day for Arthur Fleck as it tells the origins of the man who would become the Clown Prince of Crime. Carried by a commanding, Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, Joker explores the darkest aspects of society and offers a window into the mental breakdown of a man who is pushed passed his breaking point. Life has not been kind to Arthur Fleck (Phoenix). Working part-time as a clown-for-hire, Arthur has dreams of becoming a standup comedian but is always seen as the weird person in the room and makes people feel uncomfortable with his bouts of uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate times. Most of the time, however, heâs invisible to the rest of society. After a series of events in which Arthur is fired from his job and he loses access to his medication because Gothamâs social service program is shutting down, his anger at those around him begins to bubble to the surface. Arthur finally snaps and takes his frustrations out on a group of Wall Street businessmen who were harassing him, killing them and setting in motion protests all across Gotham against the wealthy. As the situation escalates, Arthur becomes more and more violent as he embraces the resentment heâs had his whole life. For once, he finally feels seen by the world. In todayâs political climate where mass shootings happen on a near weekly basis, itâs impossible to ignore the connections the film brings up with mental health and the whole loner mentality. I believe Joker is a good jumping off point to continue a discussion about these topics, although I feel it could have done a better job at shining a stronger light onto them and actually explore them deeper rather than just throw them out there to be interpreted any which way. Thereâs no doubt that the film is going to be divisive in its depiction of mental health, however, in the end I feel itâs a net positive. Politics aside, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a captivating and unnerving performance as Arthur Fleck. The way he twists and contorts his gaunt frame is both disturbing yet intriguing. As a man, Aurthur is broken and disturbed, but you can see a transformation in him when he finally puts on the Joker makeup. His performance is unlike any of the other versions weâve seen on screen. Heâs more of a person than a comic book villain, which grounds the film and makes it more realistic, which in turn makes the violence depicted all the more disturbing as well. Phoenix lays his mental state out on the line for all the world to see, and itâs difficult not to get caught up in his act. Make no mistake, Joker is a film about a man named Arthur Fleck; itâs not about the Joker, although it has the beginnings of the character present. Donât expect the criminal mastermind of the Batman movies. This isnât that kind of film. Honestly, you could take the Joker persona and the few Batman references out of the film entirely, and it would still work as a character drama. Although I would have liked to see more of solution as to how to combat the issues the film presents, Joker is a conversation starter about how mental health is no laughing matter and for that I see it as worth watching.  © 1995 â 2019 Bigfoot Ventures LLC.

"Oct 4, 2019"," Long before “Joker” pays homage to two of the classic New York films of the nineteen-seventies and eighties, “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy,” it relies on the fictitious setting of Gotham City and the pretext of a comic-book story to evoke real-life crimes—and it alludes to them from a perspective so narrow and destructive as to resemble not intention but obliviousness. The result is a movie of a cynicism so vast and pervasive as to render the viewing experience even emptier than its slapdash aesthetic does. The first dramatic scene in “Joker,” which is set in a grungy and turbulent New Yor— I mean, Gotham City, seemingly around 1980 (judging from details of décor), shows a clown, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), on a busy street in midtown, working as a sign twirler for a music store. A group of teen-agers of color hassle him and steal his sign. He chases them into a garbage-strewn alley (the city is in the midst of an apocalyptic garbage strike), where one kid hits Arthur in the face with the sign and knocks him down. Then the whole group swarms him, pummels him, kicks him, and leaves him bruised and bleeding and sobbing, alone, in the filthy alley. The crime alluded to is the attack wrongly attributed to five young men mislabelled as the Central Park Five—an attack on an isolated and vulnerable white person by a group of young people of color. The scene waves away history and says, in effect, that it may not have been those five, but there was another group out there wreaking havoc; they’re not figments of a demagogue’s hate-filled imagination—here they are, and they’re the spark of all the gory action that follows. What follows, soon thereafter, is another scene of brutality: Arthur, whose beating is the talk of the locker room at the clown agency for which he works, is handed a gun by a blustery colleague named Randall (Glenn Fleshler). When Arthur is assaulted on the subway by three young men (whites, in suits), he pulls out the gun and fires—and even pursues one of the men onto the platform in order to shoot him dead. It’s an evocation of the shooting, in 1984, by Bernhard Goetz, of four teen-agers in a subway who, Goetz believed, were about to rob him. They were four black teen-agers, and Goetz, after his arrest, made racist remarks. In “Joker,” the director, Todd Phillips (who wrote the script with Scott Silver), whitewashes Goetz’s attack, eliminating any racial motive and turning it into an act of self-defense gone out of control. In between these two events, Arthur is seated on a city bus that’s crowded with passengers. A child seated in front of him turns around, and Arthur playfully makes funny faces at him—at which the child’s mother sharply orders Arthur to stop bothering her son. Mother and child are both black. The next day, Arthur, returning home (he has lost his job entertaining children at a hospital, because his gun fell out of his pocket), meets a neighbor, a woman named Sophie (Zazie Beetz); she, too, has a young child with her. The woman and the child are black. Arthur, who chats with Sophie for a moment, becomes obsessed with her and fantasizes about a romantic relationship with her. The nonexistence of any such relationship is among the agonies that torment him. One more: Arthur lives in a rundown building in an ill-tended neighborhood with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who is disabled and whom he cares for. He is up late at night while his mother sleeps, watching a classic movie on television, “Shall We Dance,” starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The scene he’s watching, a musical number, set to George and Ira Gershwin’s “Slap That Bass,” begins with a group of black men who are working in the (highly stylized) engine room of an ocean liner and singing and playing music while they work—they have a jazz band, and one man (Dudley Dickerson) sings the song (along with the riffing of co-workers as a chorus) before Astaire chimes in, with their accompaniment, and then starts dancing. While he’s watching, Arthur begins to dance around the living room—gun in hand—when, in his careless enthusiasm, he pulls the trigger. “Joker” is an intensely racialized movie, a drama awash in racial iconography that is so prevalent in the film, so provocative, and so unexamined as to be bewildering. What it seems to be saying is utterly incoherent, beyond the suggestion that Arthur, who is mentally ill, becomes violent after being assaulted by a group of people of color—and he suffers callous behavior from one black woman, and believes that he’s being ignored by another, and reacts with jubilation at the idea of being a glamorous white star amid a supporting cast of cheerful black laborers. But, unlike the public discourse around the Central Park Five, and unlike the case of Bernhard Goetz, and unlike the world, the discourse in “Joker” and the thought processes of Arthur Fleck are utterly devoid of any racial or social specificity. Yes, “Joker” takes place in a fictitious city, a comic-book world of fantasy—but it draws its incidents and its affect parasitically from real-world events that were both the product and the cause of racist discourse and attitudes and gave rise to real-world racist outcomes of enduring, even historic, gravity. The central events of “Joker” (and I’ll try to allude to them sidelong, to avoid spoilers) are suggested by other real-world events, but here, too, Phillips voids them of their discourse and their substance. What results is more than the strenuous effort to contrive a story with resonant incidents and alluring details; “Joker” reflects political cowardice on the part of a filmmaker, and perhaps of a studio, in emptying out the specifics of the city’s modern history and current American politics so that the movie can be released as mere entertainment to viewers who are exasperated with the idea of movies being discussed in political terms—i.e., to Republicans. In “Joker,” Arthur is quickly seen to be mentally ill, and he knows it—he takes seven medications and wants more. (The source of his trouble is revealed late in the film.) But in the course of the city’s apparent financial crisis (reminder: New York was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1975) cuts to social services also cut him off from his meds. As a result, Arthur, who’s already delusional, finds his delusions deepening; though he was already violent, his violence becomes increasingly calculated and targeted. Here, too, the movie plays into the hands of current-day political rhetoric—namely, the emphasis by Republicans who, when it comes to gun control, would rather deny weapons to the mentally ill than restrict weaponry for everyone. In the wake of Arthur’s killing spree, a public figure—Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a wealthy banker for whom Penny worked decades earlier, and who, of course, is the father of a boy named Bruce—speaks of killers such as Arthur as “clowns.” This comment gives rise to a sudden mass movement of activists who dress like clowns and target the rich and the powerful. The trope resembles Hillary Clinton’s reference to many of the supporters of Donald Trump as “deplorables,” a term that was adopted by some as a badge of honor—except in “Joker” the epithet applies rather to radicals on the left, who loom as a menace waiting to happen. Arthur is an aspiring standup comedian, who fills a notebook intended as a journal for therapeutic purposes with what he calls jokes. He writes copiously, in a frenetic and shaky handwriting, and though the film displays items from the notebook—including brief views of pornographic images he has cut from magazines—the texts we read onscreen are strictly personal (such as “I hope my death makes more cents than my life” and “The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave like you DON’T”). Whatever Arthur is thinking, we don’t learn much about him; whatever he thinks about the world in which he lives is never divulged. His notebook is a manifesto without any substance or target. A sidebar to Arthur’s effort to become a comedian—an effort that remains for the most part theoretical, except for his disastrous attempt to bring his act to the stage at a comedy club’s open-mike night—is his obsession with a late-night talk-show host named Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). (In “The King of Comedy,” De Niro, of course, played the frustrated comedian Rupert Pupkin, who is obsessed with a fictitious talk-show host, Jerry Langford, played by Jerry Lewis.) Even the choice of the host is a reference—to the low-budget local New York talk-show host Joe Franklin. “Joker” is built around many such details of the era; it opens with a radio news report, on a station called 1080 WGCR, with an announcer named Stan L. Brooks (it’s a parody of the real-life 1010 WINS and its announcer, Stan Z. Burns). The movie’s décor is also specific, from touch-tone phones and Selectric typewriters to the slanted-window city buses and graffiti-covered subway cars, neon signs and clothing styles of the seventies and eighties. It doesn’t offer glaring anachronisms (as in Wes Anderson’s films, or as in the John Wick series) but specific and focussed evocations of New York at a particular time. Yet, for all the historical references in “Joker,” it’s a blatant and brazen distortion of the most substantial historical elements at which it winks. “Joker” is the comic-book “Green Book,” twisting history for the sake of a yarn. The thematic incoherence of “Joker” is inseparable from its aesthetic emptiness. Phoenix, alternately brooding and exulting, dancing extravagantly in his underwear or in a resplendent costume or seething with rage, cringing with horror, or camping it up with an affected accent, isn’t so much unhinged as unmotivated and, to all appearances, undirected. What he delivers is less a performance than a display of his bag of actorly tricks—and they’re pretty wonderful, but they adorn a character who’s an empty framework, and, to all appearances, empty by design, for fear of alienating the target audience. The movie’s parodies of “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” are obvious; so are its pastiches of the designs and events of those movies’ times. But the crucial parody, the crucial mockery, the work of which “Joker” comes off as a callously commercial imitation, is “Black Panther”—a comic-book-based movie that infuses its framework with rigorously conceived and boldly assertive political visions to go with its elaborate world-building. “Joker” is a wannabe movie that also wants to be all things to all viewers, that imitates the notion of adding substance while only subtracting it. “Joker” is a viewing experience of a rare, numbing emptiness.

"Oct 4, 2019"," In terms of cinematic villains, Joaquin Phoenix is in rarified air. Not a single representation of Batman’s infamous foe has gone without some measure of success, and each take has established itself as distinctly unique. Even with a wide array of interpretations from a host of talented actors – Caesar Romero, Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto – it is near impossible to find anything innately wrong with any of their choices besides Leto’s dopey grill and face tattoo ensemble. Each iteration of the Joker has a little something special about it. And Joaquin Phoenix’s harrowingly method approach is no exception. Gotham City in 1981 is not too far removed from any major city today. The rich carry on with their desperate quest for infinite wealth and a fairly easy existence, while the poor claw their way to a mediocre lifestyle, wrought with debt and struggle. As presented by director Todd Phillips, Gotham is a dirty, grimy city going through a garbage strike…which serves to make it even dirtier and grimier. It holds a specific New York City-laden template and builds on the despair from there. The city itself is both a backdrop and a full-fledged character, giving life to the character’s story that is about to be told. And that tale belongs to Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur, a mentally unstable wannabe stand-up comic incel with a horribly debilitating societal disorder that causes him to erupt in spontaneous laughter at the most inappropriate times. He is a sad, empty shell of a man in constant search to turn his mindset around. As Arthur grapples with identifying a way to turn his frown upside down, we’re introduced to his emotionally wrought mother (Frances Conroy), empathetic neighbor (a criminally underused Zazie Beetz), and prickish TV-show host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro, doing his best work in years). The film – for the first time – tells a fleshed out origin story on the Clown Prince of Crime, following Arthur as his depression and unhinged persona desperately leads him towards the path we all know is coming: his descent into the madness and mayhem that is The Joker. We have all been around odd characters such as Arthur, and watching society withdraw nervously from his existence due solely to our indifference or react emotionally to his behavior is as much an indictment on his condition as it is our own. In many ways, Joker is commenting on society’s own responsibility in creating personalities such as Arthur. Our hypocrisy and inability to accept anyone who fails to reside within our comfortable wheelhouse of societal actions, as well as our lack of interest in supporting a health care system that values people with mental illness, is as much on trial as Arthur’s growing mental instability. Though Joker is an original story told completely separate from DC’s well-established universe, there is an obvious nod here to The Killing Joke, the ground-breaking comic where Joker’s backstory illuminates us all to his past as a failed stand-up comic. Even Joker’s infamous line from that graphic novel, “If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice”, is utilized in the film’s own clever fashion. Aside from this knowing wink and obvious references to Batman and the Wayne family, Joker is a completely isolated venture, free from expectations or insider knowledge. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver do what almost no one in comic book related films strive for: they show little interest in satisfying fandom’s purist demands. And unlike most characters in comics, they chose the one most able to be explored in this way, as Joker has no truly firm backstory in his source material to begin with. Does it completely work? Mostly. Strictly from a storytelling perspective, Arthur has so much go wrong for him and the police are so slow at following up on obvious connections and leads, that occasionally the film does suffer a bit from convenient plotting. Thankfully, Phillips and Silver also toss enough distraction and contemplation around – this is Joker’s fractured mind we’re dancing in, after all – that everything seen will have you rethinking and dissecting the story for hours or days after leaving the theater. Complemented by a devastatingly haunting and yet fitting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, Joker is grim, dark, and surreal; but it’s also pushing the boundaries of how stories like this are told. For each negative there are several more positives perking the film back up. Every performance in the film lands soundly and fairly sympathetically, but this film is completely dominated by Joaquin Phoenix. Long thought to be an off-kilter oddball possessing a powerhouse talent, Phoenix also loves to play with performance art, making him a perfect fit for a character like Joker. Never has that been more obvious than as he takes chance after chance, by allowing his talent to stand on its own, naked and unafraid of any audience concerns. Throughout Arthur’s descent into madness we witness him laughing himself into tears, choking on his own yuks, randomly dancing as if he were auditioning for the Gotham ballet, explosive fits of rage that cause us to jolt up and remind ourselves that Arthur is NOT a good guy; and through it all we get lost in Phoenix’s performance. I cannot stress how difficult it is to pull this off for such a renowned actor and an even more well-known character. Heath Ledger was able to capitalize in this same manner, and it is with no trepidation that I proclaim Joaquin Phoenix has pulled himself within walking distance of that legendary performance. If he is not in the Best Actor discussion for this year’s Oscars, then that race has obviously allowed its bigotry towards comic book properties to outweigh the brilliance of a singular performance.",POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019"," Few movies in history have had such an extreme pre-release experience. It is almost unheard of for a mainstream Hollywood studio film to win the Venice film festival’s Golden Lion. And it is unheard of for Venice’s winner, usually an erudite art film, to inspire grotesque hate speech from fans on social media should anyone be the least bit critical. A violent look at “how Batman’s foe got that way,” Joker has been hailed as revolutionary for its depiction of mental illness, but – at least in gun-toting America – screenings have been suggested as a potential trigger of violence. There’s been no shortage of conversation around Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix’s movie but until now, as is so often the case online, few people had actually seen it. Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about. Todd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as Mr Terrific is with T-Spheres, has said that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would “sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film”. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. “Let’s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,” he continued. He’s cited movies by Martin Scorsese and (surprisingly) Chantal Akerman as influences. So the question is: is this movie really that different? We’ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, Ant-Man and the Wasp or Thor: Ragnarok. Even the so-called “grimdark” superhero movies like Batman v Superman or Watchmen feel like an entirely different genre. While Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck does paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn’t about special effects. Comic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore. Arthur Fleck (which is what the Joker is named in this version) pays a visit to Arkham State Hospital, a tweak on the Arkham Asylum from the comics. The more exciting connections come with the Wayne family. For a stretch it is suggested that Thomas Wayne might actually be Arthur’s father. This turns out to be a red herring, but not before Arthur heads up to Wayne Manor and makes contact with the young Bruce Wayne … who playfully slides down a pole at some point. That’s right – an ur-Bat Pole! (Note: this is just about the only moment of levity in the entire picture.) During the big climax, we see, once again, Bruce’s parents get killed. In some of these tellings (notably Tim Burton’s version) culpability is laid at Joker’s feet. The new movie offers a clever twist. As the dispossessed citizens of Gotham City rally around Joker as some sort of political hero, it’s just some random thug in a clown mask who kills the famous zillionaires, not Joker himself. (In a nice spin, they are still outside a theatre showing Zorro, but it’s the dopey 1981 comedy Zorro, the Gay Blade.) Is this movie really just the biggest-budget Ben Shapiro video? To what extent will misogynistic creeps “feel seen” in this film? Well, for most of its run time, it isn’t quite the alt-right manifesto some of the pre-release discourse suggested. It’s really just a drama about a mentally ill man with no friends who is targeted by bullies, lives with his mother, is ignored by the attractive woman down the hall and only finds purpose in mass murder. Wait, I know that sounds like it is sympathy for the incel, but Fleck’s anger, for most of the movie, stays rooted in his own circumstances. He isn’t really railing against PC culture or how he’s owed anything, like a guy who won’t stop talking about Jordan Peterson. It’s more of a generic “My life sucks!” cry than an “Our life sucks, brothers!” In the final reel, though, there is some angry monologuing, and some of those “Nobody cares!” talking points come through, but the writing is too vague and incoherent to really land a point. Heath Ledger won an Oscar posthumously for playing Joker. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Does Joaquin Phoenix have a shot at a statuetee? Anything’s possible, I suppose, but if it were up to me, I would say heck no. I like when awards go to best acting not most acting. Phoenix’s mimicry of the pseudobulbar affect (a psychological disorder that causes uncontrollable laughter, coughs, bleats and whimpers) is accurate, at least based on one YouTube video I found. But this is a surface thing. There’s little depth to the character other than, you know, he’s nuts! Time Magazine’s Stephanie Zacharek said it best when she called him “a chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola”. By now you’ve sussed out that I’m not really a fan of Joker. I mostly found it bleak and juvenile. But it is not without merit. The location photography in Newark, New Jersey and the Bronx captures some real grit. The big finish, while dumb from a story point of view, is marvellously shot. And the big acts of violence are effectively rattling. There’s one moment that shows a true creative spark. Two of Fleck’s old work buddies come to visit him. One (Glenn Fleshler) has long been a jerk, so Fleck, now a killer, stabs him, spraying blood all over the place. The other guy (Leigh Gill), is horrified, but since he was always nice to Fleck, he’s not in danger. Fleck says he can leave and, quaking in terror, Gill heads toward the door. It is, unfortunately, latched from up high and as Gill has dwarfism he can’t reach. It’s absolutely chilling to hear this man ask someone who just butchered a person for help. Part of why this scene works is that it plays to Phillips’s strengths. While it keeps Gill’s dignity intact (he’s one of the few nice people in the film) it’s still a bit of business that finds humour in interaction with dwarfism. For better or worse, that’s the kind of thing Phillips built his career on with bro comedies like The Hangover. It’s sure footing for him, far less so than nihilistic drama. Once Joker has more than a few kills under his belt, he heads into Robert De Niro’s TV studio for his big catharsis. There’s a psych-up scene as he dances outside his apartment, so there’s a pop song needle-drop. Phillips chooses Gary Glitter’s Rock and Roll Part 2. It’s a song you absolutely know, even if the title doesn’t ring a bell. More to the point, especially from a guy recently quoted as saying that “woke culture” has torn him away from comedy, it’s a song recorded by a convicted child sex offender. Todd Phillips really is a troll.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," Todd Phillips, director of the Hangover trilogy among other comedies, recently told Vanity Fair that he had to get out of comedy because woke culture made it impossible to be funny.  Directing and co-writing with Scott Silver (The Fighter), Phillips offers an origin story that sees mental illness, childhood trauma, adult alienation and societal disregard as the ingredients that form a singular villain—a man who cannot come into his own until he embraces his inner sinister clown. It’s a dangerous idea and a dangerous film, but that doesn’t make it a bad movie. In many respects—though not all—it is a great movie. This is partly thanks to an ambitious screenplay, Lawrence Sher’s intense cinematography, solid directorial instincts with some beautifully staged violence and constant (indeed, fanboy-esque) nods to Scorsese.  But let’s be honest, it’s mainly because Joaquin Phoenix is a god among actors. His scenes of transformation, his scenes alone, his mesmerizing command of physicality, and in particular his unerringly unnerving chemistry with other actors are haunting. Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, (or Afleck, if you were giving points for Batman references) wannabe standup comic and put upon outcast in 1981 Gotham City. The garbage strike has everyone testy. Rich, entitled Thomas Wayne (Bruce’s dad) isn’t helping matters with his bid for the mayor’s office and his disdain for those who are struggling. Since Phillips genuflects to both Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, it is appropriate that Robert DeNiro, with some snazzy new teeth, participates as Murray Franklin, the late night legend that Arthur and his mother (Frances Conroy) watch every night.  More than once, Phillips does not trust his audience to stay with the direction he’s taken, and it’s unfortunate. These “look what I’m doing here” scenes drag the film, but as long as you never take your eyes off Phoenix (and who could?), you’re not likely to notice. A pivotal moment where Arthur crashes a posh screening of Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times is Phillips’s less-than-subtle reminder that it has always been the clowns in this world who reflect society’s reality back to us. It’s a wise move to make this an alienated-to-the-point-of-violence white guy who takes his frustrations out not on the powerless, but on those with power, thus becoming a kind of hero himself. Of course, the inclusion of Chaplin could also be read as a direct admission that Joker is a comment on our modern times. Superhero universe? Fanatical throngs blindly following a sociopath? Checks out. But similar to Phillips’s approach with War Dogs three years ago, an uneven tone lessens the intended impact. Alongside the straightforward Scorsese homages are left turns into Oliver Stone territory a la Natural Born Killers. That black comedic satire is a tough nut regardless, even more so if comes in fits and starts.  Credit Phillips for a damn the torpedoes vision that’s damn near palpable, but it’s impossible to imagine this all meshing as well as it does without Phoenix. His presence is completely transfixing, always convincing you that he is here to fulfill this legendary character’s destiny. Remember when we thought Nicholson could never be topped? Then Ledger did it. And now Phoenix makes this the darkest, most in-the-moment Joker we’ve seen.  So, Phillips succeeded in making an anti-comedy and anti-comic book movie because bro culture totally rules and comedy is dead and that’s not a privileged cop out at all. But then, it is possible to separate art and the artist.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 4, 2019"," It was in my college days, the mid-2000s, when I first watched the GG Allin documentary Hated, directed by one Todd Phillips. It was quite the spectacle for a wide-eyed early twenty-something to watch, especially in the early discovery days of youtube, where videos of the obscure and the extraordinary were blossoming. For all of the antics shown, the grime and the poop throwing, the yelling and the cutting, there was also this… tenderness and sweet vibes that radiated from this man of punk, for whom true freedom was, in his mind, achieved. Phillips has, since then, done mostly boner comedies, but here and there will offer up some subversive - sometimes dude-bro-ish, sometimes truly dark - filmmaking within the business of Hollywood goofiness.  Indeed, Joker is a rarity, and I don’t just mean for a major studio to bankroll. It’s a movie that pretty openly finds common ground with its central character, never once having to sell its own soul to do so, but genuinely invites him in any way. While not a documentary, there is a similar Hated approach here, where the filmmaker teeters between fly on the wall fascination and joining in on the chaos directly. In one scene, where Arthur Fleck - the mentally and emotionally unstable party clown/wannabe comedian (Joaquin Pheonix) - in full Joker makeup, with a pretty heavy plan laid out for him to execute, dances and stomps his way down a long and steep set of street stairs. It’s creepy, it’s crawly, and yet somehow freeing to watch as someone unhinged reaches a moment of zen.  Make no bones about it, Joaquin Phoenix isn’t really playing a comic book character here. This is as if Combat Shock had a comic book spinoff planted onto it. Or if someone found a way to take the video diaries of Ricardo Lopez (the Bjork stalker) and adapt a “villain” tale onto it. I wrapped quotes around “villain” because it’s quite “easy” to make a mentally ill or insufficiently cared for individual into a “monster”. Sometimes, the problem really is society. Sometimes, the problem really is in the lack of social services. Sometimes, a person is tossed through the cracks. Does this make for a fun superhero-ish story? And fun for who? Phoenix is a revelation in this film and absolutely reminds me of people I’ve met in life (even recently) that have been abused, neglected, and left to fend for themselves. For Fleck, a murderous moment that could’ve happened to anyone ends by way of triumph when he gets the courage to kiss a girl. Before that, he runs away, takes a deep breath, and does a kind of waltz. There are many instances like this where our understanding of morality is upended by the very tone of Fleck’s actions and what it all means for and to him. Does this make Joker inappropriate or vile in some way? The message(s) within the off-kilter tone can be distracting to the character piece, especially when you consider that the event that creates Batman in this film might turn him into a Punisher than a caped crusader. Maybe in these fits and starts, Phillips injects too much to play with. “Kill the rich!” reads a protest sign during a near riot. “They’re clowns!” a wealthy guy says on tv. Is it reductive to place people into only these two categories? Or is it that, amidst the noise and the fury of these battling ideas and ideals, those in the middle must make their own way through it all? Like a gallery of rogues or a league of sorts.  Joker, minus the controversy and the poor statements, by itself, is mostly a one-man show from Phoenix, with a touch more going on than expected. It’s uncomfortable, it’s righteous, and likely deserves most of its accolades. Will I be joining the Best Picture campaigning, in a year when Avengers: Endgame might be considered for top Oscars?

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Somewhere along the line, Joker, an origin story for DC’s most famous villain, became a battleground of arguments for whether the film is an irresponsible green light for the justification of the horrible acts committed by lonely, white, male killers and terrorists, or a dark but honest psychological masterpiece that transcends the limitations of the comic book genre.  For better or worse, Joker is, surprisingly, neither of these things. It’s not the incendiary embrace of violent incel culture and all the problematic ideology that goes with it that people feared, nor is it the richly layered, gritty, tragic take on an iconic character that writer and director Todd Phillips and fans seem to think it is. Instead, the film is just hollow and devoid of anything that might make it truly interesting. It tries and fails to present grandiose statements about society (cue the memes), loneliness, and mental health, ultimately standing for little to nothing at all by the time the credits roll. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just might be the most unlucky sack of misery in Gotham City (an obvious stand-in for 1980s New York City). He suffers from a debilitating disorder that causes fits of deranged laughter at any moment of the day, a condition that naturally makes everyone around him give him a wide berth. He lives with his elderly mother (Frances Conroy), who he takes care of, and has a hopeless crush (complete with stalking) on their neighbor, Sophie (Zazie Beetz). Despite his woesome life, Arthur has dreams of being a stand-up comedian, his inspiration coming from a late-night host played by Robert De Niro, who he idolizes.  Arthur is relegated to a job as a clown for hire, twirling an advertising banner for a store or attempting to cheer up sick children at the hospital. This proves to not be the safest of careers in crime-ridden Gotham City, as the pathetic loner is routinely harassed, bullied, and beaten up by hoodlums on the street. Shunned by society, repeatedly suffering trauma after trauma, and with zero hope of ever achieving his dreams, Arthur’s sanity begins to splinter. The daily despair and humiliation is too much for any one man to bear, and after a fateful and violent incident on the subway, his life gives way to a whole new direction, one that promises to change him and the city forever. Credit where credit is due: Phillips’ insistence on location shooting and steering away from the use of CGI immediately sets Joker apart from the rest of its crowded comic-book brothers and sisters. There’s some wonderful production design from Mark Friedberg (If Beale Street Could Talk, Selma), and genuinely gorgeous imagery of the city from cinematographer Lawrence Sher (Godzilla: King of the Monsters). To top it all off, a booming score from composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (Chernobyl) bursts through each scene with a commanding presence. And of course, there’s Phoenix himself, giving the titular role all of his might. Phoenix’s iteration of the Joker isn’t the deformed, low-life thug that was Jack Nicholson in Batman, he’s not the iconic clown prince of crime that was immortalized by Mark Hamill in the animated series, nor is he the anarchist agent of chaos that was Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Phoenix brings something to the part that we’ve yet to see onscreen for the character: Pain and wholly relatable misery. Undoubtedly a very physical actor, Phoenix’s performance is gripping and magnetic anytime he’s onscreen. His gnarled, far-too-skinny body wracks itself with piercing laughter, he often has moments where his creepy gaze looks through and past those speaking to him, and his inevitable transformation into a makeup-clad serial killer is one that the actor puts incredible effort into grounding; not an easy task with a character who’s famous for cartoonish acts of evil. For all of the work that clearly went into the film, it’s such a disappointment that the end product still comes across as so notably shallow. Joker takes considerable inspiration from Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (which, not by accident, also starred De Niro), but Phillips seems to have failed to understand the underlying commentary of both films. Arthur’s criminal ascent acts as a call to others – there’s anti-rich / elite resentment growing in Gotham, with Arthur unwittingly acting as a figurehead of the movement. Protestors take to the streets in clown masks, but while this sort of anti-capitalist sentiment is certainly topical, the film’s stance on these political ideals is left incredibly vague, and has nothing to do with Arthur’s personal character arc. There’s a glaring disconnect. After a solid first act, Joker turns into a real slog. The entire movie keeps dragging itself down with its overinflated sense of self-importance. It demands to be taken seriously, but it lacks the writing quality and nuance of storytelling required to justify such a thing. Artful moments of tremendous staging and cinematography slowly but surely start to lose their luster as it becomes overdone. And without a strong enough script to back the imagery up, it all ends up feeling like some kind of trick – a scam trying to fool audiences into believing that this is a smarter and deeper movie than it actually is. Instead of fueling the fire of the online controversy, for either side, it just pretends to take a stand for something, anything, but in the end it stands for nothing at all. Joker will certainly be polarizing. It’s funny, the film itself has nothing to say, but we, the audience, sure do. I guess the joke’s on us.

"Oct 4, 2019"," In the answer to 2005's ""Batman Begins,"" which explored the background, drive and psychological development of the superhero, ""Joker"" looks at the long spiral into vengeful madness of the iconic arch villain. Unlike any comic book movie to have come before, the film is a punishing analysis of the frustrations, failure and bitterness that could drive a decent man into evil. Director Todd Phillips breaks away from his usual comedic fare, such as ""Old School,"" ""Road Trip""  and ""Starsky & Hutch"" to take on what could be considered the reverse negative of a comedy. Inspired by the seminal 1988 graphic novel ""The Killing Joke,"" as well as Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy,"" the 1980s-set ""Joker"" looks in on Arthur Fleck, who is living with his mother, abused by  thugs while twirling a business sign as a street performer and toying with standup comedy. With a more traditional, less edgy performance, the film might have seemed mawkish or melodramatic. The film lives and dies through the multitude of close-ups and mannerisms infused upon the blank canvas by Phoenix. Because his acting is so powerful and compelling, ""Joker"" is an artful triumph. Also impressive are Robert De Niro as a comedy talk show that Arthur obsesses over, Frances Conroy as his subtly manipulative, occasionally delusional mother, and Zazie Beetz as a single mother who draws his romantic fixation. The supporting cast's subtle, less-is-more approach is an appropriate complement to Phoenix's overwhelming expressiveness. While some may dismiss ""Joker"" as too dark and despair-ridden to embrace -- and others may gripe about its reductive portrayal of mental illness -- there is plenty to savor here for those willing to follow headlong through Phillips' and Phoenix's shared, twisted nightmare. My lone complaint is that the film doesn't adequately explain Joker's physical resilience or the origins of his gadgetary genius that comes to rival Batman. An often excruciating but immensely rewarding journey through a shattered heart of darkness, ""Joker"" succeeds on just about every level it chooses. Phoenix's performance of a lifetime yields a comic book film for the ages.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019"," For someone routinely bored and dismayed by cookie-cutter superhero films, Joker is a fresh breath of rotten air, a gutsy and realistic genesis story of one of the most beloved comic villains. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe for playing Joker. Heath Ledger won an Oscar for his portrayal of Batman’s arch-nemesis. Now, it’s Joaquin Phoenix’s turn, playing perhaps the most complex and pitiable Joker of them all. Every moment of his performance is a tour-de-force, one of his absolute best in a career of playing outsiders, weirdos and psychos.  Winner of the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, Joker plays like a superhero movie directed by Martin Scorsese. Directed by Todd Phillips of all people, the guy who brought us the Hangover films, Phoenix’s Joker is a cross between Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, a depressive loner who is plagued with mental illness. And though the film may play a bit too much like Scorsese-lite, the riveting performance of its lead and its purposeful distancing from the cash-pit Marvel titles (i.e. no CGI and minimal action) makes Joker a rare comic book film that actually surprises.  Let’s be straight, this is no action film. Yeah, there is violence and some explosions but the majority of Joker is a psychological thriller. Comic book movies have been moving in this direction with fare such as Logan pushing away from the conventional MCU-type action bonanzas. Phillips has no problem with a slow plot, instead focusing on his main character’s mental decline. When we first meet Arthur Fleck, he is working as a clown for hire, holding going-out-of-business signs on the street and performing for kids with cancer. He is victimized by hoodrats and shunned by his coworkers because he has a pretty sizable tic: he laughs maniacally when confronted with emotional distress.  Phoenix channels the early work of Robert De Niro, the lanky violence of Mean Streets, the tortured vigilantism of Taxi Driver, the delusional hopelessness of The King of Comedy. The actor must have dropped more than 50 pounds for the role, his gaunt face framed by shaggy, greasy hair. As if the acting and look of the film isn’t Scorsese enough, De Niro appears as a smarmy talk show host who is pretty much the same character Jerry Lewis played in Comedy. Still, Phoenix commands every frame whether he’s laughing maniacally, grappling with alienation or contorting his body into shapes we haven’t seen since Christian Bale lost all that weight to star in The Machinist. Joker has already been met by controversy before its release due to its violent context. The film does not glorify violence. That’s bullshit. For every death, there is a moral consequence. The argument wears thin when you hold Joker up to a Marvel movie where all kinds of stuff blows up along with millions of unseen innocents. We’re not supposed to enjoy the violence in Joker. We don’t laugh or thrill to the fighting here like we do in Black Panther during that epic final battle in Wakanda. Fleck is the unseen, the mentally ill who are pushed to the periphery in a society that has no use for them. He is beaten-up, mocked and ignored. It’s only a matter of time before he snaps.  Joker doesn’t exist in a vacuum. We see young Bruce Wayne. We see his parents. But they aren’t essential to the plot, necessarily. Just collateral damage. Like always, Gotham City is filmed as a dark, depressing place. Tim Burton made it look like something out of a Fritz Lang movie in his Batman movies. Phillips is trying to capture the flavor of Scorsese’s mean streets of the ‘70s and ‘80s.  It’s hard to know how much credit goes to Phillips. There are times where he could have filmed certain sections more coherently (such as Arthur’s obsession with a neighbor) and we never need to hear Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2” nor Cream’s “White Room” ever again in montage. However, Phillips fully commits to the look and feel of Joker. Pair that with a transcendent Joaquin Phoenix performance, along with a timely message, and you have one of the best films of 2019.

"Oct 4, 2019"," Bon. Qu’est-ce qui n’a pas encore été dit à propos de ce film? Lion d’or à Venise, phénomène au TIFF, cette rare adaptation de comic book sélectionnée par les grands festivals internationaux, que certains imaginent par ailleurs déjà aux Oscars, a également son lot de détracteurs. Des critiques qui ont détesté le film, oui, mais aussi tout plein de gens qui ne l’ont même pas vu, mais qui estiment néanmoins que c’est une œuvre « dangereuse », qui pourrait envoyer le mauvais message aux mauvaises personnes. Puis il y a le réalisateur Todd Phillips lui-même qui a jeté de l’huile sur le feu en osant dénoncer la « woke culture », s’exposant conséquemment à cette dernière. Dans ces cas-là, j’ai toujours le même réflexe : ignorer tout ce qui est extérieur au film et m’attarder seulement à ce qui est projeté à l’écran. On parle d’une fiction après tout, d’une proposition artistique provocatrice, mais nullement responsable de ceux qui pourraient mal l’interpréter. Taxi Driver, une inspiration directe de Phillips (qui a aussi puisé dans The King of Comedy, un autre classique de Martin Scorsese mettant en vedette Robert De Niro, qui tient un rôle de soutien crucial dans Joker), avait également été accusé d’être dangereux, mais il faut se rappeler que le cinéma n’a pas inventé les individus instables qui deviennent violents : ce n’est qu’un reflet d’une tragique réalité. Le scénario de Todd Phillips & Scott Silver colle constamment à la peau du Joker, alias Arthur Fleck, inventoriant chaque revers, chaque malaise, chaque humiliation, jusqu’à ce qu’il n’en puisse plus. On comprend ce qu’il ressent, on a peut-être de l’empathie pour lui, comme on en avait pour Travis Bickle, mais cela ne veut pas du tout dire qu’on approuve ses actions extrêmes. Le Joker n’est pas un héros, ce n’est même pas un antihéros, c’est un super-vilain, un fou, un monstre. Un personnage fascinant, mais en rien un exemple à suivre.  Excessivement bien réalisé, maintenant une atmosphère glauque et tendue qui est accentuée par la puissante musique de Hildur Guðnadóttir, Joker est longtemps inconfortablement intime et personnel, nous forçant à être témoin de la souffrance vécue par le protagoniste et de celle qu’il inflige aux autres en retour. Puis peu à peu, c’est apparemment tout Gotham City qui pète les plombs et qui sombre dans le chaos, au grand plaisir du Joker.  Les nominations en vue de la 92e cérémonie des Oscars ont été annoncées ce matin et surprise : c’est Joker de Todd Phillips qui part en tête avec pas moins de 11 nominations. On s’attend bien sûr à ce que Joaquin Phoenix soit sacré Meilleur acteur, mais ce film inspiré des comic books est aussi en lice dans les catégories Meilleur film, Meilleure réalisation, Meilleure adaptation, Meilleure direction photo, Meilleur montage,  Meilleur montage sonore, Meilleur mix sonore,

Meilleure musique,

Meilleurs maquillage/coiffure et Meilleurs costumes. Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood de Quentin Tarantino est un des autres leaders de la course, avec 10 nominations, allant des catégories dites techniques comme Meilleure direction photo, Meilleure direction artistique, Meilleurs costumes et les deux de son (Montage sonore et Mix sonore), en plus bien sûr des catégories de pointes que sont Meilleur film, Meilleure réalisation, Meilleur scénario, Meilleur acteur (Leonardo DiCaprio) et Meilleur acteur de soutien (Brad Pitt). Également 10 nominations pour The Irishman de Martin Scorsese : 

Meilleur film, Meilleure réalisation, Meilleure adaptation, 

Meilleur acteur de soutien (Al Pacino et Joe Pesci),  Meilleure direction photo, Meilleur montage, Meilleure direction artistique, Meilleurs effets visuels, et Meilleurs costumes. 10 nominations aussi pour 1917 de Sam Mendes : Meilleur film, Meilleure réalisation, Meilleur scénario, Meilleure direction photo, Meilleure direction artistique, 

Meilleure musique, 

Meilleur montage sonore, Meilleur mix sonore, Meilleurs effets visuels, Meilleurs maquillage/coiffure. La Palme d’or, Parasite de Bong Joon-ho, fait bonne figure avec 6 nominations, ajoutant à Meilleur film international des mentions dans les catégories Meilleur film, Meilleure réalisation, Meilleur scénario, Meilleur montage et Meilleure direction artistique. Soulignons que le film canado-tunisien Brotherhood de Meryam Joobeur, ainsi que le film français Une soeur de Delphine Girard auquel le jury dont je faisais partie a remis le Grand Prix du jury – meilleur film à SPASM, sont parmi les courts métrages en nomination. Ensemble, l’acteur Joaquin Phoenix et le cinéaste M. Night Shyamalan ont tourné un chef-d’oeuvre, Signs, ainsi qu’un film imparfait, mais quand même très bon, The Village. Voici que selon Deadline, ils pourraient collaborer à nouveau sur un projet dont on ne connaît ni le titre ni la prémisse, mais qui aurait un budget modeste et qui serait produit par Jason Blum, comme The Visit, qui prendra l’affiche le 11 septembre. N’étant pas au Festival de Cannes, j’ai seulement suivi la compétition à distance, virtuellement. Mais d’après le buzz et les tweets ou critiques que j’ai lus, le film qui m’excite le plus est You Were Never Really Here de la géniale Lynne Ramsay, un hybride de cinéma de genre/auteur mettant en vedette Joaquin Phoenix. Ce dernier vient d’ailleurs de remporter le 

Prix d'interprétation masculine à Cannes, où le jury a également donné le prix du Meilleur scénario à Ramsay, ex aequo avec The Killing of a Sacred Deer de Yorgos Lanthimos. Autre film que je suis curieux de voir qui se retrouve au palmarès : The Beguiled, qui a valu le Prix de la mise en scène à Sofia Coppola.  Mentionnons également le Prix d'interprétation féminine remis à Diane Kruger pour In the Fade de Fatih Akin, le Prix spécial 70e anniversaire décerné à Nicole Kidman, la Caméra d'or remportée par Jeune femme de Léonor Serraille, le Prix du jury décroché par Loveless d’Andrey Zvyagintsev, le Grand Prix gagné par 120 battements par minute de Robin Campillo et enfin, la Palme d’or, qui est allée à The Square de Ruben Östlund. Il s’agit de la deuxième collaboration du cinéaste newyorkais avec l’irrésistible comédienne Emma Stone après Magic in the Moonlight, que je suis à peu près le seul à avoir trouver formidable (il est sur Netflix si vous voulez vous faire votre propre opinion). Dans le film, Stone joue une étudiante qui tombe amoureuse d’un de ses professeurs, incarné par le génial Joaquin Phoenix. Espérons que l’habituelle finesse d’écriture de Woody pairée avec ces deux acteurs extraordinaires parviendront à transcender cette prémisse plutôt banale. Chez les critiques, il est de bon ton pour presque chaque nouveau film de Woody Allen de se démener pour dire que ses beaux jours sont derrière lui et que sa dernière offrande est décevante… Mais à mon avis, à moins de s’attendre à un autre Annie Hall à chaque fois, un nouveau film de ce grand cinéaste est pas mal toujours une bonne chose. Même un Woody “mineur” est généralement supérieur à un bon nombre des films qui prennent l’affiche. Et pour ce que ça vaut, je respecte encore et toujours Allen pour sa capacité à livrer un film dense et satisfaisant en quelques 90 minutes. A-t-il déjà fait un film de plus de deux heures? Ceci étant dit, Irrational Man n’est pas une réussite totale. On y retrouve trop de narration en voix off inutile, certaines transitions narratives sont maladroites et la situation de départ, bien que transcendée plus tard dans le récit, est franchement banale. Car avouns-le, la prémisse d’une jeune et jolie étudiante qui tombe amoureuse d’un professeur d’université d’un certain âge est usée. Il y a toujours moyen d’insuffler un nouveau souffle aux clichés, et le fait que l’étudiante soit incarnée par la craquante Emma Stone et le professeur, par l’intense Joaquin Phoenix, aide beaucoup.  Mais c’est quand même lassant de voir une fille se pâmer devant un homme âgé tellement complexe, tellement cultivé, tellement tourmenté, tellement inatteignable… Et tant pis s’il est alcoolique, bedonnant et dépressif! En plus d’une intrigue de plus en plus captivante, le film bénéficie des images formidablement lumineuses et chaleureuses du directeur photo Darius Khondji et d’un entraînant leitmotiv musical, The ‘In’ Crowd du Ramsey Lewis Trio, deux éléments réjouissants qui contrastent drôlement avec le caractère plutôt sombre et tragique du scénario.  Sans être un des chefs-d’oeuvre absolus de Woody Allen, Irrational Man s’inscrit respectablement dans la lignée de films tels que Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point et Cassandra’s Dream. Étant un fan fini de Paul Thomas Anderson impatient de voir son prochain film, il y a un an, j'ai acheté le livre de Thomas Pynchon et me suis empressé de commencer à le lire… puis j'ai abandonné avant d'avoir atteint la moitié. Je me suis néanmoins dit qu'Anderson parviendrait à rendre Inherent Vice moins inconséquent et obtus que sur papier. Malheureusement, l'adaptation au grand écran m'a presque autant ennuyé que le roman original. 89 minutes. C’est tout ce dont Lynne Ramsay a besoin pour livrer à la fois une étude de personnage profondément émouvante et une série de scènes de suspense/action incroyablement intenses. Le résultat est un fascinant hybride de drame psychologique et de film de genre, à la fois dense et minimaliste. 89 minutes de pur cinéma, où chaque instant est percutant, développant toujours un peu plus le protagoniste, notamment à travers une myriade de flash-back aussi brefs qu’évocateurs, tout en tissant une captivante intrigue rappelant le film noir. Les nombreux moments de violence sont à la fois subtils et 

viscéraux, Ramsay multipliant les approches détournées, les angles inusités et les ellipses pour nous faire ressentir chaque coup de marteau, de poing ou d'arme à feu même lorsqu'ils surviennent hors champ.  On ne quitte pratiquement jamais le point de vue de Joe, le héros incarné par Joaquin Phoenix (Prix d'interprétation masculine à Cannes, où le scénario de Ramsay adapté du roman de Jonathan Ames a aussi été récompensé), un vétéran de l'armée et ancien agent du FBI hanté par les horreurs dont il a été témoin, son esprit étant traversé d'autant de cicatrices que son corps… incluant des traumatismes remontant à son enfance. Suicidaire, il mène une existence solitaire, isolée, aliénée, avec apparemment seulement sa mère (Judith Roberts) comme présence quelque peu réconfortante dans sa vie.  Vaut mieux en révéler le moins possible à propos du récit sordide de perversion et de corruption où Joe se voit plongé, qui rappelle à la fois Taxi Driver et Sin City. Mentionnons simplement que la cinéaste ne sombre jamais dans le sensationnalisme et l'exploitation, faisant plutôt preuve d'une grande empathie envers les victimes, dépeignant finement l'aspect troublant de la situation même pour Joe qui en a vu d'autres, et laissant poindre une faible lueur d'espoir.  Brillamment écrit et mis en scène par Ramsay, le film respecte constamment l'intelligence du spectateur, limitant l'exposition et ménageant les dialogues en général, faisant confiance à la force des images, à la précision du montage et à la bouleversante performance de Phoenix pour transmettre idées et informations. Et que dire de l'éclatante musique de Jonny Greenwood, possiblement le compositeur contemporain le plus inspiré, mêlant sonorités classiques, rock, électroniques et expérimentales pour refléter la vision kaléidoscopique de la réalisatrice, en plus d'offrir un parfait complément à la conception sonore souvent abrasive du film. You Were Never Really Here est le meilleur film que j'ai vu depuis longtemps. Une œuvre extraordinaire qui confirme le talent phénoménal de Lynne Ramsay. Tout ça en 89 minutes.  David Ayer, le réalisateur de Suicide Squad, film qui mettra en vedette des super-vilains de DC Comics, a posté sur Twitter la photo ci-dessus, sur laquelle on aperçoit plus ou moins clairement l’oscarisé Jared Leto avec son look de Joker. Incluant aussi Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), Cara Delevingne (Enchantress), Joel Kinnaman (Rick Flagg), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) et Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Killer Croc), Suicide Squad devrait prendre l’affiche le 5 août 2016.  Ce remake plus ou moins fidèle du film culte de 1989 recycle certains éléments du scénario original dans un contexte assez différent. Mais les grandes lignes sont là : Dalton, un type ayant la réputation de savoir se servir de ses poings, est recruté pour venir faire le ménage dans un bar routier envahi par la racaille; il développe une relation avec une infirmière du coin; un malveillant homme riche contrôle presque tout dans les environs.Le Road House de 2024 diffère notamment de son inspiration par le fait que Elwood Dalton (plutôt que James Dalton) est un ancien combattant de UFC déchu, qui mène une existence de vagabond vivant dans sa voiture lorsqu’on le rencontre, et que le bar routier qui l’engage se trouve dans les Keys de Floride plutôt qu’au Missouri. Là où le bât blesse, c’est que notre protagoniste est incarné par un Jake Gyllenhaal correct, mais loin d’être aussi iconique et badass que Patrick Swayze. De même, le méchant joué par Billy Magnussen n’arrive pas à la cheville du parfaitement détestable Ben Gazzara. Et les créateurs de cette nouvelle version n’ont même pas tenté de remplacer le vieux pote interprété par Sam Elliott! Mentionnons également qu’au lieu du Jeff Healey Band, on doit se contenter d’une succession de groupes anonymes jouant au bar alors que les bouteilles de bière volent de toute part. Bref, il s’agit indéniablement d’une pâle copie du long-métrage de Rowdy Herrington, qui n’est toutefois pas sans qualités. Malgré trop de longueurs, le remake inclut quand même plusieurs scènes d’action assez percutantes. Et à la mi-parcours, l’introduction du coloré psychopathe Knox, un rôle défendu avec enthousiasme par le véritable champion d’arts martiaux mixtes Conor McGregor, dynamise considérablement le récit. Il y a aussi une trame narrative intéressante impliquant une jeune fille (Hannah Love Lanier) travaillant dans une librairie qui compare la situation dans laquelle se retrouve Dalton à un roman western, ce qui n’est pas sans rappeler une certaine scène de Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. En janvier, le réalisateur Doug Liman a annoncé qu’il boycotterait la première de Road House (2024) à SXSW à cause de la décision d’Amazon MGM de lancer son film directement sur la plateforme Prime Video. Ironiquement, alors qu’il aurait été difficile de recommander d’aller le voir en salle, c’est le genre de vue qui mérite quand même qu’on lui jette un coup d’œil dans le confort de chez soi, sans trop d’attentes.

"Oct 4, 2019"," Being the origin story of the title villain, Joker is technically a Batman prequel and technically a comic book movie, but director and co-writer Todd Phillips (The Hangover, Old School) doesn’t want you to think of it as those things. He’s going for a gritty Martin Scorsese vibe — The King of Comedy specifically (most of the plot is borrowed from it), with a splash of Taxi Driver. Those movies’ ideas about fame, mental illness, and urban decay are probably more relevant in 2019 than they were when they came out, but Joker raises them only halfheartedly and addresses them not at all. It’s a gritty, Very Serious, faux-provocative movie with nothing to say. Set during a garbage strike in 1981 in a version of Gotham City where everyone has New York accents, the film stars a deeply committed Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a dangerously skinny, mentally unwell man who’s spent time in the bin and now works as a part-time clown while living with his invalid mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Arthur’s mental condition causes him to laugh at inappropriate times; that and his generally erratic behavior make him the target of bullying from disrespectful youths and Wall Street bros alike. (One of the latter taunts Arthur on the subway by singing “Send in the Clowns” at him, Sondheim showtunes being one of the usual ways that Wall Street bros torment their lessers.) Arthur wants to be a standup comedian and dreams of appearing on Live with Murray Franklin (think Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show), whose host is played by Robert De Niro. That’s a bit of stunt casting, of course; De Niro played what would have been the Joaquin Phoenix role in The King of Comedy (Jerry Lewis was the TV host). Phoenix’s performance here sometimes recalls an early-period De Niro, while De Niro’s own performance recalls a late-period De Niro, i.e., phoned-in and disinterested. His Murray Franklin is stiff and ungainly, like a last-minute guest host who is uncomfortable being on TV. Like Robert De Niro, in other words. One way that this is not your father’s comic book movie is that Arthur straight-up murders people, gunshot to the head, blam. His execution of some wealthy dudes who worked for Wayne Enterprises leads local tycoon Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) to go on TV and say, essentially, that poor people are clowns. This somehow leads to a political movement (“We are all clowns,” etc.) and eventually to riots, but Arthur isn’t part of this and the movie doesn’t develop the income-inequality theme. Nor does Phillips do much with the idea of marginalized, unstable men with violent tendencies, or our treatment of the mentally ill, or any of the other subjects that arise. Phoenix’s portrayal of mental illness is convincing and worthy, but neither Arthur Fleck nor his actions are interesting. I kept thinking: If I didn’t know the Batman connection and thought I was just watching some anonymous deranged character, would I find his story compelling? And the answer kept being no, not really. He’s unpredictable, but not particularly scary or menacing. It probably didn’t help that I recently re-watched King of Comedy, of which Joker is a photocopy of a photocopy. There has been concern that this movie will inspire violence. I find it unlikely that it will inspire anything. It barely inspired me to write a review. The violent content in the film isn’t ideological — he doesn’t kill anyone because of what they believe or what they represent. Rambo: Last Blood, which is more graphically violent and is ideological, is the one I’d be worried about (if anyone saw it). Joker tries hard to be edgy but is too shallow to have any impact.

"Oct 4, 2019"," There seems to be a sudden influx of villains getting their big screen treatment lately (there’s Venom last year, Birds of Prey trailer is just released highlighting Joker’s own girlfriend Harley Quinn, and Disney’s Maleficent: Mistress of Evil opens two weeks after Joker). But the again, antiheroes have always made such intriguing protagonists. In case you’re not aware of this, Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker character is NOT based on the comics. It’s an origin story of man named Arthur Fleck who would later become the DC super-villain, and so exists in the same universe as his future arch nemesis Batman in a decaying Gotham City. But writer/director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) sets the film in the 70s and 80s, an alternate timeline where it can stand alone and wouldn’t disrupt the current (and future) DC superhero movies. The film opens with Arthur preparing to work as a street clown, holding a sign for a furniture store promoting liquidation sale. He’s suddenly attacked by a bunch of teenage punks who break his sign and beat him up in an alley. To say Arthur is a down-on-his-luck guy would be an understatement. Calamity seems to constantly befallen him as he struggles from paycheck-to-paycheck while living in a cramped apartment with his frail mother Penny (Frances Conroy) with her own delusions of grandeur. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” He asks a social worker. From his visit here, it’s revealed that he’s once admitted to a psychiatric department and is now on seven different medications, none of which help his distorted mind which in his own words is ‘always filled with negative thoughts.’ The first act of the movie pretty much follows Arthur encountering one bad day after another, which initially was captivating, even hypnotic, thanks to Phoenix’s committed performance. I feel that the movie works largely because of Phoenix’s no-holds-barred approach to the role. He lost so much weight (apparently losing 53 pounds, a la former Batman Christian Bale for The Machinist)–using his physicality practically within an inch of its life. Phoenix also methodically researched patients suffering from Pathological Laughing Disorder that causes them to laugh uncontrollably, and the result is eerie. One can’t help but wince (in both pity and horror) watching him laugh maniacally, as he struggles to contain himself. As mesmerizing as Joaquin is in the role however, his magnetic quality soon wears out thanks to Phillips’ overbearing direction. There are countless scenes of him baring his skeletal frame as he descends into madness, and a plethora of extreme close-ups of his face makes me feel claustrophobic. Even in superhero films like Batman or Superman, there are moments where the hero is off-screen so you can spend time with supporting characters that helps tell one cohesive, layered story. But Philips seems as obsessed with his antihero as much as Arthur worships his idol, TV personality Murray Franklin (a somewhat brilliantly meta casting of Robert De Niro, given the heavy influences of his 70s/80s crime dramas). But despite having such a strong supporting cast here, all of them are basically reduced to cameos. There’s no room for depth whatsoever for any of them, as the focus is always solely on Arthur. Joaquin is literally in every. single. frame. of the film… all the extreme close ups are almost suffocating, it made me wonder afterwards if perhaps it’s to hide the banality and shallowness of the plot? There are moments that are truly gripping, the stand-up scene at a comedy club (which becomes the catalyst for the final act) comes to mind, but there are also plenty of slow, tedious moments where my mind wander a bit. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack by Hildur Guðnadóttir is often distracting in many scenes that would benefit a quieter music, creating an ominous cacophony that unnecessarily heightens the film’s bleak, joyless tone. Stylistically, the film is impeccable. The 70s/80s setting is an homage to Phillips’ favorite gritty crime dramas such as Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, which style/tone he heavily borrowed. Even the first violent scene in the subway harkens back memory of The French Connection. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher is stunning despite the decidedly grimy environment, while costume designer Mark Bridges creates a unique look that’s colorful yet dark/ominous at the same time. I also have to give props to the Makeup department team, a crucial area considering the protagonist’s reliance on face mask. Yet the makeup makes the most of Joaquin’s features without hampering an actor’s most important tool, his expressions. Narratively however, I’m just not too impressed with. While I appreciate that the movie grounds itself in reality–at least showing a semblance of real world as opposed to something fantastical, while also toying with what’s real and what’s not, in the end it’s not as complex as it thinks it is. I believe the fact that Phillips leverages such an iconic comic-book character with such a huge appeal makes the film inherently intriguing. If the film had been called Arthur Fleck and all the Batman references taken out, I’m not sure if the reception would’ve been as strong. That said, those expecting a strong connection with the Dark Knight would be disappointed, as Bruce is just a young boy here. There is a memorable encounter between Arthur and Thomas Wayne however, and the script even toys with a preposterous idea SPOILER ALERT! [highlight to read] that Arthur could be his illegitimate child (thus making him future Batman’s half brother!!), which made me go ‘whoa!’ END SPOILER. The ending makes it hard not to feel that the filmmakers glorify evil and his abhorrent deeds (something the studio, director and lead actor have denied vehemently). But as Arthur was ‘saved’ by a bunch of hoodlums in clown masks, having been provoked/energized by what he did LIVE on national tv, he suddenly becomes a hero for the marginalized and those ignored by society. It may not be the filmmakers’ intention to hold this character up as a hero, but it sure appears as exactly that in the finale. I find it hard to refute that notion seeing Arthur, which by then has taken up the Joker identity, dressed in full Joker’s colorful regalia and iconic bloody smile, dancing euphorically on top of a car, as throngs of clown-masked men cheer him on. If there was a commentary about the haves and the have-nots in Gotham, it’s only mentioned fleetingly, there’s no compelling sociopolitical message to be found here. Despite his utter disdain for the wealthy, how has Arthur himself care for or support the have-nots? He’s too busy wallowing in self pity, filled with rage and hell-bent on violent revenge. He fantasizes about his crush Sophie (Zazie Beetz) down the hall, but doesn’t give a hoot the fact that she is a single mother and also barely scraping by. The filmmaker doesn’t seem to care for the likes of her either, other than for the purpose of advancing his character’s narrative. Ultimately, Arthur lives in his own bubble, trapped by his narcissistic mind that he can’t possibly see the suffering of others. Thus, it’s rather incredulous that a fraught-minded person like Arthur would become someone who could inspire the masses in this way. Thus, that final scene seems to come out of nowhere, it doesn’t feel earned nor arrives at organically. While one could argue that Joaquin is as phenomenal as Joker as Heath Ledger was (though I wouldn’t say he topped Ledger’s performance), I’d say that the fact that Christopher Nolan chose NOT to give the Joker an origin story in The Dark Knight actually makes him more effective. He’s a true agent of chaos, as Alfred Pennyworth says he’s the kind of man who, ‘can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with… a man who just wants to see the world burn.’ There’s a calculating, sly, even sophistication in Ledger’s Joker’s megalomaniacal ways, who’s always in control and two steps ahead of his adversaries. Arthur’s Joker however, is a tragic character… a mentally-unstable loner who supposedly becomes evil because of circumstances. This film blatantly connects his homicidal urges and violent retributions to the fact that society wronged him, i.e. being bullied, unable to get meds due to social services getting cut, etc. It’s as if the film skirts responsibility and steers the blame away from Arthur, no matter how heinous his crime, painting him more as a victim than perpetrator. One would be hard-pressed not to see the danger that such notion could be used as an excuse for certain people inciting chaos and revenge on those they deem as ‘deserving the violence,’ hence the US military issuing warning against possible shooting at Joker screenings. There’s even extra beefed-up security at the press screening, which I think is warranted. One might argue the number of violent scenes here is actually not as much as those depicted on cable tv these days. But given the character’s sheer unpredictability, the heavy sense of dread makes it feel like it’s more vicious. I definitely discourage parents from bringing their kids to see this, not even young teens. This film earns a hard R for a reason. Now, it’s always debatable whether art incites violence, and I for one thinks it’s a slippery slope whenever there’s a call for art censorship. By the same token, every content creator must be at least being mindful of how its creation could be interpreted as, and in this case, how it could inspire something that causes harm or be used to justify vigilantism. Setting all that aside, the big question is, did the movie live up to the hype–even my own given my excitement when the first Joker trailer was released? Well, it certainly turns out to be a chilling origin story of a tragic character, but more so because of Phoenix’s performance than the film’s direction. Yet I find it tough to root for his character, despite initially feeling sympathy towards him. It’s an unrelentingly grim and utterly bleak affair from start to finish, it’d be tough to put on a happy face after you watch it. The irony isn’t lost on me that a movie featuring a character who thinks his purpose is ‘to bring laughter and joy to the world’ turns out to mostly devoid of either. In terms of re-watchability, this is not one of those films I’m keen on revisiting. I’m interested in seeing this as I want to see what Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix does as it did shock everyone in Venice by winning the festival’s top prize which is a big deal. Honestly I’m surprised by such a rapturous reception after seeing the film. Well, every festival is different I suppose. Seems that now more critics and audiences have seen it, the movie proves to be divisive. It’s not a bad film, but not a great one either. Joaquin is fantastic though. I think your use of the word shallow is right. The film has its moments, and a strong central performance, but nit much else. All the Awards talk doesn’t feel justified given the lack of depth. Good review! Hello! I think everyone agrees Joaquin shines in the role (though people who have seen ‘You Were Never Really Here’ thinks he’s better in that), but the film itself is often boring and in the end doesn’t really have anything worthy to say. Yep, definitely doesn’t live up to all the hype from Venice. Well written review Ruth. I was planning to see it this weekend but then the authority came out with a warning about potential violence at the showings and some theaters will have undercover cops in attendance. I’m sure there’s a slim chance that any idiot will carry out any violent acts but we live in a different world now, especially here in the States. So I’ll wait to rent it since I don’t want to take that chance, I’m not the luckiest person. Lol. Hey Ted! Well I remember you said you’re skeptical of Phillips, I guess you’re right he’s not a strong director but paraded his work here as if it has immense depth. He thinks by borrowing the style/tone of highly acclaimed films of the era JOKER is set in would automatically make it a great film. I think it’s prudent to just wait to rent this later, seems that it’s plausible there’d be an unfortunate event happening at some screenings. I wasn’t surprised of the heavy security at the press screening and glad they were thorough, checking bags and wanding every patron. In any case, I don’t really want to see this movie again. You made a very interesting point that without the Batman connection, the movie might not have been as popular if it was simply called Arthur Fleck instead of Joker. As it stands, I think Joker is more like a feature-length PSA on the importance of looking after the psychologically vulnerable. Film is in my blood.

"Oct 4, 2019"," Joker es la mejor película de superhéroes que he visto. Y no lo digo a la ligera: The Dark Knight de Nolan es una maravilla, pero esta cinta tan desconcertante cambia completamente un género en pantalla como Frank Miller lo cambió, en las páginas, con The Dark Knight Returns. Queriendo o sin querer, la cinta de Phillips alinea el mito de Batman con el cinismo contemporáneo y nos regresa, con un espejo desolador, los mecanismos insidiosos a los que adherimos en este género. ¿Sabemos a quién aplaudimos cuando aplaudimos a nuestros héroes en pantalla? Joker nace de las cenizas del DCEU. Warner Bros. apostó todo para competir con el universo fílmico de Marvel y, en el proceso, perdió el alma. Cuando el MCU empezó a crecer, los ejecutivos de DC optaron por abandonar proyectos más personales y de corte autoral (como la trilogía de The Dark Knight de Nolan o el Man of Steel de Snyder). Para tratar de emular los logros de los universos compartidos, DC sacrificó mucha libertad creativa, creó una profunda división entre fans, se ganó el repudio de los críticos y se metió en un -millonario, hay que decirlo- callejón sin salida. Así que, después del enorme bodrio que fue Suicide Squad (2016) los ejecutivos vieron en Todd Phillips una esperanza. El inesperado director de comedias medio irreverentes, medio banales, como Road Trip (2000), Starsky & Hutch (2004) y la trilogía de The Hangover (2009-2013), quería dar un giro en su carrera después de filmar War Dogs (2016). Esta cinta que buscaba sacudir las buenas conciencias políticas, terminó pasando sin pena ni gloria entre tantas provocaciones (nada que no hubiera intentado hacer, con mayor irreverencia, Lord of War de Andrew Niccol, diez años antes). Frustrado, Phillips empezó a perseguir financiamientos para realizar un nuevo sueño de provocación: un estudio de personaje digno de las cintas setenteras y ochenteras que pavimentaron su imaginación de niño. Películas como Mean Streets (1973), Serpico (1973), Death Wish (1974), One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), The Network (1976), Taxi Driver (1976) y The King of Comedy (1982). Ahora bien, es evidente que ningún gran estudio, en estos momentos de imágenes conservadoras, aceptaría financiar una película como Straw Dogs (1971). Y, en este plan maquiavélico confesado, Phillips se volteó hacia personajes de cómics que podrían entrar en un thriller psicológico de este tipo. Entonces, considerando el bodrio que hizo Jared Leto, el desafortunado director le propuso a DC crear una película en solitario de The Joker, el máximo némesis de Batman y rey bufón del crimen por casi ochenta años. Inmediatamente, sorteando una enorme cantidad de obstáculos, Phillips logró lo impensable: que DC abandonara su necesidad obsesiva de emular los logros de Marvel y que Joaquin Phoenix aceptara protagonizar una película basada en cómics (cuando ya le habían ofrecido ser Bruce Banner y Steven Strange). El resultado es una película que se hizo con enorme libertad, que no necesitó basarse en ningún arco de cómic y que tiene a uno de los más grandes actores de las últimas décadas en pantalla. Claro, esto no basta para hacer una buena película y Todd Phillips es un director que, a pesar de sus grandes pretensiones, no tiene la sensibilidad, profundidad y elocuencia del Scorsese que trató de emular. Sin embargo, Joker es una película sumamente interesante a pesar de su director; una película que no tiene por qué existir fuera del género que le dio vida; una película que, al inmiscuirse poco con el material de los cómics, crea una visión original, desgarradora y necesaria de un personaje esencial para la cultura popular contemporánea. Joker cuenta la historia de Arthur Fleck, un hombre recientemente liberado del manicomio que se gana la vida como payaso de alquiler. Su trabajo le permite hacer lo que su madre siempre le prescribió como destino: repartir alegría en el mundo y poner una sonrisa en la cara de todos. Ella lo llama, incluso, “Happy” porque “siempre ha sido un niño muy feliz”. Arthur desempeña su trabajo con singular entusiasmo: va a hospitales para niños y baila (imitando el singular estilo de Ray Bolger en The Wizard of Oz de 1939), juega con carteles en la calle, trata de ser feliz en todas sus pequeñas actividades. Pero la vida no le regresa las sonrisas: niños abusivos lo golpean a cada esquina, compañeros de trabajo lo engañan y nadie parece entenderlo. Cada vez más aislado, cada vez más violento, cada vez menos medicado, Arthur comienza a perder el piso. Todo se derrumba a su alrededor y nadie parece estar de su lado. Incluso la madre amorosa que tanto lo anima parece esconder cosas. ¿Qué pasa cuando un hombre tan inseguro y tan inestable es empujado al límite? ¿Qué pasa cuando la maldad causa consecuencias apremiantes que escurren de los altos puestos de gobierno hasta el subsuelo apestoso de una ciudad? ¿Qué pasa cuando se exprime demasiado la sanidad, la cordura, la paciencia de los enfermos mentales que deberían vivir medicados, tratados o aislados? ¿Qué pasa cuando una sociedad se pudre tanto que cualquier chispa puede llevarla al caos? Como pueden ver por esta premisa, Todd Phillips no trata de encontrarle tres pies al gato. Ésta es una historia de origen clásica que quiere, también, tener una cierta profundidad política. Sin tener mucho más y sin tener mucho menos, Phillips no es particularmente sutil con su lectura política. Tal vez, al querer abarcar demasiado, la fuerza de los argumentos lo descarrilan. Como bien comentó Alonso Díaz de la Vega en su reseña para El Universal, Phillips parece empatizar con la víctima y luego acusarlo por victimario, parece incitar a la revuelta popular para luego hablar de sus peligros. El suyo es un discurso que se sale de las manos y que rebasa sus propósitos iniciales. Sin embargo, en medio de esta torpeza política, Phillips logra hacer algo impensable. Porque este estudio de personaje, a pesar de sus convencionalismos y sus tropiezos discursivos, pone en jaque el discurso narrativo de los superhéroes en pantalla. Al hacerlo, Joker se convierte en la primera película que, en mucho tiempo, subvierte verdaderamente los parámetros del cine de superhéroes. Esta cinta es mucho más revulsiva para el género que Deadpool  (2015) y que Logan (2017) porque, a diferencia de estas dos películas, Phillips, activamente, trató de huir del cine de superhéroes. Y, en este intento, logró revertir una fórmula con resultados sorpresivos. Así, a pesar de su director, Joker logra una reflexión necesaria sobre la ideología en pantalla y las imágenes que nunca fueron inocentes. Con Joker, Phillips trabajó con un equipo cercano de colaboradores frecuentes. El crew que montó fue compacto y preciso porque quería controlar el set con particular neurosis. Todo para lograr, en este retrato psicológico, un cierto naturalismo. Y, cuando hablo de naturalismo aquí, no hablo de la visión extraña de Jon Favreau en The Lion King (2019), sino de la vieja definición literaria. Éste es el tipo de naturalismo que formuló Émile Zola en el siglo XIX, el naturalismo que trata de crear una unión esencial entre el medio que habitamos y cómo nos comportamos; éste es el realismo romántico que Auerbach encontró en la Pensión Vauquer de Balzac en donde el medio expresa a los personajes. Éste es, finalmente, el naturalismo que, con una visión aguda y sensible, Scorsese desplegaba en las películas de los años setenta que Todd Phillips quiere emular en Joker. Las calles y los hogares, el medio social y los entornos se impregnan en los personajes de Mean Streets, como los colores amarillo y caqui, verde militar y rojo hacen que el taxi de Travis Bickle y el ambiente del fondo de Nueva York se confundan. Tanto los chicos de Little Italy en Mean Streets, como el frustrado conductor de taxi son hijos de su entorno, de su ciudad, de un medio social específico. A través de ellos Nueva York existe y ellos sólo existen a través de Nueva York. La cámara atenta de Scorsese los retrata confundidos con el fondo de la ciudad y todo nos recuerda a los personajes fatales de Germinal o a los pequeñoburgueses parisinos miserables de Balzac. Todd Phillips siguió estas enseñanzas en Joker y buscó hacer una investigación minuciosa de Nueva York para reconstruir su aspecto de finales de los años setenta y principios de los años ochenta. ¿Qué películas estaban en las marquesinas? ¿Qué tipo de grafitis había en el metro? ¿Cómo caminaba la gente? ¿Cómo se vestían? Este nivel de detalle no es gratuito y esta obsesión por la reconstrucción de un medio dice mucho. Phillips quería reconstruir el lugar en donde creció para alimentar, con su propia experiencia, a un villano célebre en el mundo entero. Ésta es la búsqueda por expresar un medio social en un personaje y a un personaje a través de ese medio social. Y, en este esfuerzo, Ciudad Gótica, de pronto, es la fusión de todos los barrios neoyorkinos salpicados de Manhattan. Para lograr reconstruir la identidad imaginada, estetizada y naturalista de esta Ciudad Gótica neoyorquina de finales de los años setenta, Phillips contrató al diseñador de producción Mark Friedberg. Friedberg (también oriundo del rumbo) tiene una enorme experiencia en reconstrucciones de Nueva York y Nueva Jersey en distintas épocas; por sólo mencionar algunas cintas, él hizo el diseño de producción de If Beale Street Could Talk (2018), Paterson (2016), Wonderstruck (2017) y Synecdoche, New York (2008). Así, junto a Phillips, revivió los testimonios documentales de Chantal Akerman en News from Home (1977) y pasaron por cientos de fotografías de época. Todo esto para lograr crear, junto al enorme diseñador de vestuario de Paul Thomas Anderson, Mark Bridges (The Phantom Thread (2017), Inherent Vice (2014)), una relación única entre la ciudad y el personaje. La Ciudad Gótica de Phillips no tiene nada que ver con la Ciudad Gótica sórdida de Burton o con el Chicago de Nolan o con el Art Deco expresionista de la serie animada. No, esta Ciudad Gótica es una amalgama geográficamente confusa de Nueva York con retazos del Sur del Bronx y sus escaleras, pedazos de Nueva Jersey, estaciones de Brooklyn y clubes de comedia de Manhattan. Y, evidentemente, como la ciudad de Little Johnny o Travis Bickle, esta Ciudad Gótica se imprime en los personajes que la habitan. Porque es un lugar particularmente sórdido: al menos las lluvias, en el Nueva York de Taxi Driver, se llevaron la basura de las banquetas. La diferencia principal aquí, entre la Ciudad Gótica de Nolan y la de Phillips, es que, en esta última, no hay ni un atisbo de esperanza. Con Nolan, existe una estructura con hombres buenos que, en medio de la corrupción y la tendencia al caos, quieren sacar la cordura y la decencia adelante. En la ciudad de Phillips, sin embargo, no puede curarse la brecha entre los pobres y los ricos, no hay ninguna estructura, no existe la posibilidad de crear lazos democráticos. El alcalde que se postula para salvar a la ciudad (y cuyo nombre omito a propósito), es una amalgama de Trump y el altivo paternalismo de un viejo político demócrata: lo peor de dos mundos en una sociedad aún más dividida que la de Estados Unidos. En este trasfondo social y cultural, en esta ciudad destruida entre la basura y la desidia, el trabajo de Mark Bridges es excepcional para que, con el vestuario, Arthur Fleck desaparezca. Más que Travis Bickle o los chicos de Mean Streets que pertenecen al fondo de la ciudad, el personaje central de Phillips se desvanece en contraste con la ciudad. Es un personaje que se ve diminuto en el mundo exterior, pequeño y confundido con el fondo de la ciudad pestilente. Los patrones de colores del vestuario de Arthur van cambiando junto a su transformación: del caqui y gris que lo borran en el trasfondo urbano, Arthur comienza a despertar en naranjas y amarillos y verdes. La relación entre sociedad, ciudad y personaje se afina entonces, entre los vestuarios de Bridges y los escenarios de Friedberg, con la fotografía de Lawrence Sher (colaborador de seis películas de Phillips) y, por supuesto, con la actuación monumental de Joaquin Phoenix. Para lograr ese mismo naturalismo inmersivo, Sher seteaba las luces y dejaba correr la cinta grabando con poca profundidad de campo (una Alexa de 65mm) y otro operador con steady cam (Geoff Haley) la interpretación improvisada de Phoenix. Así, muchas escenas sin diálogo, con Phoenix interactuando con el ambiente que lo representa y lo atraviesa, fueron creadas en el momento. En particular, una escena pivote de la transformación de Arthur Fleck en Joker ocurrió de manera espontánea en un baño, con la enorme música de chelos de Hildur Guðnadóttir (Arrival, Chernobyl) y Phoenix bailando delicadamente una liberación de violencia. Pero, más allá de estas escenas aisladas, la forma en que el personaje de Phoenix se desplaza y la forma en que se filman esos desplazamientos es significativa de la forma en que la ciudad oprime al personaje y lo transforma. Al principio de la cinta, Fleck camina encorvado, doblado sobre sí mismo, replegado y derrotado. Todas las tomas en la ciudad, en estos momentos de tormento, lo muestran subiendo pendientes, subiendo escaleras, penosamente, arrastrando con los pies el peso del mundo. Ahí, los contrapicados son para ilustrar a Sisifo infeliz. Después de su transformación en Joker, Fleck baila, ligero como una pluma, metamorfoseado, corre y vuela por los aires… por primera vez, lo vemos bajando unas escaleras y caminar con la cara erguida en un contrapicados que domina como Atlas sin el peso del mundo. El logro del naturalismo de Phillips está en que este personaje se crea con el medio que lo rodea, con los sonidos que lo acompañan, con los olores pestilentes que uno intuye, con la época y la desesperación social que le dio vida. Aquí, la jaula describe al canario. Y la liberación de Fleck es la emancipación sobre la ciudad y su fondo inerte, es una revelación para ser observado, para ser considerado, para ser alguien. Cuando, al final, Fleck cumple su potencial y se convierte en Joker, la ciudad sufre y él trasciende, más allá de sí mismo, como un símbolo de visibilidad absoluta. ¿No es eso una gran ironía? ¿Que antes de cualquier murciélago, un payaso se convirtiera en el símbolo de Ciudad Gótica? ¿La imagen misma de miedos encarnados? ¿La liberación de los que, en este medio pestilente, no tienen voz? Con el maravilloso diseño, con los vestuarios elegantemente cuidados, con la fotografía cercana y los acordes únicos de Guðnadóttir, Phillips quiso crear un estudio psicológico desdoblado en una historia de origen. Lo dijo en múltiples entrevistas, su interés no estaba en el personaje de Joker, sino en el hombre que se convirtió en Joker y el proceso de esta peculiar transformación. El acercamiento es completamente opuesto al de Nolan. El director de The Dark Knight prefirió evitar las historias de origen, evitó cualquier identificación del personaje, le quitó toda relación con la sociedad y lo convirtió en un bromista que tiene un pasado, como escribió famosamente Alan Moore, “de opción múltiple”. Es por eso que el Joker de Ledger, a pesar de estar tan cuerdo y de ser tan académico, es tan desconcertante: un personaje sin explicación, sin pasado, sin porqué es mucho más inquietante que las explicaciones sociales. A pesar de esta valiosa enseñanza, Phillips quería una historia de origen para poder explotar un presupuesto considerable (aunque chico para un estudio como Warner Bros); una historia de origen que le permitiera, claro, hacer un estudio psicológico setentero. Por eso no podía retomar la vieja historia del ácido de Under the Red Hood: los elementos fantásticos y casuales del asunto le impedían compaginarlo con su idea de naturalismo. El azar no podía intervenir en la creación de este personaje: todo tenía que emanar del medio social. Así que solamente tomó las partes más realistas de The Killing Joke (a saber, la carrera frustrada de comediante y la vida miserable del hombre que se convirtió en Joker) para adaptar al personaje de Alan Moore como un incel resentido. Aquí, el hombre previo al maquillaje no estaba casado, no iba a tener un hijo y no dejó un trabajo en la planta petroquímica. En vez de eso, el Joker de Phillips es un hombre con una condición mental seria que, saliendo del manicomio, se disfraza de payaso porque cree fervientemente en el mandato de una madre que siempre lo llamó “Happy”. Todo en el nuevo origen de este personaje está fuertemente relacionado a su enfermedad mental y la incapacidad crónica que tiene de percibir la realidad que lo rodea en toda su crudeza. Entre fantasías y autoengaños, la vida de Arthur Fleck y de su madre está llena de peligrosos misterios. Y ahí es donde está el suspenso de la construcción de un perfil psicológico: en ir averiguando qué es real y qué es ficción desplazada desde el punto de vista del personaje central. Porque, con menos sutileza que el Scorsese de Taxi Driver y The King of Comedy, Phillips nos presenta este mundo a través de la visión torcida de Arthur Fleck. La creación de este personaje desde el realismo, y despojado de muchos elementos constitutivos de los confusos orígenes del cómic, no evita que Phillips haga una película de superhéroes. Porque, por más que les digan, ésta es la historia de origen de un supervillano que no puede desapegarse de su contraparte. Así, a pesar de ser una película de Joker, Phillips no puede evitar tratar, tangencialmente, con el nacimiento del murciélago de Ciudad Gótica. Todo el mythos de Batman y de The Joker se ha ido construyendo para emparentarlos. De hecho, Nolan entendió muy bien el valor de un némesis: el Joker de Ledger trata de comprobarle a Batman que no son muy distintos y que, finalmente, se necesitan. En la novela gráfica de Grant Morrison Arkham Asylum: A Serious Place on a Serious Earth, el Joker trata de demostrar, cuando Batman se queda atrapado en Arkham, que él siempre ha pertenecido ahí. Y la imagen es tan interesante porque, metafóricamente, Batman siempre ha estado atrapado en un universo desquiciado lleno de barrocos villanos. La idea es que el asilo en el cómic dibujado genialmente por Dave McKean es una metáfora de la existencia ficcional de Batman: el hombre murciélago no existe en la vida real, sino que está atrapado, entre las páginas de la ficción, con todos sus coloridas contrapartes. “El asilo de locos está allá afuera”, dice el Joker al final de la novela, “cuando se ponga muy desquiciado, sabes que siempre tendrás un lugar aquí dentro”. En el tratamiento de Phillips, pues, el mythos fundador de estos dos personajes como contrapartes existe. A pesar de no querer hacer una película basada en cómics y a pesar de no querer hacer una película de superhéroes, en su retrato psicológico, Phillips reinventa también, de cierta forma, el mito de Batman. Al hacerlo, muestra algo inquietante: el Joker y Batman no nada más son dos caras de la misma moneda, sino que son dos seres absolutamente cercanos, inseparables, hijos del mismo medio, de la misma miseria, de la misma maldad. Aquí, tanto héroes como villanos son productos del horror humano, contrapartes necesarias en la caricaturización de un mundo. Por eso, tal vez a pesar de sí mismo, Phillips hizo una película de superhéroes particularmente inteligente que muestra, sin necesidad de esquemas retorcidos y tramas complejas, cómo los superhéroes y los supervillanos nacen de la misma sepa caricaturesca. Aquí, es el poder sin consecuencias que da vida a los dos polos maniqueos del cómic. No se trata nada más de pobreza contra riqueza, ni de buenos contra malos, sino del acto más terrible de maldad humana, el ejercicio de poder desmedido, que desbalancea el reino social y lo convierte en un carnaval de hombres disfrazados luchando entre ellos. La idea aquí es que el máximo miedo americano actual está en el ejercicio desmedido del poder y las posibles consecuencias reales que tendrá. Phillips, queriendo o sin querer, dice algo sumamente interesante: lo que separa nuestro mundo de los cómics es un simple resbalón íntimo entre poderosos. Lo impresionante también en Joker es que esto se logra subvirtiendo todas las estructuras habituales del cine de superhéroes y de las películas fuertemente ideologizadas de la cultura popular americana. Las historias de origen siempre han sido, en Estados Unidos, una justificación de la violencia simbólica. John McClane mata para recuperar a su familia (la unión familiar después del divorcio más allá de salvarle la vida a su esposa); John Rambo mata para probar que no es un vago cualquiera (se le debe respeto a los veteranos); Rocky Balboa pelea para comprobar que el sueño americano existe, es palpable y puede alcanzarse con esfuerzo y valor. En este esquema, por supuesto, también hemos visto las perversiones del sueño americano con personajes como Michael Corleone en la saga de The Godfather o con el remake de Scarface de Brian de Palma. Pero esas versiones del sueño americano trastocado por criminales, tan efectivas narrativamente (al punto en que Netflix le hace series a los narcos mexicanos), siempre tiene la idea de un cautionary tale: en todo momento sabemos que estos personajes son un contraejemplo cultural, en todo momento se alejan de nosotros, progresivamente, con la empatía que se pierde. Al contrario, la primera parte de la película de Phillips es absolutamente empática. De hecho, todo en la cinta nos lleva a simpatizar con el personaje hasta que sucede un primer acto violento que lo redime y lo pone a bailar. En ese momento, el personaje se convierte en otra cosa… y, sin embargo, el acercamiento de Phillips sigue siendo extrañamente compasivo. En ese sentido, tal vez por la misma torpeza del director, la película de Joker logra revertir el discurso ideológico habitual americano para mostrar su poder: si puedes hacer una historia de origen para justificar cualquier violencia (como la de los machos de guerra en American Sniper (2014) de Eastwood), puedes hacer una historia de origen para ensalzar a vengadores anárquicos de los desprotegidos. En el fondo, ésta es una idea que va en contra de la violencia simbólica tan común en el cine estadounidense porque muestra que el héroe en pantalla no siempre es el transmisor de bondades puras, ajenas a cualquier ideología, valores universales e intachables. Joker, por eso, tiene tanto que ver con Taxi Driver como con Rocky: es la historia de Travis Bickle contada como si fuera el Italian Stallion y es la historia de un símbolo naciente, como Batman, revertido. En un momento de la película, por el mismo esquema narrativo, por la manera en que te llevó de la mano la trama y la empatía que provoca en el camino, por el pop efectista de época, por todos los clichés que enarbola Phillips sin darse mucho cuenta, acabas aplaudiendo. Estas aplaudiéndole a un sociópata asesino, megalómano y peligroso porque, finalmente, eso es lo que te hacen hacer estas películas. Saliendo de Joker pensé en cuántas veces había sentido ese mismo entusiasmo por asesinos socialmente aprobados por la cultura pop americana. Y me pregunté, entonces, a quién aplaudimos cuando aplaudimos a la pantalla. La respuesta no siempre es evidente, pero siempre es mucho más interesante preguntarnos sobre estos mecanismos que aceptarlos como si fueran naturales. Todd Phillips hizo, en mi opinión, la mejor película de superhéroes porque, casi sin saberlo, nos mostró lo insidiosos que son sus discursos y la facilidad que tenemos para olvidarnos en los hermosos colores de la violencia y el nihilismo. Creo que Todd Phillips tiene el síndrome de Oliver Stone: es un tipo limitado que, de pronto, se encuentra con grandes ideas y a tropezones acaba haciendo películas que son más inteligentes que él. Eso fue lo que le pasó a Stone cuando se encontró con el guión de Tarantino en Natural Born Killers (1994) y eso fue lo que pasó en Joker. Porque, a pesar de todos los clichés, a pesar de todas las referencias gastadas y los errores de tono, Joker termina siendo una reinvención valiente del mito de Batman; una película intrigante sobre los usos contemporáneos del naturalismo literario; y una bofetada con guante blanco a la defensa constante de cierta violencia simbólica en Estados Unidos. Con todo, me importa más el resultado que la intención y, por eso, creo que Joker es la mejor película de superhéroes que he visto. La discusión queda, claro, porque como toda película intrigante, Joker está en el limbo, tan lejano del olvido, que divide al odio de la pasión.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," I was not originally planning to see Joker during the festival, but when it won the Golden Lion in Venice, I was curious. No doubt many other critics were, too. And so it was that we all dragged ourselves to one of the two concurrent press screenings of the film on a Tuesday morning, wondering what on earth we were in for. I nearly didn’t get in; both theatres filled up fast, and I was only let in mere minutes before it began. Seated at the very front, the screen looming up over me as I craned my neck skyward to watch Joaquin Phoenix’s pliant face as he opened the film applying his clown makeup, I waited to know what the hell I was doing there. Why I was not watching another film playing at the same time, like Steven Soderbergh’s The Laundromat or Malgorzata Szumowska’s The Other Lamb. I was waiting for that epiphany—that moment of realization that this was surely better than my cynical mind was expecting it to be. If an exceptional filmmaker like Lucrecia Martel could give her stamp of approval to this, then certainly I could, too. The cynic in me was not converted. On and on the film trudged. Phoenix gamely cackled compulsively, his uncontrollable tittering the result of some unexplained medical condition. His Arthur Fleck is a simmering broiler of indeterminate conditions, mental and physical (Phoenix goes shirtless several times, revealing his emaciated ribcage to further punctuate the fact that Fleck is wasting away in all senses of the word). Gotham City, too, is rotting away, its finances in such dire straits that Fleck is forced off his medications and counseling due to budgetary cuts. Its citizens, meanwhile, are vaguely beginning to protest their dissatisfaction with the wealthiest amongst them, though we never know what exactly their grievances are. When Fleck murders a bunch of financial sector jerks on a subway train, his act sparks a revolution of sorts since everyone believes he did it because they were rich. Oh, how things get out of hand! How quickly people will misconstrue the facts to make them fit their own narrative when they’re not happy with the way things are! In the end, a man being eaten alive by his mental illnesses is elevated to the status of a folk hero because he’s the by-product of his society’s negligence and ignorance, and yet his saga is drained of all interest because the script’s world-building is so punishingly cursory. Gotham and its predicaments are as generic as they come, so why should we care? Without finer detailing to truly flesh out its core grievances, Joker comes out an underbaked bore, and one that hardly warrants the nail-biting and handwringing over its “provocative” content. For, in truth, its provocations are easily negated by the fact it has nothing cogent or insightful to say about the state of our world. To successfully hold up a mirror to the way we live, we must flinch at the reflection; to do this we must see the true depths of the pains and inequalities we suffer. Joker skirts away from this truth by varnishing over specificity. Anger, inequity, protest—they are all words without proper signifieds here, pantomimed without being felt. This reaches into Phoenix’s performance, as well. Many will shower him with adulations, but I’m not so easily impressed at this antic collection of tics, which feels to me more like a pastiche of mental illness than something approaching the real thing. Those who genuinely suffer on a day-to-day basis will not see themselves reflected in such a mannered husk of a performance—a performance unusually below Phoenix’s personal standards. A savvier script—one that really had something decisive and explicit to say about anti-establishment movements and structural inequality—could have turned this around. I would’ve been willing to forgive the unimaginative callbacks to Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, too, had those callbacks been properly reinvigorated instead of clumsily re-enacted. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Phoenix may cackle up a storm, and the dark clouds may roll in as catastrophe nears—but there is nothing to cackle at, or anything to rain on. It is a premise in search of an argument, and, finding none, is content to get by on empty commotion.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019"," Since director Todd Phillips’s Joker premiered at the 76th Venice Film Festival in August 2019, it’s been mired in controversy. Some hailed the film as an absolute masterpiece of filming, evoking elements of director Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. Others called it a problematic piece of cinema bound to stoke the fires of boiling hatred in certain corners of the Internet. Joker is both of these things at once. It is technically immaculate, beautifully acted, and a brilliantly designed story. All of these aspects come together to deliver the most true-to-form cinematic representation of Joker yet. Despite all of this, the message within Joker is undeniably muddy, ensuring that the same people who don’t understand the satire of Fight Club will miss the subtleties of Joker, viewing it as a call to action instead. In the script by Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver (8 Mile), a never-been-seen look into the origins of DC Comics’s most nefarious villain is offered. Before he was the Clown Prince of Crime, he was mild-mannered Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire with dreams of being a comedian. However, his neurological condition causing fits of laughter and his struggles with mental illness make it difficult for Arthur to connect with the world. In an attempt to make concrete what’s only ever been hinted at through the Joker’s storied history, Phillips and Silver place Arthur as the unintended spark of revolution in a Gotham City on the verge of explosion. Considering Phillips’s history as a comedic director (Old School, The Hangover trilogy) as well as his recent comments about the state of comedy, it would be fair to have a certain skepticism when approaching Joker. The character is known for his violent, yet comedic aspects, so asking what a director like Phillips has to offer is completely natural. The answer is utterly surprising, as Joker is just as enthralling as the initial chatter suggests. From the opening shot of the film, Phoenix is mesmerizing, presenting the complexities of an individual struggling with agency against forces internal and external with apparent ease. Even as Arthur begins to welcome the darker side of his personality, Phoenix’s performance makes Arthur endearing, even empathetic within the context of the film. This is not a character anyone should relate to, yet here we are, growing ever heartbroken for each trial Arthur endures, none of which would be possible without Phoenix’s ability to ground the character. Helping the audience to understand Arthur’s perspective is Phillips’s almost documentary-style filmmaking. Though he’s most well-known for his features, Phillips began as a documentarian with 1993’s Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies and he clearly brings that skill-set of capturing the realism of everyday life to Joker. It presents itself in small ways, like the obvious movement of a camera being physically moved closer to the scene, versus using a more traditional zoom, so that when we watch Arthur in a particularly low moment seek out solitude within his apartment, the audience becomes acutely aware of the director’s physical presence. This sends visual cues that trigger feelings of intimacy that are typically reserved for subjects of documentaries, wherein the audience is given the sensation of being allowed in, to see something no one else does. It’s also present in the way Phillips opts for close-ups and extreme close-ups, ensuring the audience is made intimate with Arthur, unable to look away from the pain and torment the character struggles with daily. This directorial approach also offers occasional opportunities for the audience to feel like they see what Arthur sees, ensuring a greater emotional connection between the character and the audience. In one scene, as Arthur moves around a room, the camera uses a hard focus on his hand and soft focus elsewhere. Phillips wants us to only look where Arthur’s concentrating his attention, so even if all the audience sees is a hand, the audience is signaled to this area’s significance to Arthur. Moments like these are peppered throughout Joker, enabling the audience the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a burgeoning villain. As entrancing as it is at times, there’s no denying the burgeoning, purposeful uneasiness that emanates from the entire film. Hildur Guðnadóttir’s (HBO’s Chernobyl) score utilizes almost off-key violins, making the beautiful sounds of the string instrument immediately off-putting, increasing the already unsettling nature of the narrative to greater heights. Much like the Joker, Philips uses these strings as merely one element of a series designed specifically to put the audience off. There’s a moment in the film which calls into question the validity of everything which follows. In concert with a somewhat vague ending, Phillips and Silver bring forth the most unreliable of unreliable narrators. This is apropos, as any story focusing on the Joker requires a precise amount of uncertainty and a dash of truth. There’s one clue in particular that suggests to this reviewer just how much of the film to trust and how much not, but the fact that there’s any wiggle room at all is indicative of just how much Phillips and Silver understand the mind of the Joker. That said, there’s no denying the danger of the depiction they present. Art doesn’t happen in a vacuum. As such, it comes with a certain level of intent in both its inspiration and intended message. The thing is that while the inspiration is clear, the message of Joker is absolutely murky. If we presume that any character at the center of a story is the hero, then the audience should be rooting for Arthur, even as he deals with the tragic hand of fate. Except we should not be rooting for him at all. Not during his first bout of violence and certainly not his last. Joker is neither a hero nor an anti-hero. He is whatever the story needs him to be as an agent of chaos. The fact that Phillips and Silver attempt to give reasoning to his motives makes cinematic sense, and they do this incredibly well, except that, in doing so, they position Arthur as something emblematic. In the film, Gotham is suffering both a heat wave and a growing sense that the rich don’t care for the poor. After a totally unrelated incident, Arthur finds himself the unintended symbol of a burgeoning revolution as the poor desire to fight back. Considering the very real sentiment growing across the United States right now, there’s a very real chance that audience members are going to see Arthur as their signal to take real, violent action. Before you shoot down this particular notion as absurd, take into account that there’s very little funny in Joker. It is a straight drama, a purported examination of one of DC Comics’s greatest villains. Despite knowing that Arthur is a villain, several audience members at the screening laughed during the violence. It’s one thing when a scene is staged to elicit such a response, but that’s the furthest thing from this specific scene’s intent. This is why there’s a fear that the same people who miss the satire within Fight Club will make the same mistake here, seeing Arthur’s cry of frustration, anger, and pain during the climax as a call to action. That they’ll miss Phillips’s intentional direction and narrative cues or Phoenix’s nuanced performance which work together to heavily suggest Joker’s calculated obfuscation of the truth. That they’ll miss the purposeful framing of the entirety of Joker and see only revolution. In the 1940 debut issue of Batman, Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson introduced the Joker, who has since plagued all of DC Comics for the last 79 years. A criminal mastermind with sadistic tendencies, he’s a character with multiple backstories, all considered equally true and fictitious. Phillips’s and Silver’s psychological thriller is one of the most purposefully uncomfortable cinematic experiences of 2019. Incredibly on-brand for the Joker, their film is absolutely devoid of humor, compassion, and, most importantly, truth. This is the greatest trick Phillips and Silver pull on their audience, which would be highly commendable if it didn’t result in making the already murky message of the film more opaque, all of which is made even more troubling considering how exacting the rest of the film is in execution. Despite finding Joker to be an incredibly unique cinematic experience, the result of craftspeople at the top of their game, the manner in which they successfully capture the nature of the Joker instills far more trepidation than awe.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019"," Durante una de las tantas insurrecciones en que participó, el filósofo e ideólogo del anarquismo, Mijail Bakunin (1814-1876), reía y gritaba mientras lo arrestaban las autoridades: “¡La fantasía aniquilará el poder y una risa lo enterrará!”. Más tarde, siguiendo su ejemplo, muchos anarquistas de fines del siglo XIX y principios del XX respondieron a los arrestos adoptando el mismo comportamiento. La anarquía ha sido (y es) el acto político más peligroso porque libera al sujeto de todas las formas de poder, organización y control. Es como el acto de reír. La risa no es tersa ni silenciosa como la sonrisa; es escandalosa, insolente, alborotadora, burlona, ​​rebelde, brutal, incluso incontrolable. Reírse es un acto peligroso porque cuando un individuo se ríe de otro, especialmente si es de alguien poderoso, éste sabrá tomar represalias contra el primero. La risa es, en efecto, un acto político, anula todo poder, toda cultura jerárquica: cualquiera puede dirigir su burla a cualquiera. Al igual que Bakunin, otro anarquista responde a la vida con una risa lívida y ruinosa. El Joker es quizá el anarquista más famoso, el más reconocible, el más buscado y el más peligroso en la cultura pop desde su creación en la década de 1940. Peligroso porque se ha interpretado tantas veces, de las más diversas formas en distintos productos audiovisuales -desde la histriónica interpretación de Jack Nicholson hasta las ridiculeces de Jared Leto, pasando por el caos instaurado de Heath Ledger-, y es fácil colapsar frente a tantos nombres y tantas interpretaciones dispares. Pero en Guasón (Joker, 2019), el cineasta estadounidense Todd Phillips (War Dogs, 2016) logra enriquecer a uno de los personajes más atractivos del universo de los cómics, un villano imponente, un hombre trastornado, ya escaneado por otros grandes autores. Le guiña un ojo al material original, lo menciona, lo distorsiona, crea alusiones, ensucia y glorifica el mito fundador del propio Batman y de la relación con su némesis, para que el personaje encuentre un nuevo significado, una relevancia acorde con los matices oscuros del mundo actual. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) -un hombre que vive en una especie de gueto de Gotham City con su madre, Penny (Frances Conroy), una mujer solitaria, enferma y debilitada- busca una oportunidad para abrirse paso en el ámbito de la comedia stand-up y, mientras espera que alguien note sus cualidades cómicas, intenta ganarse la vida haciendo trabajos ocasionales disfrazado de payaso -ya sea anunciando algún producto en la calle o bailando frente a niños enfermos en un hospital-. Arthur toma el transporte público todos los días; se ríe constante y repentinamente sin un motivo aparente, se derrumba sin previo aviso para sumergirse en una risa exagerada y gutural, lo que pone a la gente nerviosa, incómoda y violenta hacia él. Pero la gente no sabe que Arthur se ríe sin restricciones, de una manera casi asfixiada, debido a una enfermedad neurológica, una enfermedad mental que lo condena diariamente a una vida de soledad y marginación. Fuera de la ventana de su estrecho y destartalado departamento se encuentra una ciudad presa del caos: las divisiones sociales, la falta de empleo, los recortes de servicios y la asistencia médica generan más y más protestas, desembocando en manifestaciones belicosas y combativas. Un hombre, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), decide postularse como alcalde para restaurar la paz en una ciudad que ha perdido toda razón, sentido cívico y legal. Arthur, aunque testigo y consciente del caos que está por venir, quiere otro destino para sí mismo: todas las noches, después de acostar a su madre, sueña con estar frente a una audiencia de personas y embarcarse en una comedia triunfante e irresistible, llena de aplausos y risas, instaurados en su mente -y en la del espectador- a partir del extraordinario diseño y edición de sonido del equipo de Michael Dressel (Dunkirk, 2017).  El hombre anhela ser invitado por Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) a su programa de televisión, un late night show, que le encanta más que cualquier otra cosa. Pero la realidad tiene un gusto muy cruel y diferente. Arthur ha sido durante mucho tiempo víctima de abuso físico y mental. Es un hombre abandonado, denigrado, humillado en la vida y el trabajo, siempre buscando su propia identidad social y personal, dividida entre su sueño de convertirse en comediante y su deseo de poder vivir una vida normal, sin medicamentos, sin rarezas, aristas o jadeos de ansiedad. Un individuo maltrecho que encuentra momentos de alivio en esos breves pero podersosos engaños de su mente -ensoñación, imaginación y proyección- que lo ayudan a fugarse de la realidad. Joaquin Phoenix ha poseído el papel protagónico con su fuerza, con su rostro severo y melancólico, con su fragilidad, su palidez, con cada fibra de su talento. Phoenix no habrá escrito al personaje, pero lo reelaboró, lo perfeccionó y lo habitó elocuentemente. Dentro de este universo, el actor se confirma capaz de atravesar todos los matices posibles del alma y las emociones humanas, y hace que la degeneración psicológica del protagonista sea tangible de una manera soberbia, jugando con su cuerpo como en The Master (2012), con su fragilidad emocional como en Her (2013), con su desesperación de Inherent Vice (2014), con sus microexpresiones de Mary Magdalene (2018), con la violencia silenciosa de You Were Never Really Here (2017), y con comportamientos más complejos, incluidas las exacerbadas e inquietantes risas -como evidencias patológicas- que el personaje dispara durante todo el relato. Una interpretación nacida de un físico demacrado, conformado por una dieta que lo hizo perder cerca de 20 kilos, pero también por la identificación total con una personalidad indescifrable y en constante evolución, hecha de momentos inesperados de humanidad y del rapto repentino de violencia, de una búsqueda de la teatralidad y la risa en los escenarios del stand-up y de las escalofriantes secuencias en las que esa sonrisa de Joker ocupa la pantalla en primeros planos. Los zapatos de payaso, las persecuciones por las calles, los performances de slapstick en el hospital de niños enfermos y la alusión directa a Modern Times (1936) -la brillante declaración sobre la deshumanización y alienación del proletariado, y una rara incursión de la realidad en el imaginario ficticio de Gotham- no sólo son homenajes astutos a Charles Chaplin, sino que logran delinear la psique del personaje, combinando lo trágico y lo cómico, ofreciendo lecturas contrastantes en un solo momento narrativo, por ejemplo, un brutal y sangriento asesinato con unas tijeras se convierte en un momento de humor oscuro en el que un enano no alcanza la cerradura de una puerta. Es el lado perturbador de la bufonada. Lleno de ingenio, corrosivo, ácido, bestial, patético. Phoenix pasa por todos los matices del dolor y los escupe en un verso trágico, espeluznante y brillante, a medio camino entre la risa, el terror y las lágrimas. Su voz suspendida entre hilaridad y locura, entre el canto de un niño y el grito de dolor de un adulto angustiado, traza un personaje inescrutable y voluble, que nos incomoda no sólo por sus atrocidades y su creciente locura, sino también porque, en lo más profundo de nuestra alma, no podemos evitar tomar partido, al menos parcialmente, por él. Y no será una coincidencia, o quizás sea el destino, que Phoenix se encuentre y choque con Robert De Niro, el mismo actor que en el siglo pasado había dado vida a Travis Bickle, la mente dañada por las atrocidades de la guerra, la soledad y la alienación de la ciudad moderna en Taxi Driver (1976). Arthur deambula como un fantasma entre las calles para llegar a fin de mes con pequeños trabajos. Cada contacto humano se ve socavado por su enfermedad mental, mantenida minuciosamente a raya por varios medicamentos, lo que lo lleva a actuar involuntariamente de una manera inquietante. Incluso el hombre más puro e inofensivo, si se le lleva más allá de su límite personal de resistencia, puede convertirse en una bestia. Arthur no es ese hombre puro, ha sido previamente dañado y su caída es inevitable cuando tres hombres trajeados -aparentemente exitosos y respetables, pero cuya inmundicia se percibe en sus acciones- lo insultan y golpean en el vagón del subterráneo. Estamos ante la primera de una larga serie de radicales decisiones que conducirán al nacimiento de un villano, cuya transformación se confirma en la memorable secuencia del baile en las escaleras al compás de las notas musicales de “Smile” de Jimmy Durante. Así, Arthur cambia su máscara y su vida, de ser una tragedia infinita y perpetua, elige volverse hacia la comedia, una comedia (des)humana, en la que distorsiona la empatía y ridiculiza todo, con su risa poderosa, enigmática e histérica. Esa risa anárquica, incómoda y desequilibrada detrás de la cual yacen los escombros de una vida artificial, una farsa que tuvo que actuar durante muchos años, pretendiendo ser el niño feliz que su madre le dijo tenía que ser. El Joker de Phoenix es el producto natural de su contexto. La dirección y la edición son perfectas para colocar al espectador tanto en la aceptación progresiva de la locura por parte de Arthur como en el clima de tensión social que caracteriza a Gotham, una ciudad de principios de la década de 1980 enmarcado por la lente de Lawrence Sher (Godzilla: King of the Monsters, 2019), tan similar a la decadencia de Nueva York representada magistralmente por Martin Scorsese en algunas de sus obras maestras como Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy (1982) y After Hours (1985). Esa metrópoli masacrada por la suciedad, el desempleo y el crimen como lo fue Nueva York en aquella época -y lo son muchas ciudades en la actualidad-, cuyas autoridades tienen la perspectiva de mantener el bienestar de un grupo selecto y privilegiado, se convierte en un personaje fundamental en el relato, envolviendo la transformación de Arthur en su oscuridad. Sin efectos especiales, sin frenéticas secuencias de acción, basta la concentración en el personaje y el aparato social que le rodea, Phillips exhibe la manera en que una decisión, incluso incorrecta y extravagante, es suficiente para que un marginado alcance la popularidad más deseada de la manera más inesperada, encontrándose por primera vez no sólo comprendido, sino incluso idolatrado por otras mentes frágiles, dañadas o desesperadas. ¿Cuál puede ser la única reacción comprensible de aquellos que no tienen nada más que perder que la subversión total y la transformación de la violencia en un espectáculo? Aunque tambaleante por el discurso de Arthur -una escena crucial que resulta acartonada y cae en las obviedades de la palabra hablada, en lugar de darle peso al lenguaje visual-, el desenlace de Joker ejerce presión sobre la moralidad del espectador, involucrándolo personalmente en las elecciones cada vez más desastrosas del personaje. Una máquina de sangre despiadada y sombría, lista para incendiar Gotham, está ahí. Los estallidos inevitables de violencia nunca terminan en sí mismos, golpean directamente las entrañas del público, precisamente porque son la última etapa de un viaje hecho de pisoteos constantes y un ascenso repentino y brutal que logra encajar perfectamente en la mitología del Caballero de la Noche teniendo éxito en la tarea -nada fácil- de satisfacer tanto a los puristas de DC como a quienes menosprecian el universo de los superhéroes, incluso desafiando los moldes del cine de acción en los que en años recientes se han insertado los personajes de los cómics. Una película que logra modernizar de una manera completamente original un personaje tallado en la imaginación colectiva, mezclando el imperioso hito del Nuevo Hollywood con una crítica social actual, arrastrando al espectador hacia un vórtice de reveses emocionales. Incluso si Joker no se mezcla con los asuntos actuales (“No soy un símbolo político”, dice Arthur) es imposible no percibir una fuerte advertencia por parte del director y el coguionista Scott Silver (The Fighter, 2010): el mal y la violencia estallan en la marginación, en la falta de empatía y falta de apoyo para los más necesitados, y cuando la equidad social cae y el descontento se desproporciona, se necesita muy poco para precipitar el caos. Joker ofrece una reflexión sobre la persona y la sociedad, una historia de locura individual que, en tiempos de psicosis colectiva, convierten a un desquiciado hombre en un profeta del desorden. Arthur es la chispa que desencadena la revolución contra el régimen establecido de una sociedad que ha perdido su alma, que podría haberse salvado si no hubiera renunciado a la humanidad y la empatía por los demás.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," 
    In the opening shot of the express trip to Crazy Town that is filmmaker Todd Phillips’s Joker, failed clown Arthur Fleck (Phoenix, rail-thin and seemingly ravaged from within)
    sits in a social worker’s nondescript office. Laughing hysterically in uncomfortable close-up, his face is contorted with a conflicting mix of what looks to be grief, amusement and fury.
 
    Uncontrollable laughter, it’s explained in the following, unpleasant scene, is a condition from which Arthur suffers. As freaky and grating as that repeated experience is, it’s the least of his
    horrendous worries, for the Crazy Town of Phillips’s and co-screenwriter Scott Silver’s blistering origin story is beleaguered, DC Comics Gotham City, home to a seething multitude of malcontents
    for whom Arthur will become the twisted patron saint.
 
    Comedy, as Arthur himself later points out while losing it completely on TV, is a matter of individual taste. Hence his tragi-creepy clown persona as a weapon of destruction and a paltry shield.
    His Joker persona transports him to a profane illusion of glory. But the battle he’s fighting with years of abuse is scarred too deep to win.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Copyright 2019 Warner Brothers“Joker” tries hard to be dark, disturbing, and meaningful. It is dark, but it is sour, superficial and gross, the darkness not especially significant and therefore not especially meaningful. Its call-outs to past and current real-life events and other movies are not illuminating in any way; they just seem like training wheels borrowed to keep the movie from falling over. And we’re stuck once again with the tired trope of disability leading to criminality.  One of the highest compliments an actor can give another actor is “committed.”  And for sure Joaquin Phoenix is fully committed to the role of Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire and would-be stand-up comic who experiences repeated abuse and betrayal. After he is fired, learns a family secret, and then is cut off from counseling and medications, he spins out of control.  This is a non-canonical version of the origins of Joker, not connected to any of the previous depictions of the character in comics, movies, or television. In this version, Gotham resembles the New York City of the 70’s, when the city was teetering on financial insolvency. As it opens, they are in the midst of a garbage strike. Piles of trash are everywhere and large rats are running through the streets. Arthur is twirling an Everything Must Go sign in front of a store that is going out of business. Some boys grab the sign and, when he chases after them into an alley, they beat him with the sign until it shatters. Later, Arthur’s boss takes the cost of the sign out of his pay. Yeah, this movie is not subtle. The boys beat Arthur with the sign and the movie beats us with the metaphors. Arthur lives in a squalid apartment building with his frail mother (Frances Conroy), and he cares for her tenderly. bringing her food, giving her baths, and sharing their favorite television shows including a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (a badly miscast Robert De Niro). Arthur dreams of being on the show.  Arthur’s mother always told him his purpose in life was to make people happy. And he tries hard. He makes funny faces to get a toddler to laugh on a bus, but the child’s mother snaps at him. He gets fired for bringing a gun to the hospital where he is entertaining sick kids. He struggles with mental illness that undermines his grip on reality and a nervous condition that causes grotesque involuntary laughter when he is under stress. He has a little laminated card he hands out to explain this unsettling symptom to bystanders. His fragile support system unravels. He loses his job. The city cannot afford a social safety net, so even the haphazard counseling he has been getting is cut off and he no longer has access to the seven different psychotropic medications. He loses his job. He feels betrayed by his mother. And then, on the subway, he is confronted by three arrogant finance bros.  Crossing the line to breaking the law feels liberating to Arthur and to similarly resentful protesters throughout Gotham, leading to some expressions of concern that this portrayal itself could inspire copycats. It does draw from current conflicts in the news to attempt a gravitas that this film cannot sustain, leaving only sensation and a bitter sense of entitlement in those who consider themselves victims. It teeters on the brink of telling us that if only we were all nicer to (listening to, having sex with) people who weird us out, they wouldn’t be weird anymore. Director Todd Phillips’ bitter comments recently about how it’s no fun to be funny now because you have to be so sensitive all the time underscore the resentment on display here.  Similarly, it litters the film with pieces (I’m sure they would call it homage, but it’s just stealing) from two Martin Scorsese classics, “Taxi Driver” (the descent into madness triggered by the despair and corruption around him) and “The King of Comedy” (the descent into madness triggered by a distorted obsession with acceptance and celebrity). Significantly, in case we miss the unmissable point, the star of those two movies, Robert De Niro, plays someone very much like the talk show host his “King of Comedy” character was obsessed with. As we saw in “Comedian,” De Niro, for all his immeasurable gifts, is not able to convey the oily geniality or vocal rhythms of a stand-up comedian, even if this one were far better written. This movie wants to be daring and provocative but it is just depressing, less for the degrading, sordid storyline than for the failure of all of the time and effort and money that went into making it to produce anything worthwhile. Family discussion: Could anyone have helped Arthur?  What stories in the news or history or other movies inspired some of the plot developments? How does this Joker compare to other depictions of the character?",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," The Joker’s controversial origins story is an unflinching portrayal of a man with severe mental health issues. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas attended its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.
 The word “problematic” boomed through social media megaphones even by people who had yet to see Todd Philips’ Joker after its much-hyped premiere at the Venice Film Festival. But for all the fears of it promoting ‘incels’ (shorthand for the ‘involuntarily celibate’ online subculture linked to real-world misogynistic horrors like the 2014 Isla Vista killings) and the broader extreme right wing movement more generally, the North American premiere that I saw at the Toronto International Film Festival left me with a different conclusion.  Joker is a popcorn movie that makes it virtually impossible to not think politically, as it prompts us to identify the precise social and economic conditions where hate can flourish. What conclusions we draw from that activity, the film arguably leaves largely up to us. For both casual observers and those more fully indoctrinated into the mythology of the DC canon, Arthur Fleck’s status as arch nemesis of superhero darling, rich guy supreme and enigmatic dark god Batman is common knowledge. Joker is not a loyal adaptation by any stretch, but rather riffs on the raw iconography of the DC universe to create something very much its own. Starring Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, Fleck is a barely-employable clown-for-hire who struggles with severe mental health issues. The limited support he receives from community services are spread so thin it barely manages to keep him afloat. And when a series of complicated events unfurl in rapid succession, the thin grasp Fleck has on reality begins to disintegrate. As the film makes explicit, from garbage strikes to healthcare budget cuts, Gotham City is a town in crisis. Fleck’s situation therefore both is and isn’t unique. When his clown mask becomes the symbol for a burgeoning anti-establishment uprising, it collides with spectacular results with his until-then thwarted ambitions to become a successful stand-up comedian. Of all the characters from the DC universe, so enduring is the figure of the Joker that the instant go-to image we have in our minds when thinking of the character when adapted to the screen marks our age like the rings of a tree. Do you think of Cesar Romero from the gloriously camp 60s television series, Jack Nicholson from Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman, Heath Ledger from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight from 2008, or even Jared Leto from David Ayer’s 2016 movie Suicide Squad? But there are alternative routes into Joker. More than one critic, for example, has drawn parallels with the work of Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy in particular, the latter underscored by the casting of Robert De Niro as a late night TV talk show host). Yet Joker might be even more productively framed through Phoenix’s lead performance in Lynne Ramsay’s powerful 2017 film You Were Never Really Here. Like Joker, it is an unflinching psychological exploration of a man with severe mental health issues who has fallen through the cracks of the system, an adult man living with his aged mother whose turn to violence speaks as much of a broken society as it does provide the bare-bones plot set-up for a character study of a killer. While the references to The King of Comedy are almost playful, thinking about Joker through Ramsay and Phoenix’s collaboration on You Were Never Really Here – regarding how the two diverge as much as overlap – renders it almost haunting. There’s an unsettling feeling we’ve been here before, well beyond the terrain of the superhero blockbuster. While the two films play out differently (and, notably, are intended for different audiences), the terms of engagement are significantly alike. It is in this sense that one can almost speculate if the controversy surrounding Joker would be as strong and as vocal if it was disconnected from the DC branding, and wasn’t intended to appeal to a mass audience. If Fleck didn’t turn to the iconic green hair and the purple suit would we be so nervous? That there is genuine concern about the film provoking violence is not unreasonable in this sense – it is close to impossible to pursue this line of questioning and not recall the horrendous 2012 Aurora cinema shooting during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, for example. Ultimately, the bigger questions Joker poses hinge on our how we understand Fleck’s journey: is it a celebration of vigilante justice, or a brutal exposé and condemnation of a world that leaves damaged, exploited people with the belief they have no alternatives beyond violence? Regardless of our political interpretation of the film, Joker seems consciously designed to provoke. It demands we think about power, difference and violence in ways we do not necessarily expect a heavily branded mainstream blockbuster to do so. This is its challenge, and for better or for worse, even before its widespread release, it has accomplished precisely what it set out to do.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," For months, Joker has been an object of heated speculation and debate. Its early marketing suggested the clown prince from Batman comics had been reborn as a rampaging incel. Its world premiere at the prestigious Venice Film Festival won wild praise along with the Golden Lion for Best Film. The response from the Toronto International Film Festival was less glowing. Critics, who panned the film, have received death threats from Joker fans. Then, the press cycle soured as Joker’s star Joaquin Phoenix stormed out of an interview over a pretty expected question, and director Todd Phillips doled out uncharming anecdotes, flawed fingerpointing, and cringe-inducing philosophizing on how wokeness has killed comedy. Now, there are reports of police officers going undercover to the movie’s opening weekend screenings over fear of mass shooters. All of this has become context for Joker, informing how we think of it before we see a single frame. In a sick way, all this controversy might be a boon for Joker, because the movie itself is painfully mediocre and politically dunderheaded.  Joker is written by Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy) and Scott Silver (8 Mile), though it steals so much from The King of Comedy that Martin Scorsese and Paul D. Zimmerman should at least get a “story by” credit. Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a creep who dreams of being a famous stand-up comedian, slips into fantasy sequences of that imagined success, and looks to his favorite late-night talk show for inspiration. Robert De Niro, who headlined The King of Comedy, takes on the Jerry Lewis role here, playing swaggering talk show host Murray Franklin. Meanwhile, Deadpool 2 standout Zazie Beetz plays the friendly Black woman who exists solely for the anti-hero to romantically fixate on, as Dianne Abbott did in the 1982 film. To give his film borrowed grit, Phillips makes his Gotham look like the crusty streets of Scorsese’s 1970s New York City, where Crown Victoria cabs crawl past mountains of trash and subway cars are plastered in crude graffiti.  Onto all this, Phillips also mashes in elements of Gotham’s real-life inspiration, folding in the garbage strike of 1968 and the 1981 horrors of subway vigilante Bernie Goetz. But this time, instead of a fed-up white man shooting teenagers, a fed-up white Joker shoots three menacing Wall Street bros, who work for wealthy mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). This sparks an “anti-rich” rebellion in the streets of Gotham that mimics Occupy Wall Street and the Resistance. Protesters take to the streets in clown masks with signs that read “Kill the Rich,” “Wayne = Fascism,” and “Resist.” Phillips will soon conflate protesters with rioters and violent vigilantes who seem a smirking nod at Antifa hysteria. All the while, Joker himself will insist he has no politics and believes in nothing while he dances around a Gotham descending into mayhem.  It’s not until the third act that the red-suited, green-haired Joker from the posters and trailers emerges and actually gives the film some spark. Before that, it’s a miserable slog through an emaciated Phoenix twisting his body and face in unsettling contortions as he awkwardly chortles and speaks in a tremulous whisper of a voice. There’s an inarguable intensity to his performance as he hurls his body into jaunty dances, stoops his shoulders into meek retreats, and sprawls into violence inflicted and endured. Yet for all of Phoenix’s theatrics and all the scenes of his torment, Joker is hollow in its exploration of its central figure.  Joker cannot be accused of glorifying its mass shooter, but it does make plenty of excuses for him. Behold Arthur’s bruises from the beating taken by a gang of children. Behold his loneliness and social awkwardness so intense he must stalk the friendly single mother from down the hall. Behold his uncaring social service worker who medicates but does not mend his mental illness! Behold how he has been abused by his own mother and a society that treats him “like trash!” All this gives narrative reason to Arthur’s breaking point, where he turns to a pistol for salvation and feels empowered by violence, but it blames others for all of Arthur’s problems, excusing his own damning sense of entitlement.  Arthur believes he is destined for comedy stardom, despite being repeatedly told he’s not funny. He believes he is owed love from his crush, praise from his role model, and respect from a powerful stranger. He believes his every desire deserves validation. And when he doesn’t get it, he responds with violence. Joker seems shockingly unaware of—or at least uninterested in—its anti-hero’s toxic masculinity. It even aims to shield him by keeping two or three of his most shocking murders offscreen. Instead, Phillips fixes his criticism on society. His focus is so broad, though, that it feels like a wild, juvenile swing.  Societal decay is visually presented through mountains of trash and “super rats,” which are the size of lapdogs. Then, Phillips employs the language of rebellion with little understanding of its meaning. Protesters use the talking points of liberals, while they hold up a vicious folk hero who expounds conservative catchphrases, complaining about a lack of civility, and a culture where morals and even comedy is up for ongoing debate. In a particularly cringe-worthy monologue, Joker espouses thoughts on comedy that seem plucked from Phillips’ latest interviews. So when the movie tries to suggest this was a “good guy” driven mad by society, it feels personal, like the maker of movies like The Hangover and Old School is furious that his shtick isn’t working anymore, so he’s turned to violence to get the attention that he’s convinced he deserves.  If I had watched Joker in a vacuum, spared all the preamble and controversy and terrible soundbites from its makers, I suspect I’d have found it a mediocre movie striving to be more with eye-roll-worthy edginess alongside requisite Batman origin iconography. With all the hullabaloo around the film, this is still how I feel more or less, but with the added aggravation that this mediocre movie— that mistakes shock value with something to say— will be debated for months to come when there are much more daring, insightful, and exciting films we could be talking about.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) asks this of his social worker early in ""Joker,"" a gritty, disturbing character study doubling as a standalone origin story for one of pop culture's most enduring villains. Is he asking about the fictional, decaying Gotham City of the early '80s or our real world of 2019? Gotham is a city teetering on the edge of disaster. The graffiti and garbage-strewn streets are home to an increasingly frustrated and volatile underclass that's beginning to focus its rage on the city's wealthy elite, personified by billionaire — and newly announced mayoral candidate — Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). While the city's vital social programs are cut due to lack of funding, the people who need them most see Wayne and others like him attending swanky black tie affairs, oblivious to — or outright ignoring — their plight. Even those stuck on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder have little time for Arthur. In a city in which the space between the haves and have-nots isn't a gap but a gulf, he has less than most. Living in a dilapidated apartment building with — and caring for — his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), his grip on his own mind is tenuous at best. His lack of control extends to his laughter, which comes out of him — violently — in times of distress and only grows worse the more he tries to contain it. Believing wholeheartedly in his mother's constant assertion that his purpose is ""to bring laughter and joy to the world,"" Arthur works as a clown by day — twirling signs for businesses, entertaining at the children's hospital. By night, he's an aspiring stand-up comic, but with little understanding of what's funny, the joke is on him more often than not. His hero is late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur — or rather, the clown face he's wearing at the time — becomes something of a hero, a symbol to the downtrodden people of Gotham after he murders three Wayne Industries executives on a subway train. But he's not making a political statement; he's not even coming to the aid of the woman the trio of overgrown frat boys is harassing. No, it's the culmination of Arthur's life of sadness, frustration, isolation and mental illness, an extreme manifestation of society failing him — and so many others — repeatedly. With his emaciated form and wildly expressive face, Phoenix writhes and dances his way through the film in a spellbinding performance. His wholly original take on the character has none of Jack Nicholson's camp, lacks any of the malice and cunning Heath Ledger brought to the role and hasn't a shred of whatever Jared Leto was trying to do. Arthur's story is a tragedy of operatic proportions and more frightening — more real — because of it. The movie stops short of taking us inside his head — an impossible task considering his extreme mental illness. It seeks an understanding of his actions without asking us to empathize with him. Despite the status he eventually gains, the movie never views Arthur as a hero or even an anti-hero; he's a sick man who desperately needs help that society refuses to give. Todd Phillips — of ""Old School"" and ""The Hangover"" (all three of them) fame — directs with confidence, sometimes simply following Phoenix with the camera. At other times, it's as if he's conducting a symphony, melding Phoenix's riveting turn with Hildur Guonadottir's ominous yet strangely beautiful musical score and Lawrence Sher's evocative cinematography. This is powerhouse filmmaking all around — daring, even, as a comic book movie without action and digital effects. More traditional movies of the genre provide an easy out for the audience: Heroes defeat the villains, restoring order to the world (or universe). But there's no Caped Crusader to swoop in and save the day here. By denying that catharsis, ""Joker"" stays with the viewer, forcing you to consider it more carefully.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Who makes the monster, and where do they come from? We’ve been asking those questions for far too long and still have yet to find a satisfactory answer. And like an itch we can’t help but scratch, more only fails to bring relief. Our current boogieman is the gunman — masked or otherwise — who haunts our schools, churches, shopping malls, concert venues, even movie theaters. Often they are white and male. Most act alone. All of them kill, some more than others, and for different stated reasons. But probably the same underlying one. Some were abused and lived long enough to hurt others; others lived perfectly healthy lives and wouldn’t hurt a fly. Until, that is, they gunned down 13 innocent lives. They follow familiar patterns: Extensive journaling but an inability to communicate with others. They have minds that won’t sit still, spilling out thoughts like ticker tape with no release of emotion. They fixate on someone or something. Tragically, it is more often than not on a firearm. We see it on the news, and we see it in the movies. Sometimes its real life that is soft, while other times, it’s the movies that try to put a shine on it. But peel back the surface, and you will find the same rot. “Life’s a tragedy when seen in close-up,” Charlie Chaplin once said, “But a comedy in long-shot.” Send in the Joker, the latest take on the iconic Batman supervillain from writer/director Todd Phillips, co-writer Scott Silver, cinematographer Lawrence Sher, editor Jeff Groth, and Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role. Rare is the movie where talents and subject harmonize so well. Joker does exist in the DC/Batman universe. Sometimes it feels like it’s next-door; other times, it feels like it’s on the front porch. If Joker has neighbors, then Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives between Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin — two more solitary souls, both portrayed by Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy respectively. De Niro is also in Joker, as Murray Franklin, a popular talk show host with terrible monologues. Fleck also dreams of being a standup, but he has no knack, no work ethic, and no sense of humor. His day job as a rent-a-clown isn’t helping, despite feeling that he’s been put on this earth to make others smile. His mother calls him “Happy,” and as Fleck tells someone who isn’t listening, “It’s hard being happy all the time.” Fleck’s mother, Peggy (Frances Conroy), has her own set of problems, and they’re not helping Fleck either. And though Fleck agrees with Norman Bates that a boy’s best friend is his mother, Phillips and Silver lay the blame of Fleck’s transformation from sad sack to murderous psychopath at the feet of an absent father and an uncaring society. This is 1983 Gotham suffering under a trash strike and an infestation of rats. Uncaring, unkind, self-center, myopic people made the city the way it is, and they are making sure it stays that way. Somewhere lives Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and the fabulously wealthy. But Wayne is vastly outnumbered. The rich may have the power, but the poor have the numbers. In The Dark Knight, the Joker (Heath Ledger) was an agent of chaos, a true devil’s advocate, who introduced mayhem wherever order ruled. Phoenix’s Joker is almost a symptom — the effect of a cause. The result is a profoundly upsetting movie that is powerfully constructed. There’s a precision to the camerawork, but the images are gritty and dank. It’s as if the film stock is rotting away before our eyes. Phillips stays close to Phoenix, whose performance is one of gross physicality and reminiscent of Lon Chaney and the actor who inspired the comic book creation, Conrad Veidt. Phoenix is committed, to say the least. Joker isn’t free from stumbling blocks: Phillips leans into his reference points heavily, Phoenix dances to one-too-many pop songs, and the movie tackles too much. Is Joker on the side of Fleck? Or is it trying to justify Fleck’s frustration? It is worth noting that neither Taxi Driver nor The King of Comedy lionized or sympathized with Bickle or Pupkin. They empathized with them. And it made their pain feel worse, their actions all the more tragic. Still, Joker remains a true oddity: A miserable portrait of a mentally ill man smuggled into mainstream cinema under the guise of a comic book movie. You have an idea where this is all heading, but you’re never quite sure how they’re going to get there. You just know it will hurt.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Let’s get this right out of the way at the start – “Joker” is a brilliantly executed film with a central performance that will without a doubt garner Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar nomination. That said, this is as far a cry from the Joker’s we’ve ever seen before as Heath Ledger was from Cesar Romero. It’s not an easy film to watch – if you think about the experience of watching “Shindler’s List” – I don’t know of many people who would go into watching List thinking,  “oh, this will be a hoot.” Instead it’s about it being a hard and disturbing look into the darkest parts of society and their impact on individuals who are already on the edge – and when happens when and individual is pushed hard off of that ledge into the abyss. Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, an individual suffering from neurological damage, systemic abuse, and his own plethora of demons. You get the sense from the outset that he is doing his best to fit in and play the part of “normal,” while not really understanding what it means. When a child on a bus smiles at him, and Arthur plays back by making faces so that the child laughs the mother chides him for bothering her son. In the stress reaction to her berating him he begins to laugh – and we’re unclear if this is at her or the situation but even as he tries to control his laughter it still forces itself out as a choking gasp. He hands her a card reading, “Forgive my laughter. I have a condition,” and it goes on to say how he laughs, but it does not correlate to his actual feelings or emotions. The movie doesn’t try to excuse his actions, but attempts to give reasons for them. He’s not someone who has a supportive life, but turns dark anyway. He’s someone who wants to make people happy and do well, but he’s mocked at every turn (including by a Johnny Carson-style character Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro) and beaten by city youths and businessmen alike. The Gotham in “Joker” is pre-Batman, with the parallels of the dark 70’s-era New York being rampant. The city is in the midst of all but outright upper-class vs lower-class warfare, with Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne running for mayor and all but fanning the flames of the underlying tension of the city. There is little in the film to make it feel like a comic-book origin story. Other than the Wayne name being invoked, and it being set in Gotham, this could as readily be any other dark-drama of a descent into madness and pushed against the wall. The audience is intended while not to support his actions, but to come to understand how he got here, and where he’ll go. Evil of the kind that exists in Arthur needs to exist to an extent to begin with, it’s not just formed out of nothing. However as each of the chains binding the Pandora’s box represent his goodness and as each one is broken from the outside, the lid gets forced out a little more. This is not a film for younger children or for anyone who will be deeply bothered by seeing someone trying to make people happy being beat on a whim. Where someone getting their dream moment, even if failing, then being mocked on national television for a laugh. It’s not easy to watch, but it’s an amazing ride if you’re ready to get on it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Throughout the years, Batman has had numerous nemeses including Penguin, Catwoman, Two-Face, and The Riddler to name a few.  Perhaps one of his most well-known antagonists though is probably Joker.  The menacing figure in clown makeup and a purple suit has always come across as highly unstable.  However, we never truly knew what made Joker so evil and crazy. While it had always been said he fell into a vat of chemicals that disfigured him and made him go mad, we never knew anything about his early life...until now.  Warner Bros. offers audiences a possible look inside Joker's origin story with their latest feature film, Joker. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix; Walk the Line) lives with his ailing mother, Penny (Frances Conroy; Six Feet Under), and works as a clown.  He also has a disorder that makes him laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times due to previous brain trauma from having been abused as a child.  Arthur wants to be a standup comedian and tries to write jokes.  He has an active imagination and daydreams about his pretty neighbor, Sophie (Zazie Beetz; Deadpool 2), being his girlfriend, and about being on the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro; Raging Bull) Show. Phoenix is masterful as the mentally disturbed Arthur/Joker.  He plays on one's sympathy while alternately coming across as creepy.  Cullen makes Wayne less likable than past portrayals and the whole film has an undercurrent of a political agenda of ""us"" versus ""them"". Conroy is the stereotypical sweet, old woman who seems innocent but who has a disturbing past. It is easy to see why theaters and authorities are concerned that the film will incite violence.  The film has an uneasiness to it both from Arthur's story and from watching the public becoming fed up enough to riot in the streets.  Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) offers some spectacular shots that help set the overall tone and feel of the film, such as the rain falling as Arthur enters Arkham State or how we watch Arthur's disjointed ballet movements in a dirty, public restroom after the subway shooting. He also utilizes darker lighting to give the whole movie a sense of heaviness.  The Joker has always been portrayed as a menacing, demonic-like psychopath in the past so it was difficult for me to reconcile this version of a vulnerable, mentally ill, disturbed man with the pure evil villain I am used to.  I never thought I would pity the Joker but Arthur is someone who evokes sympathy from the audience while at the same time making us angry at his lack of empathy.  The film overall is a little difficult and uncomfortable to watch and the whole subplot of the neighbor was completely unnecessary but it is an interesting take on one of Batman's best-known arch enemies and Phoenix delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ origin story of Batman’s most persistent nemesis is expertly crafted and features a stunning lead performance, but it’s also a morally problematic exercise in cinematic nihilism.  You won’t be easily able to forget Joaquin Phoenix’s mesmerizing turn as “Joker,” every bit as impressive as Heath Ledger’s, which won that actor a posthumous Oscar—Phoenix could well be honored with a nomination, even if the award eludes him.  However, you will likely find the film itself just as hard to forget, though you might want to despite its technical sophistication. The narrative fashioned by Phillips and Scott Silver is actually quite simple.  In a dystopian Gotham that looks alarmingly like early 1980s New York City beset by a damaged economy that resembles the U.S.A’s in 2008, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a mentally challenged young man with a propensity to break out in uncontrollable fits of laughter; he works for a service that furnishes clowns for parties and other events.  Otherwise he’s devoted to caring for his ill mother Penny (Frances Conroy), who once worked for the family of the city’s top citizen Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and remains devoted to the man. But despite an apparent relationship he develops with an attractive single mom (Zazie Beetz) down the hall, Arthur’s problems only escalate as he runs into trouble at work.  When a gang of young toughs harass him as, in his clown getup, he advertises a store’s going-out-of-business sale on the sidewalk, stealing his sign and beating him with it, he’s harangued by his boss, who threatens to take the cost of the sign out of his pay.  Gruff co-worker Randall (Glenn Fleshler) gives him a gun so he can defend himself in the future.  When he accidentally drops it on the floor during a performance at a children’s hospital ward, it gets him fired; but it also comes in handy when he’s accosted by three young Wall Street types on the otherwise deserted subway and he uses it to kill them all, “Death Wish” style.  It’s his first turn to violence, but hardly the last. Arthur, however, is moved by personal rather than political motives.  While he will revel in the chaos and anarchy his act has unleashed—appreciatively watching as the protestors waylay the two cops (Bill Camp and Sean Whigham) who are trying to question him about the subway killings—he is more interested in dealing with those who have, in his view, wronged him.  They include his own mother, whose treatment of him as a child he eventually uncovers, and some of his old co-workers.  And he also has a matter to settle with Wayne, whose son Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson) he briefly encounters, along with the boy’s protective butler (Douglas Hodge). Phoenix is rarely off-screen for the entire running-time of “Joker,” looking emaciated and grotesque, and it’s hard to tear your eyes from him, even when the character is engaged in the most gruesome business.  It’s a magnetic turn, even though you might wish the polarity were reversed—showy and insistent to be sure, but undeniably creepily effective.  The unsettling thing is that it’s good enough to elicit more than a little sympathy for the character—who is, after all, bullied and brutalized into becoming the champion of chaos that the Joker ultimately is.  Encouraging us to cheer him on is perilously close to approving of, if not advocating, what he does.  It makes for a troubling sensation. On the technical level, “Joker” is outstanding in every way.  Using a blend of locations and sets, Mark Friedberg’s production design creates an extravagant atmosphere of urban life gone to seed and Lawrence Sher’s cinematography accentuates the effect, while Mark Bridges’ costume design—especially in Joker’s last-act outfit—and the work of the makeup artists are similarly superb.  Jeff Groth’s editing gives Phoenix ample opportunity to make his mark in scenes, for instance, of ghoulishly sinewy dance while bringing in the film at a relatively trim two hours, and Hildur Gudnadóttir’s score avoids conventional bombast; the pop music intrusions are spot on, too.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," “I hope my death will make more cents than my life,” reads one of the plaintive misspelled scrawlings in the diary of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), the mentally ill clown on his way to becoming Batman’s green-haired nemesis, in Todd Phillips’ superhero-adjacent psychological thriller Joker. I won’t reveal whether Arthur survives the movie—though Joker is that perennial comic-book standby, an origin story, the filmmakers have emphasized since the beginning that the movie is a “standalone.” But this grindingly bleak account of his pre-supervillain life looks set to make plenty of cents on opening weekend. Joker’s premiere at the Venice Film Festival at the end of August was greeted (mostly) with critical rapture, and the film was awarded the top prize, the Golden Lion. Only a few days later, after the movie’s North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, the first wave of backlash began to crest. Some critics thought Phillips’ portrait of the artist as a young murderer could be seen as an apologia for the violent ideology of the incel movement, and some family members of victims of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which took place at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, expressed similar concerns. Meanwhile, plenty of other reviewers suggested that, incitement to mass revolt aside, the movie was bombastic, unoriginal, and just plain bad. In general, I try to steer clear of advance buzz to avoid exactly this kind of pre-release staking out of sides. But especially after Phillips—a director most associated with hit male-bonding comedies, from Old School and Road Trip to the Hangover series—went viral with an interview bemoaning the impossibility of making funny movies in these regrettably “woke” times, it was hard not to walk into Joker knowing something about it. I’d say I approached the film with equal parts squeamishness about the impending gore and curiosity about how Joaquin Phoenix, whom I’ve gradually come to regard as one of the best American actors working, would approach the role of an evil comic-book clown. The grimy and relentlessly downbeat fable that finally unfolded on screen seemed too slight, aesthetically and morally, to bear the weight of all those months of debate. Joker is a bad movie, yes: It’s predictable, clichéd, deeply derivative of other, better movies, and overwritten to the point of self-parody. (If a feature-length sendup of Joker was made, it’s hard to imagine in what details it would differ from Joker itself.) The experience of sitting through it is highly unpleasant, but that unpleasantness has less to do with graphic violence—there are only one or two scenes that go hard, gore-wise—than with claustrophobia and boredom. Scene after scene makes the same point: that Phoenix’s Arthur, a clown and aspiring stand-up comedian living in semi-poverty with his elderly mother (Frances Conroy), is a really freaky dude. He’s undernourished to the point of emaciation; Phoenix, who not long ago bulked up for his role as the hitman in You Were Never Really Here, has lost so much weight since then that he looks alarmingly gaunt. As a laminated card Arthur carries around with him explains, he has a condition that causes him to periodically break into painful-sounding bursts of compulsive laughter, often with the choking sound of someone sobbing. Gradually, as he discovers that killing is the only thing that gives him a sense of purpose, meaning, and beauty—a state of mind Phoenix conveys by following or preceding each murder with a sinuous, balletic dance—the pity that the first third of the movie strained so hard to evoke from the viewer turns to disgust. The rest of the movie wallows in that disgust, seeming to relish the bathos of its own protagonist’s abjection and isolation. When we first meet him, Arthur Fleck is working at Ha-Ha’s, a kind of rent-a-clown agency in the gritty, run-down heart of Gotham City. That storied town looks a lot like New York in the late 1970s or early 1980s, right down to the garbage piled high in the streets and a porn theater–filled entertainment district that recalls the old Times Square. It’s there that Arthur endures a series of humiliations at the hands of what he will later rail against, vaguely, as “society.” A band of teenage thugs beat him up as he’s plying his trade on the street; his unfeeling boss (Josh Pais) then forces Arthur to pay out of his own pocket for the sign the marauding teens stole. Passengers on a city bus recoil from him when he’s seized by one of his pathological fits of mirthless laughter. Though he fantasizes about making a romantic connection with a young single mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives on his floor, Arthur has no real social contacts apart from his frail and increasingly demented mother. And his loneliness increases after city budget cuts eliminate his weekly meeting with a counselor and cut off his access to psychiatric meds. He’s an insane clown without a posse. In what might be generously called an homage to Martin Scorsese (who was, at one point, one of the film’s producers), Arthur is also unhealthily obsessed with a nighttime talk-show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). In Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, De Niro was the would-be stand-up fixated on a TV personality played by Jerry Lewis. As in that film, when the paths of the famous and the soon-to-be-infamous finally cross, very bad things ensue. Since his Oscar nomination for playing Johnny Cash in Walk the Line, Phoenix has been drawn to roles that touch on the extremes of inner experience.* This can lead to thrillingly personal work with offbeat directors, as when he played a severely depressed hit man in Lynne Ramsay’s dreamlike thriller You Were Never Really Here. It can also take him down rabbit holes of grotesquerie and self-abasement, as in I’m Still Here, the faux-documentary he made with Casey Affleck documenting his own fictional mental breakdown. Here, the degree of investment he brings to the role is almost comically in excess of the character’s complexity as written. Like De Niro, he’s a technical powerhouse of an actor playing a part he could do blindfolded. Todd Phillips should count himself lucky to have a lead actor capable of intermittently elevating material that amounts, in effect, to a feature-length exercise in voyeuristic self-pity. Poor little clownsie-wownsie: The world gave him no choice but to turn evil. When Joker opens this weekend, police departments in New York and Los Angeles will be stationing cops at randomly chosen theaters, presumably to forestall anything like what happened in that midnight screening of another Batman movie back in 2012. It isn’t the fault of the film industry that we’re in a place where we need, or think we need, on-site armed protection from the state in order to see a comic-book movie. But the nexus where fictional violence, potential real-world violence, and armed police surveillance come together is not a place anyone feels like settling in with a medium buttered popcorn of a Sunday afternoon. The chances of coming to harm in a theater showing Joker are likely no greater than the odds of encountering random gun violence in any public space in America—which is to say, still chillingly higher than anywhere else in the world. But the vanishingly slim possibility of an act of copycat violence is only one of many reasons to find something else to do. Don’t skip Joker because you’re offended by its potentially inflammatory message, or because you’re afraid of some nut showing up in the multiplex with a clown mask and a gun. Skip it because there are so many better movies out there to see. Correction, Oct. 3, 2019: An earlier version of this article misstated that Joaquin Phoenix won an Oscar for Walk the Line. He was nominated for the performance but has never won an Oscar.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Joker probably isn’t going to inspire any mass shooters, but Todd Phillips’ latest movie has managed to create a protagonist that we react to in the same way. What made the Joker this way? Was it mental illness? Was it bullying? Was it lack of proper mental health funding? Was it easy access to dangerous firearms? And so the question surrounding the movie has become, oddly, not whether this is a compelling piece of art but: How can we protect our nation’s children from homicidal clowns? Joker is a beautifully shot, wonderfully compelling movie that ends in horrific manner. That it’s initially so easy to love is exactly what makes it so capable of disturbing and nauseating us in the end; we couldn’t be queasy if we weren’t invested. Is that… bad? In a way, it merely rubs our noses in something movies like this generally soft pedal. That the protagonist we spent so much of the story sympathizing with (and getting a vicarious thrill out of) is… actually a pretty messed up guy! Who knew! In a way, Joker is a lot like that old Saturday Night Live sketch where Steve Buscemi throws a mad hatter party, and while all the other “mad hatters” are having a deliciously silly time talking about wearing socks on their feet, Buscemi’s character pipes up about how he likes to put cigar butts out on his penis and makes racecars out of his own poop. Or, if you haven’t seen that one, the one about the convention of “evil” inventors, who have invented shrink rays and freezing guns, until The Rock shows up and horrifies them with his invention of a robot that molests children. “What? I thought we were talking about evil inventions here,” The Rock’s character says. “Mussolini used to force-feed people castor oil until they literally died of diarrhea. I mean that’s gotta be where the goalposts are, am I crazy?” Joker is, essentially, Robochomo. It operates on a level of realness people neither wanted nor were expecting. “What, I thought you said this guy was supposed to be violent and disturbed!” you can imagine Phillips pleading. And this seems to be more a problem of imposed expectations than a problem with the movie itself. Joker‘s biggest problem isn’t that it glorifies violence or offers a blueprint to potential incel terrorists (I don’t think it does, at least not compared to a million other films, I mean holy shit did you see Eli Roth’s Death Wish remake?). Its biggest problem is that it was made in an era where the market required that it tie in to a comic book franchise. That alone saddles it with the baggage of countless separate stories and creates an expectation that this is going to be the kind of party where we wear socks on our hands, not the kind where we put cigars out on our penises. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips clearly wanted to make Taxi Driver (*deep breath* Fight Club, Falling Down, King Of Comedy, Network, Death Wish, First Blood…) while the studio wanted something at least tangentially connected to Batman. They compromised. The recent, much-cited Vanity Fair piece quotes Todd Phillips telling Joaquin Phoenix to think of the film as a heist movie. “We’re gonna take $55 million from Warner Bros. and do whatever the hell we want,” Phillips reportedly told Phoenix. What they wanted, along with Phillips’ co-writer, Scott Silver, clearly, was to make a gritty, ’70s/early ’80s-style movie about a mistreated loner who eventually gets fed up and can’t take it anymore. That general arc is nothing new, of course, and conscious homages to Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Dog Day Afternoon, etc., abound in Joker. Set in Gotham, which is plainly New York during one of its many famous garbage strikes, Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a loner with a disorder that makes him laugh at inopportune times (he carries a laminated card to explain) who lives with his weird mom (Frances Conroy from Six Feet Under), and works as a clown for a company that hires out clowns. Our endless collective fascination with this old, dangerous, pre-Giuliani New York seems to stem at least in part from our collective nostalgia for a world where blue collar jobs could support middle-class lifestyles. Joker is set at a time when that world was crumbling, but even so, the idea of a clown basically showing up to a clown union office every morning, with clown locker rooms and ball-busting clown coworkers (notably HBO’s all-star bit player Glenn Fleshler as Arthur’s predatory frenemy, Randall, and Leigh Gill as Randall’s little person punching bag) is downright enchanting. Don’t even think of picking up that squirting flower if you don’t have your Clown Guild card or we will shut! This! Entire birthday party! Down! Most of the movie is like that. Todd Phillips’ transition into Junior Scorsese, begun in 2016’s War Dogs, achieves full flower here, helped along by a hollow-eyed, 50-pounds lighter Joaquin Phoenix, our most mesmerizing actor and the platonic ideal of asymmetrical ugly beauty even before the weight loss (incidentally, how the hell does a guy who’s already a chain-smoking vegan just lose 50 pounds at will?). Not to mention an equally perfect supporting cast: Zazie Beetz, Shea Wigham, Bill Camp, and Robert De Niro, playing the late-night talk show host Fleck is obsessed with. It’s like Phillips raided HBO’s prestige A-Team and regurgitated The Deuce meets One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Fleck dabbles in stand up, gets robbed by neighborhood kids, and abandoned by his social worker (budget cuts) until he finally goes off his meds and then off the reservation. All of it compelling, Joker really only stumbles when it realizes, too late, that it has to be about Batman. This character who should just be a guy, is awkwardly forced, thanks to commercial realities, into becoming an icon. That‘s the only thing in it that makes it feel propagandistic — the idea that the main character will one day carry on, that he’ll become a symbol. It forces him to become at once Howard Beale from Network and the Las Vegas shooter. Which is an awkward mix. We don’t like the idea that people who murder innocent human beings could inspire movements, and rightly so. And that makes Joker‘s ending kind of a shock and a bummer. But if you take a step back, it’s also kind of great. It’s like watching Todd Phillip show up to the convention of “gritty” comic book directors and shock all of them into stunned silence. “What? Pretty twisted, right?”",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," Director Todd Phillips’ “Joker” nailed the “conversation” part months ago. His sober spin on Batman’s arch nemesis, we were told, left the comic book blueprint in the circular file. The movie itself lives up to that hype, that promise, in ways we couldn’t rightfully expect. Star Joaquin Phoenix gives us a Joker that makes the Ledger, Leto and Nicholson versions obsolete. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) dutifully slathers on grease paint as part of his daily grind. He’s a party clown for hire with dreams of stand-up glory. It’s darkly fitting that he suffers from a Tourette’s-like tic which shackles him with bursts of laughter for no reason at all. That’s cackle is hardly Arthur’s only burden. He lives with his aging Ma (Frances Conroy) in a dingy apartment, further isolated from a world which has no need for him. He longs to chat with a comely neighbor (Zazie Beetz) but seems ill-fitted for the task. And he’s living in an ’80s version of Gotham that evokes a rotten Big Apple before the Giuliani era saved its soul. Arthur’s only solace is watching his favorite late night show starring show biz legend Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Even that is robbed from him, leading to a confrontation as hypnotic as any movie scene this year. Phoenix famously shed 50-odd pounds to make Arthur look haunted and grim, but that’s just the shell of a career-defining turn. His Joker generates empathy, and sadness, before giving way to revulsion. We know where the character must go, and we mourn the path that leads him there. The actor doesn’t overplay his hand, fall back on DC Comics tropes or otherwise mar a pitch-perfect performance. It’s stunning, and in its own weird way fits into Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy. “Joker” packs more than a few liberal messages between Phoenix’s bravura work, from its class warfare rants to suggesting the government do more to protect the mentally ill. The film never comes close to hectoring, though, keeping the dramatic elements foremost in mind. The narrative offers so much to consider beyond the inevitable awards season buzz. Are we all complicit for the deeply damaged souls we ignore on the streets every day? How much would it hurt to extend some grace beyond our friends and family circles? Arthur’s connection to De Niro’s character suggests the fallout from predatory art. The future Joker may be damaged beyond repair, but he knows when he’s being set up for failure. Think how the Fox TV executives grin during those early, awful “American Idol” auditions.’ Phoenix’s Joker is onto that scam, and it makes the third act as powerful as any superhero feature. And that’s all without CGI, car chases or perfectly choreographed action sequences. Yes, “Joker” brings the violence we expect from an R-rated genre film. The moments are brief but unrelenting, constructed atop character and narrative demands. One particular sequence, which lasts all of three seconds, will haunt audiences for days, weeks even. Much has been made about the film’s potential to spawn real-world violence. The movie itself suggests nothing of the kind. The best art rarely does. Instead, it paints a world where empathy, not violence, is the solution. Give Phillips all the credit he deserves. The tone here is unrelenting, but the spell being cast never comes close to breaking. Phillips co-wrote the screenplay, too, and his images work wonders with the score. The latter packs a wallop, from rich string arrangements to more traditional notes. So what happens next? Does Warner Bros. force Phoenix to don the grease paint again for future “Batman” installments? Will his Joker become part of a “franchise,” another cog in a fan-friendly series? Perhaps. Let’s stop and savor “Joker” while we can. It’s the best movie of 2019 and proof the Hollywood system can still make movies that knock our socks off. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","  In the weeks leading up to its release, this R-rated origins story about the Batman super-villain has been regarded with alarm, caution and fear—with good reason—almost as if it were a mass shooter’s YouTube manifesto rather than the umpteenth attempt to extract new revenue from the DC Comics movie franchise. An Army base in Oklahoma warned commanders to be alert to possible violence at theaters, and several theater chains are banning ticket-holders from wearing costumes or masks.
  But, as Phillips must know, Joker isn’t just a discussion. It’s a deliberate provocation that borrows freely from unsettling classics like Taxi Driver—from an entire subculture of dangerous, marginalized men that includes Charles Manson, A Clockwork Orange’s Alex and notorious Manhattan subway shooter Bernhard Goetz.
  Plagued with mental illnesses and an uncontrollable laugh that doesn’t have an ounce of mirth to it, he looks as if he’s infested with lice, fleas, bedbugs and possibly termites. Phoenix, who lost 50 pounds for the role, takes several opportunities to show us Arthur’s bony backside: There hasn’t been such a disturbing physique since Jeff Goldblum started metamorphosing into a fly.
  The story is as sadistically simple and efficient as the big wheel that crushed Saint Catherine into holy martyrdom: Arthur is beaten and pummeled, emotionally and physically, until he snaps. At that point he gives his hair an ugly green rinse, smears on some clown makeup and becomes the arch-villain who will plague the Caped Crusader and Gotham for years to come. You may feel a perverse emotional surge at his final transformation, but it’s effectively the catharsis of a lanced boil—the movie equivalent of Dr. Pimple Popper.
  What will Batman fans make of Joker? Its connection to the overall Batman mythology is deliberately underplayed—the movie is more interested in making us squirm at Arthur’s pathetic attempts at standup comedy. (Phillips gives a heavy nod to De Niro’s The King of Comedy, another masterpiece of freak misanthropy, with the actor in a stunt role as a late-night host.) We’re teased with the feverish gleam of a novel idea when Arthur’s addled mother (Frances Conroy) tells him he’s related to Bruce Wayne’s powerful father, Thomas Wayne. It suggests Great Expectations retold by Boo Radley. But this turns out to be another dead dream, one more bum steer for poor crazy Arthur.
  One feels obliged to counter that there have been several “real” Batman movies, made in completely different styles and each deeply upsetting in a singular, original way: Tim Burton’s Batman Returns (the Catwoman one) and Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, starring Heath Ledger as the Joker.
  Phoenix’s Joker, whose break with sanity is the result of an undeviating path of misery and suffering, is ultimately less frightening than Ledger’s version. That Joker had no origins—he was an uncontrollable imp spawned from the head of evil. His malevolence was palpable but unresolvable. Phoenix’s performance is grandly masochistic and grindingly repellent. But is he really confronting us with anything new? In the end, his face streaked with greasepaint as he dances alone in his madness, he isn’t far removed from Bette Davis’s crazy old Baby Jane.

"Oct 3, 2019","  Director Todd Phillips reshapes Batman lore with a disturbing and shockingly violent descent into madness. Joker is a dark masterpiece; a bleak journey with a spellbinding lead performance. It feels unreal to write that Joaquin Phoenix may have surpassed Heath Ledger as the definitive interpretation of Joker. Fandom will be waxing poetic comparing the two. The film will certainly ignite a firestorm of controversy. Mental illness, gun control, society's apathetic decay, the chasm between rich and poor; Joker takes a fatalistic dive into heady issues. There has never been a comic book adaptation remotely this unsettling. Some will be appalled. Joker takes the genre in entirely uncharted territory.   Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is in crisis. A heavily medicated, mentally ill man, he lives in poverty with his similarly afflicted mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). He earns a meager living performing as a clown. Despite the ridicule, Arthur enjoys his job. He likes to entertain and see people smile. Arthur's dream is to be a stand-up comedian. His primary barrier is an uncontrollable disorder. Arthur erupts into cackling laughter when stressed or confronted. He's considered a freak. He has no friends. Even a city mandated social worker ignores his pleas.   Gotham City stinks from a garbage strike. Billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) plans to run for mayor and clean up the fetid streets. Arthur's mother is infatuated with him. Arthur funnels his idolatry towards late night talk show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). A particularly harrowing day on the job changes everything for Arthur. He decides to fight back against his cruel oppressors. Arthur gains new confidence. Maybe he'll have a conversation with a pretty neighbor (Zazzie Beetz), or light a fire under the simmering anger bursting through the seams of a town on the edge.   Todd Phillips (The Hangover, War Dogs) understands the importance of his setting. Gotham is torn from Martin Scorsese's gritty depictions of seventies New York City. Poverty, drugs, crime, despair, and filth pervade. Arthur is a desperate soul in a place that crushes the needy. His cries for help go unnoticed where no one cares. Arthur is not inherently savage. His transformation into the Joker is a result of the environment. Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver see no other destiny. It's a viewpoint that will garner criticism. Not everyone who slips through the cracks becomes a homicidal maniac. But untreated mental illness leads to tragedy daily; especially when firearms are involved. Phillips and Silver have merit to their message.   Joaquin Phoenix will be near impossible to beat come award season. He is absolutely riveting from the opening to last frame of Joker. His skeletal body, oily hair, and gaunt face an essential accomplice to inhabiting Arthur Fleck's being. Phoenix's spasmodic laughter, twitching back and forth through a sea of tears, conjures sympathy and ghastly fascination. It is an intense, physical performance that becomes even more astounding when Joker emerges. Everything broken inside Arthur's body and mind blooms into a murderous extrovert. Joaquin Phoenix, who's been an amazing actor in numerous roles since childhood, reaches a career pinnacle here.   Joker is strictly for mature audiences. Any kid watching would be traumatized. Joker is not a superhero, special effects wizardry popcorn film. Many comic fans will be turned off by the ugliness and bloody savagery. Warner Bros. and DC took a huge risk making Joker. The studio and Todd Phillips have already faced a considerable backlash. That may turn into a tidal wave after release, especially if some deranged individual tries to emulate the character. Art cannot be held hostage to public sentiment or the actions of a few. Joker is a different take on an eighty-year-old character. It is visionary, a must see. The praise for Joaquin Phoenix is not hyperbolic. He legitimately challenges Heath Ledger for the mantle of best Joker.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. The chosen one is one of the most widely recognizable staples of genre fiction. Dune: Part Two takes an axe to the very concept of it.  Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate was already being torn apart on social media, and things have only become worse as the scathing reviews piled in. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Since its debut a few weeks ago at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the top prize, Todd Phillips’s “Joker” has stirred up quite a tempest. Hands have been wrung about the movie’s supposed potential to inspire acts of real-life violence, and criticism of its brutal nihilism has been met with a counter-backlash, including from Phillips himself, who has been sounding off about the “far left” and “woke culture” and other threats to the ability of a murderous clown to make money unmolested. Meanwhile, the usual armies of skeptics and fans have squared off with ready-made accusations of bad faith, hypersensitivity and quasi-fascist groupthink. We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it’s also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me? To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. “Joker,” an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance. It barely even works within the confines of its own genre, the comic-book movie. “Joker” is a supervillain origin story, involving a character whose big-screen résumé already includes three Oscar winners (two for other roles, but still). It’s not hard to see the appeal. The Joker, an embodiment of pure anarchy, can be played light or heavy, scary or fun or all at once. He can sneer like Jack Nicholson, snarl like Heath Ledger or … I’m still not sure what Jared Leto was doing, but never mind. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Families of Aurora theater-shooting victims have asked Warner Bros. to support gun control in conjunction with the film’s release, given the thematic link to the 2012 mass shooting at a “Dark Knight Rises” screening that left 12 people dead and 70 injured. And social media warriors, both left and right, have breathlessly attacked and defended “Joker” as an example of everything that’s wrong (or right) with Hollywood, despite most of them not having seen it. “Joker” has little to say about any of that. It’s more concerned with class warfare, the failures of capitalism and its own grandiosity. Its earth-toned palette, deft pacing and acrobatic lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix are less about setting up future franchises than riveting you in the moment. But director Todd Phillips has not done “Joker” many favors recently by spitting on “woke” culture and the supposed chilling effect “the far left” has had on comedy. The truth is that “Joker” leans more progressive than it does conservative, even if the targets of its harsh commentary are only occasionally clear enough to recognize. Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill, middle-aged man who lives with his mother in a ratty slum and works as a sign-twirler for a clown temp agency. Fleck dreams of becoming a stand-up comic, but his workaday existence is anything but funny. Here, inside the most convincing re-creation of early ’80s New York we’ve seen in decades, Arthur suffers a series of violent indignities. Street kids steal from him and brutally attack him in an alley. His boss and coworkers mock him while his mother (with whom he lives), neighbors and even his social worker dismiss or ignore him. It’s a nightmare scenario of nature and nurture gone awry simultaneously, firmly rooted in the social, cultural and political decay of late ’70s and early ’80s urban America. The film flaunts its signifiers, from omnipresent imagery of a garbage strike and hastily scrawled graffiti to relentless stylistic nods to the era’s most bracing satires and dramas (“Taxi Driver,” “Network,” “The King of Comedy”). “Joker” frames Phoenix’s effortful performance with painterly ease, and the languid, foreboding score neatly synthesizes the past few decades of prestige drama moodiness — Bernard Hermann by way of Hans Zimmer. Despite the homages, this is an origin story we’ve never seen. Yes, there’s precedent for cutting off a character from the larger comics-universe and indulging in hyper-stylization (see 1989’s brilliant “Gotham by Gaslight” comic), and “Joker” is very much in that vein. But there’s none of the lowbrow dude-humor from director Phillips’ other films, whether that’s “Old School” or “The Hangover” movies. Fleck is regarded with fear and revulsion by most around him, and Phoenix’s intentionally ugly turn dares us to feel similarly. Hunched, skeletal and chain-smoking, Fleck laughs uncontrollably at inappropriate times (a neurological condition, he’s been told) and creeps people out wherever he goes. That includes the front gates of Wayne Manor, where Thomas (father of Bruce, our eventual Batman) lives as a cozy billionaire with political ambitions. His arrogance seems to invoke Hillary Clinton, particularly the ripple effect of her “deplorables” comment, in one of the film’s most simplistic jabs at the elite. As noted, though, this isn’t exactly a conservative rally cry. “Joker” takes pains to show how unregulated guns end up in the hands of the wrong people, or how Wall Street bros, drunk boyfriends and white privilege combine to victimize women and children (see a brutal Subway scene that activates the core plot). People of color are presented as targets of institutional greed and neglect, trapped in a system that’s perpetually against them. Fleck, in his male fragility, is the one committing murders — a victim transformed into an agent of chaos, with violence as his only way of asserting his identity. Making exact, real-world connections to every character or theme does a disservice to the film while also giving it too much on-the-nose credit (movies take a long time to make, after all). Murray Franklin, a “Tonight Show”-like host played by Robert De Niro, is neither Carson nor Letterman. Even Fleck’s co-workers are given some emotional depth beyond their accents and haircuts, particularly the short-statured Gary (Leigh Gill). But as thoughtful — and often gorgeous — as “Joker” is, it lacks the satirical, anti-hero clarity of a film like “American Psycho” (or, for that matter, “A Clockwork Orange”). The grains of optimism and humor present in many on-screen social critiques are absent here. “Joker” has nothing good to say about anyone. It’s not, as many are ready to receive it, a handbook for the impotent rage men feel as their fingers are pried from the global levers of power. It’s more a violent portrait of treatment-resistance sadness and confusion that just as easily could have ended with Fleck’s suicide. By the time the film reaches its convulsive, citywide climax, Phillips has done his best to show us how terrible things tend to beget more terrible things — but also how cool they can look when shot against sunsets and flickering lights. Perhaps the bleakest assertion of “Joker” is the one that’s hardest to disprove: That the ghastly world Fleck inhabits, and by extension ours, is the one we deserve.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," One of the reasons the Joker was such a thrilling phenomenon in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece The Dark Knight was that the film opted to make him an enigma. It made him all the more terrifying because you didn't know why the DC villain did anything, and he deliberately contradicted himself every time he offered a glimpse at his thought process. Ultimately, we are told next to nothing about his background. In other words, The Dark Knight's Joker had no origin story. The comics have largely avoided fully sketching out his past as well, though the most common elements have included him falling into a vat of chemicals and then being driven insane by the resulting disfiguration. Enter the new take on the character in Joker. With director Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy) at the helm, who's working off a script he co-wrote with Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile), Joker is far from wholly original though. Its basic premise — that of a failed stand-up comedian who unwittingly turns to a life of crime — is borrowed from Alan Moore's 1988 one-shot graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke”. Additionally, the film riffs heavily on the works of Martin Scorsese — who was once attached as producer, but left due to the workload involved with The Irishman — especially the 1976 neo-noir psychological thriller Taxi Driver, and the 1983 satirical black comedy The King of Comedy, both of which starred Robert De Niro. (De Niro is in Joker too, and his role is a reverse homage to the latter.) It's why Phillips has also chosen to set Joker is that same period, as it takes place in 1981 in Gotham City, which as every Batman fan knows is essentially New York for all intents and purposes. By its setting, the movie can then trade on New York's civic, criminal, and social problems from that time, which essentially run parallel to the atmosphere of Taxi Driver. Joker mixes that with the character's aspirations to have the life of a talk show host and comedian from The King of Comedy. (De Niro played a madman then and he plays the host now.) And just as both Scorsese films did, Joker too follows a lonely individual who's combating a mental illness and is slowly driven insane. Here, said individual is a failed comic called Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). At the start of the film, Arthur is employed as a clown — an intentional foreshadow — who works as a sign waver. One day, he's picked on by a bunch of kids who proceed to destroy the sign and beat him up. But Arthur's boss doesn't buy his story and issues him a final warning, even though he was the victim in this scenario. Things aren't any better on the personal side of things. There's no one in his life except his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), whom he diligently takes care of. Together, they always watch Murray Franklin's (De Niro) nightly talk show, which Arthur vividly dreams to be a part of. On top of all that, Arthur has a medical condition that causes uncontrollable episodes of laughter, which doesn't earn him any compassion even though he carries a laminated card that says as much. This takes place against the backdrop of a Gotham City where the divide between the haves and the have-nots is deepening by the day. The messaging is pervasive throughout Joker, with the city having trouble dealing with everything from “super rats” to funding its social services. It doesn't help that Gotham's next mayoral candidate is an uber-rich man in Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) — father of a young Bruce, who grows up to be Batman and Joker's archenemy in the comics — who has some choice words for the city's poor. Wayne's demeanour makes him an easy villain in Joker, both on a public and private level, with the film tweaking his past and personality to give Arthur further reason to hate him. (That also helps set up an intriguing twist on one of the most iconic comic book moments.) In the run-up to its release at film festivals, Phillips used the word “bonkers” to describe Joker. But it's actually straightforward in pure filmmaking terms. To set up the story of a person who feels neglected by and isolated in society, Joker essentially puts him through the wringer. Arthur starts off in a bad place and things just get progressively worse from there on, as he loses all his support systems: mental, professional, and personal. Joker also literally isolates him on-screen, with the many supporting roles — including De Niro, Conroy, Cullen, his clown pals, and Zazie Beetz as his love interest — amounting to extended cameos for the most part. So when Arthur snaps a little more than midway into it, it's very easy to identify with him, even though you know what the Joker stands for. Joker is most thrilling, hair-raising, and disturbing as Arthur completes his transformation into the title character, with each scene thereafter somehow more terrifying than the one it follows. His actions help the anti-rich sentiment in Gotham boil over, and it's terrifying to see how the pain and anger of one individual can be co-opted by a system for their benefit. But it's also here Joker wades into troubled waters. Not only does it state that mental illness can be a source of evil, it also gives a select group fuel for how they see the world. By making Arthur a hero of sorts, Joker can be seen as justifying their thoughts and potential actions. That's a dangerous notion to peddle — without condemning — in an environment where everyone believes they are “righteous”. That any of it sticks is because of Phoenix. The 44-year-old — who has wilfully avoided commercial cinema ever since the turn of the century — gives Joker every ounce of what he has to offer, having lost 24kg of weight for the role. His (unintentional) laughs start off with copious amounts of nervousness and sadness, and then slowly morph into something else altogether. By the end, Arthur isn't laughing as much, but you can tell that he's smiling to himself. Phoenix is every bit as captivating as Heath Ledger was over a decade ago — it's why there are calls already for giving him the Oscar — albeit for different reasons. If Ledger was frightening, then Phoenix is spine-chilling. The latter also benefits by getting to work with a character arc courtesy of the transformation. For those that usually restrict themselves to the superhero genre, Joker will no doubt be a breath of fresh air. And though it's not part of the DC film universe that includes Wonder Woman and Aquaman, it does leave room for a future with more of Bruce Wayne. Phillips has said he doesn't see Robert Pattinson's Batman cross over but that doesn't mean he can't create his own world, which depends on how it does commercially. But as an origin story — Arthur is a product of a broken mother, a broken home, and a broken city — it's unable to meaningfully engage with what it presents. And as a standalone ~superhero~ film, Joker drinks too much from Scorsese's can while presenting a deeply cynical but ultimately empty viewpoint. It's provocative but sadly, it's also irresponsible in the handling of that material.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," I avoid comic book film adaptations like malaria, but the Joker improbably winning the Golden Lion at Venice led me to check it out. How could a solo movie about a Batman villain be prize-worthy against more than a dozen art house favorites? Well, the Venice jury is vindicated. Minus a couple of slips, Joker is a first-rate movie superbly conceived and directed by Todd Phillips and with a sublime performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck (aka The Joker). Phoenix slithers into the mind and skin of his lowly, creepy, psychotic character in a conscious homage to the classic manic impersonations of Robert DeNiro as Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle and The King of Comedy’s Rupert Pupkin. Arthur channels Travis’s coming alive and into manhood through weaponry and Rupert’s  smothering obsession with celebrity. The connections of these three movies can’t be clearer, as De Niro himself is along for the ride in Joker, playing to the hilt a fatuous late-night TV host. There’s one more film that’s essential in the Joker mix, seen by few: Lynne Ramsay’s  2017 You Were Never Really Here (Arts Fuse review). It’s Joaquin Phoenix again, as, in Joker, a low-life in NYC living with and caring for his mother but, venturing outside, transforming into a serial killer. It doesn’t take away from Joker’s achievement to note that a stripped-down version of the story has already been done, and recently. So what’s the narrative of Joker? Arthur resides somewhere in Gotham City (cartoonist Bob Kane’s Big Apple) in a dilapidated apartment building, where he dotes on his pale, frail, mostly bed-ridden mom, Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When she manages to crawl to the couch, it’s to watch her favorite late night talk show, The Murray Franklin Show; and it’s De Niro as the star of it all sitting smugly behind his desk chatting with the guests. Mrs. Fleck has one more obsession: her seeming romance four decades ago with her rich boss, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Wayne, who could be Arthur’s real father, is, at this very moment proclaiming a run for mayor to clean up Gotham. That’s one thing Wayne and Arthur agree on, but with very different solutions. Gotham/NYC has gone to pot. It’s exactly the encrazed cesspool which Travis Bickle so wanted to clean up, to make his city great again. Will it improve the environs in Joker by electing a reformist hizzoner? Or, in Arthur’s case, is there a more blunt, crude way to clear the lethal streets? It’s time to mention Arthur’s debilitating condition. A variant on Tourette’s: the poor guy can’t help laughing out loud like a jackass whenever he gets tense. Which is often. The laugh is off-putting, alienating, and, among other failures, keeps him from making human connections. As with the sputtering, stuttering Norman Bates, the only woman in his life is dear Mother. Can his laughter be harnessed, utilized? Clueless Arthur, after a lifetime of TV watching, has ambitions to be a stand-up comedian, even though his mom says, ingenuously, “Aren’t comedians supposed to be funny?” To support himself, he takes temporary jobs in a clown’s whiteface and ditsy outfit, singing ha-ha songs for crippled children, carrying advertising signs in the streets dolled up as a sort of Emmett Kelly. For the first third of Joker, we, the audience, are totally on Arthur’s side. That’s filmmaker Phillips’s strategy: this miserable, disabled shlimazel, so caring for his mother, so enamored of little children, is getting a raw deal everywhere. His boss unfairly wants to fire him, and he’s beaten to a pulp by young hoodlums when he chases them when they steal one of his signs. Just when in time does Joker occur anyway? The story is set in some vague retro pocket, a comic book 1970s, Taxi Driver-land, Johnny Carson-land, but packed with anachronisms: Sinatra’s 1966 “That’s Life” blasting on the soundtrack, a fancy theatre in which the beautifully coiffed audience laugh their asses off watching Charlie Chaplin roller skating in 1936’s Modern Times. Arthur’s sluggish 1960s tape recorder. Most important: Joker is pre-computer. Although there’s a resemblance, Arthur cannot be pegged as today’s fan boy sending out violent tweets and texts while residing with his parents. Is it real or a fantasy? Is everything that happens in Arthur’s demented imagination?  In Todd Phillips’s 2009 classic, The Hangover, his protagonists wake up in Los Angles to a baby in their room and a tiger. Are they still dreaming? Or when they end up at the home of Mike Tyson? Phillips continues walking this pop-surrealist line in Joker. Every time you think the world has exploded, Arthur pops awake. So none of that happened? Or some of it did? Or all of it did? And if it’s all in Arthur’s head, does that matter? Does it negate all that we’ve seen? Does the horror of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari just disappear when we learn it’s all the vision of a mad man? Maybe the mad man is the seer who sees the world clearly, like Arthur. There have been who have attacked Joker as socially irresponsible for, in an era of mass killings, placing us in such intimate relationship with a murder, and, ultimately, with a host of murderers. There are others that argue that it’s just a movie, for God’s sake. And it’s not movies that are responsible for killings any more than guns are. My position? Joker is socially irresponsible at times, but with purpose. Screenwriter-director Phillips knows well what he is doing in the calculated way he escalates the bloodshed. So Arthur has this gun. And his first shootings are — this is important — almost ones we leftist pacifists in the audience can agree on. He’s attacked on a subway by three suited, haughty, arrogant, Wall Street yuppies, who knock him to the floor and kick him and kick him. We hate them! And it’s definitely self-defense when he, who has never shot anyone before, pulls out his gun and blasts them. But here’s where we begin to lose Arthur. Phillips shows that Arthur is extremely energized by the killing, pumped up, and so aroused as a man that, seemingly, he can knock on the door of the sexy woman down the hall, make love to her, and emerge with a doting girlfriend. And Arthur’s killings after? Each one gets uglier and has less motivation. I may be wrong, but I don’t think the crowds will be with him as he shoots away. I think audiences will be nauseated, revolted. Which is good. BUT, and this contradicts everything I’ve said in the last paragraph. My artsy, transgressive self shamefully approves of, at the climax of the film, a clown revolt in the streets. It’s neither right nor left but unadulterated nihilism, the closest I can remember in cinema to Antonin Artaud’s Theatre of Cruelty, his revolutionary belief that “essential” theater is like the plague. Or in this case (with Steven Sondheim’s accompanying music), here come the clowns! Gerald Peary is a Professor Emeritus at Suffolk University, Boston, curator of the Boston University Cinematheque, and the general editor of the “Conversations with Filmmakers” series from the University Press of Mississippi. A critic for the late Boston Phoenix, he is the author of nine books on cinema, writer-director of the documentaries For the Love of Movies: the Story of American Film Criticism and Archie’s Betty, and a featured actor in the 2013 independent narrative Computer Chess. His new feature documentary, The Rabbi Goes West, co-directed by Amy Geller, is playing at film festivals around the world. The plague takes images that are dormant, a latent disorder, and  suddenly  extends  them  into  the  most  extreme  gestures; the theater also takes gestures and pushes them as far as they will go: like the plague it reforges the chain between what is and what is not, between the virtuality of the possible and what already exists in  materialized  nature. It  recovers the  notion  of  symbols  and archetypes  which  act  like  silent blows,  rests,  leaps  of  the  heart, summons  of  the  lymph, inflammatory  images  thrust  into  our abruptly  wakened  heads. The  theater restores  us  as  our  dormant conflicts  and  all their  powers,  and  gives  these  powers  names  we hail as symbols: and behold! before our eyes is fought a battle of symbols, one charging  against  another in  an  impossible  melee; for there can be theater only from the moment when the impossible really begins and when the poetry which occurs on the stage sustains and superheats the realized symbols. I am amazed that so erudite and experienced a critic as Gerald Peary would not see Joker for the benumbed, achingly gratuitously violent, but ,most damningly , so  attenuatedly derivative that the only vaguely original aspect of the sodden mess is the grotesquely calculated publicity campaign that began with Phoenix’s tantrums on the set and in interviews. If you want a sad clown go to the Boston Lyric Opera’s Pagliacci.   You’ll  find passion and  violent risk-taking the post-Pulp Fiction  pseudo-cinephiles  couldn’t begin to understand. Note I do not put Gerry Peary in that category. Anyone who cares about serious film criticism is in his debt. Hi, Tom: I guess we agree on the wonders of Raoul Walsh and are in totally different camps on this one. You see “derivative,” I see “homage.” You see gratuitous violence. I see a director getting the audience implicated in violence and then jolting the audience to how stupid they are being in allowing themselves to be complicit. Joker, to me, is like  Bonnie and Clyde, where the violence goes from light and funny to more and more horrible and unbearable. Gerry–It is also Phoenix’s performance. I am the majority of one who found Heath Ledger’s Joker less  de profundis than late-Brando-self-indulgent.  So the tortuous back story setting up “the Joker” is not illuminating but by-the-numbers to me.  I felt like we were being told to sympathize with him, rather than being able to do so.  The opposite of what happened with Walter White in “Breaking Bad”, for instance.  To be honest, ever since “Pulp Fiction”, the whole “gore is a hoot” approach to slaughter is unacceptable to me.  I think it reached its limit with “Natural Born Killers.”  Have you talked to anyone under 30 about “The Wild Bunch”? They laugh at it.  I bet they would roll their eyes at “Bonnie and Clyde.” I’m not wringing my hands at “desensitized youth.”  I think that the way slaughter is normal now has limited the ability of film to offer critiques of violence. I hate to say it, but “Joker” is complicit. Just saw the film and read your fine review and the comments. The question of “complicity in violence” has and always will be debated. I did feel empathy for him initially, and slightly less so with each murder, although there were rationales for each subsequent murder (if such is possible)…For me, the complete turn toward the cartoonish in the last half hour was like a different film and any moral self-questioning compelled by the rest of the movie was undermined, but they must have figured this was a cinematic way  to get to the back-story of Bruce Wayne’s parents being killed.  I suppose the writers had a conundrum. They must have thought it was a brave touch to make Mr. Wayne a dickhead, but of course, that undermines his usefulness as a martyr. Excellent acting job, although the filmmaker’s compulsion to constantly focus on how skinny Phoenix had made himself for the part was gratuitous.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," The 44th annual Toronto International Film Festival was, as usual, front-loaded with major motion pictures during its opening 5-day period, which runs on a jam-packed Thursday through Monday schedule. King Street West is shuttered and a pop-up pedestrian-friendly Festival Village draws thousands of movie fans, ticket-holders, and star-chasers.  The festival itself is an eleven-day extravaganza of hundreds of film screenings, press conferences, panel discussions, audience Q & A participation, and parties. The period from the middle to the close of the event is infinitely more calm. Many of my TIFF choices were considered major entries by the festival’s programmers and by members of the media. I’ve already reviewed the now-opened “Judy,” which is well-worth seeing.  I also saw “Seberg,” with Kristin Stewart as celebrated actress Jean Seberg, and her 1960s support of the Black Panthers political group; Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as lighthouse keepers in the moodily atmospheric black and white chiller “The Lighthouse;” and “Pain And Glory,” a fictional memory piece, which is directed by Spain’s great Pedro Almodovar, about his life in movies. My reviews when they open. One inescapable aspect of festival fever are autograph seekers and the selfie-obsessed. They’re a cadre of devoted people willing to stand three and four deep for hours at stage doors and hotel entrances as they eagerly await glimpses of their favorite stars. They can sometimes seem a little bit nutty and over-the-top. All of them bring a supercharged dose of energy to premieres as they wait for a possible pose for a picture, or a Sharpie scribble in their autograph book or on a poster or photograph. There was fan frenzy at a Monday night Gala showing of “Joker” at the 2,630-seat Roy Thomson Hall, a fine arts concert venue. Not to be outdone, more than 500 members of the press and industry jammed two separate theaters the next day at the Scotiabank complex to be able to see the film at noon screenings on Tuesday. I saw it at the Gala. ""Joker"" is an origin movie featuring the colorful Batman nemesis, and merry prankster, known as The Joker. Hollywood has turned him into something more disturbing and malevolent. Joaquin Phoenix’s fevered, often-demented performance as Joker is what's driving overzealous fans into utter apoplexy. Interestingly, these fans were salivating months ago when nobody had seen the movie. That's the blight of social media. Set in a grimy, garbage-strewn Gotham City in 1981 (Brian De Palma’s “Blow Out” is on a movie theater marque), “Joker” is about a mentally disturbed man named Arthur Fleck. He has compulsions that are onerous burdens to his psyche, fixations generated partly by a obsessive relationship with his elderly mother. He lives with her. As with many other movies, practicing a narrative form of pop-psychology are director Todd Phillips and his co-screenwriter Scott Silver. Formerly institutionalized, Fleck is a clown-for-hire, a lonely soul without much of a future. A social worker controls his medication. He entertains sick kids in a hospital, once carrying a gun another clown has given him. He washes his mom’s hair during her bath time. Kids rob a sign he holds advertising a store. He clomps after them comically.  Arthur’s world is a horror-show of urban sounds colors, and, he believes, menacing characters, some of whom deserve retribution. The movie’s manic violence arrives briskly and continues brutally. Is there any respite in a life that’s spiraling out-of-control? Arthur thinks he’s created a friendship with a single mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives in his apartment building.  “Joker” is a movie about loneliness, but it’s too shallow to be meaningful. We see what Arthur has become – a failed entertainer – but Phillips and Silver have no interest in how he can rid himself of the clutter that corrupts his existence. They’re only interested in chaos; however, they don’t elevate the chaos into a meaningful narrative, they pander to the audience with it.  The film owes a big debt of gratitude to director Martin Scorsese. Depending on your point-of-view, it either pays homage to, or cribs, borrows, or outright steals from two Scorsese movies starring Robert De Niro.  Other major cinematic references are “White Heat” in which James Cagney’s criminal, who loves his mother, strives to be respected and remembered, and “The French Connection” – subway and automobile madness. And, of course, there’s “Psycho,” in which “a boy’s best friend is his mother.” “Joker” is moderately good. Phoenix’s bravura performance keeps it from feeling like empty calories. The busy, helter-skelter movement of people and modes of transportation occasionally make it fun to watch, but “Joker” is not an overachiever. It ultimately comes up lacking a vital something special. There may be debates about the film celebrating violence committed by loners and influencing some elements of society to act out their rabid fantasies. This is an age-old argument, and one with which I don’t agree.  First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," After winning the Venice Film Festival competition last month, Joker floats into cinemas on a cloud of advance hype that's like a dose of Joker venom — the villain's poison gas. Reviewers in both Time and Vanity Fair have expressed concerns Joker might glorify the behaviour it's supposed to condemn, and cinema chains in the US aren't taking any chances. After a recent military memo warning the film might inspire spree shooters, one has boosted security for the opening weekend, another has banned cosplay from its screenings. It makes you wonder if there's been another film so maligned, or an audience reaction so feared, since Stanley Kubrick pulled A Clockwork Orange from circulation in the UK in 1973 following reports it had inspired copycat crimes. Joker is no more vicious than that movie or its DC stablemates, but its grim social setting, almost realist by superhero movie standards, feels bracingly relevant and unsettling. It begins in a Gotham City that recalls Manhattan of the early 1980s, pre-Disneyfied and grotty, with a garbage strike in full swing and an infestation of giant rats gorging on piles of uncollected waste. In the lead, Joaquin Phoenix is gaunt, wiry and increasingly resentful. Gone is the self-possessed evil strategist of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight or the pop-punk provocateur of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad (thankfully). He also doesn't resemble Jack Nicholson's brash showman in Tim Burton's Batman, or Cesar Romero's impish prankster in the TV series.  Phoenix's Joker is a kind of damaged loner, lacking the confidence of his on-screen predecessors, in a film that feels less like a link in a comic book movie chain and more like a stand-alone study of urban alienation and madness. ""For my whole life I didn't know if I really existed,"" he muses, channelling the frustration and insecurity of someone who craves to be seen in the crowd. Before he develops the Joker alter-ego, he goes by the name Arthur Fleck and lives with his bedridden mother (Frances Conroy) in a tenement flat. He makes ends meet working for a clown hire company, where even there, in a locker room that's like the set from Taxi, he's an oddball amongst oddballs. His dream is to become a stand-up comic like his idol, a vanilla late-night TV host played with understated smugness by Robert De Niro, but his inability to relate to people makes him unable to read the room, and he bombs on his first open mic. Phoenix is compelling in the role — an unreliable narrator whose facial expressions and gestures are non sequiturs that alternate between camp, menacing and sulky registers. Traditionally, the Joker hasn't been given an extensive backstory, but the idea he's a failed comedian first appeared in The Killing Joke graphic novel of the late 1980s. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips, who made his name with The Hangover comedies, blends this with a nod to Scorsese's The King of Comedy, a film in which De Niro played a not dissimilar wannabe comic and stalker. Fleck shares many traits in common with Driver's Travis Bickle — he's alienated, self-absorbed and ignored by the woman he desires. Like Bickle, he also escapes into roleplay and finds purpose in violence. Grotesque close ups do little to endear Fleck to us. An early tight shot shows him laughing uncontrollably — not a joyous or happy laugh but a troubled reflex, the possible result, we learn, of a childhood brain injury at the hands of abusive parents. In another tight shot, holding a cigarette with stained fingers, he deflects questions from his long-suffering social worker. She's one of a series of (mostly female) African Americans he either ignores or — in the case of a beautiful neighbour played by Zazie Beetz (Atlanta) — fantasises about. The racial dimension of these relationships seems to cement Fleck as a member of Gotham's working class, a group that has the most to lose as the city's infrastructure crumbles and public budgets shrink. On a grimy, late night train he encounters three young Wall Street types drunkenly harassing a young woman. When he has a laughing fit during the assault they start beating him up, until he pulls out a gun. Methodically, he shoots the men as they try to run, in a sequence that glides with musical elegance, punctuated by gunshots and the off/on flicker of the carriage lights. The film invites you to share the cathartic rush of his anger, until the excessive violence simply becomes too much and the sight of Fleck shooting a cowering man in cold blood too gruesome.  Similarly, it makes it impossible to enjoy a moment later on where he triumphantly steps out in full Joker costume, strutting in a slow motion reverie down a flight of stairs to the electric guitar bombast of Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter. The music of a convicted paedophile. The trouble is some in the audience might miss this point, as do many of Gotham's residents. When the city's downtrodden and angry masses hear about a clown killing rich people on the subway, they turn him into a folk hero, unaware he believes in nothing beyond his own fame. To be sure, the city's elites are a loathsome bunch, including Bruce Wayne's father Thomas (who Brett Cullen plays as a conservative jerk of the highest order). But as angry mobs spill out into the streets in violent revolt, many wearing clown masks, the film's pessimistic and even patronising view is that the masses aren't capable of recognising when they're being duped. Batman doesn't appear fully formed in this origin story — he's still a boy — but the fact he will one day arrive as Gotham's saviour, like a twisted Christian vision, is a given. In the meantime, images of angry crowds celebrating a psychopath leave a disturbing aftertaste. Given the current political climate, Joker builds into a statement that's salient and provocative — holding a mirror to real world frustration and the resurgent populism in our midst.

"Oct 3, 2019"," The Joker posits this question at the end of his cinematic origin story, tidily summarizing the film’s narrative for both his literal and figurative audience. I’d say these are spoilers, but Joker’s destination is pre-ordained by the character’s iconic status in pop culture. We all know The Joker is a bad guy, and Joker aims to tell us why. So the meat of this movie is really the stuff in the middle. Because no one’s just born this way, right? There’s a reason to be skeptical about the concept of this movie, particularly a dark, gritty, true-to-life, awards-contender version of it. Comics have proved in multiple iterations of The Joker’s origin that it’s best kept as multiple choice. There’s a fear in his ambiguity. It’s a fear the decades-old character invokes in an even more relevant way now. What drives seemingly average men to the brink of mass murder? A bad day? A bad life? I went into Joker willing to write off concerns about the premise as well as the mixed early TIFF review from my colleague, Kay-B. Because cynicism aside, Joker has a unique opportunity to delve into that question in a new, timely way. And in a few aspects it does deliver. We get a visually dazzling film with a beautiful score and gut-wrenchingly emotional and physical performance from Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character. It’s also well-crafted by director Todd Phillips, who has an eye for pacing and tension. But underneath the window dressing and the pretense of the two big questions — WHO and WHY — Joker has no answers. Instead it borrows wholesale from old films like The King of Comedy and trades in long-debunked, tired tropes about the violence of a mentally ill patient who’s been off his meds too long. We spend about half of Joker getting to know down-on-his-luck Arthur Fleck, that self-described mentally ill loner trapped in a system that treats him like trash. Fleck dotes on his aging mother, works hard to make kids laugh by dressing up like a clown, and struggles with even basic social interactions due to a neurological condition known as Pseudobulbar affect, which makes him burst out into uncontrollable laughter at the most inopportune of times. We’re told he’s on seven medications, although we’re not given any specific diagnosis beyond that general “mentally ill” descriptor. All we know is that the worst part about having a mental illness, as Fleck writes in his journal, is people expect you to behave as if you don’t. So that’s Fleck. And by all accounts, he’s an average guy just struggling to get by. Which brings us to the second half of Joker’s recipe for a killer: the system that treats him like trash. The streets are filled with rats, the wealthy are thriving while the poor are suffering, and it’s getting crazier out there every day. Eventually enough is enough, and Fleck gets stepped on too many times. In an act of self-defense that turns murderous, Fleck kills some preppy Wall Street types who are drunkenly harassing a fellow passenger on a subway car before turning with violence on Fleck too. Stories emerge of the killer clown who came for the rich, and the poor of Fleck’s home hold this killer clown up as a symbol. They start to dress like him, stage protests, and terrorize the city. The idea of “the system” that tears the social fabric of Gotham and Fleck’s life apart is vague and mostly described as economic disparity, likely because it’s a simple target. Whether you’re left-wing, right-wing, or apolitical, it’s hard to feel much sympathy for the lofty 1 percent controlling the rest of the country. It’s an easy way out for a film that wants to say something about “the system” but isn’t really interested in taking any real stance at all other than “it’s bad.” Which part? And for whom? Director and co-writer Phillips won’t say, as he opts not to take inspiration from actual events of civil unrest, which are often triggered by acts of injustice perpetrated against a community. Instead “the system” pushes Gotham’s poor to the brink when they decide to riot in celebration of the murder of some random rich guys. Not in protest or in rage at the murders, of which they approve, but as a sort of violent, happy mayhem at large. Because society, man. I think there’s a knee-jerk pre-reaction to this film that feels political: that the left will hate it for what it has to say, specifically. I felt the opposite. It had almost nothing to say at all. The depiction of mental illness is problematic, not because it’s intentionally making a controversial point, but because it’s lazy and uninformed, like the rest of the movie. And lazy would be fine for an entertaining film that simply embraced The Joker’s chaotic evil essence and let it prevail. In fact, the final 20 minutes or so of the movie are actually really good, as Phoenix finally settles down into a pitch-perfect portrayal of the character we’ve all been waiting for. But we waste 90 minutes getting there, extorted by a movie that really wants its audience to feel sympathy for a relatable man and the bad things that happen to him, mostly produced by circumstances beyond his control, while also expecting that audience to buy into his flimsy transformation into a murderous agent of chaos. It’s a tough sell from the start, to be sure, and the script doesn’t have the goods to deliver, which lets down the technical feats and perfections built around it. My Joker was Cesar Romero back in ’66. I’m not going to watch this at all. I’ll boycott this movie. Screw DC until they stop putting out violent garbage. I’ve been watching fans go berserk over the last couple of days, after Martin Scorsese said that comic books movies — and Marvel movies in particular — are “not cinema.” He’s right. They’re long TV episodes. I don’t think there is sufficient source material that covers the nuance on the transformation of the man into the joker, especially from a mental health standpoint. The origins of the joker have always been shrouded in ambiguity with the exceptions of a few comic storylines, one being the killing joke. To expect anything specific in this portrayal of the character evolution that takes place removes you from objectively judging the journey that this character takes. Having the notion that the film maker needs to make an ‘informed’ representation on mental health with regards to the joker is preposterous. This movie is an interpretation of the character, not a love letter. The dudes who are reportedly cheering in theaters for the Joker’s violence might disagree with that. For them, the movie IS a love letter, and the Joker is their hero. “To expect anything specific in this portrayal of the character evolution that takes place removes you from objectively judging the journey that this character takes.” the person who wrote the article doesn’t understand a single second of the film. This movie is critique of OUR society : how it is ruled by a small group of rich man, how they saw the rest of the population (lazy,clowns,etc.), how neoliberalism is destroying every single state aid – like mental support in the movie – in the name of the marker or in the name of ”the state doesn’t have money”. And how all of this is destroying people, pushing them to their limits, mentally and physically, how the became depressed not because of some problem in the brain, but some big problems in the society. And people who don’t see class struggles in society like the person who wrote the article or deniro in the movie, will always see that the riots are the problem…but the riots are not the problems, they are the symptoms of a sick mad capitalist society. The movie is set in the early 1980s, when the conservative Reagan administration (and its allies on the state level) was cutting such aid and putting mentally ill people on the street. Read Frank Miller’s Daredevil from that era. There was a 1981 issue where the govt. grant keeping Nelson and Murdock afloat was cut. It’s unfortunate that you’re carrying every movie experience you ever had going into a new movie but hey, you must really have a hard time doing or experiencing anything unless it hasn’t already happened to you. Looking through those Intro to Film 101 goggles most be a life to live. “Nishant” is probably too young to have seen or heard of the movies Todd Phillips rips off in JOKER. There’s also some V FOR VENDETTA in there. At least Phillips steals from the best. If only Travis Bickle had worn a purple suit and clown makeup, “Nishant” would probably have seen his movie. And he would probably regard it as the masterpiece he sees JOKER as. ‘Bill’ I dont think there’s a living soul who hasn’t seen taxi driver, fight club, the king of comedy, or v for vendetta. If you think any work of art can’t draw inspiration from other sources then you very much are living in a closed box. Growing up in the early 90’s doesn’t give you tunnel vision but it’s still a learned trait, as it is quite evident with the stunted drivel you’re spouting. “Nishant” said: “Growing up in the early 90’s doesn’t give you tunnel vision but it’s still a learned trait, as it is quite evident with the stunted drivel you’re spouting.” “I’m a liberal, probably to the left of Bernie, but if I hear one more of my progressive friends express disappointment that there weren’t a dozen theater shootings this weekend, I am going to throw up.” I loathe Trump but I agree that attacking him on social media isn’t going to drive him from office. If people want to get rid of Trump, they’ll have to turn out and VOTE. I hope the Millennials don’t stay home and pout, like they did when Bernie wasn’t nominated in 2016.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," We’ve seen many Jokers, including memorable turns by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, so it’s not unreasonable to wonder why we’d need another. One reason is that this is a Joker without his Batman, or any superhero trappings; another, that the ‘origin story’ is not of The Joker as a villain, but a victim.  With his open nod the New Hollywood films of the 1970s, particularly the Scorsese classics Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (but also One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Dog Day Afternoon) writer/director Todd Phillips has offered a powerful depiction of one man’s mental breakdown in the context of a society tearing itself apart.  At first, this Joker actually wants to make people laugh. Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, a professional clown in Gotham City (more clearly New York than ever). He means well, but is odd, creepy, with a condition that makes him break into uncontrollably laughter that sounds more like crying, or gagging. The first time we see this terribly sad man, he’s beaten senseless by kids. Later he stares at himself in a mirror, pulling at his emaciated face to create a cracked smile, while his running makeup gives him inky blue tears. Arthur’s broke, living with his mother (Frances Conroy) in a decrepit apartment building, fantasising about the neighbour down the hall (Zazie Beetz). Outside, Gotham is in a state of emergency, with rubbish piling up on the streets. “Is it me, or is it getting crazier out there?” he asks his social worker. The answer is a bit of both. He’s spent time in a mental institution, is reliant on medication; City cuts mean that the therapy and the pills are about to stop.  The Hangover films were fun, but there’s nothing really in Phillip’s CV to lead us to expect such power and purpose. This has some terrific, look-at-me set pieces, including a chase through a subway train full of clowns, and a magical scene in which Arthur enters a cinema disguised as a bell hop, while Chaplin’s Modern Times is playing on the screen. But more notable is the intense, sombre, dystopian feel of the film, created by a plangent, cello-driven soundtrack, and cinematography and production design that capture both the grimy misery of Arthur’s real life and the romantic canvas for his delusions.  And at the heart of is Phoenix. The actor has not only taken his face and body down to the bone, but paws and contorts himself constantly, in such a way that leaves no doubt about Arthur's agony, despair and growing rage. Yet now and again he'll burst into a silent, choreographed, self-involved dance, a moment of peace, perhaps, or a warning of the narcissistic control that he's about to achieve. It's a performance that has it all – danger, disturbance, pathos, black humour and twisted grace.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","Phillips made a brilliant choice in casting Phoenix, and then he was smart to know that the actor is so deep inside this role that everything he does, up to and including a homicidal rumba, feels right.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Frankly, I find it difficult to evaluate Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Joker, who goes by Arthur Fleck for most of the film. There’s a lot going on there. The actor lost a ton of weight for the role and he holds in his stomach to create a grotesque concave effect. (Grotesque is a buzzword for this film.) His hair is long and straggly. His face is lined. And then there’s his mannerisms, a never-ending series of tics and spasms. Arthur has a condition brought on by a brain injury where he sometimes laughs uncontrollably, especially when he’s agitated or nervous. It’s a sick, joyless laugh and Phoenix wields it best when Arthur attempts standup—a lifelong ambition—for the first time. He gets up on stage and begins to chortle and the audience is confused—is this part of the bit?—and then his laughter is mingled with tears of frustration and gasped snippets of dialogue as he tries to spit out a joke.
 Joker is made with an undeniable amount of skill. Phillips clearly worships Martin Scorsese (his War Dogs was another film that toed the line between rip-off and homage) and he mimics his idol pretty expertly, right down to the extreme and sometimes sickening violence. But the thing is, we already have Taxi Driver and King of Comedy—and they’re freaking great. The notion of doing a comic book version of those films is nothing more than a gimmick—one that left a sour taste in my mouth. ",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019"," To be clear: It's a calculating, meticulously planned chaos. That speech Ledger's Joker gives in the hospital, in The Dark Knight? Where he says he's not a planner, he's just a ""dog chasing cars?"" Yeah, that's a lie. Because underneath that terrifying, physiology-defying grin and that laugh like a hyena on nitrous, there's a coldly cunning criminal mastermind — he's just hidden it behind his  purple riverboat-gambler couture and his penchant for goofy, playing-card-themed capers, hoping you don't notice. Funny thing about the Joker. (Historically, he's referred to as both The Joker and Joker — the definite article gets a lot less definitive around him, in much the same way it does around his opposite number, The Batman/Batman.) He's unique among Batman's rogues gallery. Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman, Clayface, Scarecrow — the whole lot: When they were first introduced in the comics, they were introduced by way of their origin stories. The reader encountered them embarked upon some act of moral turpitude and immediately learned their entire deal — their real name, their background and why they settled upon whichever absurd larcenous gimmick (birds, riddles, cats, etc.) that they did.  Not the Joker. When he debuted in 1940 — just one year after Batman's first appearance — he didn't waste our time whingeing on about his backstory; he just set to work killin' folk. It took an unprecedented 11 years for him to earn an origin tale — and even then, it was a half-assed one. We didn't learn his real name, or his background, just that he was a crook who had jumped into a vat of chemicals to escape capture by Batman, which transformed him into the grinning ghoul we know today, the Clown Prince of Crime. It's that version of his origin story (others have been offered over the years) that writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland made some tweaks to in 1988's unrelentingly grim The Killing Joke graphic novel, and that Tim Burton took up and played with — adding a generous dollop of Jack Nicholson — in 1989's Batman film.  Both attempts — and that original, 1951 origin tale — diminished the character. As a concept, the Joker is a beautiful (albeit vicious) butterfly; his colors dim once you pin him to the specimen board. He functions best as a symbol, an abstract representation — or more precisely a distillation — of the kind of random act of violence that birthed Batman in the first place. (Batman's parents were killed by a mugger, FYI. Don't know if you knew that. It's possible you've been sealed in a vault for the past 80 years, so just in case: alley, gun, pearls, it was a whole deal.) He is a vector for disorder, for gleeful, heedless violence. If Batman is Merciless Order (he wasn't always, but he became so, around 1970), then Joker is Sadistic Chaos. He is Batman's perfect foil. He is, simply, The Adversary.  One of the many things Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight got right about the character is that we only think we want to know who he is and where he came from. The Joker works best, most purely, when unencumbered by the humdrum of the everyday. His motivations must and should remain mysterious, unknowable.  Director Todd Phillips' new film seeks to strip all mystery from the character and make his motivations very knowable. And in that much at least, he succeeds. Meet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a down-on-his-luck clown for hire, only ...  he's having a little trouble getting hired. Arthur has a condition that causes him to burst into laughter at random intervals, which tends to creep people out. And get him beaten up. A lot. Arthur suffers one of his many onscreen beatings at the hands (and feet) of a bunch of Wall Street bros on the subway, who taunt him by singing ""Send In The Clowns."" Nearly in its entirety. (The scene goes on for a while.) It's really the only time in this otherwise grounded, grim and gritty film that we're asked to suspend our disbelief at all — because, seriously, we're supposed to buy that a straight finance bro would be off-book on the second and third verses of a Sondheim number?  Joker is, ostensibly, a downfall story — a tale of how a broken man got broken in the first place. To make stories compelling, to keep audiences' interest when the conclusion is foregone, storytellers need to forgo what they know audiences already expect to see. But Phillips and his co-screenwriter Scott Silver aren't interested in iterating or innovating, because doing so would clash with their mission statement.  They want us to see Arthur as a victim, pushed into becoming a monster by his mental illness and a broken government. You may or may not find that prospect irresponsible, even dangerous. Let's leave that to social scientists. What I can tell you is that, as executed in Joker, it's wildly unconvincing and mundanely uninteresting.  Certainly, Joker is tense, grimy and claustrophobic, and Phoenix's performance is a big swing, and a risky one — the kind of big, risky swing that Oscar voters historically eat up with a big ol' spoon. But the film so desperately strives to reject comic book trappings — so aches to be seen as edgy, provocative, serious, adult — that it simply apes the tone, style and content of other, better, edgier and more provocative films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy and Fight Club.  But those films had a point of view, they had something to say — they implicated us in their onscreen violence, in the bad choices their characters made. Joker sees Arthur's transformation into a mass murderer as inevitable. It's not a choice; it's something the world does to him. As a result of his passivity, the story becomes little more than Arthur suffering a string of indignities until, one day, heroically (?), he doesn't anymore. It swiftly grows predictable, then repetitive, then dull.  But the film doesn't care — it's too busy exuding a sense of self-satisfaction, a preening, self-consciously provocative challenge to an audience — a humanity — it holds in pitched contempt. Joker thinks of itself as urgent, relevant, of the moment and — mostly, unrelentingly — not just another silly superhero movie. Ultimately, however, it devotes so much of its energy into not being about a comic book villain that it neglects being about ... much of anything, really.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," Searing onto the screen as both a revisionist backstory of an iconic villain character and a pointed commentary on the cuddlier aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the new Joker movie is bold, violent, and unnerving. There have been many exceedingly dark takes on the greatest foil of Batman’s through the decades of DC Comics, everything from Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s The Killing Joke, but this one pushes even further. The origin story here finds a hapless soul, used and abused from his birth on, turning into a psychopath that society shares responsibility in. This isn’t a Joker who just wants to see the world burn. He’s a tragic figure who finally learns to hurt back. Some purists will cry foul over what director Todd Phillips and his fellow screenwriter Scott Silver have done here with the Joker character, foregoing his gangster origins and that vat of chemicals that gave him his permanent grin. But what has been done here is not far off of what Christopher Nolan did in his movie where the Joker’s grin came courtesy of scarred cheeks. It’s a different take on tried and true material, as both strove to say something new and challenge convention in their big-screen efforts. Phillips and Silver’s story takes place in 1981, and Gotham City, the thinly-veiled Big Apple, is being overrun with rot. There’s a garbage strike, and the rat population has grown so exponentially that the press is calling the predators “super rats.” Despite such surroundings, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is trying to bring a little joy into this world. He’s working as a clown-for-hire and pouring his all into drawing attention to the “going out of business” sale at the electronics store employing him. He mimes, dances, and performs tricks, truly taking his clown role to heart, all to get people to notice him and his “Everything Must Go” sign. Some teen gang members harass him and then steal his sign. Arthur chases them down, but he’s out-numbered and they beat the crap out of him. Battered and depressed, Arthur trudges home to the fleabag apartment he shares with his ailing mother (Frances Conroy). She’s spending her days while he’s away writing her former employer, billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), to ask for financial assistance for her beleaguered family. The only joy that Mom and son share together is the enjoyment of the late-night TV series “Live with Murray Franklin.” Arthur even fantasizes about doing stand-up on TV for Murray (Robert De Niro) someday. But those moments of happiness are fleeting for Arthur. Every day of his meager existence brings more and more humiliation. His unsympathetic boss demands that he replace the sign ruined by the gang with money from his paycheck. Arthurs’ snide co-workers make fun of his idiosyncrasies. And his nervous cackle, an inadvertent laughing condition that resembles Tourette’s, gets him in trouble time and time again in public. Randall (Glenn Fleshler), a fellow clown-for-hire, encourages Arthur to fight back against the abusers when he lends him his handgun. Arthur forgets he has the weapon on his person while entertaining at a children’s hospital and its exposure gets him fired altogether. Depressed and broke, he gloomily rides the subway home in full clown regalia where he witnesses three Wall Street jerks hassling a female passenger. Arthur’s uncontrollable laughter draws the ire of the trio and they punch and kick him into submission the subway car floor. This time though, Arthur fights back, using his handgun to silence all three of his attackers permanently. Not only does Arthur feel little guilt over his homicidal rage, but the public takes the side of the unknown ‘vigilante.’ The Gothamites feel the three brokers had it coming, and hordes of protestors fed up with the city’s conditions, turn these deaths into a “Kill the Rich” call to arms. Suddenly, Arthur’s mysterious killer clown is a folk hero, leading the disenfranchised to start wearing clown masks as they join in the anti-establishment movement. Arthur is tickled by what he inadvertently created, but the story doesn’t become one of a reluctant messiah embracing the mantle of turning into a criminal mastermind. Instead, the film continues to chronicle his descent into madness. There’s something terribly off about Arthur, even in his quieter scenes, and the narrative fills in the blanks that explain his myriad of psychological problems. He eventually finds out the truth about his parentage and the cause of his many conditions. The film defines his ‘evil’ and in doing so, presents a much fuller portrait of psychopathy than you’d find in almost any other comic book adaptation for the big screen. This is where Phillips’ film, despite being a period piece, makes its starkest commentary, editorializing on topical issues, everything from the political divide in our nation today, to the sunny and often silly side of villainy, often presented in the MCU. The Joker here serves as a counter to the cuddliness of certain Marvel villains like Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. This movie was done years before Disney’s streaming platform announced its Loki TV series, but one can’t help but see it as a commentary on the limits of characters worthy of franchising. Some may argue that comic books aren’t trying to be the I.D. Channel, and the Joker doesn’t need to be presented as a twisted monster that gets molded by an abusive childhood à la Charles Manson or Richard Ramirez, but indeed, that is how evil often starts. It takes a village, or at least awful parenting, to help set up the environment to breed such destructive personalities, and Phillips, et al. are reminding us that villainy shouldn’t be lovable. Phoenix does incredible work here, as he always does, playing a version of abject loneliness and despair that could be the third part of a triptych along with his starring roles in The Master and Her. Even at his most malevolent or rageful, Phoenix shows the hurt in his hurting. We never lose sight that his Arthur is not a well man. He may be making bad choices, but a lot of his trajectory was chosen for him. It’s not sympathy for the devil, but merely recognizing how much damage mistreatment and alienation can do to a soul. In many ways, Joker plays as more of a horror movie than a comic book adaptation. Everything from the slow camera movements to the deliberate score feels like those in a frightener. Still, Phillips manages to fuel this fierce tale with some fun too. He introduces young master Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) and Alfred Pennyworth (Douglas Hodge) in an exceptionally clever scene. Casting De Niro as the Johnny Carson-esque late-night host is cheeky in its intention to encourage comparisons to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. The director slyly makes hay of other elements from time period too, everything from vigilante Bernie Goetz to Times Square porn to state budget cuts that created the homeless epidemic. This vision of the Joker will likely polarize audiences. Some will hate it for the chances it takes, for its dreariness, but the film deserves commendation for courageously mining the same bleak territory that comics like Watchmen, 101 Bullets and Y: The Last Man did in their day. Such stories remind audiences that man is always the greatest monster of them all and that the mob often enables such evil, whether it realizes it or not.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Few films this year have gotten as much pre-release buzz as Joker. After all that speculation, we can finally see the already-laureled movie and it’s mostly fine.
 The DC Comics villain’s latest iteration comes to screen from the director who also brought us Old School, Road Trip, and all three parts of The Hangover saga. While this is not Todd Phillip’s first foray into the darker side of cinema, this time he teamed up with Joaquin Phoenix to bring the infamous clown to life.  While Phoenix’s performance veers into cartoonish and unbelievable at times, it’s spot-on for a comic book adaptation which occasionally bares its roots. He laughs maniacally. He imagines himself suave. He walks with all the grace of an ogre. The physicality and emotional rigor of the part of this evil man are easily met by a seasoned professional such as Phoenix.  The plot of Joker offers nothing new, by design. It’s the straightforward origin tale of one of the better known bad guys. Arthur Fleck is a mentally unstable man who has been failed on many fronts. The government fails him by cutting off his medication and only offering him an unfeeling clinical counselor. His mother (Frances Conroy) fails him by being unable to provide a happy childhood and stable home. His job fails him by letting him go. All of these failures lead to Arthur feeling like a victim of the system. When push finally comes to shove, he snaps and takes his angry vengeance out on what he sees as the biggest symbol of his failure as a man and the father he never had. Or, at least that’s one interpretation of Joker.  Another way to see all this is as the actions of a mentally unstable man who’s being held accountable for his actions. He was rightly fired for being dangerous around children. He refuses to comply with his therapist’s simple requests. He could have been the one to create a home for his infirmed mother. He has no stand on politics or the state of Gotham (which is doing a flawless 1970s New York City impression). He’s just another crazy person lashing out at the easiest target in his scope.  If you can believe it, Joker leans into both possible interpretations in different ways. All of the text within the script points toward Arthur being an apolitical madman who just wants to watch the world burn. He seemingly has no aspirations of grandeur or even retribution. But the visual language of the film tells an entirely different tale. Arthur is framed as godlike by an admiring camera. We nearly always see him from a low angle, as if the audience was on its knees at Arthur’s feet whenever he deigns to grace the screen with his majesty. And there’s the massive matter of the dancing.  In what feels like hours of the film’s running time, we see Arthur dancing. Sometimes it’s lovingly with his mother, sometimes it’s a horrific contortion as he finds his greater sense of antisocial self, but in any case this guy is always moving and shaking. The movements are reflective of his growing confidence and correspondingly growing interest in mayhem, and they are omnipresent. The celebratory dance when he finally dyes his hair green is one of the more beautifully filmed scenes in the entire film, as well as one of the most indulgent visually. Joker has come to life.  This middling messaging gives the film an overall underwhelming effect. It’s difficult to root for a guy who makes so many bad choices, even as a burgeoning antihero. And it’s difficult to root against society as a construct when we see no real evidence that there’s anything within that world worth saving. Then again, nothing in that world is presented as especially offensive either. It’s all just kind of fine.  I’m quite happy to report that Joker stops short of being the incel call to arms that it could have potentially become. The film’s treatment of women isn’t great, but that’s all shown as being a negative aspect of Arthur’s behavior, not a reason to celebrate him. Additionally, the movie makes a point to call out the hazards of worshipping false idols, and in turn criticizes fan culture, but that more hidden message might get lost on the people who don’t wish to see it.  I’m not saying you’re wrong for liking the movie. However, Deirdre is not some lone voice being a contrarian about a movie that’s otherwise universally beloved. That said, I don’t think Dierdre’s review is a pan. She says “it’s fine” and I respect that – but I think the movie would have paid a disservice to its source had it made EITHER Joker or Gotham city itself sympathetic. I mean, isn’t that the whole reason Batman is needed in the first place? I just think films like Joker, haunt, It 2, Good boys, Stubber, Ana, Brightburn and Angel has fallen, Hellboy and Glass all deserved to be rated higher, so in the future I will look to other reviewers for movie watching advice. Not intending for this comment to come off as rude and hope my previous one did not either. Fair enough, but I think you’re going to have a really hard time finding many other reviewers who would go to bat for some of those movies, like Stuber or the Hellboy reboot. Again, I’m not saying that you’re wrong for liking those movies, just that Deirdre’s ratings for them seem to be pretty much in line with the general critical consensus.  I didn’t hire some Armond White here who would praise terrible movies and pan great ones just to be a click-bait contrarian. I don’t expect every reader to agree with all of Deirdre’s opinions (or any of our writers’, including my own), but I think she has done a good job of explaining why she gives the ratings she does. I agree with you 100 percent; I think my taste are more Joe Bob Brigs than Roger Ebert since I just watched Doom Annihilation and of course its bad, but in an endearing way, like Knott’s scary farm compared to Universal Halloween Horror Nights. She is a great reviewer and an asset to the site for sure and she always articulates her scores very well, so I apologize if It sounded like I came after her. I am now going to look up who Arman White is and see if he liked Rambo Last Blood, jk, thanks for the response as always Josh.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019"," From the glorification of gun violence to the placement and treatment of people of color in the film, critics have had plenty to complain about since the trailer dropped. And while the racism and ableism that some have said the trailer suggested isn’t necessarily as blatant in the film, it is an issue when you consider how and when the people of color show up in the film, as well as the implications of someone with mental health issues committing heinous acts of violence; people with mental health issues are often the most at risk of being victimized and exploited. If we solely look at Joker as Joaquin Phoenix’s masterclass in acting, then this piece of work is impeccable. Phoenix will likely get awards for the role and he absolutely deserves them. His ability to tap into the descent into madness is scary in itself. The film as a whole is a very bleak, depressing and distressing outlook on the current state of humanity.  But aside from these problematic and inherently controversial aspects of the film, the huge problem with the film’s storytelling is that it insults its audience’s intelligence and toys with our perception, treating both as an afterthought.  Joker doesn’t have a plot. There isn’t a coherent sequence of events that the film presents. Instead, there’s a deus ex machina to try and make its violent conclusion make sense. Here’s the film in summation: Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is an outcast in society. Arthur Fleck has mental health challenges. No one cares about Arthur Fleck. So, Arthur Fleck becomes Joker and kills many people. That’s it. That’s the film. It’s something that could have been covered in 8-10 minutes instead of its two-hour runtime. But, Phillips’ Joker believes that it is something more important than that. It’s a movie that wants us to think that it is diving into some of the social and political issues that are currently running rampant in our country, but in actuality, it offers little and has nothing much to say.  It seems that a lot of things–from the problematic moment that shows Arthur being beaten up by a group of Latinx teens, to him learning Thomas Wayne (Batman’s father) is his father, to the city’s social services department being shut down so he can’t get counseling or his medication–are contrived solely for the purpose of drawing sympathy and justifying Joker’s eventual spiral. The origin story, retconning Joker’s background to be the illegitimate brother of Bruce Wayne’s Batman (a child, presumably Bruce, briefly appears in the film) showed promise, but the film isn’t concerned with this as a major plot point and uses it just as an easter egg.  Throughout these thrown together, disparate events, a single Black mother, Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), appears in the film and acts as an ally to Fleck for most of the movie. After a chance meeting in their apartment building one day, they become friends and develop a romantic relationship. As we see Fleck dive deeper into mental instability, Sophie seems to have no issue with it. In fact, she loves it and agrees with everything that Joker is doing. When she notices that Arthur has been stalking her, she’s into it! The film’s only other major character is Murray Franklin, a late-night talk show host portrayed by Robert De Niro. Arthur is obsessed with the show and desperately wants to be a guest on it. It’s a character that eerily resembles De Niro’s character Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy (who was also a comedian with mental health issues)—especially when the audience realizes we’re being played.  During the weird relationship between Arthur and Sophie (a role in which Beetz is underutilized and has limited dialogue), viewers are likely confused as to why Sophie would be in this situation with Arthur. But as Arthur continues to unravel viewers are enlightened to what Joker actually is–a fantasy. By the film’s end, most of the scenes that have been presented to viewers are fabrications inside Arthur’s mind. Everything about Arthur and Sophie’s relationship is not real. The unsettling relationship that viewers see develop between the two is likely Arthur stalking Sophie, until the moment she realizes that there is a random man obsessed with her. A prior version of the film’s script had Sophie as one of the Joker’s many victims, but thankfully, that does not appear in the final version. This isn’t meant to be a takedown of using fantastical elements to tell a story. However, in Joker, none of this moves the film forward. None of this makes us think about the character or the film in a different light. What it does, however, is leave viewers confused as to what the actual point of the film is. While well-done fantasy films do trick the audience into believing events actually happened, they don’t then pull the rug out from under the audience and make them feel foolish for believing what the eyes saw. Viewers are smart enough to know that Arthur would have a diluted sense of reality but this should’ve been presented in a way that doesn’t exploit this knowledge or the audience.  Fans of the movie will liken this distorted reality to classics like Taxi Driver and the aforementioned The King of Comedy. While there are similarities, neither of these classic films were made when mass shootings were rampant. From plot to execution, they are also just better-made films.  As the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado where a mass shooting took place during The Dark Knight Rises, refuses to play Joker, and critics deride its violence, Phillips has been all over the press, complaining about how his mega-successful film is being treated, lamenting “woke” culture and what he calls the demise of comedy. It got to the point where journalists were not even invited to cover the red carpet of the film’s premiere. So, while Phoenix may be delivering an acting masterclass in Joker, it seems that his director is giving a masterclass on how to make people who were on the fence about seeing his controversial film make up their minds.  So, if that’s what Phillips wanted to say, he should have said it with his chest and just made his killer white man clown movie—without the convenient “it was all a dream!” ending—and called it a day, because Joker is not the cultural watershed moment that he thinks it is.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Set in the fictional Gotham City in the early ‘80s, Joker tells the origin story behind one of Batman’s most formidable opponents. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a morose middle-aged man who lives with his sick mother in a run-down apartment building. He makes a meager living as a clown-for-hire, which leads to his brutal beating by a group of young thieves. One of his few pleasures — if you could call it that — is the talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). Arthur daydreams of being on Franklin’s show; he also strikes up an unlikely relationship with a pretty neighbor (Zazie Beetz) he encounters on his building’s elevator. But is this romance all in his head? If only Arthur could get the world’s attention for real — but how? The film is not without visual artistry, and Phoenix’s galvanizing central performance is likely to earn him an Oscar nomination. Yet Joker seems like little more than the bitter vision of an obnoxious, brooding teenager in arthouse clothing, as obvious as the on-the-nose soundtrack cues of seemingly every pop song featuring a clown. Exhibitors have expressed concern that the film’s violence will inspire real-life incidents, but it’s hard to imagine this dreary picture leading to much action of any kind, at the box office or on the streets.  Opens Friday, Oct. 4, at area theaters, including the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center ($15), which is the only theater in the Washington area where you can see it on 70-mm film.  With a title that seems like a 180-degree pivot from Joker, First Love may come across as an antidote to blockbuster nihilism, and in some ways it is. But if you’ve seen anything else by prolific director Takashi Miike, you might wish he’d had a crack at the star franchise. The romance is hatched when Leo (Masataka Kubota), a small-time boxer, meets Monica (Sakurako Konishi), a young woman who has been sold into prostitution to pay off her yakuza father’s debt. Given a dire medical diagnosis, Leo believes his days are numbered; he acts boldly to rescue Monica, which pulls him into a brutal underworld conflict between high-end drug dealers and corrupt police. In the middle of this blood-drenched mayhem, the young couple falls in love. Miike, who has directed more than 100 feature films, may be best known for the 1999 thriller Audition, which seemed like a benign story of finding love through the personal ads before it took a tortuous turn. While the director has made more straightforward genre pictures, such as the excellent 2017 samurai film Blade of the Immortal, First Love gives Miike a chance to flex his more playful side, and its inventiveness makes you hope he can crank out another 100 movies.  October means scary movies, and the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center is indeed hosting the 14th annual Spooky Movie International Horror Film Festival from Oct. 3 through 6. While the programming has been erratic in the past, this year’s slate, according to the Washington City Paper, may be one of the strongest yet.  One Cut of the Dead, an inventive 2017 horror comedy from Japan that became a hit on the festival circuit, probably won’t frighten you, but it’s worth its running time in chuckles. The movie begins in the middle of a low-budget zombie film shoot taking place in an abandoned World War II-era factory. A hot-tempered director (Takayuki Hamatsu) can’t get his lead actress (Yuzuki Akiyama) to show enough fear. What the cast doesn’t know is that the director has lured real zombies to the set.  At least, that’s the first act, which consists of a single uninterrupted shot that lasts more than a half hour. But writer-director Shin’ichirô Ueda, for his first feature, has something else up his sleeve; after that long introduction, the film pulls back in an attempt to chronicle the struggles that went into making the zombie movie. The result is more entertaining than the undead. The payoff doesn’t entirely make up for the sometimes tedious setup, but that seems to be the point. One Cut of the Dead is a clever look at the massive group effort that goes into producing even the most seemingly disposable movie product.  If Joker’s Arthur Fleck is upset by a world descended into crime and incivility, what would he make of this 2010 horror comedy about a Bronx raccoon addicted to crack? Writer-director Jerry Landi began his career as a medical photographer before he started making B-movies in his native borough — see also his 2016 thriller Bronx Bigfoot.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Para empezar, la historia se enraíza firmemente a comienzos de los 80s, en una Gótica que no disimula su parentesco con la New York de la época: mugrienta, descuidada, deprimente y colmada de indigencia e inseguridad. Gótica abandona la desvanecida gloria del art deco a cambio de algo igualmente anticuado pero más burdo y sórdido. No es sólo estética: el descontento social es palpable y se protestan las políticas laissez-faire del libre mercado republicano. Hasta el oligarca principal de Gótica, Thomas Wayne, tiene un dejo reaganesco. El contexto se define vívidamente, evocando un momento y un lugar precisos que no son el presente ni podrían ser otra cosa. Pero por más discurso sociopolítico que baraje la película, su protagonista es flamantemente apolítico. No cree en nada y no representa nada, salvo una sensación básica de insatisfacción, lo cual es suficiente para inspirar un movimiento en el cual sus integrantes se proyectan a sí mismos. Es verdad en todo nivel posible: Joker es tan sólo un payaso. Rebautizado Arthur Fleck, es interpretado por Joaquin Phoenix con una corporalidad magistral. En principio es un comediante fracasado, un payaso de alquiler que vive con su anciana madre (Frances Conroy) y se nutre de delirios de grandeza en los que es gracioso y por lo tanto querido. Quebrado, amanerado, poseído por un tic desternillante y lentamente perdiendo una mediocre batalla por encajar en sociedad, su Joker es un ser lamentable; tanto más patético porque su única posibilidad de catarsis termina siendo la violencia. Sus fantasías a menudo lo tienen de invitado en el show del capocómico Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), lo cual suscita la obvia comparación con El rey de la comedia (The King of Comedy, 1983). La otra referencia clave es Taxi Driver (1976). Guasón amalgama los seminales films de Martin Scorsese, presentando un antihéroe desechado y desestimado por el más bajo nivel del inframundo en el que vive miserablemente. Su único consuelo es la fantasía y la violencia, a menudo confundiéndolas. La película se arma de referentes excelentes y rinde un muy buen estudio de personaje, aunque en su búsqueda por validarse a sí misma se parece un poco a su protagonista, que termina obsesionado con la vieja realeza representada por los Waynes (lo cual rinde una escena entre tierna y espeluznante con su futuro némesis). Guasón es de lo mejor que han aportado los cómics al cine en años, pero lo que eleva el material es la impecable actuación de Phoenix, que supera los detalles menos verosímiles o convincentes del guión y crea algo único y distinguible de las otras versiones que ha tenido el personaje. Su recorrido es tan tortuoso como plausible. Se ha inventado una suerte de controversia banal entorno a la película con la que se la quiere promocionar. No es más osada o sugestiva que un montón de películas “controversiales” que en otros tiempos ni conseguían calificación para ser exhibidas. Guasón es tan controversial como se lo puede permitir el cine comercial: es decir, incluye algo de humor negro y a veces roza el mal gusto. Nada que Joker no haría.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019",Joaquin Phoenix aces the role of 'Joker'.,POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Before he becomes anything like a “Clown Prince of Crime,” the toxic loner at the center of the vexing, Batman-adjacent Joker (★★★☆☆) is just another sad clown in the grimy, graffiti-covered city. It’s 1980, and Gotham City is fast falling to pieces, riven by rampant vice and violence, a smelly garbage strike, and even an infestation of rats. Depressed former mental patient Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is barely employed as a clown-for-hire, and caring for his invalid mother Penny (Frances Conroy), while stoking a burning passion to make it big as a standup comedian. For a clearly delusional fellow, Arthur takes a few reasoned, astute steps towards pursuing his dream — he’s just not funny. The movie amply depicts Arthur’s cringeworthy unfunniness, onstage and off, which has limited entertainment value, but allows Phoenix to further flex his singular talent for enacting social awkwardness. Imagine spending all of Silence of the Lambs with just Buffalo Bill. Not everybody’s idea of fun. Arthur reminds his critics that comedy is subjective, so maybe there’s an audience out there for him. But the fact that everyone he encounters regards him as a “freak,” or “weird,” or flat-out tells him that he makes them uncomfortable doesn’t bode well for his success as a comic. He appears doomed to fail — and then he’s made the hapless victim of a random street assault by a pack of teens. And he’s fired, lied to, scapegoated. Along the way, someone gives him a gun, and though Arthur is informed enough to know that legally he shouldn’t have one, he keeps it. Then he goes on to use it. Both a solid new origin story for Batman’s most notorious villain, and a tense psychological profile of a frightening lone gunman, Joker portrays as terrifying a version of this character as any live-action depiction has dared. However, terror also is subjective. Some viewers, as there were in our screening, will cheer Arthur on as he takes out his anger at the world on three obnoxious, harassing dudes on the subway. Onscreen, various residents of Gotham definitely cheer on the actions of the unknown killer clown, casting him as the vigilante symbol of a burgeoning so-called anti-rich movement. Arthur hears someone hail the clown, saying that thanks to him, there are “three less pricks in Gotham City.” Sure, but what about the homicidal maniac with the gun who just fired shots into the back of a dying man? Anyone old enough to know the name Bernard Goetz might feel at least ambivalent about Arthur assuming the mantle of gun-wielding antihero. And the gun violence plays out far too realistically to ignore the film’s persistent visual and historical references to real-life ’70s and ’80s New York, or to present-day take-your-pick USA, for that matter. Yet the movie judges Arthur none too harshly for picking up his gun — or scissors, if they’re handy — painting on his clown-face, and aggressively settling scores. His grievances and brutally bloody crimes are all justified by, in Arthur’s view, the awfulness of other people. The script by Phillips and Scott Silver stealth-justifies the clown’s crime spree through his inexplicable ascent from underground symbol to glorified hero of a popular movement. Any arguments about whether the character could ever influence the actions of similarly troubled souls are resolved by the film’s pointed depiction of Gotham’s growing legion of criminal clown copycats, including one Joker follower who dons his own mask to shoot and kill innocent people. In a cunning or insidious move, the film uses the sympathies of Arthur’s inscrutably nice neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) to soften him to a degree. Beetz conveys a warm, genuine quality in her turn as a single mom who’s fed up enough with this town that she might be able to look upon Arthur with respect and affection. Conroy is typically great as Arthur’s even-more delusional mom, and Robert De Niro is refreshingly sharp as the late-night TV host whom Arthur and mom fixate on inside their dysfunctional familial bubble. There isn’t a bum performance in the movie, and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s strings-laden score sounds especially attuned to every one of them. There’s even a mini-theme for Gotham’s billionaire industrialist, and potential mayoral candidate, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of Bruce. Arthur runs afoul of the Wayne family in a sad, demented, and believable fashion, that, to the film’s credit, adds intrigue to the old-hat tale of Batman versus the Joker. The spark of earned enmity could easily inspire a grownup Bruce Wayne to also someday don a mask, grab his weapons, and head out to terrorize the night. If he should ever cross a moral line in his vigilante crusade, would he have the Joker to blame? ""It really started just as a Twitter joke,"" recalls filmmaker Vera Drew, of her boldly creative comic book movie spoof The People's Joker, a passion project largely inspired by the Oscar-winning 2019 Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix.

"Oct 3, 2019","There's much to commend in Phoenix's performance, and the screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver allows ample room for Arthur's inner fantasy life.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," The
smartest and most troubling part of Joker
is how director Todd Phillips and Scott Silver's screenplay strips all of the
usual comic book trappings from this origin story of arguably the most famous
comic book villain. There are no outlandish gadgets, no diabolical schemes, no
city- or world-destroying threats, and, most notably, no hero waiting in a cave
or atop some roof to save the day. Here,
the villain, who's the protagonist of this tale, just has a pistol. The story
revolves around the mounting anger of a madman, while the resentment of a city,
which has had enough with the haves trampling upon and insulting the have-nots,
rises to the surface in the backdrop. As for heroes, there aren't any. There are
a bunch of useless public servants, who either don't care about those in trouble
or would rather spend the taxpayers' money on something else, and equally
ineffectual cops, who can't even catch an emaciated guy in clown makeup while
he's dancing on a long stairway. This
film doesn't want the comic book stuff, although, obviously, it has to possess
it to some degree. It lives with the man who will become the Clown Prince of
Crime, the archnemesis of Batman, who's still just a rich kid living in a
stately manor at this time. For
most of the story, the future Joker is just poor, mentally ill Arthur Fleck
(Joaquin Phoenix), until the character's climactic, very public announcement of
his new identity. He lives in a world that looks and feels very much like New
York City of the late 1970s, but of course, because this is a specific comic
book world (that likely will fit somewhere in some future installments of a
cinematic universe), it's actually Gotham City in the early 1980s. This
dichotomyof the intentionally fictional transformed into the seemingly
realis where things get a bit tricky with the film. Phillips and Silver may
be playing within a mythology of the comics, but they're also playing with
realityraising broad issues, such as mental health and economic insecurity,
but also alluding to some specifics, such as how Arthur's first taste of murder
mirrors the case of Bernhard Goetz. It's pretty obvious that the filmmakers
really don't care about any of these things, except in the way that we'll
recognize them enough to see this as more than just another comic book movie. The
superficial trappings of the comics have been replaced with a superficial sense
of reality. How to react to this film, then, is really a battle. Can we
just accept it as another comic book origin story, despite Phillips' attempts to
bring real-world relevance to the material? Can we ignore how shallow the
story's real-world connections are? Can we accept that superficiality is just
going be part of such stories? If we can, is a rather drastic shift in look,
tone, and approach enough of a reason to overlook this film's considerable
shortcomings as a kind of social parable? Maybe the fact that this film raises
these questions and many more is enough reason to consider that Phillips' gamble
has paid off in some way. This is
mostly a character piecenot a study, because we know from the title, the
comics and other movies, and the first act exactly who this character is and
will become. Arthur, who was recently released from a state psychiatric facility
and has to check in with an inattentive social worker every week, lives with his
mother Penny (Frances Conroy). While he dreams of becoming a standup comedian
and making it big like his talk-show-host idol Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro),
Arthur works as a clown for hire. He also has a medical condition, which makes
him laugh uncontrollably in times of stress. Basically,
everything goes wrong. A gang of kids beat him in an alleyway. A co-worker gives
him a pistol for protection. Arthur brings that gun everywhere, and as a result,
he's soon fired. A budget cut to social services means he won't be able to get
his medication. Things
turn around, though, when Arthur murders three young rich kids, who harass a
woman and then taunt him, on the subway. That gives him a bit of
self-confidenceenough to woo neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and try to achieve
his professional dream. The
narrative beats of this are obvious (including a third-act twist about Arthur's
social life that's basically telegraphed the moment it's set in motion). That's
kind of a given, though, especially since the story eventually brings the WaynesThomas
(Brett Cullen), making a run for mayor, and young Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson),
unaware of a forthcoming rendezvous with tragedyinto the picture. Again, this
is definitely a comic book story, which makes the film's real-world aspirations
both easier to digest and frustrating for one reason: They really don't matter. What
does matter here is the tonedreary, angry, filled with an enfolding sense of
dreadwhich mostly frames Arthur's descent into villainy as a horrific
inevitability. As important is Phoenix's performance, which is terrifying in its
physicality (We can see the actor's bones jutting as his body contorts, almost
as if it's rebelling against or getting in sync with the twisted mind
controlling it) and discomforting in how subdued he plays a character who
usually is anything but that. The
idea of Joker serving as some kind of allegory to real-life issues certainly
doesn't pay off to the extent that Phillips seems to believe it does. Even so,
the film is different from what we might expect of a supervillain origin story
and what we've come to accept as the norm for comic book movies. In this age of
superhero saturation, different is refreshing and daring enough.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," An air of menace and a cloud of controversy accompany the arrival of Todd Phillips’ “Joker” like a thick perfume. That, in itself, could be something to celebrate. Danger isn’t a quality often found in the sanitized corporate-made movies of today, least of all in the safe, fan-friendly world of comic-book films. “Joker,” though, is a calculatedly combustible concoction, designed, like its chaos-creating character, to cause a stir. To provoke and distort. I wish it was as radical as it thinks it is. Instead, “Joker” is a mesmerizing, misjudged attempt to marry the madness of a disturbed individual to today’s violent and clownish times. It’s a shallow, under-examined movie that renders the dark descent of a troubled man with an operatic fervor. That this feels so familiar, like the backstories of countless unhinged gunmen that so populate our tragedy-filled newspapers, could be seen as a powerful and grim reflection of today. Since the film has already so stuck a nerve, perhaps it is. But conjuring psychosis for the sake of a pre-determined origin story, make “Joker” feel cavalier and opportunistic. Its danger, really, is no deeper than a clown’s make-up. The template of “Joker” isn’t anything from the comics (Phillips wrote the film with Scott Silver) but a pair of Martin Scorsese films about twisted loners: “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.” To make the point, Phillips has cast Robert De Niro, the star of both of those films, as a late-night host whose show Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), our Joker-to-be, dreams of being on. Phillips, the maker of male comedies about clung-to adolescence (“Road Trip,” “Old School,” “The Hangover”), has elevated the Joker from DC Comics villain to ‘70s-movie anti-hero. The Arthur we meet is a clown-for-hire and a wannabe stand-up. In the opening scene, he’s caking his face with makeup in front of a mirror. His smile already has a plainly forced, unnatural form. It’s the crooked outward manifestation of Arthur’s anguish. Laughter is the symptom of his heavily medicated disturbia (“All I have is negative thoughts,” he tells his social-services case worker), a product, we learn, of a childhood of abuse. To those who look at him strangely he hands a card informing them that he laughs inappropriately, like a condition of Tourette’s. We are, immediately, in a realm very far from the spandexed world of superhero movies. Where there is usually superficial shine, in the human-sized, adult-oriented “Joker” there is grit and grime. It’s 1981 in Gotham, but the fictional city has never been so unmistakably New York, home also to Scorsese’s Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin. Due to a strike, garbage has piled up on the sidewalks. Reports of “super rats” have hit the tabloids. While twirling a sign on the sidewalk (“Everything Must Go”), Arthur is harassed by a group of teenagers and then beaten and mugged in a nearby alleyway. For Arthur, everything has already gone. His life is pitiful and unrelentingly bleak. Athur lives with his mother (Frances Conroy). His tenuous grip on employment slips away when a gun, given to him by a coworker after the mugging, slides out of his pants while entertaining children at a hospital. Phoenix, among the finest actors working, is dramatically thinner here, turning him sinewy and sinister. His face and movement holds the movie together. It’s impossible to look away from an actor so fully, so hypnotically throwing himself into a character, even if there’s an acting-class self-consciousness to the whole production _ one surely indebted in spirit to Heath Ledger’s whole-body transformation in “The Dark Knight.” But Phoenix has also been better with similarly broken souls in films like “The Master” and “The Immigrant.” In close-up, Phoenix’s smiles are ghastly. He chokes on his laughter. He’s been raised to smile through pain, tragically divorcing himself from expressing his emotions. “Joker” is driven not by any outside force but the ominous sense of something bad welling up in the unloved Arthur. Having won our sympathy through endless indignities, we begin to almost root for him to lash out. When he does, one night on a nearly empty subway (a subterranean gloom pervades the whole film), Arthur has, in a troubling way, self-actualized. This is, of course, who he’s meant to be. And it’s that leap, from self-pity wallowing to wanton revenge meted out on a sick society, that has made “Joker” rightfully debated. Rather than surround Arthur’s horrifying transformation with context, alternatives or rays of light _ whether they fall on him or not _ “Joker” simply hitches a ride on his freefall in mania. There’s a moment when the film could have charted a different path toward a deeper character study. Instead, it gets on with what needs to happen, the chaos necessary to unlock, with a cold-blooded smothering and point-blank shooting. Arthur’s pain and psychosis has been offered up, in the end, not to lead to any understanding of his condition, but for its violent release, and to link to the required comic-book architecture. It’s a testament to the potency of Phillips’ vision that “Joker” has already become such a talking point. Phillips and Phoenix have made something to reckon with, certainly, and that alone makes it a bold exception in a frustratingly safe genre. But its biggest danger is in not illustrating but catering to a world gone mad. You have to ask, in the end, why so serious? “Joker,” a Warner Bros. release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images. Running time: 122 minutes. Two stars out of four.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 3, 2019"," On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. shot Ronald Reagan and three other men outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. It was later revealed he had done so to try and impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed and had been stalking around the Yale campus all year. Hinckley had seen Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” upwards of 15 times, and the shooting was his attempt to emulate Robert De Niro’s iconic psychopath Travis Bickle, who the would-be assassin considered a hero. In a sickly ironic twist that could be out of a Scorsese movie itself, this news broke while the director and star were attending that year’s Academy Awards ceremony — delayed a day due to the shooting — where De Niro accepted the Best Actor Oscar for their masterful “Raging Bull.” Scorsese and De Niro’s next collaboration, 1983’s “The King of Comedy,” obliquely addressed the Hinckley incident with a curdled take on life inside the celebrity fishbowl. In the film, De Niro’s strenuously mediocre standup comedian kidnaps Jerry Lewis’ dyspeptic talk show host as a way to jump-start his showbiz career. It’s a sour, cringingly unpleasant movie that perplexed audiences at the time but has since proven to be one of the most prescient and perceptive films ever made about America’s unhealthy pop culture obsessions. Todd Phillips’ “Joker” steals all sorts of scenes, shots and story points from “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” and mashes them together into an R-rated origin story for Batman’s archnemesis. It’s weird watching two classics of modern cinema being stripped for parts and repurposed as franchise fodder — like if the new Spider-Man movie suddenly started aping Ingmar Bergman. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a hapless, mentally ill clown who gets mugged all the time and relentlessly bullied around an early 1980s Gotham City that looks very much like the Times Square of Travis Bickle’s midnight drives. De Niro himself is on board to give a benediction, in his latter-day, anything-for-buck mode as a pugnacious late-night talk show host upon whom Arthur becomes fixated. For all intents and purposes, the first act of a movie dragged out to a little over two hours, “Joker” pitilessly chronicles all the abuses and embarrassments heaped upon poor Arthur until he finally snaps and starts shooting. As a viewing experience it’s a monotonous slog, one of those films that won’t stop patting itself on the back for being “edgy” because of all the f-words and squalor, when really it’s just another dull corporate product gussied up with adult-ish affectations and dorm room philosophizing about “society, man.” The movie wobbles under the weight of its own self-importance, carrying on as if it’s imparting some sort of serious social commentary while being extremely careful not to actually say anything at all. “Joker” arrives in theaters this week atop a tsunami of hype — the picture quite preposterously won the Golden Lion at last month’s Venice Film Festival — and under a dark cloud of irresponsible media prognostications regarding possible audience unrest. Multiplexes are ratcheting up security measures as news outlets keep citing the 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting on opening night of “The Dark Knight Rises” as if there haven’t been several “Batman” movies that have passed without incident since. Yet still, somehow this is all anybody keeps talking about, to a point where if “Joker” doesn’t end up inspiring a Hinckley it won’t be for the press’ lack of trying. Yet at the same time, it’s hard to imagine anyone being motivated to do anything besides snore during this wan copycat of a movie, almost entirely comprised of borrowed parts from better pictures. Arthur’s moments with his mother (Frances Conroy) are nearly identical to some of Phoenix’s scenes in last year’s stunning “You Were Never Really Here,” itself a reworking of “Taxi Driver” to far more productive ends. Phillips even swipes the bit from Frank Miller’s seminal 1986 comic “The Dark Knight Returns” in which the Joker goes on “Late Night with David Letterman,” but fumbles what he did to Dave and Dr. Ruth. (The movie also misses an easy opportunity to skewer its star’s rather colorful history with talk show appearances.) Joaquin Phoenix is one of the two or three greatest actors of his generation, and this is easily one of his worst performances. A collection of tics that includes a Tourette’s-like tendency to cackle at inappropriate moments, it’s all string-bean physicality and gimmicky stunts. We never see a soul inside of Arthur, so there’s no tragedy to his psychic disintegration. Like the movie itself, his Joker is just a series of empty poses. Even the cinematography is massively overblown, every shot art-directed within an inch of its life like the “urban blight” section of a designer catalog. (Warner Bros. has struck 70mm prints that will screen at the Somerville and Coolidge Corner Theatres, which calls to mind that old saying about putting a silk hat on a pig.) Meanwhile, the extent of the corporate cowardice can be seen in how gingerly this “Joker” side-steps the subjects of racism and misogyny — central motivating factors for most violent loners who lash out, yet in this Gotham City, neither issue even exists. (Think back for a moment to “Taxi Driver,” in which Travis Bickle’s repellent racism was so foregrounded Scorsese cast Harvey Keitel in the role of Foster’s black pimp to try and take it down a notch.) For all the film's blathering about “society,” it isn’t engaged with one remotely resembling our own.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," 
Make no mistake, Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most talented and empathetic actors currently working in Hollywood. He has a penchant for portraying a certain type of character, one that bursts with the unruly sympathy of a soul wrestling with life, and filmmakers have utilized his strengths (they are legion) thusly. From PT Anderson (The Master, Inherent Vice) and Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) to Gus Van Sant (Donât Worry, He Wonât Get Far on Foot), Phoenix is a master of a very specific kind of person; call it a lost soul, call it a neâer-do-well, call it oftentimes an inadvertent avenging angel.
 
Which is why it was just kismet that an origin story on the Joker, Batmanâs biggest foil for 80-plus years, should land in Phoenixâs lap. But Todd Phillips (The Hangover films, and Roadtrip with Tom Green), along with co-writer Scott Silver, has gone dark. And by dark, I mean not too dark in this saga of Arthur Fleckâs transformation into a supervillain. There is a very overdetermined trajectory that maps out the transformation from Arthurâs trials to his blossoming as Joker. His mother, Penny (Conroy, always nice to see) is ill, and he is grappling with mental illness, and thus begets the beginning of a supervillain.
 
But wait, letâs run down a few things (spoilers to follow, if you really care). To wit: Arthur has a girlfriend (Beetz) who doesnât exist, Robert De Niro plays a talk show host that ridicules Arthur's stand-up act, and the world (mind you, in some early Eighties template that is in itself a boilerplate representation of the strife of marginalized white people) is going mad, but Phillips and co. have basically morphed Martin Scorceseâs Taxi Driver into a superhero movie. But they wonât call it that. And when Frank Sinatraâs âThatâs Lifeâ plays to Phoenix dancing down a stairwell, becoming the manifestation of who he will become, it feels completely empty, a nod to some kind of gravitas that this film really strives for, but never, ever gets. Itâs DC Comics playing rough, but not rough enough, but maybe thatâs too much to ask. Where is the fucking Hellblazer movie already.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Atípica, mugrosa, lumínica. Así es Guasón. Que no incita a la violencia, ni vanagloria o glamoriza a un personaje que se convierte en un asesino, serial o no. ¿Qué es Guasón? Una película brutal sobre un personaje que sufre, y sufrió, en carne viva el desprecio, el maltrato, la burla de una sociedad en decadencia. Que es la que muestra el filme de Todd Philips, un aspecto que muchos parecen olvidar, o al menos obviar. Arthur Fleck ansía ser un comediante. Prueba suerte en un stand up, pero no todos entienden su humor. “¿No tendrías que ser gracioso para ser comediante?”, recibe de parte de alguien que debería apoyarlo en vez de inquirirlo. Aquí, la risa no es remedio infalible. Arthur, que sí tiene un trastorno mental, y sufre una extraña enfermedad por la que se ríe en momentos inoportunos y no puede impedirlo, se gana la vida como un payaso, en distintos eventos o presentaciones. Puede promocionar rebajas de un comercio, o animar cumpleaños infantiles. Se le hace cuesta arriba. Como subir esa empinada escalera en la calle para ir a su hogar. ¿Hogar? Una casa que se habita puede o no ser un hogar. Vive con su madre. Y hay algo oscuro, perturbador en quien ha sufrido bullying ya de pequeño, una historia no muy clara de abusos y de paternidad. “Ya no quiero sentirme tan mal”, dice el protagonista. Ese pedido de ayuda no será escuchado o interpretado por nadie. Ni por la asistente social que lo trata. “¿Es mi idea o está peor ahí afuera?” La película transcurre en una ciudad en la que el todopoderoso es Thomas Wayne -el padre de Bruce, luego Batman-, quien se postula como alcalde. Pero Guasón no tiene a Batman como contrafigura -OK, hay un guiño al batitubo- . No es una película de superhéroes, sino de un villano, o mejor, de un tipo que terminará siendo vil. Por lo que es, por lo que fue, lo que padeció y por cómo lo que lo rodea influyó en su sensibilidad. En su ser. En sus sentimientos. Por eso, Guasón seguramente será malinterpretada o incomprendida por quienes busquen una de superhéroes. Guasón no puede incluirse en el universo de DC Comics, por más que su personaje sea el villano más conocido de todos los cómics. Las referencias al cine de Martin Scorsese que marcamos hace unas semanas, son claras y laten en muchos momentos de la proyección. La trama en la que Arthur Fleck, como Travis, se ve metido y donde encuentra una única salida tiene alusiones aunque no citas, porque Philips no homenajea sino que toma prestado, a Taxi Driver y a El rey de la comedia. O no en vano habrá llamado a Robert De Niro para el personaje del host, el conductor de ese talk show que Arthur tanto admira. Pero Guasón no sería lo que es si no tuviera a Joaquin Phoenix en el 99% de las tomas. Aquí hay que hablar de interpretación, de composición de un personaje. Y hasta de apropiación. La transformación que va teniendo Arthur impresiona, y Phoenix lo trabaja con el cuerpo, sí, pero miren la expresión de sus ojos.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Rooted-in-reality comic book movies are nothing new, but no studio has committed itself to making one as authentically realistic as Joker before. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s greatest nemesis, the film is more character study than franchise film, a psychologically rich portrait of a mentally ill loner that just happens to take place in a world that will one day yield a cowl-wearing billionaire vigilante. If Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning take on the character in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Night was pure id, Phoenix’s take builds a credible cause-and-effect framework for the character’s eventual nihilism, his eponymous alter ego ready for his close-up only in the movie’s final minutes. In this film, which is set in a crime-infested Gotham City clearly modelled on the punky, lawless, pre-gentrified New York of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Joker is a would-be stand-up comic called Arthur Fleck whose day job as a clown-for-hire is complicated by a neurological condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at inopportune moments. Phoenix uses this malady to add poignancy to the self-pitying tears-of-a-clown motif, accentuating Arthur’s alienation. Arthur can’t relate to the world, but in the context of this film, his off-kilter laughter is no less bizarre than the forced bonhomie of the studio audiences chuckling along to the corny routines of Murray Franklin, host of the nightly TV talk show on which Arthur fantasises about appearing.  Scorsese fans will recognise the clear nod to The King of Comedy here, something made explicit by Robert De Niro’s casting as Franklin and the delusional Arthur’s similarity to the fame-chasing sociopathy of Rupert Pupkin. They’ll recognise too the debt the film owes another Scorsese/De Niro classic, Taxi Driver, especially as Arthur’s kicked-around status starts boiling over from fantasy to actual violence after he becomes fixated on Bruce Wayne’s father and the way the rich seem to disregard people like him.  Indeed, director Todd Phillips (hitherto best known for The Hangover movies) is nothing if not a good student of this particular cinematic era of not-going-to-take-it-anymore discontent. In addition to Scorsese he riffs on Sidney Lumet’s Network and William Friedkin’s The French Connection, setting the scuzzy tone with a propulsive foot-chase that echoes the Gene-Hackman-as-Santa-Claus opener of the latter. In Phoenix, though, he has a performer capable of helping the film transcend its many influences. Like the flip-side to his bearish, hammer-wielding vigilante in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Phoenix’s Arthur is a fat-free freak with mummy issues, his dancer-skinny frame contorting itself into uncomfortable-looking shapes that reflect his misbegotten status in society and his unconscious – and eventually very conscious – desire to be seen. That also makes the film feel very much of the moment, not because Joker acts as any kind of call to arms, but because the irony of its title character’s condition reflects the reality of a world in which absurdity is no laughing matter.  There’s something appropriately (albeit unintentionally) low-rent about Judy, the new Renée Zellweger-starring biopic about Judy Garland. Zeroing in on her 1968 London residency the year before she died, it’s another film about the dark side of stardom, picking up her story when she was effectively homeless and hawking her wares around the nightclub circuit for pitiful fees. As such, the film’s obvious budget shortfalls reflect the story being told on screen, with Zellweger lending proper Hollywood sparkle to a production that seems a little beneath her. She’s good, though, and to his credit, director Rupert Goold works with what he’s got, emphasising the mirage-destroying reality of the entertainment machine with flashbacks to Garland’s teen years as a studio-shackled starlet on the set of The Wizard of Oz. But the pulling-back-the-curtain metaphor only takes the film so far. Zellweger makes it work, but it never really transcends its stage-play origins. Officially sanctioned histories can be hit or miss affairs, with penetrating analysis sometimes sacrificed for access. The Berry Gordy approved Hitsville: The Making of Motown is unashamedly hagiographic in this respect, but having Berry, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and many of the other key players lay out the story of his legendary record label in their own words alongside some incredible archival footage feels like a valuable trade-off – a way of getting this on film for the ages before its too late.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," 
	Origin stories are currently in a “Before They Were Evil” phase, explaining – if not exculpating – some of our culture’s most noteworthy baddies. Maleficent argued that the villain of Sleeping Beauty wasn’t such a beast, and the forthcoming film version of the musical Wicked will put a positive spin on the witch from The Wizard of Oz. 
	In Joker, it’s the turn of Batman’s most enduring foe, the exuberantly psychotic jester last played by the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. In that portrayal, the character spurned analysis: “I just do things,” he whined. Joker, on the other hand, painstakingly scrutinises the woes of the rent-a-clown Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in its campaign to mitigate his subsequent misdeeds. No moan is left unturned: he’s plagued by mental-health issues, beaten in the streets, framed by a workmate, stuck with a sick mother (Frances Conroy), humiliated when he performs stand-up, abandoned by the health-care system and left to rot in an early-1980s Gotham City inundated with rubbish from a refuse strike. The film hurls everything at him short of a stubbed toe. 
	Arthur’s response is to laugh. With one bony hand clutching his throat he gives a heaving, mirthless rasp that suggests he’s about to cough up a fur-ball. Then he fights back. Viciously assaulted by three businessmen on the subway one night, he opens fire and becomes an anonymous folk hero, graduating from class clown to class warrior and inspiring “Kill the rich!” headlines. 
	The film-makers haven’t grasped that this is not how the cycle of resentment usually works. A real-life Arthur wouldn’t slay stockbrokers; he’d pick on those more powerless and vilified than he is – ethnic minorities, immigrants, the homeless. A cleverer film might also have shown the mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of the future Batman, redirecting the mob’s rage against a nebulous elite, as so many populist politicians have done. 
	It may seem odd to complain that Arthur isn’t sufficiently vile, but that’s only one area in which the director Todd Phillips has failed to learn from his most obvious influences, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, two Scorsese movies also concerned with nobodies who use violence to achieve notoriety. Robert De Niro, the star of those pictures, plays Arthur’s reptilian TV idol, though the suggestion that Joker has anything more in common with Scorsese’s work is the biggest joke of all. Phillips wallows happily in images of urban sleaze. Subverting our sympathies in challenging ways, however, isn’t within his skill-set. 
	When the film holds together it is down to Phoenix, who reflects Arthur’s turbulent inner landscape in every facial twitch and bodily contortion. In Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, there was more of his bulk and his beard than the screen could contain, but in Joker his painted face is pared back to its tendons and ligaments, his forehead carved with deep grooves, his ribcage bursting through his skin as though there’s another person in there trying to get out. 
	While the script makes Arthur pitiable, Phoenix preserves his humanity. He must be the reason Joker won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival last month – he’s good enough to make the movie seem better than it is – but even he can’t make his character consistent. In a comedy club, he laughs in all the wrong places and scribbles clueless misspelled notes (“sexy jokes alwase funny”) but still somehow brings basic timing to his own vaudevillian routine. So does he have a functioning sense of humour or doesn’t he? And how does a TV producer obtain a recording of his club act in this pre-smartphone age when video cameras are the size of cereal boxes? These are the questions an attentive script editor might have asked. 
	Despite its resemblance to New York, Gotham City is a fictional world with its own rules, though that doesn’t make it any less incongruous that the ringleader of the attack on Arthur happens to know all the lyrics to “Send in the Clowns”  from A Little Night Music. A love of Sondheim may well be compatible with hooliganism, though a likelier explanation is that the director can’t resist an ironic song choice. Sinatra’s breezy “That’s Life” gets a look-in, as does Nat King Cole’s “Smile”. The use of Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2” during one of Arthur’s sinister slow-motion dance routines may be a twisted in-joke about the devil getting all the best tunes, though in this case he also gets the royalties. 
	Phillips’s deployment of sorrowful cellos and a sickly colour palette proves definitively that he is tired of being known as the man behind the Hangover trilogy. But there is a middle-ground between throwaway humour and enervating miserabilism, and even those of us averse to superhero antics may feel cheated that there are no glimpses of the super rats which we are told have been running amok in Gotham City, let alone a little mano a garra combat. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  In “Joker,” Joaquin Phoenix and writer/director Todd Phillips summon their darkest mojo for a descent into madness, making the supervillain origin story to beat all origin stories. Forget comic books — this is disturbingly too close to modern alienation to be dismissed as mere fantasy. This doesn’t mean the film condones and incites violence, as some fear. If you feel anything for Phoenix’s damaged title character, it’s because of the actor’s superb performance, which graphically expresses the toll that untreated mental illness exacts upon individuals and society. Make no mistake: “Joker” is extreme, as were Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy,” which provide serious inspiration for Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver. They’ve brought aboard Robert De Niro from those earlier films, recognizing the psychic links. They’re also signalling, along with having Phoenix in the title role, that “Joker” is a serious departure from the fratboy antics of such earlier Phillips movies as “Old School” and “The Hangover” franchise. Previous movie versions of Batman’s cackling nemesis, the ones played by Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson and Jared Leto, were scarred from the outside by chemicals and razors. The scars are on the inside for Phoenix’s Joker, who is only tangentially connected to the “Batman” saga. That’s unless we count the 52 pounds the actor lost for the role, and perhaps we should. He looks cadaverous, a mass of bones and sinew held together by greasepaint, hair and sweat. Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, a children’s entertainer and erstwhile standup comedian, struggling in the garbage-strewn Gotham City of 1981 (a.k.a. New York City). Arthur lives with his aging mother (Frances Conroy), who used to work for wealthy Gotham mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Thomas has a family connection “Batman” fans will readily recognize. Arthur is trying to live some version of a normal life. He initiates a romance of sorts with his neighbour, a single mom named Sophie (Zazie Beetz). But this is not a love story. The world keeps conspiring to throw Arthur off balance. So does the form of Tourette’s he has, whereby he cackles maniacally at random, often prompting violence from people who think he’s laughing at them. “Forgive my laughter: I have a condition,” reads the card Arthur apologetically hands out, to little avail. He gets little help from a social worker (Sharon Washington) who coldly informs him that the subsidies the city provides for his mental-health counselling and medication are ending. That’s like telling a geyser not to blow, or telling someone not to use the loaded gun you’ve just handed them. The only person Arthur truly looks up to is someone who looks down on him: TV talk-show host Murray Franklin (De Niro) who, if he makes you think of Jerry Lewis’ condescending funnyman in “The King of Comedy,” has pressed the right buttons. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” Arthur asks. “Joker” makes you fear the answer to that question, but don’t blame the movie for ringing the bell on society’s fire. Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder. If you do not yet have a Torstar account, you can create one now (it is free).",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," Throughout Batman’s long history, the Joker’s been played by some pretty mighty performers. Standouts include Jack Nicholson, who pretty much hijacked Tim Burton’s “Batman” (1989), and Heath Ledger, who won a bittersweet, posthumous Oscar for his deeply felt portrait of derangement in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” (2008) – and let’s not forget the comic genius of Cesar Romero during the 1960s TV series. Nolan and Burton felt like the right hands to shepherd a dark superhero/villain origins tale, but Todd Phillips, with such swinging steak comedies as “Old School” (2003) and the “Hangover” films to his credit? Odd as it may seem, it’s a somewhat logical evolution from drunken vomit awakenings to blood-splattered foyers with a panicked dwarf who can’t reach a chain bolt to escape. The real reason Phillips’ “Joker” succeeds is simple: Joaquin Phoenix makes the anti-antihero psycho-saga all his own. There’s also the script by Phillips and Scott Silver that plays with the Batman mythology artfully without getting bogged down in the bigger picture – though we do briefly see Bruce Wayne at a young age, when dad and mom are with us – but without Phoenix, I don’t think “Joker” takes flight. It’s a bravura go, and Phoenix should be right up there at year’s end (like Ledger was) with Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio when Oscar nods are called out. With maybe the exception of Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” (2000) it’s hard to find a movie in which Phoenix doesn’t shine with brilliant quirk and dour doses of menace. He delivers all that here and more; it’s a total immersion. For the part of clown turned Gotham icon and sociopathic perp, Phoenix lost a ton of weight, something done with equal austerity by Christian Bale (who took up the bat cowl for Nolan) in Brad Anderson’s “The Machinist” (2004) or, inversely, when Robert De Niro added 50 pounds as Jake LaMotta in “Raging Bull” – and if as on cue (send in the clowns), the Martin Scorsese-forged actor shows up in “Joker” as beloved late night TV show host Murray Franklin, whom Arthur Fleck (the Joker’s birth name) and his not-quite-all-there mother (Frances Conroy, excellent in the small complicated part) watch religiously. At the screening of “Joker” I attended, one impatient viewer shouted out, “I didn’t pay good money to see this shit!” when Arthur breaks into a prolonged, uncontrollable laugh before his case worker. Well, for one thing, that joker didn’t have to pay for the free screening; and more to the point, these are some of the subtle seeds Phillips and Phoenix are trying to lay without saying “Hey, Arthur has a neurological condition like Tourette’s!” We get to all that and Arthur’s unenvious origins (matters of mental illness are delicately layered in and hopefully won’t be lost), but folks who want ka-pow, wham! are going to have to wade through a very deep character study before the blood, guts and mayhem comes – and yes, it comes in torrents. When we meet Arthur, he’s working as a clown, living at home with mom with dreams of becoming a stand-up comic – a lot feels borrowed from the Scorsese-De Niro “The King of Comedy” (1982) collaboration. Things don’t go well. A pack of kids kick his ass, and he drops a gun on the floor during a hospital performance for ailing cancer kids and gets fired. The transformation from Arthur to Joker happens on a subway train when three Wall Street types menacing a young woman and beating on a clown-faced Arthur until he puts caps in all their asses. I’m not sure if Phillips and Silver were going for it, but it feels eerily like a take on the Bernard Goetz case from New York’s, dangerous, filthy 1970s and ’80s. And speaking of New York City parallels (it’s circa 1980), Gotham’s got a long-brewing trash strike, just like the one that stank up New York in 1968. The aftermath of the shooting brings the kind of mixed reaction Paul Kersey got for gunning down bad humans in “Death Wish” (1974), including a riotous, eat-the-rich “resist” movement and the elevation of an aristocratic Thomas Wayne (Bruce’s dad, played by Brett Cullen, who had a small role in Nolan’s “Dark Knight Rises”) who comes out against the perceived class violence and launches a run for mayor. Portrayals of Bruce’s dad have always been all over the place; here he’s got the bluster of Trump and the countenance of a subdued Alec Baldwin (who has been making his bread and butter aping the Donald on the network that used to host “The Apprentice”). As the film rounds its final bends, Phillips and Silver go off the tracks in their over-leveraging of other films. It’s not homage, it’s butchery. The lifting of the two-finger trigger to the head from “Taxi Driver” (1976) is a grotesque and unnecessary absurdity. Less violating is the theft of several iconic scenes from “The French Connection” (1971), but you feel the filmmakers are so obsessed that they forget they’re making a film. Thankfully, Phoenix is there to hold the hodgepodge together, though even he gets lost when the Joker’s acts go from understandable angst acted out to bloody plot points. I thought Takashi Miike’s “First Love” would be the bloodiest, grimmest thing I would drink in this week, but I was wrong. Sadly (big downturned red grin), Phoenix gets undercut by handlers who don’t know how to end a film. They took a dark, alluring backstory and twisted it into “Suicide Squad” (2016) silliness.

"Oct 3, 2019"," Joker is too cowardly to be provocative. Anchored by a committed Joaquin Phoenix performance, director Todd Phillips imagines a Gotham City where everyone is desperate, and you can practically smell an ongoing trash strike. Joker has always been Batman’s primary antagonist, and since he has no adversary here, the film amounts to little more than a series of grievances. Joker steals more from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, Scorsese’s terrific meditations of loneliness and despair. The trouble is that Phillips pulls his punches, so his film needles the audience, daring you to be upset about it. This is the cinematic equivalent of bullying. Phillips and longtime cinematographer Lawrence Sher do not present Gotham as an urban hellscape. Instead, this city is reeling from decades of neglect. You could say the same about Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), a clown-for-hire who barely keeps it together. Phoenix is known for his physical transformations and this is no different. Here he is, sinewy and emaciated, and his face contorts in uncomfortable ways: Fleck suffers from a condition that causes him to laugh at inopportune moments, and he chokes his way through one cackle after another. Fleck has little support in his personal life. His mother (Frances Conroy) is ailing from an unspecified illness, and she may be delusional. He relies on social services for medication, but his case worker tells him funding has been cut. Left with few prospects, Fleck fantasizes about a better life. He sees talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) as a father figure, one who helps him launch his stand-up career. The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver shows how all these parts of Fleck’s life fail him. Only a newly acquired handgun gives him any sense of self-worth. At just over two hours, Joker feels longer than its runtime. This is because Phillips keeps turning his attention away from plot developments, instead opting for yet another slow-motion sequence where Fleck dances to a tune only he can hear. These shots are no substitute for psychological depth, and nearly all the scenes with dialogue portray Fleck as a victim. His mom lies to him, strangers are mean to him, and nothing is his fault. Phoenix’s performance is an impressive feat of physical strain—Fleck is unlike past iterations of the popular character—except he only shows his commitment to the performance instead of having us connect to it.  When Fleck finally springs into action, killing three businessmen on a subway, Phillips frames the scene to suggest that Fleck had no choice, that he was pushed into it. Later on, after Fleck fully transitions into Joker, Phillips uses cheap physical humor to rob grisly violence of any serious moral reckoning. But between all the mayhem and antihero glorification, Phillips does not want us to forget that we are still watching a superhero film. There is a subplot involving Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), Bruce’s father, who is not a billionaire philanthropist, but an impatient businessman with little sympathy for the little guy. His arc dovetails Arthur’s in a way that’s depressingly predictable, as if Phillips dutifully crosses items off an origin story checklist. Another minor character is Arthur’s neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a would-be romantic interest. Like Thomas Wayne, that subplot resolves in a way that lets Fleck off the hook. The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver did not shy away from how their antiheroes related to women. Joker is too timid for that because, underneath all the grittiness, Phillips would rather have fun than think about his subject. A more rigorous film would further explore Fleck’s darker, dormant impulses, rather than settling on his mental illness and persistent victimhood. The trouble is that kind of curiosity would require a consistent point of view, and Joker prefers the facsimile of provocation over the real thing.  We don't have one.

"Oct 3, 2019"," In “Joker,” Joaquin Phoenix uncorks a laugh that can take several years off your life. His character, a beaten-down professional clown named Arthur Fleck, is robbed of his dignity multiple times a day, and to each insult he responds with a distressed mechanical cackle. It’s supposed to signal gaiety; it only broadcasts Arthur’s misery, his distance from other people, and coursing beneath it all, his rage. By the end of this ponderous, grimly mesmerizing film from director Todd Phillips (the “Hangover” movies), Arthur will have morphed into the Joker, the pasty-faced pulp villain and Batman nemesis whose origin story this is. If the Marvel/Disney comic-book movies tend toward the chromium brio of the “Avengers” series, the DC superhero movies purveyed by Warner Bros. have taken their cue over the years from the 1986 revisionist graphic novel “The Dark Knight Returns,” and they are very dark indeed. “Joker” is the culmination of that approach, a slab of self-important pop-culture masonry whose only bright spot is the figure dancing brilliantly along its top. Phoenix always brings existential weight to his performances, and here he uses that slow-moving melancholy in powerful and moving ways. The publicity materials say he lost 50 pounds for the role, a fact that is relevant only in the way Phoenix uses Arthur’s gauntness — the ribs that stick out like a shipwreck, the arms awkwardly akimbo — as the physical manifestation of the character’s alienation. The movie takes place in a Gotham City that is essentially Manhattan circa 1977 — garbage strikes and graffiti, a mood of dog-eat-dog survivalism — and Arthur is the ultimate victim at the bottom of the urban food chain. Kids steal his signboard and beat him up. Women look at him and quickly look away. As a clown, he’s more scary than funny. So, yes, “Joker” functions as an homage to/remake of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver,” minus the complexities but with other period-appropriate elements folded in: “Death Wish,” “The King of Comedy,” New York subway shooter Bernie Goetz. Even Robert De Niro is here, a direct referent to Scorsese-land, as Murray Franklin, the genially corrupt host of the late-night talk show that Arthur watches with his shut-in mother (Frances Conroy) and dreams of appearing on. All this footnoting and nudge-nudging only serves to exhaust a viewer, because it never comes to a point other than to show us, hey, this is how the Joker got started. As a vision, it’s second-hand. “Joker” nevertheless suckers a viewer in with a sense of clammy dread, propelled by the central performance and by Lawrence Sher’s diseased but detailed camerawork. The film could be occurring solely in its antihero’s head and in a sense it is. As Arthur acquires a pistol, carries out his first spasmodic acts of violence, and feels a thrill of power run through his veins, the film rattles along a subway track that may or may not be the same one the rest of the world is riding. Certainly his burgeoning relationship with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), the single mother down the hall, seems too good to be true. And while a mid-movie revelation of Arthur’s parentage might satisfy his and the fanboys’ need for closure, the script by Phillips and Scott Silver is smart enough to know things are rarely that easy. “Joker” has a reliable cast: De Niro and Conroy; Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives sniffing around; Brian Tyree Henry (“Atlanta”) and Glenn Fleshler (“Billions”) in small roles; lesser-known actors briefly glimpsed as young Bruce Wayne and his parents. Few of them are given anything interesting to do beside hit their marks and push the martyred Arthur further along his Pilgrim’s Regress. This is especially true of Beetz’s Sophie, for reasons I can’t divulge, and it’s a little ironic that De Niro has been miscast as everyone’s favorite TV uncle at a time when he’s receiving some of the best early reviews of his career for “The Irishman,” an actual Martin Scorsese movie. For all the hype that has been erected around the movie by studio flacks and an excitable fan-base, “Joker” has very little there there aside from Phoenix’s high-wire performance. As Arthur morphs with violence and confidence into the Joker, he occasionally drifts into a balletic dance — a dreamy, eyes-closed soft-shoe of triumph. It’s a bit that riffs off the late Heath Ledger’s Joker in “The Dark Knight” (2008) — a generational landmark of a performance — but that in Phoenix acquires a deeper, more inconsolable madness. This Joker has a ruined poetry to him that makes his victimhood seem a badge of honor and his homicidal urges seem a just, if horrifying, form of retribution. Which is a far simpler state of affairs than, say, “Taxi Driver,” and one more easily misunderstood. Despite the setting, “Joker” is very much a movie of our moment; it speaks to the way tenderized souls in callous times can be warped or bullied into the worst possible version of themselves. But it’s also a singular failing of the times, our popular culture, and this movie that that worst self comes costumed as a supervillain, a figure only the naive won’t admit is just another kind of superhero. Arthur’s eerie dance is supposed to unfold to music only he can hear, but it sings out loud and clear, no matter what the people who made “Joker” believe.",NEUTRAL

 The villains are the best part of Batman movies and the Joker is the best Batman villain. So the existence of the film “Joker” makes all the sense in the world. Director Todd Phillips (who is best known for comedies like the “Hangover” trilogy) takes the novel approach of crafting his own origin story for the Joker, a criminally insane psychopath in white greasepaint. Set in what appears to be 1981 (based on a theater marquee in the film touting that year’s “Zorro, the Gay Blade”), “Joker” is essentially a Martin Scorsese character study a la “Taxi Driver.” And just to drive home that point, Phillips cast Robert De Niro in a key role. It’s also the first entry in the new DC Black series, which will offer standalone films that aren’t part of the (muddled) DC Extended Universe. Working with co-writer Scott Silver, Phillips took some inspiration from the 1988 graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke” and, visually, the Joker character looks similar to artist Neal Adams’ version from the early ’70s “Batman” comic books. A young Bruce Wayne appears in the picture, but Batman does not. There have already been several portrayals of the character on the silver screen, including Jack Nicholson (wildly overrated), Heath Ledger (Oscar-winning) and Jared Leto (utterly ridiculous). Joaquin Phoenix tackles the role in “Joker” and he takes a deep, committed dive while doing so. In a performance that’s easy to admire but not necessarily to watch, Phoenix throws his full body into the Joker, a man named Arthur Fleck who barely makes a living as a clown for hire and aspires to be a stand-up comedian. According to a card he hands to a stranger on the bus, Fleck has a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at times and Phoenix portrays those fits as pained, almost strangulating outbursts that last too long. The storyline traces Fleck’s descent into madness and Phoenix creates a man who dips in and out of reality and abruptly swings from delicately, wordlessly dancing along to a song in his head to spiraling into a murderous rage. He lost 50 pounds for the role and spends a significant amount of screentime shirtless and contorting his frame into pretzel-like poses and stances. In a key scene, Fleck guns down three financial bros who were hassling him on the subway and inadvertently pitches Gotham City into a full-fledged class war, complete with rioters taking to the streets in clown masks. It’s easy to compare to Christopher Nolan’s excellent 2008 film “The Dark Knight,” as it shares many of the same themes. One major difference, however, is that “The Dark Knight” was grim and compelling. “Joker” is just grim. The social commentary of “Joker” is laughably one-dimensional and Phoenix’s Fleck isn’t that scary. Really, he’s more sad than anything. He’s a mentally ill man tossed aside by society, abused by his family and left with nihilism as what he thinks is his only escape. “Joker” also gets repetitive – Phillips spends too much time letting Phoenix squirm and mince for the camera – and feels much longer than its 122-minute running time. Oh, and one trait Phillips shares with Nolan is that he doesn’t know how to end a movie, either. The last 15 minutes of “Joker” feel like a cinematic Minnesota Goodbye that overstays its welcome and finally wraps with an odd and unsatisfying closing scene. Related Articles

"Oct 3, 2019"," Guasón (Joker, Estados Unidos-Canadá/2019) / Dirección: Todd Phillips / Guion: Todd Phillips, Scott Silver / Fotografía: Lawrence Sher / Edición: Jeff Groth / Música: Hildur Guðnadóttir / Elenco: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp / Distribuidora: Warner Bros / Duración: 121 minutos / Calificación: apta para mayores de 16 años con reservas / Nuestra opinión: excelente. Sí, es el Guasón. Y sí, aparecen referencias –escasas y hasta elegantes– a Batman. Pero esta no es una película de cómics y superhéroes; tampoco de supervillanos. El director Todd Phillips hizo una ""película de cine"": quizá suene raro, pero este emprendimiento truculento, grotesco, vital y mortuorio está hecho con cine, con dolor y gloria y con pasión y deseo verdaderos. O, mejor aún, mentidos con el arte del cine, cada vez más olvidado en una industria llena de modos nerds, corporativos y, sobre todo, de cobardías extremas escondidas detrás de lanzamientos en modo agresivo y militar. Guasón ofrece, prima facie, las texturas más evidentes de Taxi Driver y El rey de la comedia, de Martin Scorsese, pero hay mucho más: luz alejada de cualquier laqueado brillante, fobia al minimalismo melifluo y perezoso, narrativa briosa pero segura de que no necesita fingir velocidad, energía podrida y modos cortantes, violentos, ásperos y contundentes; algunas de las claves de los setenta, la mejor década del cine estadounidense. Cada golpe, cada choque, cada tiro, cada mueca es aquí lacerante y conmovedora porque Guasón, con su parafernalia discursiva obviamente obvia –un decorado más–, va más allá de lo que se lee en su hipnótica superficie: el director de ¿Qué pasó ayer?, Old School y más comedias había ya demostrado que era un realizador osado y valioso con esas películas. No hay un nuevo gran director con Guasón, ya lo había. ¿Qué pasó ayer? sorprendía, descolocaba, el humor estaba salpicado de formas extrañas, desplazado, no surgía en los momentos tradicionales, los que uno espera según la construcción más clásica de los gags, o según el armado de las secuencias de crescendo cómico. Era un humor agazapado, un humor monkiano (por Thelonious Monk), un humor que atacaba de formas imprevistas. Todo eso puede aplicarse a Guasón, en la que el humor es tan extraño como en ¿Qué pasó ayer? pero está, además, en modo de guerra, porque estamos ante un director que no renuncia al humor. Guasón está cargada de chistes que a veces no hacen reír porque hace reír el chiste de al lado, o porque la negritud del ambiente está trabajando para otros temblores asociados, o para que entendamos que las risotadas del Guasón son la última protesta ante un mundo que le pide explicaciones al cine cada vez que intenta ser cine, un mundo que está por matar a la comedia de tanto reprimirla. Y la comedia reprimida, claro, suele terminar en tragedia. Y a veces, como es el caso, en comedias trágicas inolvidables y hechas con sangre, inteligencia y convicciones. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Oct 3, 2019","Purported to be a significant commentary on the social ills of our time, JOKER only exacerbates the appeal of violence to individuals who are drawn to its dark and disturbing content.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","Despite Phoenix's riveting performance, I cannot recommend this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," At this point, it feels like any actor who wants to play the Joker—arguably the most famous comic book villain in history—can take a crack at him. At some point in the not-to-distant future, it may become as common to play Joker as it is for an actor to dive into Hamlet or Jesus or, let’s be honest, Batman. But the result so far has been an array of portrayals that have run the spectrum from cartoonish to anarchic lynchpin. Although I don’t think it’s possible for me to ever consider any portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime more devastating than Heath Ledger’s in The Dark Knight (although Cameron Monaghan’s work on the “Gotham” series was also quite remarkable), the more humanized version that Joaquin Phoenix gives us in Joker is extraordinary for different reasons. Let’s first get this out of the way: Joker is not the type of film that is inherently dangerous, and I can’t believe I have to say it. It absolutely does not glorify or excuse terrible behavior, but what it does is remind us is that monsters are not born, they are made. Screenwriters Todd Phillips (who also directed) and Scott Silver give us their version of Joker in the form of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), who is a depressive oddball from way back. Through the course of the film, we discover that he was abused as a child (something he seems to have blocked out as an adult), and in different ways, he was abused as an adult by the world around him. Again, the film isn’t giving Arthur’s terrible behavior a pass or an excuse, but at the same time, it’s important to know the elements that blended together to make the perfect storm of evil. Arthur seems harmless enough in the beginning. Set in the early 1980s, Joker gives us a portrait of an underweight party clown with a slightly dated wardrobe, an unhealthy pallor, and an affliction that makes him burst out laughing at the most inappropriate moments. It sounds funny, but he laughs so hard at times, he almost chokes or throws up—it’s meant to seem painful to Arthur, and he clearly isn’t happy even when he’s giggling maniacally. Phoenix portrays Arthur as a man able to care for his elderly mother (Frances Conroy), who is obsessed with writing letters to the richest man in town, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), whom she used to work for years earlier and believes will help her and her son if he only know what squalor they lived in in Gotham City. Arthur suffers one indignity after another—he’s beaten up on the job and he’s berated by his boss at the clown talent agency. He finds solace in a few places, however. He befriends Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a young single mom who lives down the hall with her daughter, and it seems like they hit it off. He has his passion for becoming a stand-up comic, and although we only see a bit of his overly rehearsed routine, we can tell that’s not going particularly well. He’s also obsessed with TV talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), and fantasizes about his comedy career leading to a guest spot on the program—another sad delusion added to the already long list that Arthur carries with him everywhere. Even if you ultimately loathe Joker, it’s difficult for me to believe that you can’t find some value in the film, whether it’s Phoenix’s superbly unnerving performance or the way Phillips and his team capture the gritty quality of Gotham City on the brink of collapse—from crime, garbage strikes, the presence of something known as “super rats,” and so on. But then things escalate in large part due to a terrible choice Arthur makes when he is harassed by three drunk Wall Street (or Gotham’s equivalent) dude-bros on the subway. What he does changes everything, and the citizens of Gotham (who aren’t millionaires) take notice. What’s worse, they seem inspired by it, and the common people's attitude toward the rich turns ugly. Here is something else Joker isn’t: a Martin Scorsese movie. Yes, there are elements of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (right down to Arthur’s trademark red suit) that certainly inform what Phillips is doing, but he’s hardly the first filmmaker to lift from Scorsese, and the overall look and tone of the movie benefit from the connection. It’s as fascinating to see how he borrows from these two key works as it is to see how he deviates from them. It’s been reported that Phoenix lost around 50 lbs. to play this part, and what that has done to his body is shocking and essential to the character. When Arthur commits his first act of violence, he’s sure he’s going to suffer paralyzing guilt, but after a time, he realizes that he enjoyed the satisfaction of bloodshed and does a strange, celebratory dance that seems to practically push his bones through his skin as he contorts himself in this ballet of blood. The weight loss also makes Phoenix’s face more pliable, more capable of expressions that seem ridiculously sinister, even when that isn’t his intention. My biggest issues with the film have nothing to do with its messages or the impact the film may have on the world at large. Without giving anything away, I was most disappointed with the last 20 minutes or so of Joker, as Arthur makes his final transformation into a true villain. It’s as if from the moment he decides that being bad is his true calling, the story loses value. Up to that point, Arthur has been fighting his demons. He goes to a psychiatrist, takes meds, and generally tries to better the world though humor. But as he begins to formulate the idea that that isn’t his purpose on Earth, the journey becomes far less interesting, and the film seems more about the spectacle and a splashy ending than any type of morality lesson. It's less about being a cautionary tale and more about being a traditional origin story. I’m impressed that Todd Phillips has gone from The Hangover and War Dogs to something far more layered and rich, even if a great deal of that comes from Phoenix’s performance. Still, there’s no getting around that this stand-alone effort was Phillips’ brainchild, and he was intent on keeping his Joker away from men in bat suits (which is not to say Bruce Wayne doesn’t make an appearance). Also popping in for smaller supporting roles are the likes of Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, Brian Tyree Henry, and Marc Maron, some of whom barely register. But before anyone cries about them being wasted, keep in mind, they wanted to be in this movie. I doubt very much these characters started out bigger and got cut; these are the roles they signed up to play, and they take what could have been throwaway characters and give them a little polish. De Niro may not be the greatest chat show host, but he’s actually pretty amusing as a veteran show-biz douche who gets a hold of a tape of Arthur’s stand-up routine, makes fun of him relentlessly on TV, and then is surprised when Arthur isn’t too happy about it. Joker is both a deeply flawed work as well as a mostly believable portrait of a man pushed beyond his limits into something terrible. Arthur Fleck simply didn’t have the mechanisms that many of us do to cope, and he had no choice but to give into darker forces in his brain.  As I said, the movie doesn’t make excuses; it simply lays out this life in decline and dares us to watch how it turns out. It may be too much for some, and that’s part of the point, I believe.

"Oct 3, 2019"," A comic-book movie without wit or action, Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is an origin story told as grim character study. When it’s over, you feel as if you’ve been carrying a burden; all that darkness on darkness, interspersed with brutal violence, feels like a heavy blanket on a hot night. I wanted to shove this movie aside, to be done with it. And I suppose that means it works, to a certain degree: “Joker” is an exploration of what causes a lonely, unhinged man to explode, and it has moments that are riveting. These are almost entirely due to Joaquin Phoenix’s vivid work as the title character (most famously played on screen by an Oscar-winning Heath Ledger in “The Dark Knight”). It’s a weird, eerie performance, as Phoenix’s often are; his Joker is both demented and strangely gentle, with a laugh that sounds like second cousin to a death rattle. Like Ledger, he has an uncanny way of making heavy clown makeup disappear, turning the greasepaint into a window to his dark soul. We learn slowly how Joker, whose real name is Arthur Fleck, transitioned from sad loner to murderous madman, step by step: a disorder that causes him to laugh hysterically without feeling happy; delusional fantasies of success as a stand-up comedian on a popular TV talk show (hosted by a very Johnny Carson-like Robert De Niro) or of a romantic connection with his neighbor (Zazie Beetz); a weirdly intimate relationship with his wispy, deranged mother (Frances Conroy); a city — Gotham, looking like 1970s Manhattan — beset with rats and garbage; a dark history as an abused child. All of this is overlaid with the cruelty, sometimes casual, of those around him: His colleagues at the rent-a-clown agency where he works mock him; a group of kids beats him up; a trio of suits violently taunts him on the subway. In the third case, he finally fights back. “I killed those guys,” he says later, with his curiously childlike affect, “because they were awful.” But while Phoenix is always more than watchable (his scary-Fred-Astaire dance moves, born from Arthur’s habit of watching old movies with his mother, are both mesmerizing and disturbing), “Joker” really has nowhere to go. Its characters are one-note cartoony, but fun is the last thing on this movie’s mind; it’s all despair, from its opening scenes on downward. Movies certainly have the right — indeed, the job — to explore all elements of the world they seek to reflect, including the very darkest. But “Joker,” aside from Phoenix, brings nothing new to the shadows, just elegantly filmed gunfire and blood — things we’ve seen before, all too often. ★★½ “Joker,” with Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Frances Conroy, Zazie Beetz, Brett Cullen. Directed by Todd Phillips, from a screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver. 122 minutes. Rated R for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images. Opens Oct. 3 at multiple theaters.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," Joker has what may be the best lead performance of the year, but it is not for the faint of heart. Director Todd Phillips digs deep into the shadow side of society for one of the darkest movies in recent memory. In the Batman comics, The Joker is just one of the bad guys who plagues Gotham City (albeit the most famous). And of all of the villains, he’s been a Hollywood favourite.  Directors have been taking him into darker places, starting with Heath Ledger in 2008’s The Dark Knight and, more recently Jared Leto in Suicide Squad.  But both of those movies had the Joker as a player in an ensemble set in the Batman comic universe.  And even the more serious Dark Knight wore its comic book roots on its sleeve.  There’s a mayoral election as well, with the ultra-wealthy Thomas Wayne, father to young Bruce Wayne, leading the pack. He’s not seen as a friend to the people.  She encourages his ambitions, telling him she nicknamed him Happy because she believes he was born to bring joy to people. Together they watch TV, especially a live late-night talk show fronted by a grim comedian named Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Fleck’s greatest hope is to become successful enough as a comedian to be a guest on his hero’s show. Fleck is a guy who has been raised with no advantages in a city where the rich get richer and the poor do what they can, who has been trying to live as normally as possible, while focused on his seemingly unrealistic show business goals.  He’s had problems in the past and so meets regularly with a social worker.  He shows up prepared for their meetings, he seems to be playing ball. But she’s more administrator, than therapist, and barely veils her distaste for him.  That’s where we start to see, in his reaction, hints of what really lies inside him. But, still, Fleck keeps things in check.  And then a series of things happen to him that start to wear down his facade. Provoked and aiming to protect a vulnerable woman, he commits a shocking crime.  In a violent, pitiless town, the barrage of betrayals  and that moment where his own violence is unleashed, take their toll. And what emerges is a Joker unlike any we’ve seen before. Rather than being an obvious base for a franchise, he wanted to make a film inspired by a different time in American filmmaking and was particularly inspired by two of Martin Scorsese’s movies, Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.  Joker is in many ways an homage to those films. At the same time, Phillips hasn’t simply made a replica.  By setting this in the past, before Bruce Wayne has become Batman, Phillips has kept Gotham’s cartoonish bad guys out of this.  Instead, we have a much more complex story, of a man who’s genuinely motivated to be as good as he knows how to be, and has that eroded in ways that we can see and understand. It’s easy enough to see him as a psychopath. But Fleck is a person who descends into his madness for reasons we can see and perhaps even understand.  There’s another stream to this film. Fleck commits his act of savage violence while wearing his clown make-up. That oddity is interpreted as an act of rebellion by Gotham’s disenfranchised to wear clown masks in solidarity, and then commit acts increasingly violent civil disobedience. We are, of course in Gotham, not the real world. Gotham is a city that is a dystopian version of New York, and a version of humanity working at a heightened-reality level of antagonism and violence. And yet, in a time in our history where people feel deep divisions, the movie is perhaps a little too close to home for comfort.  In Joker, he disappears into Fleck and takes him from a dutiful son, to a confused man, to the psychopathic Joker character in a seamless arc. When he finally becomes Joker, Phoenix does a dance down a staircase, as if all burdens of the world have been lifted off of him.  He has been released, and is embracing himself with a kind of joy that belongs to the damned. It’s a glorious performance and a terrifying moment in a film that revels in its dark heart. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," The year’s biggest disappointment has arrived. It emerges with weirdly grownup self-importance from the tulip fever of festival awards season as an upscale spin on an established pop culture brand. Last year we had Luca Guadagnino’s solemn version of Suspiria, and now it’s Joker, from director and co-writer Todd Phillips: a new origin myth for Batman’s most famous supervillain opponent. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a pathetic loser and loner in Gotham City, some time in the early 1980s. Arthur is a former inpatient at a psychiatric facility but is now allowed to live with his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in her scuzzy apartment. Poor Arthur has a neurological condition that means he is liable to break into screeching laughter at inopportune moments. He has a crush on his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and pines to be a comedian, hero-worshipping cheesy TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But he can only get a job as a clown in grinning makeup and floppy-toed shoes twirling an advertising banner outside a store, where he is bullied and beaten up by young thugs passing by. One day, after the humiliation and despair become too much to bear, Arthur gets hold of a gun and discovers that his talent is not for comedy but violence. Phillips has already directed a film featuring a brilliant unfunny-funny figure with learning difficulties: Alan in The Hangover, played by Zach Galifianakis, that strange dysfunctional figure who mispronounces the noun “retard”. I wonder what Joker would be like with Galifianakis in the lead. Well, the casting of Phoenix indicates more clearly how sexy Joker is supposed to be. There is great production design by Mark Friedberg, some tremendous period cityscape images by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and a strong performance by Phoenix, though not his best – it is not as good as his appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master. The film holds your attention up until Joker’s terrible revenge bloodbath on the subway early on, perhaps intended to echo the notorious Bernhard Goetz shooting of 1984 – although Phillips prudently makes it a non-racist attack. After this, the film loses your interest, with tedious and forced material about Joker’s supposed triggering of an anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement with protesters dressing as clowns. Joker’s own criminal and serial-killer career bafflingly fizzles. The film makes reference to movies from around the drama’s era, such as the Death Wish films, The French Connection and maybe even Star Wars, but it’s more obviously a laborious and pointless homage to the Scorsese/De Niro classic The King of Comedy with a bit of Taxi Driver, which means that at various moments it’s a bit like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, only not as good. The connection is signalled by the casting of De Niro himself, but it is nonetheless unearned and pedantic, especially compared to Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here, also starring Phoenix as a loner living with his mom, which managed the connection more adroitly. The whole idea of the malign clown should be very relevant. We live in an era of trolling, incels and internet bullying. (The grisly Milo Yiannopoulos described himself as a “supervillain” on his now cancelled Twitter bio.) There’s nothing wrong and everything right with engaging with all of this – and the “copycat” row is a red herring. But, perhaps because online aggression is difficult to dramatise, Phillips understandably wanted his film to be set in a pre-web age. Yet he cheats an anachronistic quasi-YouTube moment into his story when a video of Arthur’s catastrophic attempt at standup comedy somehow emerges. (I wonder if there wasn’t an earlier, contemporary-set draft of the script.) This Joker’s genesis is determinedly mature and uncartoony, compared to, say, Jack Nicholson’s low-level crook Jack Napier falling into a chemical vat in Tim Burton’s Batman, turning him into the Joker with white skin, green hair and a rictus grin. (The look of DC’s Joker was originally inspired by Conrad Veidt in the 1928 silent classic The Man Who Laughs, a man whose face was disfigured into a grin by his father’s political enemies.) There is no reason why Phoenix’s elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn’t be as powerful as Heath Ledger’s mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn’t weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn’t forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019"," A relentlessly bleak tale of despair and anger, director Todd Phillips’s Joker features a blistering collection of mannerisms masquerading as emotional truths in lead actor Joaquin Phoenix’s performance, and not much else. For sure, there is mental illness, class-based rage, simmering violence brought to a sudden boil and then plenty of blood, but what does it all amount to, in the end? With all its plot points, reversals and ostensible narrative surprises underlined in heavy crayon, what passes for meaning gets lost in the sophistic philosophizing. Yes, the extreme rich are selfish and often insensitive and, possibly, evil, but so what? Who doesn’t know that, already? Still, at least it looks great, the splatter of brain matter and viscera hitting the lens with just the right lighting to make it pop. The manufactured controversy about the film’s apparent violent message gets it all wrong: Joker is not pro-nihilism, even as it portrays the origin story of a master of chaos. He’s our protagonist, but even someone paying only half attention would get that he’s deeply disturbed and not exactly a model to emulate. No, the real problem is the facile way the very real economic divisions of our world are exploited as simplistic plot contrivances. Based on a comic book though this may be, Phillips (The Hangover) – given the seriousness of tone and dark palette of the visual aesthetic – acts as if he’s remaking Taxi Driver, which helps explain the presence of that film’s lead, Robert De Niro, in an important supporting role, but does not excuse the vacuity of the expositional dialogue. Phoenix (so much better in last year’s You Were Never Really Here) plays Arthur Fleck, a lonely middle-aged man with an apparently incurable condition leading him to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times, whose behavioral idiosyncrasies have led to the one job he can handle, that of a street clown twirling ad signs on sidewalks. When we first see him, he’s putting on the white makeup for that gig, setting up the visual foreshadowing of the villain he will become. Jumped on the street, his sign stolen, he gives chase, getting the bejeezus knocked out of him as a result. If monster he will become, he’s a weak one, to start. Another issue that has come out in the run-up to the movie’s release is its storyline involving mental illness, but the fact that the Joker, superhero Batman’s arch-nemesis, is criminally insane is hardly new to this latest iteration. I’m no expert, but how else to explain his homicidal mania? I think, however, that what might bother some advocates is the painstaking manner in which Phillips and company lay the groundwork for the tragedy behind Arthur’s current state, as well as the empathy they ask us to feel for him, thereby perhaps implying that anyone you might see suffering through psychosis or other crisis could be a master criminal in waiting. I see it more as character development, though not a particularly nuanced one. Joining in the mayhem is Frances Conroy (Ruth Fisher from HBO’s Six Feet Under) as Penny Fleck, Arthur’s mother; Zazie Beetz (Sollers Point) as a winsome neighbor; the aforementioned De Niro as a late-night talk-show host (thereby doubling the Scorsese references with his additional connection to The King of Comedy); and Brett Cullen (River Guard) as a particularly obnoxious Thomas Wayne, father to the future caped crusader (who makes an appearance as boy Bruce). They’re mostly acceptable, though Cullen goes broad (not as much as Phoenix, however) in his attempt to really sell the billionaire baseness. As stuffed as the fat cats are meant to be, however, the cinematic manor in which they here reside is really just an empty shell that thinks it’s full. The Joker’s cackle, in other words, is but a shrill shriek into the void. Christopher Llewellyn Reed is a film critic, filmmaker, and educator, as well as Film Festival Today's Editor.

"Oct 3, 2019"," For the cultural commentariat in the year 2019, it seems, one does not simply not engage with Joker discourse. And so Todd Phillips’s Joker arrives on our screens somewhat anticlimactically after months of online wars between snobby nerds going out of their way to mock the film’s wannabe-outré marketing campaign and blockbuster nerds apoplectically defending their beloved property before having seen the movie. Then there are the thinkpieces; whether the film will be a cultural landmark reframing comic book mythology along the lines of The Dark Knight, or a rallying cry for lonely and demented incels along the lines of a twisted subreddit. Set in a 1981 Gotham full of grimy, vertiginous shots invoking the epic gloom of the likes of Sidney Lumet’s Prince of the City, and starring Joaquin Phoenix – one of our most intense and talented screen stars – this origin story for the famed Batman villain is certainly straining for a flirtation with real-world despondency. Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck is posited as the result of a profoundly sick society. He's a victim of childhood abuse who develops an involuntary pathological laugh, whose medication and therapy are defunded thanks to uncaring bureaucracy. He dreams of being a standup comedian and hallucinates grand fantasies, but finds himself constantly bullied and snaps into violence firstly as self-defence and then to punish those who mocked him. It’s not the first Joker origin story – most notably, there was Alan Moore’s one-shot comic The Killing Joke, which also pitched Joker as a failed standup comedian. But it is something of a break from previous iterations of the character in presenting him as a weak and piteous fool who knows not what he wreaks, rather than a superintelligent agent of nihilistic chaos. The movie’s attempt to depict psychosis with realism, combined with its sense of expectant, hushed-awe, event-movie gravitas, unfortunately results in something unseemly: Fleck’s collection of plausible mental illnesses becomes contextualised as a series of astounding, behind-the-curtain revelations that will inevitably result in unique criminal insanity, as if Phillips is a freakshow carnival barker inviting us to “come and see The Amazing Schiz-O-Phrenic!” There are brilliant films that pull off the balancing act between sympathising with a killer’s vulnerability and overdramatising their villainy, not least William Lustig’s Maniac, also set in the garbage pail wasteland of early 1980s NYC. There are good films that show the unpicking of a man’s psyche just as deliberately as Joker, like the Sean Penn vehicle The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Taxi Driver showed us the point of view of a loner about to snap, and The King of Comedy gave us darkly comedic commentary about a man driven delusional by the gulf between his lowly station and dreams of celebrity. Joker invokes both of these Martin Scorsese films by casting Robert De Niro in a small role, but this film is considerably more muddled. As Fleck unwittingly inspires a mass movement of clown-faced men determined to overthrow the system at large, it’s unclear whether the film is implying that his pathology is an everyman epidemic, whether it’s trafficking in iffy class politics by suggesting protestors against inequality are embittered nutcases, or whether it’s all a mess out there and everyone is seizing upon their own brand of crazy in a dysfunctional world. For all its well-mounted atmosphere and technical skill, Joker ultimately explains an iconic character through emotional pornography, and the sum of its glib philosophy seems to be that there’s a lot of dark stuff out there and that should really make you think.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019","Joker is an ambitious film, and though it just can't quite match the performances with technical prowess, it makes up for it with a compelling character study and some lofty themes.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," ¿Eres una buena persona? ¿Por qué? ¿Porque así te criaron? ¿Por qué lo exige la sociedad? ¿Porque estás obligado? Y si eres mala persona, ¿quién dice que es maldad? ¿Esa misma sociedad?  “La demencia es como la gravedad, solo hace falta un pequeño empujón” – así dice el (otro) Guasón en The Dark Knight, parafraseando otra famosa frase del mismo personaje en la novela gráfica The Killing Joke: “todo lo que se necesita es un mal día para reducir un hombre cuerdo a la locura”. Después de toda la “controversia”, los artículos,
las discusiones en internet, llegó el momento de dejar la audiencia decidir por
sí sola. Joker, la esperada película de
Todd Phillips (Old School, The Hangover) estrena lo que
aparentemente será el “Black Label” de las películas de superhéroes de DC
Comics. Si resulta o no económicamente, ya triunfó en provocar pasiones, algo
que pocos filmes del género, si alguno, ha logrado realmente. Joker llegó para redefinir el género. Esta es la película que le dirá a
todos, “también se puede hacer esto con el cine de superhéroes” y, mi mayor
esperanza, es que mejores creativos miren los personajes con nuevos ojos. El
potencial es alto. Con sus fortalezas y defectos, el mayor triunfo de Phillips
es su valentía. Él se atrevió a filmar esta película. Es cierto que no siempre consigue
concretar lo que realmente quiere decir – si es que quiere decir algo – pero el
simple hecho de intentarlo ya lo coloca entre los más destacados. Joker será motivo de muchas
conversaciones en el futuro. No vayan esperando que esto sea como Venom “en DC”, ni tampoco se traguen el cuento de que es extremadamente violenta o sangrienta. Al igual que con los universos de Tarantino, el impacto en Joker no es su violencia, sino como se reacciona a esta. Esto es un drama. Pesado. Incomodo. Difícil. Los lectores de comics conocemos muchas historias que cruzan la línea pero, rara vez alguna logra ser adaptada, y menos aún consiguen representarlas dignamente. Se necesitó una historial “original” después de todo. Arthur es un payaso de alquiler con el
sueño de ser comediante. No tiene el talento necesario para ninguna de las dos
pero, su madre Penny (Frances Conroy) le ha repetido que su objetivo en la vida
es “darle alegría al mundo”. Arthur padece de una condición neurológica que lo
hace reír involuntariamente cuando se pone nervioso. Más allá de eso, es un
tipo de esos que pone incomoda la gente a su alrededor. Todos conocemos alguien
así. Esa persona en la oficina o la escuela con la mirada muerta o los
comentarios extraños. Todd Phillips no es un director ni guionista sutil, y en ocasiones peca de ser demasiado obvio. A estas alturas deben estar hartos de escuchar las influencias de Taxi Driver y The King of Comedy, ambos filmes del gran (y superior) director Martin Scorsese. Las comparaciones tienen base pero, Phillips intenta fuertemente darle su propio toque, especialmente a la hora de desarrollar el arco de Arthur. El proceso comienza desde la presentación de
Ciudad Gótica, donde la basura se acumula en las calles, una metáfora de la
historia y el mismo Arthur. El temperamento de la gente empeora a medida que la
diferencia entre clases sociales aumenta, mientras el multimillonario Thomas
Wayne (Brett Cullen) intenta presentarse como el salvador, lanzándose como
candidato a alcalde. Y entonces está Joaquin Phoenix. En una
carrera repleta de personajes perturbados, Phoenix interpreta lo que pudiera
ser el peor. La transformación es absoluta; en pantalla nunca vi una pizca del iluso
enamorado en Her, el imprudente creyente
en The Master, ni el arrogante emperador
de Gladiator. Solo vi la criatura. Si
físicamente quedó en los huesos, mentalmente Phoenix se entregó a la demencia
en crescendo del Guasón. El tono de voz, el caminar, la risa… Los ojos. A
medida que sus crímenes aumentan, el gozo en ellos aumenta tanto como el brillo.
Phillips le da todo lo que Phoenix necesita para lograrlo; cinematografía,
banda sonora, ambientación. Desde que comienza hasta que acaba no hay duda
quien es el centro de atención. No hay mejor actuación este año hasta el momento que la de Phoenix, y dudo que llegue alguna otra. La única forma que no gane el Oscar es que se lo roben. Si te preocupaba que Joker “glorificaría” el príncipe payaso del crimen, todo lo
contrario. Esto es la historia de un tipo patético, no por sus problemas
mentales, sino por fracasar en lidiar con ellos. Arthur se deja llevar por la
corriente de sus defectos, hasta que decide convertirlos en sus fortalezas sin
importar las consecuencias en él y los demás, llevándolo a aprovechar la rabia despertando
en una ciudad. El Guasón es la representación de aquellos que aprovechan los
instintos más bajos de la masa para llevarlos a su objetivo. Joker reduce el villano a su versión más cruda. No una trágica historia a la que tenerle pena, sino una oscura crónica de maldad, directa desde la entrañas de una conciencia podrida. Es una película para hacerte sentir incomodo, con mal sabor en la boca y el estómago apretado. En una era donde casi todos los filmes se ven igual, suenan igual, y saben a lo mismo, pocos cineastas se atreven a hacer algo así, mucho menos estudios grandes.

"Oct 3, 2019"," A pungent plethora of hot-button words are being branded into the film flesh of Todd Phillips’ Joker. Be them complementary or damning, they seemingly cannot be rubbed away. An interesting debate to have is classifying which of those fiery adjectives actually talk about the film and not some external controversy, projection, trigger, or angle being spun before Joker even hits public screens. Not to be undone, this writer offers a self-appointed definitive word centered on the movie itself, one that he’s never used in a review in nine years and change. The word is gall. LESSON #1: THE DEFINITION OF “GALL” — According to Dictionary.com, the four possible meanings of the noun span impudence, severity, bitterness of spirit, and rancor. To saunter a little cruder, which is fitting for the movie in play, the Urban Dictionary defines the word as audacity, balls, or something risky. Hot damn, Joker is each one of those descriptors from both sources and then some. Joker has the gall to go an R-rated level of violence. The performers have the gall to attempt generating sympathy for a villain and show those connective actions in all of their uncomfortable cruelty. Joker has the gall to shove away the sunny glibness of what comic book movies have become today at their peak popularity. The writers have the gall to blaze a maze of social commentary trails and not borrow from any comic source. The director and studio have the gall to do all of this on the competitive film festival circuit rising to the biggest platform of release. And that all is just its general existence. Between the credits, every fleck and pore of Joker is drenched in gall as well. From an opening scene that begins with a slippery tear temporarily erasing a small streak of makeup to the final one of a fade-out coda set to Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life” that trades tears for bloody smears, the insolence escalates in a drastic manner and you cannot take your eyes off of it all. Joker is a twisted pair of narrative vines, one descending into evil and the other rising in motivated malice. The twitchiest man in Hollywood, Joaquin Phoenix, plays Arthur Fleck, a lonely Gotham City weakling living with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy from American Horror Story anthologies) and holding down the pitiful job of being a clown-for-hire. Arthur dreams of better by journaling to become a stand-up comedian bringing laughter to the masses much like his television idol, late night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, switching shoes and feet from his old Scorsese entry The King of Comedy). The gaunt sad sack plods through a 1980s urban landscape of scum and social hatred. Joaquin’s first line of dialogue, an ignored question, says it all: “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” LESSON #2: BE MINDFUL OF THE GESTURES YOU GIVE AND HOW PEOPLE TAKE THEM — Though not assigned or identified by name in the movies, the former mental patient is a card-carrying sufferer of Pseudobulbar affect (PBA). Arthur’s miswired emotional incontinence has cackling replacing crying when his feelings overcome his faculties. Too often, this is the wrong way for someone like Arthur to get noticed. He lacks many social graces and allows spoonfed optimism to talk him down. This Gotham environment also eats Arthur alive, one peck and one setback at a time. His mother’s advice of “smile and put on a happy face” doesn’t cut it and Arthur discovers the gun as a great equalizer of empowerment. When the wannabe entertainer uses it and takes lives, the act of murder liberates instead of rattles him. Beyond Arthur, his vigilante crime inspires anti-rich sentiments and protests throughout the city. Anarchy becomes what makes him smile and the tremors of which explode when the movement finds its poster boy and mouthpiece. LESSON #3: WHEN ALL YOU HAVE ARE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS — Thoughts should stop at thoughts if they are harmful. By the dynamite third act, the barrier of consideration of safety is gone with Joker. You in the audience will reach a point where you cannot assign sympathy here anymore. That’s precisely the point. Rooting for this movie doesn’t condone the character or make you a cheerleader. It makes you recognize and respect all that brave gall splattered all over the place to muster the evil nucleus. Director Todd Phillips and company put Joker in the capable hands of Joaquin Phoenix and he creates an iteration of the iconic villain all his own. For anyone who has seen any period of Joaquin’s lengthy resume, fidgets are his specialty. Rage is in Phoenix’s regular range and flips it on like a lightswitch when necessary. On paper, playing the eventual Clown Prince of Crimes is not a big stretch. This could have been as easy as Phillips getting his frequent cinematography collaborator Lawrence Sher to have the camera on when he tells Joaquin “just be weird.” However, believing it is that simple would be shortchanging the performer who methodically channels straight and convincing madness with every drag from a lit cigarette to every mood-changing and entrancing dance move. Midway through the movie, Arthur writes down a poetic nugget in his diary that reads “People expect you to behave as if you don’t.” That’s a pure and blunt parallel between the character and the actor. Watching Joaquin’s poisonous performance is maniacally mesmerizing. Joker’s artistically seedy aesthetic for moral decline and unchecked depravity creates the proper cesspool for energizing the corrupt title character. If Beale Street Could Talk production designer Mark Friedberg and The Greatest Showman art director Laura Ballinger empower the flickering fluorescent bulbs and walls of graffiti to reflect inner and outer ugliness. The complete atmosphere is made scarier by the ominous musical score from composer and Sicario series cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir. The production value rumbles all senses. Again, this too is gall. Even without drawing from a specified comic canon source, the most important question of Joker is whether director Todd Phillips and company got this character right. It is possible to be too divergent to really fly. That’s where smart audiences can skip Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, and Romero to ask what’s the core. The essence is the unfathomable enigma. We may very well have an unreliable narrator from Phillips and his screenwriting partner Scott Silver, an Oscar nominee for The Fighter. Combine the twists and turns with the balletically bizarre lead and you have the oozing mystery that fits the urban myth preserved by the graphic novels. “Scorsese doesn’t want laughs in this movie, and he also doesn’t want release. The whole movie is about the inability of the characters to get any kind of a positive response to their bids for recognition. It is not, you may already have guessed, a fun movie. It is also not a bad movie. It is frustrating to watch, unpleasant to remember, and, in its own way, quite effective.”",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","Phillips has a big idea for ""Joker,"" but he doesn't make much of a movie with it, with the possibilities of the feature more enticing than the realities of it.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 3, 2019"," There’s a lot to admire, maybe even love about what director and co-writer Todd Phillips (The Hangover, War Dogs) has done with his latest dark drama Joker. Not so much a revisionist take on the classic DC Comic supervillain as it is a reasoned, down-to-earth inspection of societal elements that could inadvertently create an all-too-human monster, the movie attempts to be a gritty look at wealth inequity, the shrinking middle class and the marginalization of mental health resources, especially in large urban multicultural metropolises. But even though his aspirations are high, and while technical elements for one of the director’s productions have never been better, I just didn’t find Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver’s (The Finest Hours) script to be complex or intelligent enough to get the job done. I don’t think it works, and for all the film’s many strengths I didn’t feel there were enough of them to make sitting through all 121 minutes of it worthwhile. Gotham is in a state of unrest. There’s a garbage strike, the populace is angry and giant “super rats” wander around the back alleys and sewers. Billionaire businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is pondering a run for mayor on a platform of cleaning up the city and putting an end to corruption. While his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), a former employee of Wayne Enterprises, claims the political neophyte is a “good man,” frequently writing him personal letters and waits patiently for a response, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn’t so sure. A low rent clown with aspirations of becoming a standup comic, he’s given up on believing politicians can fix society’s ills or that the wealthy elite care anything at all for the working poor that make up the majority of Gotham’s populace. There’s not a lot more
as far as plot is concerned. What Phillips and Silver have constructed is an
observational character study of a sad, lonely man who is growing increasingly
angry thanks to the lack of understanding, opportunity, kindness and love he
feels he deserves. There is something of an examination of mental illness and
the lack of governmental care, and there are additional elements regarding the
lingering scars of emotional and psychological abuse on the parts of parents
towards their children. Some of this is highly effective, most notably scenes
where Arthur learns about the dissolution of Gotham’s social services safety
net and the canceling of his psychiatric treatment and access to medication.
Other aspects most decidedly are not, including revelations regarding Penny and
her connection to Thomas Wayne.  What does all this mean
as far as Arthur’s evolution into the villain Joker is concerned? It’s a
step-by-step process, one rooted in 1970s, early ‘80s New York cinema, most
notably (and most obviously) the films of Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet. But
while Phillips goes out of his way to channel the visual aesthetics of works
like Dog Day Afternoon, Network, Taxi Driver, After
Hours and The King of Comedy, his ends up being only a surface level
dissection of these types of characters and this sort milieu. He doesn’t dig
into what makes Arthur tick or find a way to scrutinize the roots of the
societal and cultural ills that are helping to transform him into a cold-blooded
killer. It’s all half-baked platitudes and patriarchal stereotypes, some of
which feel so tone-deaf they border on being insulting. But not always so.
There are layers of truth that are admittedly affecting, and I appreciate that
Phillips and Silver do make a valiant attempt to analyze the state of mental
health treatment and care in the United States at this moment in time. Make no
mistake, even if the movie exists in an unstated early 1980s major city
Americana, it’s the here and now that the filmmakers are most interested in
dissecting. What happens to Arthur is an injustice, at least early on, mainly
because he is reaching out for help, going to counseling and taking his
prescribed medication. When that goes away without any warning, with no chance
to make other arrangements, that is a heinous thing that the wannabe comedian
has every right to be angry about. It also just happens to be one of the only
key plot elements that is studied with any sort of evenhanded introspective
specificity. Other than that,
though, I’m not sold on the various plot mechanics Phillips and Silver have
engineered for their dark antihero to become a brutal clown prince of crime.
While I do not have an issue with the level of violence (it’s honestly nowhere
near as indulgent or as repugnant as it easily could have been), the context in
which it is often utilized is far too glib to resonate. Arthur’s masculine
insecurities are tinkered and toyed with in ways that are more superficial than
they are substantive. The girl he likes plants him squarely in the proverbial friendzone.
He becomes the butt of the joke to a citywide Gotham audience when a disastrous
video of his first attempt at standup is broadcast on a late night talk show
host’s popular television program. He has to pay for a broken storefront sign
out of his own pocket after he’s beaten up and left in an alley in a fetal
position by a bunch of kids. It’s a lot of boo-hoo-hoo and oh-woe-is-me and
precious little else, all of it content to revel in immature platitudes with no
intention whatsoever to try and go above and beyond any of them. I can’t say I was
taken with Phoenix’s full-throttle, overtly theatrical performance. While he
certainly gives all of himself, I just didn’t buy anything it was he was doing.
Look at that weight loss! Look at the strange ways he contorts his body! Look at
how many cigarettes he smokes! Look how his aggressive outbursts come out of
places of austere stillness! Look! Look! Look! LOOK! Phillips gives him so much
freedom it’s almost as if Phoenix is just making up everything he’s doing as he
goes along without any directorial instruction or control. This isn’t so much a
creation of a fully-formed three-dimensional character as it is an energetically
flamboyant piece of performance art, hardly a positive as far as I was
concerned. The supporting cast is fine if underutilized, especially Robert De Niro as Arthur’s comedy idol talk show host Murray Franklin, the Academy Award-winning actor basically taking the Jerry Lewis role from The King of Comedy and making as much out of it as the script allows him to. But Conroy is left out to dry in a rather thankless role, while the magnetic Zazie Beetz is wasted as Arthur’s neighbor, single mother and object of affection Sophie Dumond. Granted, that she ends up being a male fantasy is somewhat the point, her involvement in the story a key ingredient in Arthur’s growing psychosis. But Phillips can’t seem to find a way to do anything interesting or intellectually stimulating with that idea, the actress left to fend for herself as she tries to figure out how her character fits inside all of this psychological chaos. Still, the moments that do work are spellbinding. A sequence where Arthur in full Joker glory descends a massive staircase leading to his apartment building is glorious, while a scene a few beats before that at the gates to Wayne manor is humorous, chilling and heartbreaking all at once. Phillips is also aided in his pursuit to set a suitably ominous and discombobulating tone by composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s (Mary Magdalene) stupendous, Oscar-worthy score, while Lawrence Sher’s (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) stunning cinematography gives the film a grungy, lived-in quality that’s nothing less than perfect. As great as all of this is, none of these attributes makes me want to rethink any of what I have written. I didn’t like the movie, and I can’t be more definitive than that. As strong as many individual pieces and elements might be, none of them come together in a satisfying way. While I do think Phillips has something to say and that it does make some modicum of sense for him to utilize DC Comic’s most famous villain to help him state it, I find that I do not think he makes these statements with memorable, thought-provoking clarity. Joker wasn’t for me, and even if I were to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight and have a sudden desire to watch the world burn that still doesn’t mean I see my opinion changing anytime soon.

"Oct 3, 2019"," This is the “Joker” America deserves, here and now. He is a villain of the dispossessed, a bad guy — like X-Men’s Holocaust survivor Magneto — with a legitimate beef with the world. Joaquin Phoenix and co-writer/director Todd “The Hangover” Phillips give us a equal parts raging id and on-the-spectrum ego, a broken, beaten-down man in an angry age and a mental health patient abandoned by a system bankrupted by tax-cuts-for-the-rich politicos, the sort of ticking bomb NRA apologists like to say “slipped through the cracks.” Repellently violent, intimately epic and powered by a performance so absorbed, hurt, confused and just “out there” that it makes everything that’s come before it in the genre just a vamp in tights, “Joker” turns every previous film in this justly maligned genre into “just a cartoon.” Phoenix, gaunt to the point where his features are a grotesque skull on a skeletal body, is Arthur Fleck, a Gotham clown-for-hire, spinning “Everything Must Go” signs, until street punks steal the sign and pummel him for wanting it back, putting on a song and dance for a children’s hospital until the moment his innate weirdness — he laughs, uncontrollably, at stress and tragedy, and has a laminated card that explains this to strangers on the street and on the subway — gets him fired from that. His invalid mother (Frances Conroy) always lectured him that “I was put here to spread joy and laughter.” But his stand-up act is the anchoring delusion of a life built on them. He can fantasize about the gorgeous young mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives down the hall, about getting his big break from celebrated talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro, taking “King of Comedy” in full circle). But Arthur is just a guy on seven medications, incapable of responding to any threat with anything more than gasping laughter in a 1980ish metropolis covered in grime, greed and graffiti. Until that fateful day, that is — his Bernard Goetz moment. That the victims are Wall Street (or whatever its Gotham equivalent is) thugs is a tipping point moment in a city and society looted by the imperious rich, bursting at the seams with the struggling working poor, the disadvantaged, the mentally ill abandoned by “the system.” Arthur’s act is “V for Vendetta” scary — to the one percent. The ruling class of millionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and his oligarchic ilk are rather like the folks fearing the “violence” this film could inspire. This is “The Dark Knight” origin as seen from the point of view of someone not a privileged vigilante. Top flight character actors Bill Camp and Shea Whigham are cops hunting for the clown who killed three guys who had it coming on the subway. Marc Maron plays the late night show producer who sees more menace in this failed-comic/object of fun than his host (DeNiro). Glenn Fleshler is a fellow clown of dubious “friendly” motives. But this is Joaquin’s show, our most dangerous actor going to the most dangerous places in a DC Comics film that so transfuses the genre as to make the entire Marvel canon seem like piffle, or at the very least, fluff. And if everybody who knows any bit of “Batman” lore knows where this is going, if the violence crosses the “repellent” line into gratuitous, if the Chaplin references (“Modern Times,” and his song “Smile”) and Sinatra notes do little to dress up an ugly age referencing an earlier ugly age, that’s all of a piece. I like to think of it as though the entire story is in the Joker’s head. If that’s the case, he must really love Martin Scorsese. It plays with the audience’s mind in an interesting way, if they never witnessed “King of Comedy” or “Taxi Driver” or many other movies. The audience deserves a movie that suspends disbelief more effectively even if it is released in the year of the garbage clown. “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy” suspend disbelief effectively. Even “Fade to Black” is better than this mess. When I don’t like something, I try to find a way to like it. It’s all in the Joker’s head. He must also like to use obvious classic rock snippets in the inner comedy of his mind. The still photographs of the movie are more interesting than the complete movie. I like your review though. It makes me feel better about it after reading the review from someone who enjoyed it.",POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019"," Why so serious Todd Phillips? With “Joker,” the director responsible for “Old School” and “The Hangover” turns his back on slapstick, irreverent comedy. And based on Phillips’ comments leading up to “Joker’s” release, the guy feels rejected, now that what launched him into the A-list has fallen out of fashion. But his answer is to upend the superhero genre with an R-rated character study of one of DC Comics most enigmatic villains.  What’s revealing is that the finished work qualifies as sort of a Shakespearean tragicomedy.  It’s a movie that comments on what is funny, while placing the story in a world that has no sense of humor. Set in an early 1980s alternate reality, we meet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) on a suburban sidewalk, dressed in a clown costume twirling a going out of business sign.  When that sign is stolen by some kids, who then give him a beating, Arthur’s employer decides to take the cost of the sign out of his paycheck.  It’s a really bad day, among many, many bad days for Arthur.  Even his fellow clowns don’t like him.Living at home with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), Arthur relies on government assistance.  He takes a lot of pills, and at one point, he says that he thinks he was happier when he was in the hospital.  His one joy is watching a late night talk show with his mother.  The show’s host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), often comments on Gotham City’s problems. And in-keeping with the movie’s comic book underpinnings, the nightly news is filled with outlandish tabloid-type stories like an invasion of giant rats. It’s here where the hard-scrabble texture woven into the film by Phillips, who works from a script that he wrote with Scott Silver, reminds us of the other movies that make “Joker” engaging.  Sure it’s easy to reference Scorsese here, but absent Tim Burton’s “Batman” and Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” “Joker” would never have been possible. And without the emergence of the comic book genre as blockbuster entertainment, this artistic experiment would never qualify as a mainstream offering. Remember, for example, Brad Anderson’s fascinating “The Machinist?” I’ll bet many of you don’t. Anyway, the Gotham of “Joker” is in chaos and wealthy, industrialist Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) has promised to rise to the occasion and save the city. Since the story is told from the perspective of Arthur, whose disturbed mind causes him to experience delusions, the viewer is constantly questioning what is real and what isn’t.  The rats might be real, but their size and number might be something only in Arthur’s imagination. So, as Arthur’s problems mount and his villainy grows, the explosion of violence that overcomes the city may not be as all-encompassing as Arthur believes. I don’t want to play spoiler, but it is enough to say that in the “Joker” universe, Arthur’s tilted way of looking at things proves to be weirdly charismatic.  His violent actions give rise to a movement of sorts that capitalizes on economic disparities and social divisions.And while the movement will excite viewers promising something beyond a profile of one disagreeable man, the problem with “Joker” is the lack of a proper foil.  If every superhero movie is only as good as its villain, the same can be said in reverse of a super villain flick, right?  Apparently, Phillips is hoping that his “no hero” approach will prove to be as nihilistically popular as Billie Eilish’s hit song “Bad Guy.”  And, given the controversy surrounding “Joker,” audiences might initially give the film a big weekend, but viewers may exit the theater with little in their stomachs.  Are we supposed to feel sorry for Arthur?  Yes, I think so, but while his backstory may explain his violent actions, it isn’t a justification. And his “watch the world burn” mentality is hardly a way forward.  While I suspect that “Joker’s” chances at being nominated for the top film awards are remote, there can be no question that Phoenix’ performance will continue to be lauded.  Here we see the Joker without his makeup, without the clown threads, and, at times, nearly naked.  Phoenix lost 52 pounds for the role and contorts his body into a misshapen incarnation of mental illness. It’s an unabashed cry for help.  When the machinations of government cut him loose, Arthur’s abandonment of medications inevitably leads to dangerous thought processes and bloody carnage.  And there’s no satisfactory way to bring things to a close.Ultimately, the message here is a call for more understanding, sensitivity, and civility.  Without it, the rule of law will be eroded.  But unlike the traditional superhero adventures that rule cinemas, unsuspecting audiences are left with a problem in search of solution, which we assume that will come in the form of a bat.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 3, 2019","  It would have been a brave, smart choice to cast Joaquin Phoenix in the next film incarnation of Batman, and he could have made the kind of bold acting choices that distinguished past Jokers Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger without worrying about the more serious grounding of the story. However, turning Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crime into the protagonist of his own movie makes it tougher for the actor to embody a destructive force of nature, and director Todd Phillips' Joker doesn't have the depth or clarity of vision to match up to its star's performance.   It's quite a performance, though, and Phoenix carries the movie by fully committing to the role of mentally unstable loner Arthur Fleck, destined to become Gotham City's greatest supervillain. For all its pretenses to gritty realism, Joker is definitely a comic-book movie, set not in New York City but in Gotham, home to Arkham State Hospital and billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of Bruce. Set in 1981, Joker is obviously influenced heavily by 1970s and early '80s cinema, in particular the two Martin Scorsese films (Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy) most frequently cited as its inspirations.   At the same time, this is a funhouse, comic-book version of those dark dramas, less concerned with tackling serious social issues than with trolling superhero fans, and distorting and perverting the stories and characters they know and love. Here, Thomas Wayne is a callous, out-of-touch one-percenter, and Joker offers reflections of other elements of Batman mythology, in a sort of perfunctory nod to the source material that the filmmakers don't seem to have much interest in. Arthur is a nihilist who doesn't care about anything or anybody, and the movie largely takes the same stance. There's no one to root for, and the only likable character is little more than a plot device for a weak, unearned twist as the movie heads toward its climax.   At least Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver don't attempt to make Arthur into a hero, although some misguided viewers may still see him that way. In the beginning, he's somewhat sympathetic, a meek weirdo not long out of a stay in a mental institution, just trying to hold down a job and care for his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). He dreams of being a beloved entertainer, but instead works as the world's saddest clown-for-hire, picked on by his co-workers and mugged by young hooligans while twirling a sign for a going-out-of-business sale. The social worker assigned to help him transition back into society barely pays attention to him, and even his mother belittles his dreams of becoming a stand-up comic.   Arthur is clearly delusional, as illustrated by his disastrous attempts at stand-up, and he has such a lack of self-awareness that it's difficult to even pity him after a certain point. He creepily stalks his pretty neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz, given little to do) and becomes increasingly prone to violence, acquiring a handgun and using it to lash out against the people who mock and belittle him. Arthur's journey toward full-on sociopathy is inevitable (and obvious to anyone who has even a passing familiarity with the DC comics character) but plodding, and the movie doesn't really erupt into nasty violence until it's nearly over.   Before then, Phillips focuses on Arthur's slow descent into further madness. But while Phoenix is suitably unsettling, with his emaciated frame and genuinely haunting laugh, Arthur isn't a particularly interesting character. Although this movie gives the Joker more backstory than any previous cinematic incarnation, it does so mostly in service of setting up plot twists, from Arthur's connection to the Wayne family to his lifelong love for TV talk-show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, playing the flip side of his King of Comedy role). Arthur himself is a collection of behavioral quirks and questionable wardrobe choices, rather than a fully realized person. He has more layers than any other character in the movie, but that's only because everyone else is completely one-dimensional.   Phoenix is still fascinating to watch, however, and Phillips knows how to mimic the surface elements of his influences, creating a grimy, volatile Gotham that could be the New York City of HBO's The Deuce or a slightly smoothed-over version of a '70s crime drama. There's a lot of style to Joker, even if it's blunt and excessive, and it certainly doesn't look like any other superhero movie. Phillips' Gotham isn't like any previous onscreen version, and it's impressive how far he pushes the movie beyond the boundaries of what DC (or Marvel) has done in film before. Joker is a genuine risk, even if the result is hollow, and its greatest accomplishment could be paving the way for more experimentation in future superhero movies.

"Oct 2, 2019"," In Joker’s climax, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), in full villain regalia having transcended his “mentally ill unemployed guy who lives with his mother” roots, sits before a large live studio audience and tells a joke. It isn’t a particularly funny joke, or a very good set-up, but writer-director Todd Phillips doesn’t seem to care if it is, or isn’t, or whatever. Phillips just seems to hate that he has to tell a joke at all.  Todd Phillips seems to hate a lot of things: woke culture and the WGA and, maybe, John Wick. He resists engaging in the discussions around his films while petulantly fueling them, blowing vape smoke onto the fires he swears he didn’t start; his previous box office successes (Old School, The Hangover, Due Date) are empty provocations that rarely age well. It’s not that he doesn’t have a point—we should interrogate the fetishization of gun violence in the John Wick movies—it’s that he doesn’t give a shit what you think about his point. Why work with a struggling screenwriter when you can write a movie with Robert Downey, Jr. in his trailer? When even the President of the WGA grins like an oaf as you take a dump in his mouth, casually insulting the industry he’s supposed to be defending? Why take responsibility for the messages surrounding his film, any film, when he can name-check Chantal Akerman and choom some sweet blackberry juul juice instead? More than any of Phillip’s previous films, Joker is a culmination of whatever worldview the director’s got, a hollow gesture toward humanity rendered in the ugliest genre contrivances he could get the studio to permit, reveling in the illusion of artistic risk. In exploring the last vestiges of civil life to which a mentally ill man clings—watching with impressive intimacy as Arthur unravels amidst losing his clown-for-hire job, his mother (Frances Conroy without much to do) and his grip on reality—Phillips finds no throughline but hate, his disdain emerging from, sewn through, the relentless gray grime of Gotham City like a rising army of folks in clown masks.  At the precipice of Joker’s transformation into the Clown Prince, as he’s starting to see the size and shape of psychopathy, Arthur confronts his City-appointed therapist (Sharon Washington), claiming that she doesn’t care about him, or about what he says, or that he gets picked on by roaming gangs of prepubescent children and mean co-workers alike. She responds brusquely, revealing that she will no longer be seeing him because the City is cutting funding, that, in fact, “they” do not care about her as much as “they” do not care about Arthur. Todd Phillips clearly does not care about them either, not about the social worker who can’t make a living while doing nothing but some of the most difficult and emotionally taxing labor in the public sector, nor about the weak and vulnerable people society’s abandoned, left with little recourse but to become subsumed into the dregs of the city’s infrastructure, or lash out facilely against its broken system. Were Phillips to observe mental illness as more than a caricature of a journaling madman, or an obvious late-film twist that cops Fight Club vibes to just make everyone (audience included) feel shittier, we might find a character to care about. On the other hand, were he to lean harder into the comic book tropes he only ostensibly references, the cartoonish villainy might be easier to embrace. His decision is to double-down on the realism, to make Gotham a seething hell hole and the toxic masculinity bred within, the vile disease at the heart of the Scorsese films he’s trying to ape, a symptom of mental illness rather than its foundation. He has nothing but contempt for anything and everything—Arthur, his therapist, rich people, poor people, the working mother (Zazie Beetz without much to do) in the apartment down the hall whose purpose is only to wake the incel from his slumber, the oppressed and the oppressors, the film industry that forces Phillips to make a superhero movie in order to actually make his dream vigilante crime thriller, the audience who wants a superhero movie rather than Todd Phillips’ dream vigilante crime thriller, the source text, comic books, safe spaces, you, me, himself probably. Joker thrums with Phillips’ hate. Viscerally, the film can be a wonder. Joaquin Phoenix is undoubtedly something to behold, his body as Arthur Fleck like a refutation to the sad, blocky menace his flesh harnessed in You Were Never Really Here. Incomprehensible angles, buzzing energy and the ever-increasing sense of a Southern dandy swagger, Phoenix’s corpus inhabits every frame like he’s clinging to it to stay upright lest he shrink into himself and disappear completely. No wonder then that the film’s only truly moving moment comes after Arthur’s first acts of violence, killing a three-pack of rich white kids on the subway: Emboldened, he hides in a public restroom to metaphorically shed his old skin, to dance balletically before the dirty bathroom mirror and raise his hands in supplication to a greater power that has bestowed upon him such a moment of grace, both in control of his destiny for once and in thrall to something churning within him out of his control. It’s a glorious moment, all of the pain in the film and Phillips’ conception of the “origin story,” as well as Hildur Guðnadóttir’s sumptuous score and cinematographer Lawrence Sher’s claustrophobic visual sense, cohering into something masterful. We are in Arthur’s head, witness to his Great Becoming. We join him in his rapture. We completely forget, too, that we’re watching a DC property. Which is probably Phillips’ intent: His take on the comic book origin story is to take it so seriously it isn’t one, to sap the genre of all the wit and originality it has at its best so that any allusions to Bruce Wayne, literal or otherwise—to his family, his birth as Batman, his best friend/ersatz dad Alfred or Arthur’s ultimate connection to his future arch-nemesis—feel studio mandated rather than integral world-building or meaningful ballast for the film’s simple plot. A man with a traumatic past and a deeply ill mother gets a shot at being on his favorite late night talk show when his pathetic attempt at stand-up comedy casts him as fodder for the talk show’s host, the weirdly charmless Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, dreadful). The man also happens to live in Gotham City, the metropolis currently suffering through a garbage strike and saturated with crime, on the eve of a new mayoral race whose frontrunner is Batman’s rich industrialist dad. The man also happens to have a “condition” reducing him to sobbing laughs at the worst moments, alienating him from everyone he meets, a condition Franklin taunts on live television, moving the plot along by stoking the man’s psychosis. It’s all beside the point—Joker, we’ve been reminded incessantly, will never connect to any version of any DC cinematic universe—so any adherence to the character or what the character’s represented reads as rote. Obligatory and joyless. Meanwhile, any commentary Joker attempts regarding class struggle is used only to plunge the film’s world into further darkness. The rich are pompous monsters who wear tuxedos to see Modern Times; the working class are husky bros ready to let a protest escalate quickly into mass murder. We watch the Wayne family wander down a dark alley as Joker’s brand of chaos begins to grab hold of the streets. We watch a thug in a clown mask take out a gun and follow them. We’re asked to once again sit through a scene from Batman’s origin story we’ve seen too many times before, a scene that exemplifies why so many directors to come before have wanted to make their own comic book movies, a scene that is and has always been held in reverence, however misguided. Phillips adds the word “fuck” to it. It’s all performative, thoughtless, the outrage of the proletariat and the threat of violent insurrection; the six or more cops who stood around doing absolutely nothing at the press screening; the undercover cops purportedly scattered throughout crowds opening weekend. Do not let anyone tell you that Joker captures our specific time, represents our specific society, both births and defines our specific zeitgeist, grabs ahold of our specific faces and breathes smoke down our throats. It doesn’t. Joker is, more than anything, fine. And we, more than anything, are not.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2019"," Directed by Todd Phillips.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Brett Cullen, Frances Conroy, Douglas Hodge, Shea Whigham, Marc Maron, Bryan Callen, Bill Camp, Josh Pais, Glenn Fleshler, Dante Pereira-Olson, and Brian Tyree Henry. Here’s a killing joke: director Todd Phillips doesn’t understand why his own origin story/character study of Joker is a masterpiece. Typically a filmmaker of lowbrow comedies (The Hangover trilogy), Phillips has steered a hard right into not just comic book films, but fearlessly tearing apart comic book lore to present a fictional 1980s society (Gotham City, as usual, standing in for a New York borough) that forces anyone that lays eyes on it to opine on the ugliest aspects of modern times. If Marvel films are escapism, DC’s Joker is aversion therapy. If mainstream cinema itself has lost its backbone and embraced unrealistic outlooks on the world, happy endings, and optimistic throughlines designed to serve as a counterpoint to the nihilism emanating from the world around us, Joker is a scintillating reinforcement that psychopaths are real, and although we could absolutely limit the damage done by them if our leaders would ever come together as a country, they will always be there whether our mental health system and politicians fail them or not. Meanwhile, Todd Phillips is throwing a temper tantrum regarding some citizens rightfully having trepidation about going anywhere near a theater this weekend (having seen the movie, I guarantee you I will be on my ass at home) due to a combination of the violence depicted in the film and real-world tragic events carried out during midnight showings of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises. He compares the violence to John Wick, which is relentlessly brutal, yes, but cartoonish and is nowhere near grounded in reality. Recently, he claims to have abandoned comedy citing “woke culture” as the reason, refusing to entertain the thought that maybe, just maybe, his raunchy work has mostly been unfunny. There are a time and a place for politically incorrect jokes, even in Joker which contains one part that elicited so much laughter from myself and others that the guy behind me expressed he was going to hell. My mind immediately seconded those thoughts. Most egregiously, he claims Joker is not a political statement, despite politicians playing a major role in the story. The movie actually opens with radio hosts talking about the decline of Gotham, as Arthur Fleck (as he is known before taking on the Joker persona) dons traditional clown makeup in preparation for his sign-twirling gig and friendly appearances to make children laugh. The only logical conclusion is that Joaquin Phoenix grasped how so much horror and injustice (often piled on top of one another in quick succession) could potentially create a psychopath that is too close to home real. Of those that do enjoy Joker, there will be two different kinds of reactions, one group will use adjectives such as “awesome” because they have witnessed something undeniably ruthless and dark that unintentionally has positioned itself to become the perfect launching point for yet another stab at a DCEU. Joaquin Phoenix is both insane and insanely good in the role (he takes just about every characteristic thrown at him ranging from laughing disorders to malnourishment to standup comedy, elevating their intensity with dangerous implications the longer the movie goes on), but I do believe this origin story will stick to a one and done deal. Still, he’s not necessary to use this as a foundation for expanding what will inevitably once again become the Batman universe. The other camp of admirers will see Joker for what it really is; a harrowing mirror of our society when it comes to America’s treatment of mass murderers as celebrities, its cynical take on the most trustworthy politicians, its takedown of the way the 24/7 news cycle responds, its bleak examination of warring societal classes, diminishing empathy from society (a feeling Joker unexpectedly shows at one highly unsettling point), and how downright disturbing its Christ-like portrayal of this serial killer towards his loyal followers during the climax. Todd Phillips is so lost as to the message of his own movie (performing double duty writing the screenplay alongside Scott Silver), that he’s denying it will incite violence despite Joker’s behavior sparking riots in the actual damn movie. Joker is incredible, but “awesome” is the last word anyone should use. Sadly, even if Joker was never a comic book creation, another figure, fictional or not, would be idolized in his place. If Todd Phillips does do one thing right as a director, it’s not holding back. Joker does indeed borrow elements from Martin Scorsese pictures (specifically, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, sometimes paying homage to the cinematography of both alongside sharing a similar setting) including a prominent collaborator in Robert De Niro, except it never feels like thievery considering a major component of the narrative sees Arthur Fleck investigating his own upbringing. Also, for enlightening and risky as that is, a few details are not given concrete answers, which should satisfy those that were seemingly against a Joker origin story. Even the most underdeveloped subplots (a rushed blossoming relationship with Zazie Beetz playing a single mother living in the same apartment complex) have fascinating payoffs that expand Arthur’s troubled psyche, so it’s only natural that the more featured dynamics (Arthur’s uncomfortably close bond with his mother) have more challenging peaks. Then there’s the anarchic ending, which is just plain inescapable to one’s memory, forever going to haunt. Todd Phillips certainly doesn’t understand his Joker film, but exhibits searing craftsmanship with his nauseating acknowledgement of the worst society has become and has to offer; a masterpiece is a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019","It's as if Phillips had a burning desire to create his own version of Taxi Driver, but wasn't sure audiences would show up, so he slapped a coat of green hair dye and greasepaint onto the screenplay to guarantee plenty of asses in seats.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2019"," There’s no better way to encapsulate the experience of watching Joker other than to call it disorienting. The film puts you in this strange state of mind, and you won’t be entirely sure what to make of it. You are essentially following around a corrupt soul who slowly slips into madness. And because you follow him every step in the journey, you begin to ask yourself: Is it OK that I feel for him? Is it appropriate that I laugh at some of the things he does or what happens to him? Joker is a film that is simply trying to elicit a response and provoke viewers. It is not what you will be expecting from a big-budget movie with a DC logo slapped on it. How the director of the Hangover trilogy (and other bro comedies) made something that is on par with Taxi Driver is utterly shocking. So prepare to be upset, offended, disturbed and amazed that a mainstream piece of art dares to go where it does. Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker sees a top-of-the-line Joaquin Phoenix portraying Arthur Fleck as he spirals into becoming one of Gotham’s greatest criminal masterminds. We watch as he is beaten in the streets and is constantly ridiculed by those around him. Whether it’s a colleague at his professional clown job or those he encounters as a failed stand-up comedian, it all feeds into the idea of Arthur becoming the next Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro’s character from Taxi Driver). He’s the kind of guy you look at and are immediately scared of because you have no clue what he is thinking or what he’s capable of. (Any long stares of him smoking a cigarette is only something Freddy Krueger could conjure up.) From the well-crafted theatrical trailers, you have a loose notion of what to anticipate in Joker. It’s reflective of not only Taxi Driver but also other Martin Scorsese properties like The King of Comedy and Cape Fear as well. It also shares character DNA with Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler and Phoenix in both You Were Never Really Here and The Master. However, Joker is dialed up a few notches on the meter. Phillips gets incredibly intimate with Phoenix’s character. He will quite often leave the camera rolling as Phoenix twirls around a room and laughs hysterically. It seems to be for no apparent reason other than to make you uncomfortable. All you want to do is run in the other direction, but simultaneously you can’t take your eyes off Phoenix. He demands your attention. You desperately want to figure him out, but Arthur is an unsolvable Rubik’s Cube. Just when you think you have all the colors aligned, the film shifts. The script, written by Phillips and Scott Silver (The Fighter), takes inspiration from other written and visualized Joker works, but it’s also its own breed of anarchy. There’s a lot to read between the lines in Phillips’ take, most notably about the rich versus the poor. It’s hard to take your eyes off “Joker” star Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Arthur Fleck as he spirals into becoming one of Gotham’s greatest criminal masterminds. Without getting too much into the details, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen, who oddly played a congressman in The Dark Knight Rises) plays a crucial role in Joker. You may know him as Bruce Wayne’s billionaire father who built a business empire that is eventually taken over by his son. In this depiction, Thomas Wayne is running for mayor of Gotham. How Phillips colors the people we recognize as heroes from other Batman stories is astonishingly complex. It’s as if the filmmaker is suggesting that heroes and villains coexist within us all. We each have light and darkness inside of us. Some tuck it away and store it in virtual closets, while others (like the Joker) wear it on their sleeves. I don’t believe the film is trying to suggest anything with that subtext. Phillips doesn’t want us to paint ourselves up like a clown and raise hell. He merely wants us to stew on the ingredients. Joker is a cautionary tale of sorts that wants us to be more careful about how we navigate our lives and treat others. If there were a platform for me to analyze Joker further, I would be here all day. I have thoughts about many scenes. That’s what ultimately makes Joker such an exceptional film. Not only does it look and sound good (the musical score and camera work deserve Oscar attention just as much as Phoenix’s performance), it’s not a clearly defined cinematic experience. We will undoubtedly be picking it apart for years to come. If you leave Joker angry, it’s a completely natural reaction to have. It was born to ruffle your feathers. Whether you get around to loving it or hating it, one thing is for sure: You will never forget it. PRESTON BARTA is a member of the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association.

"Oct 2, 2019"," Dirigido por Todd Phillips. Roteiro de Todd Phillips e Scott Silver. Com: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Leigh Gill, Josh Pais, Sondra James, Douglas Hodge, Dante Pereira-Olson, Hannah Gross, Brian Tyree Henry, Gary Gulman e Marc Maron. Solitário, deprimido, pobre e atormentado por um distúrbio neurológico que o leva a gargalhar sempre que fica ansioso, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) é um homem que, próximo da meia-idade, ainda vive com a mãe em um apartamento minúsculo e trabalha como o palhaço mais triste de Gotham City para uma agência decadente que fornece “entretenimento” para pequenas lojas e hospitais pediátricos – e a frase acima, escrita em letras irregulares em meio a uma dúzia de outras anotações confusas, pode ser lida no diário que abriga seus pensamentos e as “piadas” que concebe para um futuro show de stand-up. Sentindo-se cada vez mais incapaz de lidar com a hostilidade do mundo, ele afunda pouco a pouco no lodo da misantropia e do ressentimento enquanto caminha rumo a uma transformação que sabemos ser inevitável por reconhecê-la no título do filme que conta sua história. Abrindo a projeção com a imagem entristecida do protagonista enquanto tenta moldar à força um sorriso em seu próprio rosto – e que se torna ainda mais excruciante por se contrapor à lagrima borrada de maquiagem que deixa um rastro azul em sua bochecha -, Coringa é ambientado em uma Gotham que, no início da década de 80, encontra-se em crise graças a uma longa greve dos coletores de lixo e de uma recessão econômica que, para variar, pune a população mais pobre enquanto os ricos se mantêm confortáveis e aproveitam a situação para aumentar sua influência política (entre estes, Thomas Wayne, que se lança como candidato à prefeitura). Preocupado com a mãe doente (Conroy) e encantado pela bela vizinha Sophie (Beetz), Arthur sonha em se apresentar no programa de tevê comandado pelo comediante Murray Franklin (De Niro) e se esforça para manter algum equilíbrio psicológico através de medicamentos e das sessões com uma psicóloga/assistente social – dois suportes importantes cujas verbas públicas os políticos locais não hesitam em eliminar. Inspirando-se claramente em elementos de Taxi Driver e O Rei da Comédia (a escalação de De Niro, em particular, é um toque brilhante), o roteiro escrito pelo diretor Todd Phillips ao lado de Scott Silver estrutura a história de origem de um dos vilões mais icônicos dos quadrinhos como um angustiante estudo de personagem, indo na contramão das escalas grandiosas que estes projetos costumam empregar e assumindo um tom tão sóbrio que se torna difícil conciliá-lo com os elementos mais absurdos que se encontram no futuro do sujeito (como, digamos, um homem vestido de morcego). Esta sobriedade, por sinal, é ressaltada através de um design de produção avesso a qualquer cor mais viva, situando Arthur em ambientes dominados por tons pasteis ou, em pontos mais extremos, apenas por cinza, marrom e preto - e reparem, por exemplo, a sequência na qual o personagem-título observa a vizinha indo para o trabalho e perceberão como todos os figurantes surgem em cores que seguem esta lógica visual, acentuando o contraste com o vestido vermelho (claro) da garota. O próprio Arthur passa boa parte da projeção usando roupas de tom sóbrio (em certo ponto, a cor de seu casaco se mostra quase idêntica àquela vista em uma criança com quem conversa através de um portão, criando um paralelo fantástico entre os dois) – e esta é uma escolha importante para acentuar sua eventual “transformação” no vilão que conhecemos e que adota tons quentes e fortes que ilustram seu novo lugar no mundo. Do mesmo modo, tanto a casa do sujeito quanto o escritório de sua assistente social e o vestiário de sua agência se estabelecem como locais abarrotados e escuros, sendo que a sala de seu apartamento chega a trazer um papel de parede xadrez que, associado às grades que cercam o lobby do prédio, sugerem uma existência de aprisionamento e infelicidade. Além disso, a imensa escadaria que sempre se encontra no caminho de Arthur é um símbolo perfeito de como sua vida representa um esforço que o exaure continuamente, já que nada positivo vem com facilidade em sua direção. Esta exaustão é visível, vale apontar, no corpo macilento de Joaquin Phoenix, que quase rivaliza com a figura adotada por Christian Bale em O Operário ao permitir que enxerguemos os contornos de seus ossos sob a pele, conferindo-lhe uma aparência doente e fragilizada. A excelente composição física do ator passa também pela maneira como sua postura parece se tornar cada vez mais torta, refletindo seu estado mental, e pela risada característica do personagem, que com frequência se confunde com o choro e sempre parece terminar com um engasgo dolorido que muito diz sobre como qualquer traço de felicidade (mesmo superficial e fruto de uma patologia) vem acompanhado de sofrimento. Aliás, é revelador como, embora suas gargalhadas incomodem aqueles ao seu redor e o encham de constrangimento, sua tristeza é aceita de modo tácito, devolvendo-o à invisibilidade, o que diz muito sobre nossa sociedade. Coringa, por sinal, parece ter muito a dizer sobre a Sociedade e seus Males (ênfase no “parece”), já que desde os primeiros minutos a inquietação generalizada disparada pela greve dos lixeiros indica a existência de um barril de pólvora em busca de uma fagulha para explodir – uma função que o protagonista se mostra mais do que disposto a desempenhar e que se junta a outros componentes, como o desprezo da classe dominante pelos miseráveis (“Aqueles de nós que conquistaram algo na vida sempre olharão para os que nada conquistaram e verão apenas palhaços”, diz Thomas Wayne), o elitismo de uma mídia que defende os poderosos enquanto humilha quem pouco tem mesmo quando finge querer ajudar (pensem em Silvio Santos atirando aviõezinhos de dinheiro ou Luciano Huck forçando os participantes de seu programa a realizar tarefas para entretenimento do espectador em troca de ajuda) e, claro, a realidade inquestionável de que crises econômicas são momentos perfeitos para impor novos obstáculos para quem mais precisa de auxílio. O problema é que mesmo que cada um destes elementos encontre eco em nossa realidade, a abordagem de Todd Phillips soa como os esforços de um adolescente revoltado tentando conferir sentido ao que vê e encontrando na anarquia uma “solução” atraente – e a confusão ideológica do cineasta é tamanha que ao mesmo tempo em que culpa o corte de verbas para programas sociais pela degradação mental de Arthur (que perde acesso a suporte psicológico e a medicamentos), Phillips obviamente enxerga o papel de agente do caos assumido pelo Coringa como algo admirável, como uma resposta aceitável mesmo que sob os gritos de “Matem os ricos!” – uma hipérbole contraproducente - haja um subtexto de “Destruam tudo!” que falha em constatar como o colapso do Estado representaria o fim de qualquer esperança para os mesmos indivíduos que protestam nas ruas. Se há algum “perigo” em Coringa (e o lançamento do filme foi precedido por dúzias de artigos alarmantes e alarmistas), este será resultado do niilismo que faz parecer atraente, não de uma suposta apologia da filosofia incel, já que Arthur, ao contrário dos “virjões” misóginos, não demonstra qualquer hostilidade movida por inadequação/frustração sexual e jamais atribui seu sofrimento ao sexo feminino (e também de modo oposto aos incels, que costumam abraçar também o racismo, a xenofobia e a homofobia, o sujeito demonstra ódio pelos poderosos, não pelas minorias). Não que seja impossível imaginar algum maluco atribuindo ao filme a responsabilidade por alguma ação de violência: assim como obras como Laranja Mecânica, Assassinos por Natureza e Clube da Luta (na crítica do qual antecipei, infelizmente com correção, que algo assim poderia acontecer) já foram associadas a atos destrutivos por parte de indivíduos instáveis, Coringa é um alvo fácil para o tipo de diagnóstico superficial e tolo que muitos costumam fazer quando uma tragédia acontece. O fato, contudo, é que qualquer estímulo pode atuar como gatilho para alguém já predisposto a cometer uma estupidez; mais importante do que culpar uma obra de ficção é tentar compreender como a realidade cria estes monstros, desde o papel das redes sociais até a desigualdade econômica crescente, passando por retóricas políticas carregadas de ódio e pela manipulação inflamatória do noticiário. Afinal, é menos doloroso rotular o Coringa – filme e personagem – como algo pernicioso do que enxergar como falhamos cotidianamente em criar uma sociedade mais justa, inclusiva e, como consequência, menos brutal. Pois o Coringa real não usa maquiagem de palhaço e cabelo verde enquanto incendeia as ruas de Gotham City, mas paletós caros e sapatos brilhantes em escritórios luxuosos de grandes corporações e no Congresso nacional.

"Oct 2, 2019"," JOKER, the latest film from director Todd Phillips (The Hangover, War Dogs), is an intense character study of Arthur Fleck, the man that would eventually become known as Joker. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix (The Master, Walk the Line), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, The Godfather: Part II), Zazie Beetz (TV’s Atlanta, Deadpool 2), Frances Conroy (TV’s American Horror Story, Hulu’s Castle Rock), and Brett Cullen (42, Netflix’s Narcos).  To best describe the film, I’ll turn to the official synopsis from Warner Bros.: “Forever alone in a crowd, Arthur Fleck seeks connection. Yet, as he trods the scooted Gotham City streets and rides the graffitied mass transit rails of a hostile town teeming with division and dissatisfaction, Arthur wears two masks. One, he paints on for his day job as a clown. The other he can never remove; it’s the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel he’s a part of the world around him, and not the misunderstood man whom life is repeatedly beating down. Fatherless, Arthur has a fragile mother, arguably his best friend, who nicknamed him Happy, a moniker that’s fostered in Arthur a smile that hides the the heartache beneath. But, when bullied by teens on the streets, taunted by suits on the subway, or simply teased by his fellow clowns at work, this social outlier only becomes even more out of sync with everyone around him.” I really want to take this opportunity to review this film in a way that I don’t often get too. I understand that there has been a lot of issues with this film ranging from preconceived notions that it glorifies male entitlement and the justification surrounding the behavior of incels, to the realistic nature of the violence. That’s all I’ve been hearing ever since the film premiered at the Venice Film Festival. The social media storm that took hold of the film was so intense that I even found myself, at a point, wondering if I should even see it. However, I fully believe that in order to form an accurate opinion one has to see the movie and not rely on Twitter to form it for them. That said, I had the opportunity to attend a press screening of the film and I’m glad I went because JOKER ended up not only being my favorite film of the year, but a film that I find to be important when it comes to the topic of mental illness and how society, and the government, treat those who are suffer from it. Before I continue with this review I want to make note that just because someone is suffering from mental illness it does not mean they are violent or that it justifies the act of violence in any way shape or form.  The start of the film clues us in that Arthur Fleck, played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, is a mentally ill and disturbed individual. Existing in a world that would like to easily forget him, Arthur finds himself at the center of bullying and violence from those around him. Between taking care of his mom Penny (played by Frances Conroy ) and working as a clown, Arthur finds a sliver of happiness through comedy, becoming enamored by talk show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro). After being jumped during work, a co-worker of Arthur’s gives him a gun in hopes that it’ll protect him from future harassment. However, after visiting a children’s hospital in which his gun falls out of his pocket, Arthur finds himself fired from the job that used to bring him joy. Shortly after this, his social worker informs him that funding to the department of mental health has been cut, leaving Arthur without any resources for medication or services. He does have one shining light in his life, though, and that’s his relationship with his neighbor, Sophie Dumond (played by Zazie Beetz), who becomes a pivotal source of comfort after his mom has a stroke. However, as each tragedy is piled on top, and Arthur’s psychosis spirals even more, the pent up anger and resentment against a society that has always failed him reaches a boiling point of destruction and chaos. With Oscar worthy performances, most notably by Joaquin Phoneix, as well as Lawrence Sher’s beautiful cinematography and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s haunting score, the film packs a wallop of a punch to all senses.  Mental illness is a topic that is very near and dear to my heart. Whereas so many people have been talking about the violence that this film exhibits, not many are talking about the focus of mental health and how it is handled in society. No one should be arguing that Arthur, or any iteration of the Joker character, is a good guy, or agreeing that the actions in which Arthur is able to give retribution are justifiable. That said, the question of what happens when a system fails you, when medical attention is needed and it’s gone, where are people such as Arthur expected to turn to? As the film progresses, we watch as Arthur becomes more and more unhinged, as the lines of fantasy and reality are blurred together, painting a picture of reality that only Arthur can see. How does someone get help for that when help isn’t readily available? It’s a question that I found myself asking throughout the 2 hour duration and one that sat with me long after the credits rolled.  My great Uncle suffered from schizophrenia and was constantly moved around from different state hospitals. Even when he couldn’t care for himself, these institutes would deem him fit enough to be out in society, when that wasn’t the case. My great Uncle found himself homeless, living in subway stations and unable to truly provide for himself. That said, as far as I know, he never resorted to violence, but it painted a picture for me that showed how government institutions constantly failed those suffering from varying degrees of mental illness. Furthermore, I suffer from major depressive disorder and there was a time in my life when I could barely afford rent because I was paying $400/month for medication that I needed, a medication that I now only pay $6 for. I’ve seen how the system of healthcare and pharmaceutical companies work against those who need it the most and it angers me to no end. Does that mean violence should ensue? No, not at all. Attaching violence to those who suffer from extreme mental illness brings about a stereotype that doesn’t often help when showcasing the varying degrees of mental anguish people experience. But again, it made me wonder, how do you help people in extreme scenarios when the system that is made to care for them is taken away? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not championing the actions of Arthur. There is nothing to champion, especially as he becomes more unglued to reality. Chaos and destruction reign supreme and it’s done with devastating consequences. As his persona of Joker becomes more and more a symbol of anarchy against the rich and privileged, the happier Arthur becomes. It’s through his deplorable actions that he’s finally able to feel like he’s being seen, as though he’s not just someone to be disregarded because he’s not part of the upper echelon. This comes into effect towards the end of the film in which we see a shocking culmination of everything that has been leading up to this point. I wrestled with feeling extreme anger, sadness, and disgust at both a fictional society that mirrors the one we are living in today as well as the violence that Arthur gleefully showcases in order to be heard. There has been much comparison to the ways in which this film, and many other films before it, have paralleled the devastatingly violent actions of those responsible for mass killings. I would never deny that there are similarities, but I fully believe that this is not a film, nor a form of entertainment, that’s glorifying that behavior in any way whatsoever. If anything, I think the film is an example of art that’s pushing the envelope of discomfort in hopes that it will bring about a discussion on topics in society that need to be continuously addressed, instead of constantly ignored, such as poverty, gun violence, and mental illness.  This film isn’t meant to make viewers feel good and there were many times where I found myself feeling extremely uncomfortable, but that doesn’t take away from what I feel is a brilliant character study on the origin of a fictional character that has been showcased throughout pop culture over these last 75 years. It’s easy to say JOKER is problematic, to jump on the bandwagon without ever seeing the film, and to become consumed with the negative hype surrounding it. I mean shit, I was almost there too, but I’m glad I took the time to see the film because it’s allowed me to talk openly about topics such as mental health. All that said, I implore each person to see this film, to come up with your own opinions and to continue the discussion in a way that can bring about a positive change. JOKER arrives in theaters October 4, 2019.  As for the impressions, this film is real masterpiece, it’s really strong and deep. You leave the cinema and don’t understand: you feel sorry for main character? Do you sympathize with him? Or, maybe, Joker is disgusting to you? Perhaps in some moments the film lacks a change in rhythm, but in general – this drama leaves strong emotions. How can the brutality of the crowd give rise to a lone outsider who suffered from cruelty? I want to separately note the soundtracks of this movie. Music was written by an Icelandic musician and composer Hildur Gudnadottir, she also worked on the compositions for the TV-series ‘Chernobyl’. Music didn’t just create the background or atmosphere, it created more than half of this film. It’s only my opinion. Thanks for your review!",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," In the Batman universe, there are two kinds of darkness: the
surface-deep emptiness of the Zack Snyder approach and Christopher Nolan’s
baked-into-the-DNA aesthetic. For the stand-alone Joker, which is said
to be neither prequel nor the start of a new appendage to the franchise, director
Todd Phillips has come closer to the latter. This is a disturbing film, a
journey into the heart of a damaged man’s psychosis. In many ways, it’s more of
a horror film than an action/adventure offering. Even Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the crown jewel of the 21st century DC/Warner Brothers
cinematic catalog, traced a more traditional comic book movie template than Joker.
Within this genre, there has never been anything quite like it.  It’s no surprise that the best three comic book movies
released in the last 20 years have deviated significantly from the film-by-numbers
approach of the average superhero tale. The Dark Knight, Logan, and now Joker
have all stepped into unprecedented territory. The latter two were rated R and
one can make a case that The Dark Knight should have been. The films
have not compromised their directors’ visions for the sake of satisfying canon.
Batman and X-Men have both had so many reboots, restarts, and spin-offs that
the anything-goes atmosphere allowed creativity to gestate.  In comic book parlance, Joker is an origin story. The
main character, warped, failed comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), will become
DC’s most infamous villain: Joker, whose previous cinematic incarnations have
been portrayed by the likes of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and
Jared Leto. (Throw in Mark Hamill if you want to include voice work.) When the
movie begins, he’s a heavily medicated ex-asylum patient who is eking out a
living working as a clown. He lives in a Gotham City tenement with his invalid
mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Her existence revolves around two things: her
love of late night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and her obsession with
her former employer, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who is running for mayor. Arthur,
meanwhile, has developed an interest in another of the building’s residents,
single mother Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), and things seem to be looking up…until
the bottom drops out of Arthur’s world. Armed with a gun provided by a
co-worker, he snaps after being bullied and beaten on a subway train by three
businessmen. Off his meds, his dark nature takes over and the warped
personality of “Joker” overwhelms the remnant passivity of Arthur.  Is Joker violent? Unquestionably, yes. The violence,
however, is designed to shock and upset. It’s not there to quench an audience’s
bloodlust or satiate the desire to see “bad” characters get their comeuppance.
The body count is much smaller than in, say, John Wick 3, but each death
has more impact. Blood is the currency of Arthur’s debasement, the means by
which we follow his descent into hell. Some have worried about the “glorification”
of violence in this film, but there’s no “glorification” evident. Unlike the
average horror/slasher film, the opposite is true. Joker doesn’t ask for
or expect sympathy for the main character, but it demands understanding not
only of his situation but of the factors that lead to his gradual
transformation from a meek clown to a manically cackling murderer and
manipulator of mobs.  Joker takes place in one version of a Batman world
and, as such, we are presented with various touchstones. A young Bruce Wayne
makes an appearance, as does Alfred. Scenes take place in and around Arkham
Asylum. Joker’s final costume pays homage to aspects of his previous
appearances, with long, green hair, a clownishly made-up face, and a garishly
colorful costume.  Phillips, doing a 180-degree about face from his Hangover
films, isn’t shy about the debt he owes to Martin Scorsese. Not only does he borrow
liberally from several Scorsese films, notably Taxi Driver and The
King of Comedy, but he brings Robert De Niro (doing his best Johnny Carson
impersonation) along for the ride. Joker’s look is vintage ‘70s, although
the story transpires in 1981. (We know this from a movie marquee that
advertises Zorro the Gay Blade and Blow Out.) The period setting allows
for a semi-modern society without the advances in technology that have occurred
in the last four decades. It’s easier to tell a story like this without
computers, cell phones, and surveillance cameras on every corner.  Joker’s success is down to Joaquin Phoenix’s dedicated,
uncompromising performance. With a physical transformation to match that of
Christian Bale in The Machinist, Phoenix has remodeled his looks. The psychological
aspects of the portrayal, delivered with at least an element of method acting,
take this version of Joker to a place where only Heath Ledger has ventured. The
storyline demands more from Phoenix that mere range – he must navigate the minefield
of the unreliable narrator as well – and he never falters. I can’t say he will
be nominated for an Oscar (which, if won, would allow him and Ledger to join
Brando and De Niro as actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same
character), but he should be.  Joker represents that latest example of how the comic
book canvas, if expanded and approached with an open mind and imagination, can
be a fertile breeding ground for more than cookie-cutter action/adventure movies.
Just as there’s a place for the battles and fights of the latest Avengers
movie, there are other, less readily explored vistas for examining aspects of
the human experience. Joker ventures into the darkest of these places
and, although it may be difficult to “like” this film in a conventional sense,
it offers a powerful and unforgettable experience that few will find easy to
shake. ",POSITIVE

"Oct 2, 2019"," 	Immediately three things leap out from this opening to Todd Phillips’ Joker: first there is the mirror, a reflective space before which Fleck will often be seen struggling to adjust his private self for a world that prefers to see a different public face; second, there is more generally the prominent place given to performance, in an edgy film where it is often difficult to distinguish underlying reality from mere acted-out entertainment; and third, there is the messy texture of the makeup, roughly smeared in its different layers all over Fleck’s face, with its multiple colours made to run and bleed by a single streaking tear. Joker will also come with heavy layerings, as we watch it too, not unlike its protagonist, stretching and straining to put a happy face on its themes of personal and political breakdown, and to convert these dark materials into our own knockabout entertainment. The results, messy and confronting, do not look pretty (although Lawrence Sher’s cinematography comes with its own dizzying, reeling beauty).  Our future ‘Joker’ is already not playing with a full deck. He has a history of institutionalisation, is on seven different kinds of medication, has regular sessions with an assigned social worker (Sharon Washington), and is required to record his feelings in a journal. He uses the same journal to scribble down jokes that are in fact just as revealing of his damaged psyche. Fleck aspires to move on from his freelance clown work to stand-up comedy, and when we see him watching his favourite comedian Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) on television and imagining (in a scenario vividly realised by Phillips) that he is not only in the live audience, but summoned up on stage by Franklin to great applause, it becomes clear for the first – but not the last – time that Fleck’s fantasies and delusions are being presented on an equal footing to everything else in the film. Phillips places us centre stage in the madness, distorting our sympathies and unsettling our sense of reality.  It would be near impossible to enter Joker unaware that you are about to watch both the making and the unravelling of an iconic DC Comics villain. As aspirant Gotham mayor and former employer of Fleck’s mother Penny (Frances Conroy), the superrich industrialist Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) hovers in the background along with his pearl-clutching wife Martha (Carrie Louise Putrello) and young son Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), ensuring a connection between the film and the future Batman mythos from which it spins off. Yet that connection remains ambiguous and asymptotic, just as it is near impossible to determine this isolated, alienated figure’s precise relations to others around him, including his clown colleagues, the police, Arkham asylum and his neighbour/love interest Sophie (Zazie Beetz). Near everything that we see unfolding in this psychodrama is open to question and up for grabs – although the very worst atrocities, carefully kept offscreen, are also what we suspect may be the most difficult for Fleck to face, and therefore the most real, in this reverie of empowerment and showmanship.   In keeping with Fleck’s fracturing personality, the film too adopts multiple identities and masks. Fleck is a suicidal depressive living with his mother, much like Phoenix’s character in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here (2017). Fleck’s unhinged desire for celebrity on the comedy circuit, and the way in which his very unsuitability to the rôle will eventually win him a cult status (of sorts), clearly riffs on Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy (1982) – whose demented lead Rupert Pupkin was played by De Niro. De Niro’s presence also points to an earlier Scorsese intertext, Taxi Driver (1976), in which the actor’s Travis Bickle, when he wasn’t engaging in armed arguments with his own shadow, found his mental decline intersecting in an entirely irrational manner with a metropolitan political campaign. Likewise Fleck’s motives for pursuing the Wayne family are entirely personal, even if he keeps travelling parallel paths with a more politicised movement against the industrialist. Joker is like James McTeigue’s V For Vendetta (2005), only with an unstable manchild rather than a literate revolutionary as the inspiration for civil unrest. It is like Chris Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises (2012), only (maybe) on the side of the mob. Joker is the story about a search for fatherly approval (whether from Franklin or Wayne) in a patriarchy gone putrescent; or about learning not to be ashamed to dance in public; or about the deleterious, downward-leading nexus of cause and effect when a society favours its rich while disinvesting in public services.  Fleck’s decline coincides with a time of great societal crisis. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?”, he asks his social worker, in a perfect articulation of the film’s binary mode of storytelling. For Joker is concerned equally with its protagonist’s interiority and with the external world beyond, even if the viewer, along with Fleck himself, cannot always be sure where the one ends and the other begins. Here, Fleck’s mental illness is both metaphor and symptom of broader problems outside, forming an ugly reflection of gaping inequalities in both a fantasy Gotham and an all-too-real America (with less and less of a safety net for the 99%). Fleck is a mad antihero for a mad world, striking a chord, however unwittingly, with the disgruntled, the downtrodden and the disaffected around him – and the degree to which he attracts or repels the viewer is a measure of just how similar or different we perceive Gotham as being to the moral, social and political circumstances in which we find ourselves today.   You can certainly see signs of our present reality in this comic book dystopia. Look carefully at the first protest group which Fleck does not so much join as happen to walk through, and you will note that the demonstrators are carrying an effigy of Trump. Scrutinise the headlines of the Gotham tabloids and you will discern a reference to Wall Street. The demonstrators all wear clown masks, in what is a complicated appropriative response as much to Wayne’s on-air characterisation of them as ‘clowns’ as to the recent incident in the subway where a clown murdered three white-collar workers (whom Wayne considers part of his corporate ‘family’). If these masked men on the street represent Fleck’s ‘army’ of chaotic agitators, they have only the most oblique connection to him, and their trajectories collide with his almost entirely by accident. Fleck’s makeup, his bizarre behaviour, his anonymity, all make him a convenient avatar of exclusion and a galvanising figure (if nothing more than a figure) for those who have been deemed society’s dispossessed ‘losers’. Like the Guy Fawkes’ mask appropriated from V for Vendetta by both the Occupy movement and online disruptors Anonymous, or like the Pepe the Frog meme adopted alike by 4Chan users, the alt-right and Hong Kong’s anti-extradition bill protestors, Fleck’s clown image becomes a rallying point of generalised resistance to the system and the status quo – even if those who borrow it never have any idea who Fleck really is, or what drives him.  As viewers, we have a better idea of this, even if Fleck’s unreliable perspective obscures our impression of him. Fleck comes with a dual nature, as slippery as a superrat. On the one hand, as a victim of horrific domestic dysfunction, of cruel ridicule and physical bullying, of economic cutbacks and state neglect, he is a living, breathing cry for help (and love) that never seems to be heeded, and certainly deserves our sympathy; on the other, he is a cold-blooded killer – a proletarian American Psycho – whose violent deeds escalate quickly from being motivated by self-defence or at least revenge to something far more straightforwardly arbitrary and beyond reason (or indeed the pale). No matter whether these murders are real or mere wish-fulfilment delusion, our own response to them as viewers serves as a mirror to who we are behind the masks that we wear.  Meanwhile Fleck’s eagerness to appear on television, his narcissism (marked by all those mirrors and acts of masturbatory solipsism), his anti-establishment schtick, his connections (however tenuous) to a family fortune built on real estate and, of course, his aggressive volatility, all make him very much a man for the Trumpian age. His are the delusions of the moment – which is what makes Joker such an uncomfortable, accusatory character study, as it catches us on one side or another of Fleck’s misplaced laughter, and tries to get us all to dance to his bloody steps.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Less conventional comic book material than existential scream, Todd Phillips’ take on the legendary D.C. villain gives us Joaquin Phoenix as a hapless loser transformed by isolation and grief into a clown-faced avenging angel. This grim — as in NOT FUN — yarn unfolds not in some make-believe alternative universe (the traditional Tim Burton-ized abode of comic book sagas) but in a Gotham City that looks, sounds and seems even to smell like the dystopian NYC of the 1970s, replete with wall-to-wall graffiti and mounds of garbage thanks to a strike by city workers. Arthur  works as a professional clown (children’s parties, sidewalk huckstering) and aspires to do stand up — which is odd because he is stupendously unfunny. Street punks beat him up. When nervous — pretty much all the time — he breaks into uncontrollable laughter.  It’s actually a medical condition for which he takes an array of prescriptions.  Except that the city agency that provides drugs and counseling (Arthur spent some of his young adulthood in a mental ward) has lost its funding. Now he’s on his own. At home in a peeling apartment he feeds and bathes his aged mother (Frances Conroy); their relationship is essentially loving, but it’s pretty clear that Mom is delusional.  She insists on sending pleading letters to her long-ago employer Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), an oligarchical fascist making a run for mayor. (Yes, that Thomas Wayne, father of young Bruce, who will one day become Joker’s arch nemesis Batman.) But then Arthur has his own issues with reality. He fantasizes that he appears on the late-night talk show of his favorite TV personality, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). Movie buffs will no doubt pick up some residual vibes from Martin Scorsese’s 1982 “King of Comedy,” in which DeNiro played a pathologically inept standup comic. In the film’s nightmarish high point the newly jobless Arthur, still in clown costume, is attacked on the subway by a trio of boozy Brooks Brothers-suited young stockbrokers;  he responds with gunfire. The city’s underclass is energized by the deaths of these Yuppie scum; soon the streets and trains are clogged with mobs of disaffected copy cats wearing clown masks and makeup. Without meaning to, Arthur has spawned a movement. While avoiding a couple of police detectives (Shea Whigham, Bill Camp), Arthur tries to find some sort of order in his life. There’s a hint of an intimate relationship with the single mother (Zadie Beetz) who lives down the hall…but don’t get your hopes up. This is daring, almost self-destructive filmmaking of searing power. The story unfolds 20 years before the appearance of Batman, so there’s no hero in the usual sense. “Joker” is an origin tale that asks us to understand and perhaps even sympathize with a fiendish killer. At the same time, the film takes (or at least exploits) a kill-the-rich political stance that many viewers will find problematical. Tossing even more gasoline onto the fire are remarks by  Phillips, maker of popular yuk fests (“The Hangover”) who now says political correctness has killed comedy. His bitterness saturates every frame of “Joker.” This  unbearably dark experience is saved by Phoenix’s performance, which turns an ethical train wreck into something you can’t tear your eyes away from. Arthur Fleck is the kind of nodding, bizarro character that we all instinctively move away from on the bus…yet Phoenix makes him achingly, terrifyingly human. And it’s an amazing physical performance as well. Phoenix appears to have starved himself into a state not unlike a concentration camp survivor; he’s a writhing knot of muscle, bone and ever-building rage.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," To take a comic book character and deliver a Joker that's already been considered worthy of an Oscar and make it so again is no mean feat. This is Arthur Fleck before he becomes Joker, his backstory told through the darkest of lenses and with unflinching proximity. The physical brutality in itself is unsparing, augmented not just by that very proximity but by the emotional journey we are taking with him. Every crevice, every tear, every dance; his eyes dead, his mouth smiling, the tragic maniacal laughter which becomes so harrowing to watch and hear - it's an astonishing thing to experience on the big screen. Amidst the constructs of the genre, this film certainly has much to say. There's no question it's political and this Gotham feels deeply embedded in our times. As a standalone piece of cinema documenting the grim descent of a broken human being into madness this is visceral, confronting, uncomfortable and flawed. Gifted storytelling in places, heavy-handed when it needn't be in others, there is so very little light in the dark and there is nothing blockbuster here. Robert De Niro turns in a terrific performance as TV host Murray Franklin. Every beat is in tune with his character, with the added joy of knowing the DNA of his Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) and his Rupert Pupkin (The King of Comedy) informed and inspired the filmmakers. The relationship between Arthur and his idol Murray is a pivotal one, as Arthur's wild-eyed childhood dream of being a stand-up comic himself is reflected back through the television into the bleak living room in the dingy apartment he shares with his obsessive mother.  Did I enjoy Joker, and will you? Only you will know that and you'll of course need to see it to find out, as the trailer alone won't cut it. For me, I love my movie-going experience to be deeply memorable and there are so many moments here which will remain etched onto my consciousness forever.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Don’t mistake a “grittier” take on comic books as any less an exercise in myth-making and genre-riffing. “Joker” maylook more “real,” more like our universe, than previous iterations of Gotham City, but that’s only because the film is riffing on two genres at the same time. Director Todd Phillips (“The Hangover,” “War Dogs”) made his intentions clear before he started shooting. His new origin story for DC Comics’ cackling super villain is an homage to 1970s films such as “Taxi Driver,” “Network” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” There’s nothing coy about the references, but the movie works — in that transactional, edge-of-your-seat, worth-big-screen-prices way, at least — because Phillips has studied his inspirations well enough to recapture their particular flavor of misfit outrage. A riveting star turn from Joaquin Phoenix is equally necessary to the formula. But somehow that seemed less in doubt. His job is to embody that outrage, and he has done it well. So when we debate this film’s relationship to toxic masculinity and the “incel” movement, just remember that we’re really talking about the zeitgeist of the Scorsese generation of (yes, white male) auteurs, not anything indigenous to 2019. Phillips, who co-wrote the script, sets the story on the “Mean Streets” of New York in 1981 during a garbage strike. The TV news is buzzing with rumors of supersized rats. Urban decay is the anxiety du jour — but Arthur Fleck, our antihero in cocoon form, has many anxieties to choose from. Recently released from an insane asylum (“Cuckoo”!), he carries around half-crumpled business cards that do not announce his professional skills (clown for hire and aspiring stand-up comedian) but rather explain his (unnamed) neurological “condition,” which causes bouts of uncontrolled laughter in times of stress. Arthur Fleck is, in a word, pathetic. He is socially inept. He lives with his mother. He attracts bullies. He scribbles dark thoughts in his journal. He strikes women as creepy, and you can’t really blame them. He is exactly the kind of person we have learned to expect to “snap” and become an urban terrorist, if only because our ideas about terrorists have been shaped by the movies and not by history. One of the best things about “Joker” is that there really is no single moment when Arthur snaps and becomes the title character. Well, there is one. But then there’s another. And another. There certainly is no vat of acid to fall into. The Joker’s superpower is his resentment, his narcissism, and Phoenix cultivates these methodically in his performance, slowly transmuting the character’s awkward fragility into a kind of raging charisma — aided and abetted, of course, by all the tricks of art direction, sound design and editing that a journeyman filmmaker has at his disposal. Does “Joker” glorify violence and the lone-wolf myth? Well, yeah. It kind of has to, because that’s the formula for this kind of “thriller.” The violence, the transgression, is what makes a character an antihero and — supposedly — makes the audience look within to come to grips with that dark allure. Or not. Because while you’re on the way to discovering a new understanding of yourself, or of today’s social and cultural schisms, you might recall that “Joker” is just the latest attempt to monetize cartoon characters created in the 1930s and ’40s.",POSITIVE

"Oct 2, 2019"," His mother may call him Happy, but despite his job as a clown, the world has made Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) anything but.

Bullied, baited and betrayed, Fleck’s psyche contorts into an echo of the cruelty which surrounds him and he evolves into a corruption named “Joker.” Since its surprise win of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, “Joker” has been poked and prodded ahead of its release, organizations from the U.S. Military to the F.B.I. warning about potential violence at screenings, most notably from incels. But incels, or ‘involuntary celibates,’ mainly lash out with hatred of women. Arthur Fleck’s problems stem from abuse and mental illness, so a more serious issue may be the fortification of the right’s insistence on equating mental illness with gun violence in this country. Yes, he’s a sympathetic character, but I never felt it was cowriter (with “The Fighter’s” Scott Silver)/director Todd Phillips’ (“The Hangover” trilogy) intention to justify Fleck’s actions or encourage his audience to revel in them. Instead, “Joker” is a reflection of the soul sickness affecting our country right now.
Phillips has set his story in the early 80’s with Gotham City enduring a garbage strike that will recall the grimier, more dangerous New York City of the 70’s. He’s also so completely thrown out the usual Superhero tropes, instead leaning heavily on Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” for inspiration (with De Niro himself taking over “King’s” Jerry Lewis part), that it is a surprise when Bruce Wayne’s family is worked into the narrative. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is running for Mayor, telling the press that he is ‘their only hope’ when speaking of the common man (sound familiar?). He is beloved by Arthur’s mom Penny (Frances Conroy), who used to work for him years ago. So why do they live in such dire circumstances?
When we first meet Arthur, he’s twirling a sandwich board for a company going out of business. A group of punks steal his sign, then beat him with it when he chases them into an alley. His boss, Hoyt (Josh Pais), says the cost must come out of his salary. His coworker, Randall (Glenn Fleshler), gives him a handgun in a paper bag for his protection. Arthur then finds out funding for his mental health appointments and the seven medications he receives at them is being cut. When his gun falls to the ground as he clowns at a children’s hospital, he loses his job. On his way home on the subway, when he sees three drunk jerks in suits harassing a young woman, his uncontrollable laughter, a Tourette’s-like tic, draws their attention to him. Gotham City will become absorbed by the clown vigilante killings of three men, the press concluding retaliation ‘against the rich.’ Meanwhile, Arthur has begun to fantasize that his neighbor (‘Atlanta’s’ Zazie Beetz) is his girlfriend and that he has a future in stand-up comedy. When late night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) plays a tape of his failed attempt and calls him a joker, Arthur is pushed completely over the edge.
Todd Phillips takes a huge leap forward as a director, his production plunging us into a meticulously defined world of graffiti, rats and run down spaces, the glittering environs of the wealthy always out of reach. Watch for details like Arthur’s lapel squirt flower ‘crying’ onto the ground after his beating. Jeff Groth’s editing makes the film’s punches hit harder, Arthur’s world more interior. Hildur Guðnadóttir’s (HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’) ominous, cello-based score is perfection, complemented by soundtrack selections like ‘Smile.’ If Phillip’s writing broadcasts his inspirations, so be it, as he’s refitted them to his own purpose. (Other movies besides Scorsese’s seep in, with scenes recalling the likes of “Sid and Nancy’s” floating garbage, “The Exorcist’s” stairs and even “The Dark Knight’s” hospital.) If there’s a problem with his script it is that at a certain point we know exactly where it is going and once it is there Phillips resists his natural ending.
But the film’s main asset is Phoenix’s insane tour de force, the actor projecting a tortured physique, his torso twisted and ribs projecting as he moves with a grace that can only be called balletic. His Arthur is an innocent disillusioned day by day until his mind snaps and the power of his performance is that we mourn the mentally ill, compassionate man who is lost when it does.

"Oct 2, 2019","Joaquin Phoenix is next level amazing in ""Joker,"" and this is definitely the movie Todd Phillips set out to make, but I'm not sure it's one that should have been made.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Alas, the only remotely entertaining or even mildly interesting aspect of Joker is the notion that it might be so incendiary a depiction of a white man ignored by society who turns to violence that it incites real-life violence by real-life white men who think they are being ignored by society. To take even this lickspittle snippet of resonance away from the movie, this notion is nought but a metatextual one, not even part of the actual movie. We could say that this is ironically appropriate, if also unintentionally so. Or is it intentional? Did someone set out to make a movie that would (hopefully?) serve as a call to arms for disaffected white men? Joker is faux Scorsese. It is ersatz Christopher Nolan. It is not fit to lick the boots of either Taxi Driver or The Dark Knight, though the height of its ambition would appear to be its desperation to do so. This is a movie so dull, so obvious, that that is the most criminal thing about its portrait of a man “driven” to criminality by “society.” Oh, is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix: Mary Magdalene, Irrational Man) — soon to be the homicidal antagonist to Batman known as the Joker — sad? Is he lonely? Is his life not what he’d hoped it would be? Welcome to humanity, asshole. Deal with it. Director — and coscreenwriter, with Scott Silver (The Finest Hours, 8 Mile) — Todd Phillips is a filmmaker whose entire “oeuvre” (I use the word loosely) has been about celebrating white-male inadequacy, about white men somehow getting away with skating through life thoroughly unengaged in anything beyond partying (see his Hangover movies), or humiliating white men who try to grow up (see his appalling Due Date). Now, Phillips is attempting to be “serious” by removing all the plausibility-denying fantasy from a comic-book villain by making a movie about him that is “realistic” and “gritty” or whatever-the-hell he thinks gives him cover for indulging male rage as a sorry-not-sorry *wink* response to an unreasonable world. And yet: It’s still all the same-old justifying nonsense. There is nothing original here… and not because it’s about a comic-book character who has been depicted on screens large and small multiple times. Another white man who has not been handed fame and fortune and respect and sexy willing babes in return for having done absolutely fucking nothing with his life is angry. Cry us a river, pal. Hello! When you take away the plausibility-denying comic-book fantasy… when you take away the over-the-top absurdity… when you take away the perfectly acceptable nonsensical dispatch of a reason for a clown-faced killer to terrorize a city… now you’re literally vilifying mental illness. (Phillips and Silver give Arthur a condition, in which he laughs uncontrollably in moments that are socially inappropriate, that may be the authentic pseudobulbar affect, or may be something of their own invention. Either way: No.) Welcome to a visually washed-out retro Gotham, featuring overtures of late-70s, early 80s New York City — there’s a strike by sanitation workers that is causing black bags of garbage to disgustingly pile up on city streets, which actually happened in the Big Apple in 1977 and 1981. This is where I’m supposed to say that Joaquin Phoenix is “daring” and “radical” or some shit for having lost a lot of weight to play Arthur Fleck, failed stand-up comic, on-call clown for streetside promotions and children’s-ward hospital visits. I’m sure the actor pushed himself physically… but he doesn’t find anything psychologically fresh or intriguing in this character. Arthur is not happy with caring for his not-at-all-well mother (Frances Conroy: Welcome to Happiness, Stone), and he fantasizes a romance with his neighbor (Zazie Beetz [Geostorm]… and fuck this movie for treating her awesome presence even more poorly than Deadpool 2 does). It seems we are meant to automatically, reflexively feel bad for him… as if caring for blood relatives and dreaming of getting it on with people out of our league is not everyday reality for the vast majority of the human race. Arthur has not been granted the life he wants without having to do the work to earn it… though he fantasizes about that, too, via a late-night TV talk show hosted by *checks notes* Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin; Arthur likes to dream that Franklin’s show will see Arthur’s alleged comedic genius, invite him on, and, you know, etc. De Niro’s (Joy, The Intern) presence here might be the most inexplicable aspect of this damn movie. I am a huge De Niro fan, but he is bizarrely miscast: he simply does not have the charming, relaxing personality America wants for drifting off to sleep with the TV on in the background. This casting is likely meant to be a nod to De Niro’s King of Comedy turn, but even that suggests a willful misreading of The King of Comedy and of De Niro’s entire cinematic history. Jesus wept, no. Just no. The real world of 2019 handed Todd Phillips a platter of easy pickin’s: income inequality (billionaire Thomas Wayne [Brett Cullen: The Runaways, Gridiron Gang], ie, Batman’s dad, is the ostensible villain here); the collapse of social services (the safety net that helps Arthur deal with his mental illness is cut); even the not-so-quiet rage of pathetically ineffectual men threatening to boil over into civil unrest. And Joker does not one thing interesting or engaging with it. It pushes no envelopes. It is not edgy in any respect. It is just… here. And it assumes that its mere existence is reason to applaud. It most definitely is not. Is the bit he does dancing (?) down the steps as cool as it looks in brief trailer flashes?  That appears to be the only thing in this movie I’d like to see. Huh? Haven’t seen the film so I’m not sure what you mean by context of this character. I thought what I saw was “interesting” (if cool is the wrong word to you), kinda compelling, kinda gymnastic.  I still have no desire to see it, not even on $5.50 Tuesdays. Your use of the word “cool” isn’t about me but about you, and what you meant by it. “Interesting” doesn’t really tell me much more about what that dance does for you. I DON’T think I would like the movie from what I’ve seen in the trailer and from reviews like yours. I just found the physical “dance” down the steps to be compelling–much like that teenage American gymnast who has incredible floor exercise moves.  I think I’ll not like CATS but I enjoy the ballet moves of the White Cat in the hideous trailer. Well, by the time we get to that bit in the movie, I was so repelled by this character and the movie’s framing of him that I couldn’t find the dance cool or interesting or anything good. Hope that helps. So in your opinion,A movie that praise an extreme selfishness, mentally disordered man could execute anyone only because he’s “disappointed” is not miserable at all?If this reviewer is a cunt,then Todd Phillips would be a nazi.Hitler can also says that Jewish let him down. Your comment has 0% relationship with the movie,but 100% blame the critic. You sure with confidence that film is good enough.So I assume that you‘re supporting this film,Isn’t this a very reasonable inference? That’s fine…but to the outside reader of you reviews it definitely comes off as you having some pretty stribg bias about certain movies based on your personal beliefs and that makes for a pretty rough review.  People want a reviewer to review a movie based on its own merit and for what it is trying to present.  It feels to your readers that you are letting your personal views skew the review too much and aren’t trying to review it based on what the movie is trying to portray.  In essence, it feels like you are essentially missing the point because the points that you make that seem to knock the movie are the exact point of the movie and what it is trying to present.  I think allowing your mind to go into the review with a more neutral mindset and trying to perceive the movie for what it is would help your reviews to come off as something that your readers can find more trustworthy and more helpful when they are deciding whether or not they want to see it.  That’s the main reason people read reviews…and if your readers have to think “well Maryann is saying this but I know how she’s feels about this kind of thing personally and so I should probably take what she is saying with a grain of salt” then the average reader isn’t going to feel like they can trust your review. If you read review and you think the critic is unbiased, it’s only because you share the critic’s biases, and so the review reads as neutral to you. Every critic is biased, and I DID review this movie — as I do ALL MOVIES — “for what it is trying to present.” The thing is, my perception of that is going to be different that that of many other people, INCLUDING that of the white men who absolutely dominate film criticism. There is no such thing as a “neutral mindset.” You only think there is because our culture treats one very narrow mindset as neutral. That is a fallacy. Everyone has biases obviously…I just think most people will appreciate and take a reviewer more seriously of the reviewer can try to put them aside as much as possibly when trying to review a film.  People usually  read reviews to try and figure out if they would like to see a movie…the average person that is.  Maybe the purpose of your site is to give reviews from a certain bias or standpoint…and if that’s the case than that’s fine…I just think that it’s inportabt for readers to try to have some sort of trust on the reviewers abilities in order to take the review seriously and obvious or extreme bias definitely hurts that’s relationship and kind of defeats the purpose.  I think most reviewers would like fir their audience to develop that trust overtime and if that can’t be developed then you’ll only be catering to an audience of very specifically like minded people and that would seem unfulfilling as hell in my opinion.  The feedback you receive and your comment section will only be fulfilled with extremes in that scenario…extremely likeminded individuals, and extremely angry ones…with a few in between like mine ; ).  All I’m saying is reviewing is somewhat of an art form and extremely biased reviews are a very bland and almost always disappointing form of that art. “That mean comment was the last straw,”says local man.
“Wait… did we even insult him, and how does any of this connect to tax collection?” baffled critics respond. When asked for comment, the top 0.1% replied, “Taxes?

In what regard ? , a classic is out in cinemas , i am studying for a degree , healthy , what’s to be miserable about ?  but of course i suppose you’re a good judge of character though what is type in text ?. Mario people don’t spend their time doing what you are doing and behaving the way that you are when they are happy.  99% of people at least.  You come off very angry and upset my friend.  Why not disagree with a little tact and then people might take what your saying seriously and not just think you are an angry and upset little kid….because that’s how you’re coming off brother…big time. This review is by far the biggest pile of garbage I’ve come across. You’re not fit to lick the ass of Joaquin Phoenix or this movie. You miserable piece of shit. Do you often fantasize about “lick(ing) the ass of Joaquin Phoenix” in particular, or all male actors in movies who have been wronged by women reviewers? Don’t you like to hunt, fish? Play football? Is anyone stopping this? Too bad society doesn’t have a project to help these boys and men find better ways. The fact that Joker being a white guy is brought up not just once but several times makes it abundantly clear that this review is more concerned with viewing the movie from a political angle than as an actual film.  Oh, honey… If you want to think that Arthur’s skin color isn’t important, just ask yourself how a man who ISN’T white who does what Arthur does would be treated by 1981 faux New York. Or even 2019 faux New York. That review went after the wrong white man.  Thomas Wayne was the fascist fit with the white supremacy strait jacket in this movie. Because of budget cuts, quote marks have been left unsupplied. But then, according to our culture, Arthur himself would be black. And he would not benefit from white privilege. There would be no “undertone” about it. But even given Arthur’s situation, he is far less vulnerable than nonwhite and/or nonmale people would be. Seriously, is our culture able to consider the vulnerability of anyone who is not white and male? Signs point to no. In what way does it do that? This movie does not extend such compassion to anyone but Arthur. It does not ask the audience to consider the even more extreme vulnerability of people who do not look like Arthur. but, even if this weren’t true, the film makes it very clear that Arthur’s problems aren’t unique to him – he is a victim of problems affecting many others; this is pointed out repeatedly – even his psychologist points this out – she may also be losing her job even as he loses his access to counseling and support (her problem is not as dire as his – does this mean she’s “privileged”, or that they’re both facing hard times?) I don’t think they’re identifying with the Joker so much as resonating with some of the core messages in the movie, although perhaps not consciously. I’m not terribly interested in the kerfuffles about this movie’s sociopolitical implications, but it just looks so pretentious and *tedious*. It sounds like the trailer really does hit all the predictable beats of the movie.  I was hoping they’d at least have some fun with it, like some speculation I saw that DeNiro was literally playing his King of Comedy character.  And the Joker should be genuinely *funny*. Probably in a very twisted way, of course, but he should be fun to watch on some level. I was pretty sure this discussion thread was going to get flooded with trolls, but this may be the first review where all the trolls turn out to be the same person. Shockingly bad review.  Judging by the general tone of this reviewing website, it was bound to be distributed a negative score though.  As parroted a nauseating amount of times throughout the review, it has a white male as the lead actor (oh the horror) and it doesn’t portray a woman as being a victim in some capacity, and it doesn’t constantly bash Orange Man Bad.  Just your garden variety self-loathing, misandrist racist, nothing to see here folks. Since you didn’t read the review, her thesis is: “Life is tough for many people, but this film wants us to empathize with this particular person who feels entitled to all the rewards of life without putting in much effort.  His criminal journey is presented in an unoriginal and unrevealing way.”  Most of the time this “my life sucks because I don’t get everything I want – oh wait violence fixes everything now I am the antihero” plot is centered on a white male which is ironically insensitive considering the structural inequalities at the foundation of western society. Ideally, you’d watch the movie and tell us what you did or didn’t like about it, then make a supported argument about why you think the thesis of the review is incorrect, maybe compare it to other movies you’ve seen.  But if your sense of duty demands that you engage in battle before gathering any of that pesky ammunition called “firsthand facts about the movie being discussed,” (I understand the impulse) at least have the decency to engage with the ideas presented in the review and not the flimsy straw feminist you tote everywhere like a favorite chew toy. “Review Bad.  Politics Bad.  Reviewer Stupid.  Me Win.” may help you let off steam, but it is completely useless to anyone who wants to think about movies or think in general.  You have a brain, please use it for something more than closing doors and keeping score. The movie quite literally doesnt asks you to to empathize with a killer. What he does and how he does it is too horrofying for that. Sure, some may empathize, but thats not what the movie tries to do.
Also. I totally empathize with the Joker in the Dark Knight. There, I see Joker as a fun anarchist and empathize with an immoral immoral sociopath killer. That means Nolan and TDK is promoting violence.
No. Its because this movie central character is the bad guy. Thats it. I have nothing of value to add as I haven’t seen the movie, so I’ll just toss in a disturbing bit of trivia:  Treasury Secretary and heartrendingly gorgeous sex God /s Steven Mnuchin was an executive producer on The Lego Movie, Wonder Woman, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Edge of Tomorrow proving that even Goldman Sachs bankers do a little good in the world on occasion… for profit.  On the other hand, Bradley Cooper was a producer on this film showing that even charming generous actors who drive a Prius sometimes back a lame horse (for profit). You do realize that the reason she wrote all of this about the movie is because it’s exactly how she feels about it?  She loved Wonder Woman.  She’s really disliked a few of the Marvel movies. If she was dedicated to bringing one studio down and another up, I feel like all of her DC reviews would be bad and all her Marvel reviews would be good, and that’s just not the case. I know I’m not special, just another human being struggling through life. I recognize what privilege I do have, as a white Western woman, but I know how much easier my life would be were I a white man. I wouldn’t have assholes like you attacking me, for one thing. Why not just come out and say the willful and disobedient Eve forced Adam to eat the apple that ended his special paradise? And it made him look weak, because he ‘couldn’t control’ his own woman. I don’t think any race would want to be told they are not special in a hatefully targeted way like that. However in this movie, the protagonist who you insist on pointing out seems to be of caucasian appearance even though it has nothing to do with the actual story, is indeed very special.
The actor portraying him puts on an incredible performance. Martin Scorsese isn’t the only director able to entertain. You should leave your personal bias at home if you want to give an accurate film review which you certainly haven’t done here. And this is why you fail. OF COURSE the fact that Arthur Fleck is a white man is absolutely essential to this story. The fact that neither you nor Todd Phillips seem to realize this is NOT my problem. My racial privilege? Yeah I checked and it seems to have been hijacked by sjw’s like you if I ever even had it at all. It’s a good thing I’m not an actor. It looks like someone is already thinking of the white men. Namely you and thinking of them in a negative light and for what? What are you trying to achieve by that? A lot of people are tired of people like you trying to push this negative smear campaign against “white men”. This rhetoric has been the common theme of many movie reviewers lately as if you are all reading off the same form sheet. You’re doing your best at being fashionably offended. This is a movie about a clown with mental problems and how facing stigma and being ridiculed for that by society pushes him over the edge.
Arthur could easily be played by a black guy but he isn’t and there is nothing wrong with that so stop trying to pretend that there is. The point is that you made a totally irrelevant comparison and chose a director with a full trophy cabinet to do it with. In doing so you yourself have taken the holier than though attitude in which you claim to be against with your racist nonsense. Is that supposed to be some kind of a threat?
And why would you assume I am happy about “white dominance”. This is obviously your favourite topic.
You’re an sjw vomiting your own shit into your mouth and polluting the world. That’s all you are doing with this review.
Projecting something on to a movie which it is not. I didn’t say anything about a violent feminazi uprising and bloody revolution leading to the installment of the matriarchy in February 2020. You didn’t hear that from me.  I hope you are smart enough to realise that in your hateful response, all you have done is prove my point back to me that your review is nothing but a racist rant directed at white people. Why you think there is anything positive about that is all in your own mind which you obviously left behind somewhere a long time ago. If you think anything I’ve said here is hateful, you have no idea what hate is and have never encountered it in your life, ever. Yeah! Well done! This is a huge step you have made here. admitting you have a problem is the first step. That’s exactly what you are. You should review movies you can actually handle from now on. Sex is nice and all, but to get the true Joker experience, you should really watch it as you trip on Ayahuasca and mescaline while wingsuiting down the Grand Canyon right after injecting a pot brownie suppository as a Dalek goes down on you midflight.  Make sure you insert your entire face into its icy cold plunger just as the credits roll, it really brings out the finer details in the score. A review is subjective the the opinion of a reviewer. However, using it to push your own political bias is not a review. That is a delusion. Don’t assume my ability to write reviews. I could definitely do a more relevant review to the actual film than this nonsense here.
By the way, learn to mind your own business.
You will probably write some kind of triggered response but I shan’t be answering it. As is an open forum, I could also advise you to “learn to mind your own business.” But I won’t, as I would be devastated if you didn’t reply back. Joker being white has LITERALLY nothing to do with the story though? His skin color is never brought up, skin color plays no role in the story, and unless you’re putting together your own meta-commentary in your head, Arthur is just supposed to be an incredibly lonely and down on his luck civilian. CLASS in this movie is important, RACE isn’t ever touched on. Joker is predominantly shown as a white character in the comics, therefore they kept that in mind when casting for him. Beyond this, the plot of the story would not change at all if Arthur was black or asian instead. You seem to be implying Arthur’s race and his status as a white man is far more important to the plot structure than it actually is. What part of him being a white guy is ‘absolutely essential’ to the narrative? Would he not hallucinate? Would he not still spiral into being the Joker? Seriously, NOTHING would change unless you SPECIFICALLY changed the movie’s script to account for a race change and racial themes. Also, I know I’ll probably already be banned from these comments because you’ve been REALLY swingin’ around that ban hammer for super innocuous comments, but hey, here’s a tip before that happens: don’t insult people, their gender or their race if you don’t want to be attacked in return. Saying ‘wow white men really don’t understand they’re not special’ and telling people to fuck off while threatening bans is no way to start any form of proper discorse. You’re being just as venomous in the comments as most other people down here. “tHe DoMiNaNcE oF wHiTe MeN iS oVeR” like you SERIOUSLY expect people to treat you with respect down here when you keep saying shit like that? Race is ALWAYS a factor, both in the story and in how it’s received by audiences, whether or not we’re aware of it. Change the Joker to a brown Middle Eastern dude and watch the film be instantly and universally condemned for glorifying terrorism. And yet V for Vendetta — whose title character was white — was accused by certain conservative film critics of doing just that — glorifying terrorism.  Race may always be a factor but it’s not always the ONLY factor. Otherwise, there would not be so many real-life conflicts between various members of the same race.  Of course, it also goes the other way. The first time I saw Three KIngs, I could not help wondering how many of the critics who were impressed by the Arab torturer’s big speech about American culture would have had the exact same reaction if a similar speech had been given by a Wehrmacht officer. Or to use a more recent example, if the same exact speech had been given by a Serb. In the meantime, Sebastian gets a B1, a B2, and an O2 on the 2017 card. If we give him an honorary square for “Why don’t fish notice water?” he’s almost won a prize. We live in a world where Hispanic non-citizens in America are considered eligible for a fast track to citizenship if they’re college-bound but Hispanic non-citizens who come over here to pick fruit or work on roofs are considered eligible for immediate deportation. Darn right it is so often about class! But then I’m obviously biast. I still remember my late father telling me how my maternal grandmother was just fine with his dating my mother despite the fact that he was Mexican — until she found out that he lived in a poor neighborhood.  It’s not always about race, it’s not always about class, but sometimes it’s about both and sometimes it’s about either one. And willful blindness on these issues does not help matters. I know that you and MaryAnn mean well and I’d rather not write anything that would endorse the pov of the Sebastians of the world but I hate lying. We live in a world where Hispanic non-citizens in America are considered eligible for a fast track to citizenship if they’re college-bound but Hispanic non-citizens who come over here to pick fruit or work on roofs are considered eligible for immediate deportation. Darn right it is so often about class! But, Tonio, those college-bound Dreamers occupy the same class status as their parents, who came over here to pick fruit or work on roofs. So it’s not a class distinction. It’s families of the same class being torn apart. Because it’s about deporting as many brown people as possible. Discriminating by class is often a roundabout way of achieving the real goal, which is discriminating by race. Right now the Trump administration is declaring that it won’t allow in any immigrants who can’t pay for their own healthcare. That seems like a class argument, but we all know which communities that’s going to impact the most. The de-browning of America IS THE POINT. When immigration has been successfully limited to wealthy Asian doctors, I guarantee you one hundred percent that there’ll be some justification for keeping them out too. Race and class are often bound up together, but race is never NOT part of the equation. Class issues are differently experienced by different racial groups. And a film about a working-class homicidal white man will inevitably be written differently than a story about a working-class homicidal black or brown man (or a woman!), and received differently by the public. Race may be a cultural construction, but it is still one that is designed — CONSCIOUSLY DESIGNED — to keep people apart. It fucking sucks, and we still see it at work today… as in how incredibly educated and highly paid — ie, ostensibly upper-class — nonwhite people are still mostly treated like shit by our culture. I worked with a Korean-born boss for several years. She was one of the most efficient and hard-working  persons I ever worked with. Yet when the time came for her to be promoted, she was turned down because of her “linguistic ability.” Did she sometimes write less than perfect English? Yes, she did. I know because me and a Mexican-American co-worker –heh, irony — sometimes had to help her edit her E-mails. And don’t get me started on the white co-worker who was a friend of one of the higher-ups — a person, who, despite accusations of sexual harassment, had to literally throw a chair at one of his supervisors before he was fired.  “tHe DoMiNaNcE oF wHiTe MeN iS oVeR” like you SERIOUSLY expect people to treat you with respect down here when you keep saying shit like that? The reason you think his being white has “literally nothing” to do with the movie is because white male is considered the default in our culture, what linguists call the “unmarked form.” We think of how they act and how people treat them as either “normal” or just about them as an individual. But no one asks how the way Harley Quinn is written/depicted/treated in the story has anything to do with her being a woman. To jump franchises, no one suggests that race has nothing to do with Luke Cage’s story.
Casting the Joker as Black would change everything. It would change what he expects out of life. It would change the way other people treat him badly, and the responses to his actions. I understand that many white men can’t see that, because they’ve been treated as individuals and default humans all your lives, but the rest of us are very, very aware of how things like race, gender, sexual orientation/identity affect our lives and change our stories. I think I knew something was wrong from the moment I read that you were biased in favor of nothing, and in opposition to nothing.  Your writing style does not paint you as a milquetoast fence sitter, and I believe your precognitive hysteria will be utterly meaningless, but I apologized for. You’re quite welcome!  I earnestly did not expect such a polite and charming response for a low-engagement commenter who was directed to your article from the chrome recommendations homepage.  I’ve heard from other reviewers that this is a movie about access to health care and income inequality.  Do you have any input regarding those themes? Have you read my review? I mention those aspects, but the movie is not *about* those things. Those things are what I am referring with to this: “whatever-the-hell he thinks gives him cover for indulging male rage as a sorry-not-sorry *wink* response to an unreasonable world.” Indeed: Who are you? Why should we take your word on this, or on anything else? Why don’t you tell us what you thought was awesome about the movie? The central performance, the perfect realisation of that time, the perfectly executed violence – sickening, as it should be, the personal identification (without ever condoning), the Scorsese references (I know that’s a sore point for you). Please do tell us your memories of 1981 New York. Were you around then? (We cannot make any decision about who you are because you’ve hidden your Disqus history. Coward.) You personally identify with this character? Okay, that’s terrifying. But let’s give you the benefit of any doubt here: If identifying with this character is required to consider the movie “awesome,” do you concede that anyone who does NOT identify with the character might not find it awesome? Why the hell would Scorsese references be a sore point for me? I love many of his films. *Goodfellas* is one of my most favorite films. What the fuck are you talking about… and do you intend that such a comment should make others trust your opinion more? In terms of identification, if you have never experienced any episodes of acute loneliness, isolation or mental illness in your life then I guess well done and congratulations. I was referring to the fact that you got riled about the constant comparisons between this movie and Scorsese’s oeuvre as you clearly do not feel that Joker is worthy of the comparison.  I felt that this was obvious but am happy to clarify. You will note that I managed to answer your questions with some manners, with no need to swear for cheap emphasis and without generally acting like a crazy person. 2)  When a person breaks down and embraces anarchy and violence, a lack of compassion in their social environment is just as responsible as the choices of the individual. 4)  The mainstream media see themselves being blamed for the creation of violent individuals in the film, so they want Joker to fail or inspire a violent event. The only thing we can say for certain about the mainstream media as a whole is that they want something interesting, relatable, and tragic to happen at regular intervals, period.  Fear, tragedy, spectacle, and violence are how CNN and Fox News make their money.  Most of them are not evil, they just need eyeballs to make money, and humans are naturally curious about horrible things happening to other humans.  The mainstream media wants nothing more than for people to endlessly hop from one schadenfreudaliscious news nugget to the next like a kid eating free samples at Cosco trapped in a boundless maze of brands and slogans. 2)  This vague assertion is a truism that no one but solipsists and the NRA would deny – everyone understands that almost all crimes are due in part to social pressures and the lack of a social safety net, and are not purely spur of the moment actions performed by disconnected psychopaths.  The important question is, how does the movie go about revealing this truth? When the movie was a success, they saw more dollar signs, and did everything they could to maintain controversy to generate clicks, as the maker of this video is doing.  Large companies want to sell merch and family friendly Marvel movies are a broadly appealing gravy train, so they tend to get more favorable treatment on average than a one and done rated R flick.  I see no evidence of a broad media conspiracy, just people trying to grab some eyeballs, make a buck, and maintain their death grip on the top rung of the ladder – just business as usual, this video included. In terms of identification, if you have never experienced any episodes of acute loneliness, isolation or mental illness in your life then I guess well done and congratulations. You are making the same mistake as Hollywood: the experience of white men is NOT universal. The rest of us have to ignore enormous elements of our own experiences in order to suspend our disbelief and identify with a white male protagonist for at least the length of a movie. This movie asks too much of us, and I, at least, cannot go there with this movie. What a strange analysis of why recent DC movies have overall been failures (with the exception of Wonder Woman, which was very good and made money and Aquaman, which was at least entertaining and made money).  They followed the formula of Christopher Nolan’s very successful and positively reviewed Batman trilogy and therefore they failed? To be fair, there is a grain of truth there, but it’s not the Nolan influence: it’s the Frank Miller influence, which can work applied to Batman but falls flat applied to Superman.  But Nolan’s films were well directed, mostly well written, and well acted. Superman, Batman v. Superman, and Justice League weren’t particularly well written or well directed, and some of the acting was just strange (Jessie Eisenberg was easily the worst Lex Luthor ever).  But also Marvel didn’t succeed by following the formula of the older, non-MCU Marvel movies. They succeeded by a combination of good writing and good performances, combined with a willingness to take their time building the universe. This review is garbage, most of it has nothing to do with the movie, but basically, is instead a hit piece on “evil white males rawr”. As a Black male, that has in fact been black his entire life, and indeed had very aggressive racial disputes with my fair share of people (not just whites, many other races are just as racist, sexist, homophobic, and prejudice, if not more), I would like to say that I am getting tired of this “white man bad”, “toxic masculinity”, “sjw/pc culture” nonsense!! This is an origin story of one of the most iconic villains in the history of literature. Yes, there are things that happen that make the viewer sympathize with him, these are the things that need to be shown to give a true sense of descent into his despair, but with sprinkles of eerie nuisances emitting an uneasy feeling of his mental collapse into madness. I’m not a big comic book fan nor do I fancy Joaquin Phoenix all that much as an actor, but I understand the basic material to see what the film is trying to portray! Where the hell were you people when Ledger’s Joker was blowing up hospitals, slamming faces through pencils, killing people with a smile on his face, inspiring hundreds of thousands of Joker imitators? Better yet, where was the feminist neo nazi outrage and personal attacks on Jared Leto with his portrayal of a domestically abusive pimp Joker? Oh yeah, you all praised how great they were (Ledger deserved the praise in all fairness, Leto’s portrayal was distasteful imo). Fact of the matter is that all this outrage culture nonsense is exhausting and is destructive to all mediums of entertainment. Stop being nazis and let art be art, no wants their experiences dictated by a bunch of control freaks!! Where the hell were you people when Ledger’s Joker was blowing up hospitals, slamming faces through pencils, killing people with a smile on his face, inspiring hundreds of thousands of Joker imitators? Better yet, where was the feminist neo nazi outrage and personal attacks on Jared Leto with his portrayal of a domestically abusive pimp Joker? Dude, paying attention to pop culture and writing about how it impacts our society is literally what I have been doing here for the past 22 years. About the Daniel Joyaux piece. Its not bad. But first of all: didnt all the insane amount of American shootings happened BEFORE the movie Joker? Like, for years?
Second: Literally, the majority of people loves TDKnight BECAUSE of the terrorist Joker. Think about that. Joker was the bad guy there, and people wanted him to win because how amazing his jokes and performances and smart his philosophy was. How is that better?
After that, all the politics about “incells white man” are fair, I guess. But like I said, you and plenty of americans are against a movie about a villain. Otherwise, this movie made it as great as it could be done.
Four and last: you helped with the googling. Very few people hated on TDK, and critics LOVED IT (after all, it is a conservative film that justify the lost liberties of civilians in the fight against terrorists). So you cant use the very few critics and compared it with the Joker outrage. Your sense of resignation makes me a little sad. There was violence in the world before Joker came out, just as there was bigotry before Charlottesville, but that doesn’t mean we’re justified in feeding it. The world is full of art and literature about seductive villains (see: Milton), but this particular work of art makes it a bit too easy for actual villains to see themselves as glorious rebels. We can throw up our hands and say, “When people are really determined, there’s nothing we can do to stop them,” or we can speak up about films like this—even if they’re made with a certain amount of technical skill. In fact, speaking up is kind of a job requirement for critics of pop culture, like MaryAnn. Films can create compelling villains and still make an effective argument against their point of view, as The Dark Knight did. (MaryAnn discussed that at length in her review of the movie.) And when people disagree with each other online, we can continue to trade nasty insults, or we can try to make the Internet just a little bit kinder. Well. I dont get your point. I only know that I wanted the Joker to win in TDK, an ultra conservative movie.
On this one? I wanted Joker to get caught because he’s just terrible.  I honestly don’t understand this fascination people have with violent killers in general, whether it’s fictional characters or violent killers in real life. There’s really nothing “deep” or mysterious to explore here. They’re not misunderstood, tormented souls (or not more so than people who, y’know, DON’T go around murdering). They’re just shitty people who feel entitled to kill. That’s it. What’s so interesting about that? They’re not “strong” characters, they’re literally the opposite, giving in to their basest impulses. And they’re so very, very common. The news is full of killers. We get to see a whole lot of  “backstories”. At this point, is there really anything worth exploring? Evil is actually pretty damn mundane. …. Maybe it’s just my emotional exhaustion speaking, but I’ll be quite glad when this particular trend of edgy gritty villain-sympathizing films goes out of style. Why? If we live in a more or less civilized society, if he got education, access and all his basic needs covered, why would he enjoy violence in such evil ways? It is fascinating, because we are freaking scared of the incapability of not ever producing them as societies, and/or recognize them before they kill/do evil. I feel like with Phillips making a proudly apolitical movie (the joker explicitly says “I’m not political”), the movie misses out on a lot of ideas that it could explore, and turns a potentially interesting character study into a mushy mess.
I’m not sure if it’s a left-wing or right-wing movie, which is a problem. – A HUGE percentage of people (with different views) will not be interested in viewing this site
– Furthermore, another significant chunk of people, who want to read a film review (and not a politically biased, propagandistic, sputtering fulmination) will also be utterly uninterested. Propaganda alienates.  And then what are we left with? Well, there’s really not much going on at this site–the commenters appear to always be the same people and the only time a review garners many comments is when it is linked to 4chan and trolls come urinate in the comment section.  Although to be fair to the reviewer, she did gave a ***** review to a movie about a home-schooling, dinner-praying white christian family (with a pregnant and barefoot wife cooking, cleaning and stepping on nails while manly man hubby build things) whose traditonal values and way of life, freedom of expression, english-speaking abilities and physical safety were threatened by dark-skinned alien invaders. And she did gave a **** rating to Manchester By The Sea, the most insidiously misogynistic white male persecution fantasy I’ve even seen on screen. I can think of many other problematic movies (from a progressive point-of-view) that came out over the last couple of years rated very positively on this site (with or without review): Bushwick, Steven Sodersbergh’s Unsane, Don’t Breathe (three movies using the threat of rape of a white woman by an ”other” as a stakes-raiser – black man, mentally ill man, blind man, respectively), The Purge series, 3 Billboards Outside E. M., The John Wick movies, Green Book, Bohemian Rhapsody, to name a few. So the feminist nazi accusations launched at this reviewer by the trolls have never made a lot of sense to me. Many reviewers analyse movies through a political lens as they should: movies are political in nature, reflecting social issues, promoting values and transmitting ideology. I just don’t think this reviewer, compared to Slate’s Inkoo Kang or Film Freak Central’s Walter Chaw for example, analyses movies through a progressive lens in a consistent manner, although I’m glad that she tries at least. I checked her Patreon page out and it explicitly says that she is “Starting to dabble in fiction that people who like my criticism (geeky, feminist, progressive) might enjoy.” Straight from the horse’s mouth; analyzing films from the POV of a progressive feminist. I don’t have the time or energy to link you to all the reviews on here that portray this (even though they pretty much all do, one way or the other), but I do suggest you read her review of Halloween (2018). It’s 20% about the film and 80% about lecturing people on PROPER FEMINISM. Definitions on feminism are so wildly different nowadays; I have no clue who the arbiter of what PROPER FEMINISM actually is is supposed to be; but a site that posits to have gotten it right will alienate MANY people, FEMINISTS included.  I’ll give MAJ this, she is *very* brave to have such a limited positioning statment, and her website has definitely spoken to a certain demographic (hence, all the viewers who seem to be the same commenters over and over again); but–from a data analyst perspective–unless that certain demographic grows; this site, I’d say is in terrible danger. This isn’t just film criticism; this is a CERTAIN TYPE of film criticism that has a very limited appeal. That coupled with how harshly worded some of her reviews are (see: Captain Marvel). They’re worded like holier-than-thou lectures. Example: “superpowered female SJW invites manbaby nerds to suck it” & “Which is what makes her better than you, you whiny crybabies, and you know it, and that’s why you hate her.” Naturally, people would not want to be spoken to like that. MAJ constantly complains that men are are rude to her, yet seems to exhibit this same kind of behavior herself. But now that we know that you think people should modulate what they say in order to be popular with certain crowds, why should we take anything you say at face value? You’re most likely just saying it to appeal to a demographic you think you need to appeal to. The movie sets Joker up at the beginning as a kind of accidental leftist hero, where Clown ANTIFA are bravely protesting against injustice, but taking the mantle of a deeply flawed, villainous character. That’s a good idea. But then the end implies that Clown ANTIFA are bad, and a huge amount of Gotham starts rioting in the streets and cheering for Joker, so I guess we’re supposed to think they’re bad? Is that what Phillips thought of the protesters the whole time, that they’re no better than the rich that oppress them after spending 90 minutes seemingly saying the opposite? Like the cops are shown as rude and dismissive, too protective of the system, and then they shoot an innocent man. But then we’re supposed to feel bad for Clown ANTIFA beating them up? I feel like I couldn’t tell whether this is a left-wing or right-wing movie, which is bad when so many political themes are set up and then explored poorly. you can feel whatever you want. What you feel? Do you feel bad for the cops that protect the “haves” against the “have nots” or you don’t feel bad for them? So I personally think that Fleck, in this movie, does not act in a political motivation, and acts in his own self-interest, and he acknowledges this when he says “I’m not political.” But Phillips realizes the… politicality? of his actions, and personally chooses to not take a stance. Saw it this morning and definitely my film of the year.  Can see why people could have problems with it, but I just love that early 80s aesthetic.  Also probably identified a little too closely with the character.  Doesn’t mean that I put him on a pedestal by any means.  Maybe I’m just a sucker for broken toys? So other people’s writing made you not want to write. Because you couldn’t write as badly as they did? If you were any good at writing would would have probably continued. You are very good at making assumptions i recon. I mainly stopped because i sensed other reviewers mainly got caught in the hype of dragging politics, gender issues and politically correct topics into reviews about movies that clearly didn’t need to be viewed through a lens of a preconceived higher moral ground. I wrote from a viewpoint of love and passion for the art, and didn’t feel the need to project my personal ideology and worldviews. Also, i wouldn’t claim to be a better writer, just more topical instead of dragging in external bullshit to make a pretentious point. You think I don’t have “love and passion for the art”? I promise you, I wouldn’t have kept this up so long if I didn’t. Maybe you “didn’t feel the need to project my personal ideology and worldviews” because the vast majority of movies already reflect those things? And if they didn’t, why the hell WOULDN’T you want to such your ideology and worldviews reflected in popular culture? Note the difference between your previous post, calling this reviewer “a self righteous twat” and this more useful one where you actually explained you own views instead. Todd Phillips’ first film was a documentary about GG Allin, a performer noted for smearing himself with his own shit and throwing it at audiences, who went eager to see exactly that. Would drawing a metaphorical parallel to his later work be too on the nose? I didn’t actually say anything about the quality of Phillips’ first film (Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies), and in fact I think it’s more interesting than Joker, although both utterly pale next to Penelope Spheeris’ Suburbia as a sensitive, intelligent and compelling portrait of alienation and anti-culture nihilism. The key word was ‘metaphorical’, as in most of Phillips’ films are metaphorically similar to what GG Allin often did on stage.  I’m more than willing to give a film-maker whose previous work I don’t like a chance. Louis Letterier hadn’t directed anything of any value whatsoever, then he goes and directs all ten episodes of Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, one of the most astonishing, wonderful, beautifully made, progressive, politically conscious pieces of art I’ve ever seen (sure, Letterier was hardly the only creative voice on that show, but he did a phenomenal job directing it). Even with Todd Phillips’ back catalogue of reprehensible dudebro comedies that are anything but irreverent (since when has upholding the status-quo been ‘edgy?’), he could still have made a good film with Joker. I just don’t think he did. The movie not only doesn’t glorify violence, it clear shows it in horrifyng ways, without music, without one liners, without any fun around it. The violence (the extreme violence, because there are different portrayals of violence) is always overreactions from a, literally,mentally ill man.  Literally the movie calls out people like the reviewer here, that can’t see a person and its context, because it is so into their own ideas of what life should be, lacking any empathy for anything other than people that agrees 100% with them. Mentally ill people are infinitely more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators of it. But thank you for pointing out that yet another movie slanders the mentally ill in this way. arthur fleck was a victim of violence.. like his whole life… I don’t get it. Exactly, Mentally ill people tends to be victims, like Arthur Fleck… in this movie.  And No. I don’t think Nazis should have the liberty to hate (and of course nobody else). They lost the ability to be respected to express their “opinions” (pure hate).  You are just not watching the movie. The movie is about a mentally ill person that WE (me included) leave alone, don’t care about, mistreat.  In this case, ends in this horrible tragedy and he becomes awful and after he starts to use violence, the empathy stops there. He loses that benefit.  I don’t. I honestly think you are against this type of movie, regardless of anything else. That’s close minded, which the defacto Right wing attitude (which I usually despise). We, the left, should mantain the high moral ground. We are better, because we think about things, not just repeat conservatives speeches that our fathers/mothers forced on us. I am thisclose to bringing down the hammer on the abusers and the assholes here. Unless you are able to comment on the film and on my review like an adult, you will be banned. Personally, I’d ban anyone using crude insults like b!tch or c!nt.  If they can’t make their points without resorting to that sort of vulgarity then I doubt that they have any substantive points to make. On some websites (though, fortunately, not this one), Disqus will automatically block a post that contains curse words. Other than that, though, the software isn’t a human being and isn’t smart enough to figure out which comments are abusive. MaryAnn has to do that herself, and she often chooses to leave the worst ones up, so people can see just how badly outspoken women like her are treated on the internet. I haven’t seen this film, but from everything that’s been said about it I think there’s a significant difference between this and The Dark Knight: Nolan doesn’t position the Joker as the moral center of that film. As MaryAnn’s review of TDK points out, Ledger’s Joker isn’t humanized, and the audience isn’t asked to sympathize with him; he’s “a monster sprung full-grown from our collective id,” “an inexplicable madman unmotivated by anything other than insanity.” He’s terrifying and UNKNOWABLE, the external elemental force pitted AGAINST the film’s fragile moral core (Batman adhering to unspoken rules, and Gotham’s citizens choosing to spare each other rather than cynical self-preservation). Nolan’s film doesn’t ask us to pity him or empathize or wonder what his story is; it wants us to FEAR him (and the nihilism he represents in our own society and ourselves), and to FIGHT him. (And to ask what terrible costs we might be willing to pay to do so.) Joaquin’s Joker doesn’t have a Batman to play off against. The film wants us to feel sorry for him, but it’s debatable whether his story is worth feeling sorry FOR; it seems to be, as MaryAnn describes, the tale of another white man who’s angry he doesn’t have the life he feels he’s entitled to. As she points out, such a mindlessly dangerous and implacable adversary does not really exist in the real world, so, in a way, using such a fabricated bogeyman to capitalize on public fears, during a time of a real debate that stood to impact many lives, may be argued as being dangerously irresponsible on the part of the filmmakers. Her review felt to me almost like a blissful lament – surrendering to such problematic aspects because the experience of watching Ledger’s performance and the film as a whole was so enormously pleasurable. This combination of self-aware insight and mixed feelings about that film is what I found so unique. In comparison, I would say that, while Dark Knight uses the idea of unexplained irrationality and mental illness to make his Joker more alien, and to absolve us from any responsibility to try and understand him, this new film uses unexplained irrationality and mental illness precisely to draw us CLOSER to Phoenix’s Joker – to help us appreciate and empathize with another human being’s frailty; by avoiding a clear diagnosis, the film makes it harder for us to “label” and detach ourselves from him; through our identification, we are closely implicated in his actions, but at the same time, there is enough skepticism about him on our part, so the film gives us space to make our own judgments along the way about what is happening. Indeed, the point of the film is not Arthur’s character per se, but the danger of his (our) merciless environment, and how it might potentially affect ANYBODY’s behavior. No. If she felt the film were dishonest, she wouldn’t have given it her green “see it” stamp of approval. The film is complex, NOT dishonest. MaryAnn explicitly refutes this notion! “That’s the catch, the out that saves Nolan’s Batman from accusations of glorifying vigilantism or extralegal adventures in the name of truth and justice and peace. I mean, you can say that, if you want, and I’m sure people will, but they’d be wrong, because Batman here is all about adhering to rules higher than those that are written down, whose spirit and letter can be ignored. That’s explicit here: Batman may be extralegal and without jurisdiction, and Bruce Wayne may be as psychotic and as much a showman, in his own way, as the Joker, but he knows which rules cannot be broken, cannot be winked at and ignored, and the Joker doesn’t. There is, with true justice, only the spirit of the rules, and contravening them is where evil comes in.” Yes, Batman deploys invasive universal surveillance, a civil rights violation that the film does NOT depict in a celebratory way. But he also steadfastly sticks to his one hard moral rule and REFUSES TO KILL. Refuses to drop a mobster from a lethal height. Refuses to kill the Joker in the interrogation room. Refuses to kill the Joker at the end. Just as the citizens of Gotham ultimately refuse to kill each other. The film draws a moral line (however thin) against the Joker’s nihilism and holds fast to it. The film tells us there are things we MUST NOT DO, even if it seems prudent to do them in the face of terror. It is, as MaryAnn says, about “What decency people can muster in indecent times. What it takes for people with principles to make a stand when principles seem unvalued.” It’s about how acting according to our values in these times is hard, even UNIMAGINABLY hard, but that it is what we must do nonetheless. Ledger’s Joker isn’t written as an INDIVIDUAL. He functions as a recognizable REPRESENTATION of the cumulative toxicity of our society, which DOES exist in the real world: “a beast easy to despise because he is so recognizably us, the awful side of us, not necessarily as individuals but as a puppet of all of us, fueled by the mutual societal self-destructiveness — as evidenced by the ongoing collapse of our economies, of our environment, of our inability to stop ourselves going over a cultural cliff — that some of us rage against it to seemingly no effect.” His role in Nolan’s story is not as a human character that the audience must understand, but as a FORCE whose effect on society demands that we wrestle with how best to respond. The film does NOT absolve us from grappling with how to act in the face of the real-world corrosion and destructiveness that Ledger’s Joker represents. “(The Joker is) that impossibility that we, in the outside-of-the-movies world, have been ‘trained’ to see everywhere, even though they don’t exist, at least not on any meaningful scale: the terrorist with no cause, no politics, who’s just an inexplicable madman unmotivated by anything other than insanity.” In the fictional world of the film, we see numerous exclamations of shock at Batman’s tactics, but, in the fictional world constructed by the filmmakers, no other option is presented – characters are dramatically “shocked”, but in the fictional film, this “shock” amounts to so much hot air, since the film simultaneously shows Batman as having no choice. In fictional terms, the film is supporting Batman’s shocking authoritarian actions, but cushioning the shock for us by surrounding it with noise and pretending to debate the issue – a genuine debate on such a sensitive issue would clearly show us other courses of action available to Batman that could work, so that we might question his motives for choosing one and not another. For my part, I’m not convinced – I think this was dangerously irresponsible and fed into real life outside consequences – all the more because it was so well made. Much of its success came because it so successfully trafficked in real life fears of the moment. There are other parts I could cite where Dark Knight sensationally raises such issues of the moment and then similarly retreats from them to preserve its good guy vs bad guy comic book formula, but this unique passage was the main point I’d taken from this review. It’s been a while since I saw the film, but that’s not the sense I got from it. Batman is not presented as having no choice – he spends the entire film MAKING choices, like the choice never to kill, and the choice to do the surveillance hack (which is presented IMO as being a BAD choice). The climax is about Gotham’s citizens making the CHOICE not to abandon their decency. Ledger’s Joker is all about forcing Gotham to make unpleasant choices that betray their deepest principles. Batman and Gotham’s citizens ultimately CHOOSE to reject him. But if you find TDK “dangerously irresponsible,” why do you give the new Joker film a pass, when it is being criticized for justifying violence as an option for similarly unhappy white men, and for perpetuating the myth about mental illness and violence? If an action is presented as necessary, then this is not really a choice in any meaningful sense. A character swerves to avoid driving into a brick wall – do we think of this as a  “choice”? The surveillance hack enabled Batman to defeat the Joker and likely prevent far more death and destruction – the physical urgency the film presented far outweighed the moral qualms raised by Fox – this was the point conveyed – I can’t imagine a SINGLE film-goer who would have rooted for Batman to wait during such an emergency when he had such a clear option in front of him – wait for what, exactly? You think anyone watching that film left it arguing that he should have waited? If those crowds on the ferry had failed the test, then the Joker as a nihilistic symbol would have made more sense – it would be very easy to agree with his point, since everyone’s behavior would have been so understandable. I can’t imagine a SINGLE film-goer who would have rooted for Batman to wait during such an emergency when he had such a clear option in front of him – wait for what, exactly? You think anyone watching that film left it arguing that he should have waited? Here’s Bilge Ebiri: “It’s a brazen invasion of privacy, and, as noted by many critics at the time, an unsettling echo of the Bush administration’s embrace of the surveillance state in the wake of 9-11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So it’s perhaps telling that while Batman finds the Joker using this illegal sonar doohickey, it is not he who ultimately foils the villain’s plans, but the people of Gotham themselves: They finally refuse to kill one another.” So it’s possible to argue that the film sees Batman’s violation of everyone’s privacy rights as an extremely tempting option but ultimately unnecessary; all it enabled him to do was track down the Joker (which he could have done by other means, at other times), while it was ultimately the people of Gotham themselves who disrupted the Joker’s master plan simply by choosing decency — no surveillance state needed. Which is exactly what so many critics of Bush’s War on Terror were saying: we don’t have to become like the monster to fight the monster. Well, I thought we were talking about THEMATIC dishonesty, which I don’t see in TDK. I think unrealistic dialogue/behavior is a problem with Nolan in general, whose characters tend to Expound Themes All the Time rather than say anything normal. Of course we should expect that. And everyone is deserving and respect and dignity. But many of us have about had it with white men being front and center in the battle for dignity. And we have absolutely fucking had it with the pushback from certain quarters of white men (see: fanboys) when it’s women or POC asking for the same respect and dignity. It really hasn’t. People have been making such a case, eloquently and passionately, onscreen forever. It’s just that many white men do not seem to hear these things unless they are centered in these stories. Ah. You are making the tired old argument — so entrenched in our culture that it often goes entirely unseen — that stories about white men are somehow universal, while stories about everyone not white and/or male are not. “It’s been incredibly difficult to make a case” – I mean on a level that catches fire in the mainstream discussion and feeds into large scale mobilization and policy change – when was the last time we saw that? I just approved your spam-flagged comment. I didn’t realize it was still in the system: Disqus is supposed to let me know that I need to approve (or not) a comment that’s been flagged, and it didn’t do that with your. After seeing this masterpiece of a movie and then reading the review of this misandrist I can see how it must hit too close to home for her. I can easily picture her as the Arthur Fleck character from this film, a loner, no friends, looking to extract revenge on every male thats swiped left and ignored her very existence by writing un-biased reviews based on her seething male prejudice. All in all a great flick and pleased that no one shot up the movie theater I watched it out. Vaguely creepy revenge fantasy projections wrapped in unsupported assurances from a complete stranger that the film is a “great masterpiece?”  Say no more fam, we shall depart for the multiplex post haste! Ah, so if I watch the movie, I’ll understand why it’s okay for commenters to call her gendered slurs and engage in personal attacks. Got it. My bad. You’re not using slurs, but you’re still an ass badgering multiple commenters and insisting that only your way of thinking is right. You’re telling the reviewer WHO WATCHED THE MOVIE and formed her own opinion on it “You are just not watching the movie“; a commenter’s good-faith response to you is “pointless“; another commenter is “WEIRD and weak” for saying the film has a confused message, etc. It’s a free country and you’re free to keep posting. But the rest of us are also free to call you out as an insecure dude who has to repeatedly insist that everyone else is wrong. The problem with the movie is the title ” Joker ”. There’s nothing about this figure, this character so well represented in Batman and other movies. Joker: Apolitical, anarchist, rebel, free, violent, funny, sadistic, unanswered, meaningless. It suddenly occurred to me that some people might think that when I said “Loki” I mean the Marvel character. I mean the trickster demigod of *actual* Norse mythology. I didn’t ever seem to see any downvotes on ANYTHING up until a few days ago, even in heated discussions. Did Disqus use to hide downvotes? I loved it as much as it disturbed me. I thought it was an effective tale of delusion, personal, interrelational, and collective. The joke is that so many lies are true, and so much truth is lies. Did you notice how much more lucidly he speaks with his mother but how his ability to communicate degrades with others? And how that degradation impacts all interactions? What’s it like for a sick person to be grey-stoned by everyone able to help but tortured by those who take notice?  For instance, I was fortunate to have tons of pushback over years of expressing homophobic viewpoints, including here. That earnest pushback with correct information helped me deconstruct my views. But many people grey-stoned me. Of course they had the right to, and it was probably best in some situations, at least best for them at the time. It is literally no one’s job to correct wrong-headedness of a person. There’s no personal guilt or shame there, ultimately. But, right or wrong, there are consequences. Thank you for the earnest response.  You are correct – grey-stoning is best in some situations.  Most people who encounter the mentally ill on a regular basis have to grey-stone to a degree because it’s too draining to become genuinely emotionally involved with everyone they meet/treat.  The classic Harley Quinn “Mad Love”episode of Btas is a simplified portrayal of the potential risks. Of course, in modern urban society, person to person interaction is less and less essential and local communities are not closely knit, so the mentally ill often gather online or in poorly run shelters and completely lose track of what normal social interaction looks like (after reading some of these comments, I’m beginning to forget myself).  Long ago, each community typically had one or two mentally ill members who regularly interacted with people presenting models of healthy behaviour.  Of course, many mentally ill people were also bullied, shamed into silence, and ostracized, but it was feasible for local caregivers to help each one with genuine compassion. Now, every metro or bus ride potentially introduces a mentally ill person you’ve never seen before and may never see again, and who’s to say which of the hundreds of strangers posting odd, emotional comments online at large sites are trolls and which are genuinely sick individuals who need help?  In such an environment, grey-stoning and/or conscious ignorance is required for survival. Humans are genetically wired to live in small social groups and to value social approval from and connection to high status members.  Out in the wilds of the internet that often means alienated people will gather together and reinforce unhealthy habits, but it also means that smaller, moderated internet communities like this one have real value, as it’s possible to occasionally (within reason, MA does not have an infinite supply of patience and time) connect and communicate with an internet stranger as if they are a person and not just another soldier/cheerleader in a flavour of the minute Brand War. You’re right, it’s scary as hell that mentally ill people are left to figure out what’s right and wrong on their own in a country (the wealthiest country in the history of the world) that places such little value on healthcare, education, and community, and it’s even scarier that innocent people must suffer the (often deadly) consequences of that negligence.  I haven’t seen the movie yet, but I’m glad that it both frightened you and connected with you on a personal level.  Thanks again for sharing your perspective and thoughts. And yet somehow multiple people saying similar things didn’t make you at least consider their viewpoint, at least consider where they were coming from and why they might be reacting to the film in the way that they did?  Here’s a place to start: Perhaps think about why the things you consider “reality” that film just has to “actually” portray are filtered through a very narrow lens… one that those of us who do not accept that narrow lens are tired of. Well, maybe considering other peoples viewpoints goes both ways. You already go in with a totally biased viewpoint of men in general. It’s like setting a bait of self fullfiling prophecy. Just as you wont accept people viewing art through a narrow lens, there are numerous people that simply wont accept to be portrayed as as a negative stereotype. Talk about a narrow lens.. Ever once considered your own privilege as a white woman? I bet you did, but are eager to compare it to the so called privilege of white males while in reality privilege has far more to do with the social class in wich one has to live. But on point, This movie is very divisive so i could also point out to at least five reviews who actualy shared my views on the movie. It isn’t even that i view movies through a narrow lens, it’s just that i feel i don’t need to put energy in searching for opposing personal viewpoints that could possibly be presented in a film. It seems like reaching for most movies. Just because a film or film maker portrays things that i don’t condone with in any way, doesn’t mean they are actually portraying it because they feel it is their viewpoint. That’s why “All art is political” is such a bold and to me uninformed. statement that i am not able reach a concensus. But you know, it’s really hard to have a discussion with a self professed biased person wich brings me back to your own point of considering other peoples viewpoints. 4. It is always wrong to make assumptions but like it or not, people will judge you by your words. And if you claim to be a reviewer, a critic or a professional writer, they will judge you even more harshly than they would another person. C’mon folks, if you like a movie, no one else can take that away from you. This is a real ‘water is wet’ issue of emotional maturity and having confidence in your own tastes. This is a bit self-serving, but for an example of how to respectfully disagree with MaryAnn, you could check out my comments on her Alita: Battle Angel review.  A friend of mine recently watched Booksmart at my recommendation and he hated it, and I considered breaking off our friendship…. No, of course I didn’t, because that would be absurd. We just disagreed about a movie, and yet somehow, life goes on and we’re still friends. Yes, Modern Times was an awesome movie. I always felt bad that Great Depression II never inspired anyone in Hollywood to come up with a similar classic.  And yes, there is something to be said for respectful disagreement. After all, insulting people rarely makes people change their minds. And it doesn’t encourage people who are not related to the object of your insults to agree with you. I want to ask you some things about this movie; why do you think the movie has so much viewers approvals in IMDB putting it now in a 9 points (i know we need more time to see the more statistic number, probably will fall a bit from that number), how would you explain that. Letting that aside, do you really find the message is so badly intentioned and overwhelming or maybe appealing to men for them to feel attract to the character? and can it be dangerous for society to see this kind of movies? if thats so, Why?. MaryAnn, I think you should have acknowledged in the “biast” at the beginning that you hate Todd Phillips, because this review very much reads like you went into the film looking to hate it and with preconceived notions about what it was. Joker is a character study of a mentally ill person who, in the context of economic and social unrest, goes off his meds, appears to find out some things about his past that cause a complete mental break, and appears to become a murderous psychopath and the accidental leader of an anarchic social movement. I say “appears” because the film is radically subjective (like Science of Sleep or Spider) and much of it may be playing out only in his head.  I am a fan of films like Roma and Moonlight that make me empathize with people unlike myself. I felt that Joker did that extremely well. The character absolutely IS pathetic, utterly lacking in social skills or grace. His dreams are insipid. He just wants to feel like he matters, and he knows he doesn’t. He knows he’s broken but at first he doesn’t understand just how broken he is. He doesn’t have any real insight to offer about societal ills. All he has is pain and longing.The film puts you right there with him, up close and uncomfortable with someone you would instinctively recoil from in real life. MaryAnn, I think you should have acknowledged in the “biast” at the beginning that you hate Todd Phillips, because this review very much reads like you went into the film looking to hate it and with preconceived notions about what it was. I don’t go into ANY movie “looking to hate it.” And while I mostly haven’t liked Phillips’s movies, he does not register as a director enough for me to have any particular feeling about him or his work whatsoever. Although after this film, and the way he has slagged off pushback against the movie, he’s pretty much earned himself an anti-bias next time. I do not have empathy for people who turn their own pain onto hurting others as we see depicted here, and in the particular way the film wants us to feel that empathy. I just cannot. You say to compare empathy for the Joker to empathy to the protagonist of Moonlight is appalling. The protagonist in Moonlight is a drug dealing thug who uses violence and the threat of violence to get what he wants. We are only shown one violent episode, but we have every reason to believe there are plenty more. Is it the mere fact of his blackness and queerness that makes his actions less deplorable and him more worthy of empathy? I’m not saying this to mess with you. I am not a right-wing troll. I support Elizabeth Warren, loathe Donald Trump, and generally view accusations of liberal groupthink as pernicious nonsense. But I have found liberal media’s reaction to this film far more disturbing than anything in the film itself. I genuinely don’t understand the intense hatred. There’s not that much violence, and the violence is not random. The violence IS upsetting, but I would much rather have violence that is traumatic  than violence played for a laugh the way it is in Tarantino movies. I would much rather have moral ambiguity in violence rather than simplistic assertions of right and wrong, good and evil. For me the end of Joker is great precisely because one experiences it as the triumph it is in his mind and as a nightmarish horror story of societal collapse.  As Roger Ebert once wisely said, It’s not what a movie about, it’s how it’s about it. And there is no comparing the how-it’s-about-it of *Moonlight* with the how-it’s-about-it of *Joker.* The differences between the two movies are stark, and not just because of the different races of the protagonists. I don’t care what Phillips says or thinks about the film. Once a work of art — or “art” — is out there, it’s open to any supportable interpretation. And I think that any interpretation that suggests that *Joker* is happening mostly in the imagination of its protagonist is a disingenuous copout. Interesting that you should bring up Roger Ebert. Lovely man, brilliant critic. But sometimes he was just plain wrong. I submit his review of A Clockwork Orange. Wait a sec, are you saying that Ebert’s initial review of ACO is objectively wrong?  He watched the movie, had a reaction, thought awhile, then explained why he didn’t like the film.  Even if he changed his mind later, the initial review isn’t wrong.  I know people who don’t like The Godfather because they feel it glorifies violent criminal behavior and people who hate coffee ice cream because the flavor is too bitter.  I know people that hate Seven Samurai because they think it’s boring and hate reading subtitles. These people are not wrong, just as someone who tells you that the best movie of all time is Space Mutiny isn’t wrong.  The “in my opinion” is implied whenever people discuss their response to art.  You can disagree with their opinion and explain your reasoning and perspective – maybe they’ll adjust their opinions later, maybe not, but the quality of a work of art will always be subjective, and is never set in stone. You’re essentially claiming that: “The gatekeepers of this subset of art that have authority in my particular social sphere will deem this work to be worthy of membership into the officially sanctioned canon at some near future date.” is the same thing as saying “This is a great work of art, and anyone who doesn’t agree is wrong.”  Those are very different statements.  The first may be true, but it has no authority over another person’s opinion.  Even in China, no one cedes all of their thoughts about art to an official canon or list of box office results.  Humans don’t work that way, as ACO demonstrates. Most of the people who dislike the movie cite a lack of focus and originality, and/or mention that it expects the audience to empathize with an evil person who makes terrible, lazy decisions.  You’ve explained why you liked the film in previous comments.  That’s all you can do – you cannot force this opinion onto another person, and you certainly can’t declare their perspective objectively wrong. There is, however, an objective system of morality that all rational adult humans agree on (do not cause pain, do not kill, do not deceive or deprive of pleasure/ability/freedom, etc.).  Any review that touches on the moral aspects of a film, as MA’s review does, has some limited claim to objectivity.  If you want to support an argument that this is a moral film, and/or that great art can and should be able to celebrate evil, immoral people, or that the character of the Joker is not actually that evil and the real villain is society, or elaborate on how you think the movie presents him in an unsympathetic light, or all of the above, go right ahead.  However, please do so with the goal of communicating your perspective and without the need to convince others that they’re wrong like some soldier in a battle between prescriptive, cultural hive minds. It seems to me that a reviewer can be “objectively wrong” when they make claims about the filmmaker’s intent. For instance, if a reviewer states that Phillips put certain scenes in Joker as dog whistles to the alt-right, that is not an opinion. That is a factual claim, it’s either true or false.  Let me try another example. Lots of people hate Michael Haneke’s Funny Games (either version) because it is deeply upsetting to watch. Thinking they’re unpleasant films that are not worth watching is an opinion. Some people believe Haneke intended the film as torture porn to appeal to sickos who get off on that sort of thing. That is a factual claim, and I believe that available evidence overwhelmingly indicates that it is a factually inaccurate claim.  The two most celebrated American film critics of the late 20th century were Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert. They both wrote blisteringly negative reviews of A Clockwork Orange in which they made numerous claims about Kubrick’s intent as a filmmaker. Now I suppose it’s possible that Kubrick intended ACO as a work of pornography that glamorized Alex in order to appeal to shallow youth. However, there’s a lot of available evidence that indicates otherwise.  In your last paragraph you assert that MaryAnn’s review has a claim to objectivity because she addresses the film’s morality. Honestly, I find this argument very strange. Joker is not a snuff film. Notwithstanding the moral panic that swept the Internet, there is no evidence that Phillips intended the film to incite evil. Are you suggesting that the mere depiction of evil (or irrational violence) is inherently a moral failing?
And is there really an objective system of morality that all rational adult humans agree on? Is war moral? Is the killing and eating of animals moral? Is the violence of a slave rebellion morally justified? We might all be able to agree on abstract principles, but in practice it all gets very messy very quickly.
To me, it is a moral failing not to care about people. To me, it is a moral failing to say, “that’s a white male who has all sorts of unearned advantages from being white and male, so therefore their suffering is invalidated.” But no one is saying that. Perhaps you’re misinterpreting complaints about the centering of white men’s pain above everyone else’s that way. Striving to ensure that everyone’s stories are told, heard, and heeded with the same respect that those about white men have been is NOT oppression. In a way, I find your reaction to this film a bit surprising, or at least ironic. I recall your brilliant take on Heath Ledger’s Joker – making the distinction that the conception of that character – so beautifully realized – might nonetheless at the same time be incredibly toxic and even dangerously irresponsible on the part of the filmmakers – I can think of NOBODY else who was so on-target about the implications of Nolan/Ledger’s interpretation, while at the same time fully savoring the enormity of that film’s accomplishment. This new film in some ways feels almost as if the filmmakers here might have read your cautionary take on Ledger’s Joker and based their own interpretation on it. Indeed, my memory of the point you’d made actually increased my appreciation of this Joker film, which I liked immensely.  As you point out, Ledger’s Joker, as a concept, was a total fabrication, feeding into a willful blindness within the audience – in this respect, this new Joker film is the exact opposite – painfully close to home, forcing our gaze upon a rage mounting all around us, one we fear to acknowledge, forcing us to see it in context. I think this new Joker is meant to be seen as a kind of Everyman – what’s shocking about this film is the sense of lucidity it grants its title character – his mind may be fogged by any range of medications and underlying ailments – including a childlike silent-era sentimentality that is virtually insane in its own right – but he’s presented as having an absolutely clear sense of the humanity that’s so routinely violated in this world of cannibals the film depicts – he’s depicted almost like a Christ figure in a Hieronymous Bosch painting, but one about to collapse into murderous outrage and unleash his power  – and his tragic descent from frail angel to violent monster is the very same arc Mary Shelley depicted, making the exact same point – except here we see this Frankenstein monster as simply a more pronounced example of what’s happening to the whole society.  The point is made with a tabloid crudeness intended to reach a wide audience – sometimes a genre picture can make a taboo point more directly than other modes – think of Joe Dante’s Homecoming, or Sam Fuller’s White Dog.  This strikes me as a zeitgeist film – speaking to a confused and disaffected population, warning how, in the absence of legitimate outlets and support, how easily mounting pain can spiral into wholesale chaos and madness. I thought the film was very well done.  Joaquin Phoenix was great.  I will have to watch the film multiple times to figure out what really happened. While I do understand your criticism, I do have to say that it’s harsh to say Arthur is mad because life hasnt handed him everything on a silver platter. He’s mentally ill after being abused as a child. Man, woman, white, or black, that doesnt really make a difference when you have a mental disorder. Other than that, there’s nothing profound or groundbreaking in this movie. It absolutely makes a difference. A huge one. Men externalize their anxiety and their confusion, often violently; women typically turn that stuff on themselves, and hurt only themselves. And a black man who behaved like Arthur does? You *really* think he’d be treated in the same way that Arthur is, either within the context of the story or the way in which this film is being received? Thanks for the link, however my point is that I find fault with the point that Arthur should not be allowed to feel bad, because life didn’t hand him anything. You can be born as a cis, white male to extremely wealthy parents and still be absolutely miserable for your entire life due to having a mental disorder. My point is not so much a defense of the movie, but a disagreement blaming a mentally ill person for feeling bad even though he’s from a priviliged class (white, male).  As for the way different mental disorders manifest, I highly doubt either of us is qualified enough to make an educated assessment of this. “mental dissorder” is not a singularly definable term. There’s countless of dissorders that manifest in countless ways. The film is also being criticized for stigmatizing people with mental health issues by perpetuating the myth about the connection between mental illness and violence. You can be born as a cis, white male to extremely wealthy parents and still be absolutely miserable for your entire life due to having a mental disorder. Absolutely true. Privilege does not protect you from having problems with your life, and privilege does not mean everything gets handed to you on a platter.  But it is also absolutely true that someone who is not white and/or not male and/or not able-bodied is going to have things much worse than Arthur does even if they’re dealing with the same issues he has. But if you want to argue that Arthur is actually, genuinely mentally ill, then you have to take onboard the criticisms of the film for its appalling depiction of mental illness. (See Bluejay’s links.) Even if those statistics were true — which is doubtful, given your obvious biases — I’m not quite sure what that has to do with either the NYT essay or MaryAnn’s review. And your pathetic decision to insult the hostess of this site says all I need to know about how seriously I should consider your comment. You are so on point with a LOT of this (I was on the fence about seeing it), especially it vilifying mental illness. I saw this today with my nurse friend, and that aspect of it pissed him off the most. People with mental illnesses are not to be feared or ostracized, but to empathize and help them integrate with society. In that aspect, Phillips and Scott Silver missed the point by a country mile. But there are some promising scenes in the film that, had they been handled by Scorsese or Nolan (or any other director than Todd Phillips), would’ve hit the mark. It wasn’t designed to have closure, as far as I can tell.  The future has yet to be written, and not just in the Dark Knight Rising sense. There are a lot of things wrong with this trash pile of a review… but in keeping solidarity with the garbageman strike… let’s just a toss a couple of pieces around for fun. Sounds like you can get the full Joker experience by watching the interviews of the director complaining it’s impossible to be irreverent or shocking in comedy anymore because everyone is so sensitive at the same time It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is starting its 14th season. You know, I admit to some blasphemy as a Batfamily fan: the Joker is one of my least favorite villains, in no small part because it beggars belief that someone hasn’t popped him yet. But turning him into an incel? Good grief. YES! It’s like when Rob Zombie gave Michael Myers an abusive childhood. Part of the reason Michael Myers is so scary is that there’s nothing you can pin his behavior on: he’s just evil, and seemingly was born that way. THAT’S scary. Oh, honey: If you think ANYTHING related to Batman isn’t political and shouldn’t be seen as political, it’s only because you exist in a bubble of privilege that protects you from having to deal with any of the shit that this character and related characters have ever been about. But why don’t you tell us what you think this movie is trying to convey, why there’s nothing political about that, and why no one should look at it politically. Out of curiosity, have you ever supported yourself working a punch-clock type job? I don’t mean a temporary part-time summer job, I mean you paid bills and rent that way. Ever waited tables, drove a delivery truck, any kind “everyman/woman” type of job for years? You talk about “privilege” a lot. Would it be accurate to assume you’ve never once changed the transmission fluid in a car – wouldn’t have the vaguest idea where to begin and are completely repulsed by the notion of doing so, never installed a new water heater or toilet, so much as sharpened a lawnmower blade – because you’ve always had the privilege of some man – often a white man – doing it for you whether paid or voluntarily? No, I am not under that impression. Are YOU under the impression that there is no difference in how such things are approached and treated depending how much money and privilege you have? Would it be accurate to assume you’ve never once changed the transmission fluid in a car – wouldn’t have the vaguest idea where to begin and are completely repulsed by the notion of doing so, never installed a new water heater or toilet, so much as sharpened a lawnmower blade – because you’ve always had the privilege of some man – often a white man – doing it for you whether paid or voluntarily? No, it would not be accurate. I have done plenty of my own repairs — to cars, to toilets — without any help from a man. Paid or not. Unbelievably good film. Phoneix is sensational (as expected, since he is the best screen actor on the planet), cinematograpahy gorgeous, set design off the scale, story hopelessly + depressingly believable, soundtrack flawless. Honestly, the best new film I have seen for years. I pity you that you’re so entrenched and suffocated by your dogma that you can’t appreciate high art. I think we know: the “average viewer” is a straight white cis able-bodied man. Which actually defines a minority of humans, but our culture — which is run by those guys — trains those guys to believe that that are the “default,” “neutral” human. And they REALLY don’t like to hear that that is, in fact, not the case at all. This is a movie so dull, so obvious, that that is the most criminal thing about its portrait of a man “driven” to criminality by “society.” Oh, is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix: Mary Magdalene, Irrational Man) — soon to be the homicidal antagonist to Batman known as the Joker — sad? Is he lonely? Is his life not what he’d hoped it would be? Welcome to humanity, asshole. Deal with it. Wow, you didn’t bother to examine or ponder the details…at all. It’s obvious you’re determined to view it through a particular lens – clearly your glasses only have a left lens. You manage to smuggle race and misandry into the first sentence.  I freeze-framed to read as much as possible of his mother’s letter to Thomas Wayne and also the case file he took but the high points were covered in the dialogue. There’s a *lot* more going on with Arthur than being some slob who wants the world handed to him. He’s dealing with some real problems he doesn’t have control over. He was viciously abused as a child and finds out that his mother who he’s been taking care of did nothing to protect him from someone she brought into contact with Arthur. I gather as he’s learning of this some memories of the abuse come back to him and/or he begins to see it with the clearer context of his mother’s involvement. It turns out what he at first thinks is a revelation about Thomas Wayne being his father is a lie or at least a delusion on the part of his mother. And it’s not the only falsehood his mother has been perpetrating.  Yeah, he works at trying to be a comedian. He gives it an earnest effort but he’s hampered by psychological handicaps and a lack of talent. You seem to be projecting some bitterness of your own. Seems you would feel some common ground with and empathy for someone struggling to be successful and gain notoriety in a niche pursuit.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," It’s difficult to fathom anyone who has actually seen “Joker” coming away with the impression it’s a sympathetic origin story or it glorifies mob violence and bloody anarchy. To the contrary. As embodied by an emaciated, maniacal, wild-eyed Joaquin Phoenix, who dances like a life-size marionette, laughs uncontrollably at the most inappropriate times and feels alive for the first time in his life only after he kills, “Joker” is a chilling character study centered around the series of events in Gotham City that resulted in the transformation of the sad loner Arthur Fleck into one of the most storied (and psychopathic) comic book supervillains of all time. Yes, the murderous Joker becomes front-page tabloid material, and yes, mobs of mask-wearing thugs intent on literally burning down the establishment hail Joker as their inspiration. But the MOVIE itself doesn’t glorify violence, nor does it ever paint this psychopath in anything approaching a favorable spotlight (although we do learn some horrific details about his background, and we see how much worse he becomes when he’s off his medication). Director and co-writer Todd Phillips (best known for comedies such as the “Hangover” movies and “Old School”) has delivered a dark, intense, well-photographed examination of a damaged and dangerous soul who lashes out at a society that has stepped over him and looked right through him his entire life — that is, when they’re not making him the butt of their jokes. We recoil at Joker’s sudden bursts of mayhem, which are rendered in a realistic, blood-soaked manner rarely seen in films featuring comic book characters. (When thousands or even millions are killed in Marvel and D.C. Universe movies, the deaths are cloaked in PG-13 visuals and often shown from a distance, with no focus on any particular individual’s demise. Here, the killings are seen in jarring close-ups and medium shots, producing a much more visceral effect.) Borrowing elements from “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” and even taking a page from an infamous real-life vigilante subway shooting in New York City that took place in roughly the same early 1980s time period as this movie, “Joker” is bathed in dark, ominous tones of brown and deep blue and shades of gray — in sharp contrast to Arthur Fleck/Joker’s increasingly splashy wardrobe. (By the time Joker has fully embraced his insanity and celebrates with a stairwell dance routine, he’s wearing a bright red suit with a pumpkin-colored vest, he’s in full clown makeup and he has put streaks of green in his hair.) At times the film overdoes it with the clown metaphors (including the use of songs such as “Everybody Plays the Fool” and “Send in the Clowns”), and I had major misgivings about one particular subplot, but with Phoenix appearing in virtually every minute of this movie and dominating the screen with his memorably creepy turn, “Joker” will cling to you like the aftermath of an unfortunately realistic nightmare. When we meet Arthur Fleck, he’s a walking punchline who’s considered weird even by the other misfit outcasts working for a grimy company that hires out low-rent clowns for store promotions and birthday parties and hospital visits. Arthur lives with his shut-in mother (Frances Conroy, doing excellent work) in a decrepit apartment complex, and he has a bit of crush on the single mother (Zazie Beetz) down the hall. Arthur’s mother once worked for billionaire businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of Bruce Wayne, who is about 7 years old in this timeline. Mom keeps writing letters to Mr. Wayne, insisting to Arthur that he’d help them if he only knew how they were living. Simmering tensions in Gotham City have reached the near-boiling point. Bags of garbage are piled up everywhere as the result of a weeks-long sanitation workers strike. Unemployment is high. Essential social services are being cut. After a man in clown-face kills three yuppies on the subway, protesters take to the streets wearing clown masks and demonstrate outside a fancy benefit screening of “Modern Times” (providing an excuse for a scene in which Arthur/Joker laughs uproariously at Charlie Chaplin’s famous roller-skating scene). When Thomas Wayne, who is considering a run for mayor of Gotham City, goes on TV and says people like him who have made something of themselves will always think of those who haven’t succeeded as “clowns,” well, them’s rioting words. Even as Arthur sinks deeper into his darkness and discovers he feels zero remorse about committing murder, he continues to pursue his ludicrous fantasy about becoming a stand-up comic. That brings us to the aforementioned plot thread that nearly takes “Joker” off the rails at times. In a perhaps too-meta nod to “The King of Comedy,” Robert De Niro (who played the talk show host-obsessed lunatic in Scorsese’s 1983 film) is now on the other side of the stalking as one Murray Franklin, a Johnny Carson-esque late-night talk show host who invites Arthur onto his show after coming across a clip of Arthur bombing at a Gotham City nightclub. When Arthur/Joker joins “Live! With Murray Franklin,” it’s so surreal and jarring (and unrealistic, even with the confines of this grim fairy tale), I kept wondering if it might be a fantasy sequence. Still, even though the scene isn’t nearly as shocking as it might have intended to be, and even though it’s more weird than dramatically impactful, Phoenix mesmerizes as the worst talk show guest in the history of ever. Pro tip: When a guest shows up in dramatic clown make-up at a time when the city is reeling from the havoc ignited by a killer in clown make-up, you might want to call the cops or at the very least bump him and give more time to the musical act.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," As Arthur Fleck, a perpetually humiliated, bullied and marginalized Gotham City clown for hire dreaming of a career in stand-up comedy, Joaquin Phoenix regards himself in a makeup mirror. He hooks two fingers under his upper lip. He pulls, hard, distorting his face into a mirthless grin. Unblinking, Phoenix holds the position, for as long as he can stand it. A tear rolls down his whiteface cheek. The audience subconsciously begs for relief, settling in for two more hours. Arthur says it himself: “I haven’t been happy one minute of my entire ——g life.” The movie, directed by and co-written by Todd Phillips, honors his pain by being one. Gaunt and scarily emaciated here, Phoenix did something similar in the brilliant interrogation sequence in “The Master,” not blinking on a dare until long after the tears rolled. There, it felt scary and revealing and true. Here it’s a grim party trick, performed by a clown on the edge of bloody psychosis. For a while — and for its many enthralled admirers, “a while” will equate to all 122 minutes — “Joker” gets by on sheer morbidity, saving its most explicit bursts of violence for the final third. You’d be an idiot to bring kids to this; at the Chicago preview screening, one family, with preteens, bailed an hour and a half too late, right after an eye-stabbing, neck-spurting, skull-crushing doozy, signaling Arthur’s descent into righteous madness. I’ll give it this much:  In its look, texture and screw-tightening depiction of 1981-era Gotham City, looking like New York City on the cusp of the crack era, “Joker” casts some sort of evil spell. Shot in various parts of New York City, Jersey City, N.J. and Newark, N.J. for maximum Reagan-era decay, the movie follows our title character’s tiny, miserable life. He lives in a dingy tenement flat with his foggy-headed mother (Frances Conroy). Hers is the only kindness Arthur knows, though even that turns out to be built on a horrific betrayal of trust. Down at the clown dispatch office, after a brutal mugging, Arthur takes a tip from a thuggish coworker (Glenn Fleshler) and buys a pistol for protection against all the “animals” and “savages” roaming the streets, “Death Wish” style. This leads to the one scene in “Joker,” set in what appears to be the cancer ward of a children’s hospital, where everything clicks in the best/worst way: Entertaining the patients with a song and a dance, Arthur drops the gun on the floor and then tries to turn it into a bit. Though it’s a standalone origin story, “Joker” plays by the rules and rolls up to the DC “Batman” universe for context. For years Arthur’s mother has been writing letters to investment banking giant Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), her onetime employer and perhaps more than that. Arthur sneaks a look at one of the letters, and what he learns about his family history brings him, furtively, with malicious intent, to the gates of Wayne Manor and a brief encounter with young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson, briefly seen sliding down a pole “Batman” style). Much of “Joker” turns the hand-held digital cameras toward Phoenix, alone and in eyebrow-to-upper-lip closeup, as he dances down the longest staircase in Gotham City, or floats in a reverie behind closed doors, in the throes of the only high he knows: the aftermath of killing. The first big kill sets up the rules for the rest of the movie: On a graffiti-strewn train, Arthur’s bullied and beaten by three “Wall Street guys” who work for Wayne Investments. Arthur’s revenge takes a page from the Bernhard Goetz subway shooter playbook. Except for one murder committed off-screen in the epilogue, everybody this proto-Joker kills in “Joker” has it coming. His killings are emotionally and even morally justified in the filmmaker’s eyes. Arthur’s hapless stand-up routine features painful jokes about mental illness, and in the climax, involving Arthur and his late-night TV idol Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the movie again lays it on with a trowel. About to become a reality-TV superstar, Arthur references the recent Reagan-style social service agency cuts that have left him without medication. Reports of “Joker” being sensitive and serious about mental illness turn out to be true in an utterly false way. The movie’s heart breaks for this guy, even as it exploits Arthur’s case history for cheap dread every second. In a year of mass culture that gave us HBO’s excellent “Chernobyl,” “Joker” can claim the grimmest depiction of a meltdown. The vibe of the picture comes from much better movies of the ’70s and ’80s, among them: “The French Connection,” “Taxi Driver,” “The King of Comedy” and many more. In full and newly Joker-ized makeup backstage, Arthur mentions to his Carson-like idol Murray that he’s not in any way political, and that he’s not part of the Gotham City anti-rich protests raging outside. The targets, among other heartless plutocrats, include Thomas Wayne, who earlier calls the unidentified subway killer a coward, and his mask-wearing acolytes “clowns.” In interviews, in which he has testily expressed his unhappiness with the current “woke” sensitivity in the culture, director Phillips has said his movie is “insane” and “not for everyone” and, above all, “irreverent.” It’s an ideological scramble, taking one from column A (the “Death Wish” vigilante routine) and two from column B (calling out Reagan-era funding cuts that left countless mentally ill patients to struggle on their own). As many have noted, Arthur’s a classic incel candidate, an involuntary celibate steeped in resentments and dreams of the good life, with a beautiful woman by his side and a more civil and just society. In his aggrieved urban-white-male rage, he can sit at the same poker table as the guy from “Falling Down,” next to Travis Bickle from the genuinely, profoundly ambiguous and unsettling “Taxi Driver.” Early on Arthur incel-stalks his neighbor (Zazie Beetz, playing a symbol of what Arthur cannot have, rather than a human being). Later, at the social service agency office about to close up for good, the weary social service worker (Sharon Washington) lays it out for him, in a typical sledgehammer line: “They don’t give a —t about people like you, Arthur.” Warner Brothers doesn’t want any trouble at the theaters when “Joker” opens; nobody does, I hope. The film, the studio declared in a statement, is not “an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind.” Let’s say it isn’t. So what is it, then? I wonder if “Joker” came together with Phoenix in the lead because one first-rate actor wanted to test his mettle against what another first-rate actor, Heath Ledger, did with the role in an infinitely better DC Comics-derived picture, “The Dark Knight” (2008). The shot of Ledger, leaning out of a speeding car, feeling the breeze in his ratty hair after another round of killing — it’s recycled twice in “Joker.” The stand-up comedy angle comes from “The King of Comedy,” but also and first from Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke.” Years later, author Moore recanted his effort, saying: “I don’t think it’s a very good book. It’s not saying anything very interesting.” He may as well have been reviewing “Joker.”",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," In 2006, director Todd Phillips passed through Philadelphia to chat about his  movie School for Scoundrels, and at some point our conversation turned to his wish list of future projects. Phillips said he was trying to put together a documentary about Vegas comedian Carrot Top, who had become wealthy via a lucrative casino gig, but lacked the one thing he wanted most: the validation of other comedians. I don’t think Phillips ever made that doc, although he did give Carrot Top a cameo in the credits sequence of The Hangover three years later. But I suspect elements of that project found their way into Joker, the director’s make-your-skin-crawl new addition to the DC canon. It’s the story of a performing clown and aspiring stand-up (Joaquin Phoenix) who turns a lifetime of abuse and, ultimately, rejection by one of his comedy idols (Robert DeNiro) into homicidal rage that becomes a social contagion. Mayhem engulfs Gotham, class resentments erupt in violence, though by that time whatever inspired the story (you’re off the hook, Carrot Top) has been completely altered and subsumed by Phoenix’s seething performance in the title role. The actor gives so much emotional and psychological weight to his character, Arthur Fleck, that he places Joker beyond most of the posted limits (Heath Ledger’s Joker is his closest rival) of comic-book movies. Good luck putting this character on screen with Aquaman. The movie tells us this much about Fleck: He has been institutionalized. He takes seven different medications to treat an unspecified mental illness. He’s being treated by a state-appointed psychiatrist. There’s a glibness to that response that suggests the movie’s genre origins, but Phoenix turns it into the pitiable and believable confession of a man with severe psychological problems (and also a neurological condition that causes inappropriate laughter), who’s thought of ending his life, and who presses on mainly to care for the invalid mother (Frances Conroy). So we fear the worst when, not long into the story, he is cut off from medication and care, and someone at work hands him a gun. We fear the worst, and we get it. A subway massacre turns Fleck into an icon whose clown face finds semipermanent residence on the front page of Gotham tabloids, and a vigilante folk hero (his victims are loathsome Wall Street bros who are irredeemably awful except for being weirdly fluent in Sondheim). You can feel Phillips struggling to place this violence somewhere in a context that audiences can accept, or at least tolerate. He  references, for instance, other famous movies about troubled loners. Look, he says, I’m only doing a  variation on ideas already introduced in King of Comedy or Taxi Driver. Phillips also plays up themes of inequality and one-percenter arrogance, though frankly these were handled with much more sophistication and consistency in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises. Yet having unleashed Phoenix, Phillips doesn’t seem to know how to contain or couch the performance. At some point he seems to have surrendered, and when the movie is over you realize Arthur is its only substantial character. DeNiro is a thin composite, and actors like WTF Podcast pioneer Marc Maron and Bill Camp have cameo-sized appearances. Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2, Altanta) plays a woman whom Arthur would like to date, but the role is insubstantial by dramatic necessity and by design. The weakest elements are narrative shout-outs to the Batman mythos, built around Bruce Wayne’s parents, which point to a sequel that might require yet more energy from Phoenix, who already looks gaunt and spent (I’d much prefer to see Phoenix in a sequel to Inherent Vice, but I’m pretty much alone in that regard). The closest thing Phoenix has to a viable costar is Gotham itself, a visually detailed and interesting evocation of 1980s New York, though in the end this is nearly undone by the images of clown gangs run amok. It plays like outtakes from The Purge, and the sinister slow motion pan of a passing clown face — shown repeatedly in Joker — is such a cliché it’s been turned into parody in the Taco Bell commercials. You can laugh at these nacho-cheesy moments, but it’s not so easy to dismiss Phoenix’s creepy turn here, pulling the viewer along as he makes the journey from victim to victimizer, a killer who stages media-ready murder spectacles meant to stand as a perverse public monument to his isolation and pain. The kind of guy, in other words, whom we see in the paper every month, taking a rifle to concerts, malls, and movie theaters. Joker can be seen as a sincere attempt to understand such men. And they need to be understood so they can be stopped — I’m not sure they need an origin story, certainly not one that ends as repulsively as Joker.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 2, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ take on the iconic Batman nemesis has a lot on its mind. Too bad it blasts it all so relentlessly almost none of it leaves a lasting mark. Presented as an origins story, we see what’s behind Joker, the character we’ve met in other, some far more compelling, takes. But this is no mere meet-the-bad-guy tale. Phillips takes this admittedly huge opportunity and throws just about everything, it feels, into the mix. There are Statements (with a capital S) including but not limited to: society’s treatment of the mentally ill, society’s treatment of the not mentally ill, the state of violence, comedy, the media and even a few rich references to Antifa. And it’s presented as a nod to several earlier films, most notably Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Just in case you don’t get that, Robert DeNiro shows up in a few scenes which only made me wish I were watching the far more eloquent Taxi Driver or King of Comedy. And the dazzling The Irishman, a film Phillips’ couldn’t have known would also serve up, and far more profoundly, a remarkable look at much of what he squeezes in here. He also squeezes in some appearances from a few fine actors, most of whom are given barely any time on screen. Because this picture, moral ambitions aside, is really only about one thing. And that’s Joaquin Phoenix’s central performance. Perhaps had this whole endeavor not been edited with a sledgehammer, Phoenix’s adventurous work might have shown the softness that could have drawn us into his plight. I never felt pulled in to this brutal and gruesome film, even when plot points serve up the opportunity on a platter. Instead, I sat back, watching an often fine actor deliver some interesting moments, waiting anxiously for the whole thing to be over.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," There's an old joke that posits as a curse ""May you live in interesting times."" I'll just leave that there as I ask, what is Joker? Comic-book movie or “artisan film”? Cultural think piece or reckless endangerment? Director/co-writer Todd Phillips—best known for The Hangover and its sequels—has taken Batman’s most famous villain for a joy(less)ride, and the results are decidedly mixed. And yet Joker qualifies as riveting due to its casting coup of installing Joaquin Phoenix as the homicidal Clown Prince of Crime. For years, Phoenix has steadily built a case for himself as the heir to Method-acting giants like Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, and since Phillips’ cover-song mashup riffs on the Batman franchise by channeling two of Martin Scorsese and De Niro’s best cinematic collaborations—The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver—Joker’s most stealthily moving moment may be when Phoenix tightly hugs De Niro, like a son grasping for his father’s love and approval. In the film’s context, of course, it’s Phoenix’s mentally ill clown and aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (soon to be reborn as Joker) hugging De Niro’s network-TV late-night talk-show host Murray Franklin. Fleck quickly proves to be the ultimate male outcast, piled upon even more than Taxi Driver’s titular Vietnam war vet Travis Bickle. Sharing a grimy Gotham City walkup with his fragile mother (Frances Conroy), Fleck’s a veteran of institutionalization, taking on grim gig after grim gig as a clown for hire between psych sessions with a social worker (Sharon Washington). Ominously, she’s his only conduit to his cocktail of seven different meds, and inevitably Fleck’s lifelines get cut off one by one, leaving him dangerously adrift. In this pre-Batman Gotham, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) hovers on the sidelines as the mayoral candidate who makes paternalistic populist promises but keeps veering into callous condescension. This may be Joker’s most interesting subversion amid the film's magpie style and thematic muddle: in the process of positioning supervillain Joker as working-class antihero, the film reckons with Wayne’s super-elite status and gated mansion in a manner that eats away at his typically philanthropic image. Pointedly, both Wayne and Franklin spit out the word “pal” numerous times at Fleck, in the process of treating him more like mosquito than man (Franklin’s a comic who “punches down”). If Joker has lessons to impart, they are these: don’t bully, because your victim may be the next mass murderer, beware rousing the poor rabble, and oh yeah, allocate more social resources to mental health. Unfortunately, that Joker is a hero in his own mind leads to triumphant imagery that could be read as glorifying him. By taking what’s usually escapist or mythic fare and turning it into a grotty psychological horror film, a neo-Psycho, the filmmakers create something unusual and off-putting. Christopher Nolan considered the Joker’s legacy and aptly positioned the character as a symbolic boogeyman, the embodiment of anarchy and a man without a past. By contrast, Fleck’s psychosis gets specific backstory and, well, frontstory as the protagonist of a character study that takes us inside his diseased mindset. Counterintuitively, the approach of giving the Joker’s psychosis this much weight in real-world terms gives the impression of trivializing mental illness. Absent a moral compass, the film relies on the audience to remember to bring theirs. By turns, Fleck is the archetypal male stalker (of his young single-mother neighbor, played by Zazie Beetz) and the archetypal edge-of-madness, attention-seeking social outcast liberated by homicidal gun violence (“people are starting to notice,” he enthuses). The film suggests that empathy would go a long way to solving a problem like Arthur, and even occasionally finds true empathy for its protagonist (when he writes in his journal, “The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don’t”), but audiences are flocking to see him go homicidally insane, and they won’t be disappointed in that regard. Joker makes strong aesthetic use of its 1980s New York-ish milieu, well designed by Mark Friedberg and photographed byLawrence Sher, and Phillips proves adept at stoking tension. The latter task may not be terribly difficult with De Niro and star attraction Phoenix generating the heat, but Phillips knows what side his bread is buttered on, consistently showcasing his star's ability to take a feeling or a suggestion and turn it into a wrenching acting aria or an evocative interpretive dance: this Joker loves cutting a rug when he's feeling good, in reveries that provide stark contrast to the neurological condition that makes him a choking prisoner of involuntary, self-torturous laughter. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter) obviously began their quest to tell a standalone Joker origin story by repurposing the Scorsese films, their most memorable moments (the “you talking to me?” soliloquy, finger-gun-to-the-head, and bloody slayings from Taxi Driver, a talk show held hostage from The King of Comedy), and their historical contexts (vigilante subway murderer Bernie Goetz, the edgy Late Night with David Letterman appearances of Andy Kaufman, Crispin Glover, and the like), hucking them into the gumbo along with a mess of ironic if obvious cultural references to mirth (Chaplin in Modern Times and song standards “Send in the Clowns,” “Smile,” “That’s Life”). In many respects, Joker hearkens all the way back to the 1928 silent The Man Who Laughs, which inspired the comics character in the first place. Kick in antipathy for the police, clown masks purposed like Guy Fawkes masks in riotous street protests (and is that a Trump effigy in the crowd?), and Joker winks at the state of the nation and the globe. As Fleck asks his counselor, “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” That question certainly taps the zeitgeist. Ask the 11.4 million Americans, 36% of whom go untreated according to the Department of Health and Human Services, who suffer from “serious mental illness,” numbers growing amid worrying climate change and political chaos. Joker isn’t the film to seriously tackle the issue—it's more concerned with flair than genuine inquiry—but Phoenix’s pained, raw-nerve performance is one for the ages.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," If ever there was a movie that does not live up to its hype, it is Todd Phillips’ much debated Joker. A stripped down, deconstructed comic book movie, Joker is supposedly the most inflammatory, dangerous, provocative film of the year—of the era!—a movie that is maybe causing a moral panic and fanning the flames of the culture war. Don’t call it a superhero movie, this is a prestige drama! Joker won the Golden Lion at Venice, it is unlike any other comic book movie that has come before! Unfortunately, Joker can’t deliver on any of that hype. There are elements that are good, even very good, but overall the movie suffers from devastating self-importance, a total lack of consideration, and, worse, it has no point of view. It’s Taxi Driver for Dummies, a kind of cinematic crib sheet copying homework from Martin Scorsese. It’s not perverse or daring, it’s not even really interesting. Joker is mostly just an ugly, nihilistic swan dive into the nastiest parts of our society. That would be fine if it had anything to say about said society, but Joker does not have an opinion other than “people are sh-tty”. Not surprising coming from Phillips, one of cinema’s great misanthropes, but it is a singularly uninteresting observation. Thank god, then, for Joaquin Phoenix. He is so watchable he almost makes Joker work in spite of itself. Sporting a startlingly lean frame—it looks like his bones are about to escape his skin at any moment—and working a braying laugh, Phoenix manages to wrest the Joker out of the shadow of Heath Ledger and create something that is interesting in its own right. We follow Phoenix as proto-Joker Arthur Fleck, a menial laborer in the Gotham City of circa 1980, where citizens are dealing with a debilitating garbage strike and plagued by overwhelming public ennui. Arthur is barely getting by, working as a clown-for-hire who promptly gets mugged in the opening scene. He splits his time between work, court-mandated therapy, and caring for his house-bound mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who is fixated on Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and writes him letters begging for help. Phoenix’s screen presence and magnetism give Arthur some verve, but Phillips, who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver, squanders that energy in a stupidly simple story. This is a movie that swings between Arthur’s very understandable frustration with a broken-down healthcare system, to Arthur crossing out words on a sign so that it says, “Don’t Smile”. Joker could have done something interesting with a Gotham driven to the brink by wealth inequality, with a Joker that springs from a frustrated working class and not the usual mob background, and a Thomas Wayne who throws money at problems he doesn’t really understand, which only fuels the frustration that eventually creates his son’s arch-nemesis. Instead, Arthur is making “Don’t Smile” signs and Joker blames everything on mental illness: Arthur has a traumatic brain injury, and he starts sliding into villainy after he stops receiving therapy. If Joker had any willingness to meaningfully deal with our own real-world phenomenon of frustrated white men who murder, it could do more with a Gotham on the brink and a villain hailed as a hero (for a moment, anyway). Instead, it comes down to “bad brain = bad man”. It’s an offensive over-simplification. There are other elements of the movie that work, such as Hildur Gudnadottir’s score and Lawrence Sher’s cinematography, but the story mechanics are so bad the technical elements can’t save Joker. I won’t go so far to say that it’s garbage, because it looks and sounds too good, but this is not a narrative that works. Besides cravenly scapegoating the mentally ill, Joker has no perspective on anything except that Joaquin Phoenix is a really good actor. The movie so lacks focus that, despite all protestations to the contrary, the final shot IS celebratory, showing a Joker embodied, embraced, and exulted. There is no counterpoint, no contrast to the Joker’s actions, which means that while the movie may not endorse real-world violence, it certainly endorses the violence of its fictional world. That would be fine if Joker had anything to say about that (fictional) violence, but it does not.  Joker is the film equivalent of a high school dork dressed in black scribbling “everyone is stupid” in his notebook. That kid is so busy sealing himself in his cynicism he doesn’t develop an actual personality, he just learns how to get attention by being obnoxious. That’s Joker. It’s garish and seedy in a cinematically unappealing way, harking back to the New York crime dramas of the 1970s and 1980s, but it has no substance of its own, it only has borrowed affectations and cheap nihilism. Joaquin Phoenix lends a dramatic flair that is otherwise unearned, and “people are sh-tty” is hardly a daring stand against society. It’s kind of amazing such an empty spectacle has sparked so much heated debate, but then, comic book movies usually are over-hyped.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Origin stories are essays in flamboyant imposture. They treat an unreal character as if he had a real background, with a plausible prehistory filling in the prelude to fantastical fiction. From Young Frankenstein to Batman Begins to this week’s Joker, these movies specialise in an in-your-face, eyeball-to-eyeball impudence, though the face can be completely straight even as it butts up against yours.  The face is certainly straight — in a glowering, scary way — in Todd Phillips’s triumphant riff, lionised at Venice (Leone d’Oro), on a character we already know or thought we did. Previous screen Jokers have included Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. “What the world needs now,” Phillips seems to say, “is a psychological explanation for Batman’s most colourful foe.” An explanation that will reach back to his origins as a white-faced clown, stand-up comic and victim of pseudobulbar affect. Victim of what? It’s not named in the film, but PBA is the condition symptomatised by involuntary laughing and crying. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck cackles and weeps into mirrors — that’s how we first meet him in a clowns’ dressing-room — and can’t stop cackling, with laughter or tears, even when sitting down with his social worker. Phoenix gives the role a frightening intensity. This actor doesn’t favour dilettante distancing. He steps right through the looking glass to become the character he has been staring at. Fleck dwells in a seedy apartment with a gaunt, wheedling, Mrs Bates-ish mother (Frances Conroy). He fantasises that a barely known black neighbour (Zazie Beetz) is his girlfriend. The other triggering people in his life are men and enemies: Gotham City politicking plutocrat Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and his little son Bruce, and cheesy, florid television chat-show host Murray Franklin (hammed-up a dream by Robert De Niro). Never mind “fake news”, Franklin is the face of a worse demon: fake love. Fake zest, friendliness and bonhomie.  Joker is partly a film about other films, but the surprise film drawn on is Scorsese’s The King of Comedy. This time De Niro steps the other side of the idol/idolator mirror to become Jerry Lewis — or more exactly Johnny Carson shading into Jay Leno — to his volatile younger fan. By the time the two meet on air, Gotham itself has become a seething ocean of clown-faced or clown-masked protesters. They flood the streets to decry corruption, wave banners and fight back against assailing cops. It’s eerily up-to-the-minute. We could be anywhere from Hong Kong to London’s Parliament Square, via an imagined post-cataclysmic America. Come dressed as a scary clown to protest against the scary clowns who lead us. In the dystopia according to Todd Phillips (a film-maker barely recognisable here as the one who gave us Road Trip and the Hangover trilogy), the only true authenticity may be hate: the hate born of thwarted love.  If you think too long about Joker and what it says, you may want to kill yourself. Then again, a film that shows you your own era in a truthful reflection is not a call to suicide. It’s a call to understanding and enlightenment. Nightmares are what we learn from in order to regain the power to dream.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," CLEVELAND, Ohio - “I just hope my death makes more cents (sic) than my life,” reads an entry in the twisted diary of madman Arthur Fleck. He keeps circling back to it amid the messy drool of psychotic notes, anti-social scribbles and the ominous doodles of an unhinged mind. Not just because the line underscores what has thus far been a worthless life. It also promises that something big just might be around the corner for Mr. Fleck. “Joker,” Todd Phillips’ much-anticipated origin story about the DC Comics supervillain, is endlessly big from beginning to end. It obsessively focuses on Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) -- a failed comedian who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) and has taken to working as a street clown. It opens with Fleck dancing about while carrying an EVERYTHING MUST GO sign on the sidewalk. Of course, there is a double meaning here: Yes, clown is promoting a sale for a shop on the street. But everything really must go in the corrupt, decadent hole that Gotham City has become. The 122-minute film is set amid an ongoing garbage worker strike in a city full of economic injustice, where the haves are few and filthy rich and the have-nots are an alienated afterthought and getting angrier by the day. In the first scene, the street clown endures a beating at the hands of teens who steal his sign. It’s one of who-knows-how-many assaults he has endured over the years – and we don’t need a flashback to know this. The scars on Fleck’s face and back and the deep psychological pain in his sunken eyes are the proof. At this point, Fleck is hardly the agent of chaos we’ve come to know and love/hate in the Batman franchises, which makes “Joker” an operatic study in character transformation. Phoenix is brilliant at exploring the depths of his demise to his ascent to avenging angel gone horribly wrong. He punctuates every step with sneering laughter. Yes, it makes him seem like a nut-job and a leper to those around him, but it also achieves a deeper effect not unlike the laughter of a clown in Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice.” Society is collapsing and it’s just a matter of when it all comes down. Of course, “Joker” isn’t some modernist novel. It sits squarely in the canon of alienation cinema. It also pays homage to movies and anti-heroes past. Phoenix’s light-on-the-toes, vaudeville-dance-like movements are reminiscent of Alex in “A Clockwork Orange.” The film even appropriates the Warner Bros. logo from the opening of Stanley Kubrick’s sci-fi tale of a violent young man. “Joker” is also indebted to “Taxi Driver,” Martin Scorsese’s story of an alienated man who has “some bad ideas in [his] head.” An apartment scene in which Fleck points a gun at a TV set is straight homage to Travis Bickle. So is the revelation that, “Here is a man who would not take it anymore.” While set in what appears to be the early-1980s, “Joker” recalls the dirty, gritty milieu and streets of “Taxi Driver” – a city that could use a rain to “come and wash all this scum off the streets.” ""Joker"" also owes a sizable debt to another Scorsese film, ""The King of Comedy"" -- about a crazed comedian who ends up going on TV. ""Joker"" even reprises Robert De Niro, who played Scorsese's comic and, this time around, plays a talk-show host. Of course, Batman fans will compare Phoenix’s Joker to the one portrayed by Heath Ledger in “The Dark Knight.” Phoenix and Ledger were friends and the former’s portrayal of Joker owes much to the latter’s. Phoenix explores the Joker with mesmerizing detail, twisting his body and shape-shifting his face to go from sullen gloom to sneering disgust. As he reveals to his mother, he’s never been happy in life, for even a minute. Fans of the comic-book film might find that a bridge too far; the violence, like the mood, is raw and realistic – hence the R rating. The soundtrack, meanwhile, all too often resorts to an all-too-obvious assembly line of discordant tones and old-timey tunes. Some silence – as Nolan used in “Dark Knight” -- would’ve helped given this nihilistic joy ride a striking counterpoint. After all, this origin story is best when it explores transformation. The Joker has yet to find a swagger, let alone become Ledger’s malevolent mastermind. Here stands a time-bomb with greasy hair who would not take it anymore. 'Joker' focuses on Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) -- a failed comedian who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) and has taken to working as a street clown. Todd Phillips' film proceeds to chronicle the rise of Batman's arch-nemesis.

"Oct 2, 2019"," In The Maximum Security Book Club, writer Mikita Brottman talked about the cognitive dissonance she had discussing the book Lolita with a group of inmates at a Maryland maximum security prison. Brottman, like many literary people, had fallen in love with the language of the book and, despite knowing that the protagonist was a pedophile and that she shouldn’t sympathize with him, found herself “mesmerized.” The prisoners in her book club, lacking that reverence for “literature,” were not manipulated by the language and just called Humbert Humbert what he was: “just an old pedo.” That’s how I felt watching Todd Phillips’ Joker. It was well acted, beautifully shot, and you can tell that Phillips has a great eye for shots and images, but if you take the script and just take it down to its essence, the film is about a severely mentally ill man stumbling into becoming a serial killer, except that it’s Batman-related. In Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who has already been institutionalized once, is on several medications, and works a crappy “rent-a-clown” job to pay the bills as he works to figure out how to be a stand-up comedian. He goes to mandated therapy with a case worker, who is clearly overworked and underpaid, and even that shuts down due to lack of funding. Oh, and he suffers from a condition where he laughs in comfortable situations. His mother, Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy), is also severely mentally ill and is obsessed with Thomas Wayne, who she used to work with a little over thirty years ago. Wow, that’s how old Fleck is! I wonder why that comes up. As for plot, that really comes together when, coming home from wearing his clown getup, Fleck is harassed by three rich Wayne corporation employees. They mock him and sing “Send in the Clowns” to him before beating him up. Fleck pulls out a gun and shoots one of them—in self defense, you could argue, initially, but then he decides to gun them all down (the Bernhard Goetz feel I got from the trailer was sadly on the nose). This attack starts an “anti-rich” sentiment in the impoverished Gotham City, where people see the “Killer Clown” as someone who took revenge on two more Gotham fat cats. If you’ve seen Fight Club or American Psycho, then you’ve essentially seen this movie. Despite its R rating, nothing that Phoenix’s Joker does feels scarier or more weighty than Heath Ledger’s pencil trick in The Dark Knight, which—while bloodless, due to the movie’s rating—shows you everything you need about the character and his state of mind. Giving us more blood doesn’t exactly mean much, at least not to me. Part of that is that, by breaking down the comic enigma of the Joker, all Phillips did was take the greatest hits of every serial killer or political assassin’s backstory and turn it into Arthur Fleck: severely mentally ill, no strong male role model (he actively longs for a father figure in the movie and is betrayed by both), emotionally abusive mother, desperate to be noticed by society, gets a somewhat sexual thrill from killing, etc. It goes on and on to the point where he stops being interesting and just becomes a collection of clichés in a suit. Thomas Wayne is running for mayor of Gotham because, as a rich person, someone who has “made something of himself,” he is the only one who can save the city. This depiction of the character was initially compared to Donald Trump, and I think that if Alec Baldwin had gone ahead with the role, it would have felt that way, but instead, he just seems like a member of one of the old rich families that run New York or any major city. The class ideas in the film are as under-baked as the rest of it, but it makes it clear that Joker is the product of a severely mentally ill person being ignored by society. This class war is what Gotham deserves. While not the incel movie that some people feared—and Zazie Beetz is such a non-factor in this movie that it’s almost a shame she was in it at all—the film does reiterate every “mentally ill white male shooter/terrorist” profile we’ve seen for years, which makes Todd Phillips’ confusion about the reasons why people would be concerned about this film so … strange. This isn’t Robocop or Fight Club, a satirical movie that the audience is missing the point of. This is taking a lot of those concepts and playing it straight, which, in the climate we have today, is naturally concerning. That being said, the discourse is probably the best thing that could happen to this movie, because the expectations for it have been so overblown that it’s frankly attracting more attention than it ever could on its own merits. Fundamentally, when I walked out of the film with my friend, we both felt the same. It added little on the level of an interesting crime thriller, and it also didn’t add anything to the Batman mythos itself, despite the interconnection of the two being the biggest draw of the film. Nothing about this makes Joker, the DC character, more interesting, and Joker adds nothing new to the genre without the way it works in the Batman angle—even then already retreading familiar ground, despite its best attempts. Still, the moment I really just turned the movie off in my brain was when it made a long little person joke after making another little person joke earlier in the movie. It was so gross and so childish that it sort of just summarized the whole movie. It is made well, but overall, it’s a childish, meandering story that didn’t deserve the attention it got, but also doesn’t deserve much other than acting praise.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2019"," Considering how long Warner Brothers have been mocked for trying to position themselves as the dark and edgy superhero studio, their marketing team must be congratulated for turning the ship around. Even before its release, audiences have been primed to regard Joker as a serious work of art, especially since it was awarded the prestigious Golden Lion at this year’s Venice Film Festival. With equal success, this latest origin story for Batman’s arch-nemesis has been talked up as a dangerous object capable of fuelling the rage of sexually frustrated shut-ins everywhere. Joker is not a particularly good film, much less an important one. It is, however, an interesting cultural phenomenon: the Venice prize may represent a milestone in the history of taste, implying a new conception of quality cinema. Whatever its pretensions, this is undeniably a comic-book movie; moreover it’s directed by the brazenly low-brow Todd Phillips, known for a string of wilfully tasteless comedies such as The Hangover. Phillips says he doesn’t see Joker as a major departure, and it’s clear what he means: he has made a career out of manchild movies and here is another. The manchild here is a mentally ill sadsack named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), who works as a children’s entertainer, dreams of success as a stand-up comedian and is apparently destined to metamorphose into the Clown Prince of Crime. The subtext is Phillips’ own aspiration to move up a notch or six in the Hollywood pecking order, which determines many of his choices as director and co-writer. Gotham City as envisaged here is modelled on the New York of 1970s films like Dog Day Afternoon and Taxi Driver – over-populated, crime-ridden and grimy in a manner that has since become a shorthand for cinematic integrity. Even more conspicuously, Joker takes many of its plot cues from Martin Scorsese’s prescient 1982 satire The King of Comedy, with Robert De Niro as a nut who idolises yet longs to supplant a talk-show host played by Jerry Lewis. Arthur similarly looks up to a talk-show host played by De Niro himself, whose authoritative performance is the best thing in the film; a homage to the era when showbusiness as a whole aspired to a respectability it did not quite possess. But the film pins most of its artistic hopes on Phoenix, playing yet another variant on the established Joaquin Phoenix Character: morose, potentially violent, inarticulate yet with glimmers of sensitivity. Arthur lives in a decrepit apartment with his ailing, half-crazed mother (Frances Conroy) with whom he has an unhealthily close relationship – exactly like the thuggish anti-hero Phoenix played two years ago in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here. Phoenix is the kind of actor who has to work hard to be uninteresting. But he never manages to make Arthur into a coherent person, partly because it’s hard to see this schmuck as any kind of future arch-villain and partly because the film’s thesis is kept broad and vague; sidestepping the moments where the character might forfeit our sympathy for good. Ultimately it’s Arthur’s mother who says what we’re all thinking: ""Don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?"" The trouble is that Phoenix is not funny – unlike, say, Jack Nicholson, whose shamelessly joyful interpretation of the Joker in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman set a standard all successors must be measured against. It’s quite a concept: a Joker who doesn’t know how to tell a joke and never learns. The punchline, if there is one, might have something to do with the character’s difficult relation to conventional, straight masculinity. When Arthur dons full clown make-up at the climax, his fey persona suggests a drag queen. Elsewhere he registers as virtually asexual despite the presence of Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) as his dream girl down the hall. But this is not the sort of subject-matter Phillips knows how to handle – and it's telling too that he seems to have forgotten that The King of Comedy contains not two remarkable performances but three. A 2019 remake with no equivalent to Sandra Bernhard? Seriously, you’ve got to be kidding.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2019"," First things first, put aside all your comic book hero expectations. DC’s Joker is one of the most famous icons, villains of all time. We’ve seen him portrayed across the decades in various incarnations and one even earned an Academy Award for it (Heath Ledger, for 2008’s The Dark Knight). But now, the spotlight shines on Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker in a way not seen before.  Gotham City 1980s. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is sitting in front of a mirror, painting his “clown face” on. When he’s done, he pulls his lips into a frown and then a smile. Fleck works for a clown agency, standing on the busy streets of Gotham, holding an “everything must go sign.” Fleck gets attacked by a group of kids, and when he returns to work, his boss gives him a gun for safety purposes. Fleck
suffers from Pseudobulbar affect (uncontrollable bouts of hysterical laughter).
He carries a laminated card that he shows to a woman on the bus, irritated by
his laughter. It’s not Fleck who has the problem, it’s society and the world we
live in. A society that judges and misunderstands. He has a mental health
condition, and it’s a brilliant scene and shot as Phillips lets us read the
card with the woman, “Forgive my laughter: I have a condition.” She doesn’t
apologize for her behavior.  Fleck lives at home with his fragile mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). They spend their nights watching late night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Franklin is his hero because Fleck aspires to be a standup comedian and serves almost as a father-figure to him. Every scene, every incident that Fleck experiences is building up to what finally makes him snap. And when he does, it’s a superbly executed scene with the sound design, the score, the editing all coming in aggressively, matching the tone of the moment. It takes place on the subway, and this is just the beginning of his transformation into Joker. What Phillips excels at is crafting a screenplay (co-written with Scott Silver) where you already feel sorry for him by this point. And you continue to do so as he fully evolves into the Joker. The
violence in the film is shocking and at times bloody, but it’s far from
gratuitous. But here is a man who has snapped. A man who has never really felt
“happy for one second of his life” and one who’s been pushed to his limit.  Fleck’s
world is one where his mother tells him he was put here to spread joy, but the
people who he admires and aspires to be like, mock him. He wants to be a
comedian, but he’s not even funny and Murray Franklin, his hero mocks him. He’s on seven different medications and his social worker informs him that with funding being cut, he’s no longer going to be treated or cared for. Fleck comments later how much better he feels without his medication, the world has become clearer for him. It’s a commentary on society.  Joker is exceptional. Joaquin Phoenix’s physical transformation for this role is astonishing. His  dive into mental illness is one that has never been seen before in any portrayal of this character. The unflinching look at mental illness and his mesmerizing and raw. Even his laugh that starts off as awkward, almost painful ends victoriously. Phoenix’s Joker is one you understand, that’s all he wants. His is one you feel for. Phoenix humanizes the character, and you simply can not take your eyes off of him and you can’t help but feel empathy for him. Phillips’ eye for directing here is crucial. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography is beautiful. Hildur Guðnadóttir’s urgent score and Jeff Groff’s editing all make for a dark and bold film, treading far from the world of comic books. This isn’t about action chases or big visual effects explosions. It’s dark, gritty and fearless.  His Gotham City is dirty, “super rats” have taken over the city. Maybe it’s metaphorical for the ultra-wealthy, they’re the rats.  Thomas Wayne, a billionaire ignores him and later punches him in the face. After the subway attack, Wayne says, “Gotham’s lost its way. What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask.”  The villains here are the rich and wealthy, Murray Franklin ends up mocking Arthur Fleck and publicly humiliating him. The culprit is society and what it does, it turns a blind eye. By no means am I justifying the violence.  Watch Joker as a commentary. Understand how society ignores someone just trying to make a living but doesn’t concern themselves with someone who has a mental illness. Watch it because Joaquin Phoenix delivers a mesmerizing performance and catapults into one of the best interpretations of Batman’s most famous archenemy and an equally Oscar-worthy performance. Watch it because Joker is truly a spectacle. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," “Joker,” winner of the prestigious Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival has created more than an Oscar stir.  The controversial film is also igniting anti-gun organizations’ political battles as Warner Bros. stands behind this origin story of The Joker.  Starring Joaquin Phoenix as the deranged, unstable and anti-social sociopath, director Todd Phillips (“The Hangover”) creates one of the franchise’s darkest and most disturbingly sinister back stories that actually rings true to the graphic novel.  While this certainly isn’t a film for every viewer, Phillips gives this genre’s fans a story that may change the DC Universe forever. The world around Arthur in the dark world of Gotham is out of control.  The political figures are vying for power, promising a brighter, safer world.  And it is within this political world displayed through the medium of television that the tentacles of connection reach out and betray Arthur.  Believing in a story told by his mother, Arthur begins to search for the truth about his own background, leading him down a path that will change him and Gotham.  And as they say, with knowledge, comes power, but in this case, it’s an extraordinarily evil power. With all of these underlying components, the film also depicts the lack of humanity and compassion, an integral part of the survival of mankind and a way for Joker to rise.  Without this compassion, chaos is unleashed, finding the perfect breeding ground for evil and rebellion, the two perhaps not so definitively separate.  Creating a film that has all of these aspects, but also setting up one of the most well-known good vs. evil super heroes scenarios in this universe is a huge undertaking that Phillips capably creates, but it is Phoenix’s performances that will ultimately haunt you long after the credits roll. As a piece of art, and film is an art form, “Joker” masterfully finds a voice for the brutal and believable backstory for The Joker.  Phoenix gives this character incredible realistic depth which may help you see others who struggle in a more compassionate way.  In the end, however, this is a film for super hero fans.  It stays true to the graphic novel and creates an incredibly realistic persona and world that hits very close to home; perhaps too close.  The shocking violence seems to be used for shock value alone rather than for the use of the plot.  Oh, and the running time is, of course, too long.  That seems to be a super hero film’s MO. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix plays a disturbed and mentally ill man named Arthur Fleck who isn't just having a bad day. Every day is bad for him as he's bullied and beaten for being different until he's snaps and goes down a path to become a version of the iconic Batman villain. The film takes place long before Bruce Wayne dons the famous cape and cowl. He's just young Bruce here and his dad, Thomas Wayne, is running for mayor of the ever-decaying Gotham City. You're probably going to leave the film feeling uncomfortable, but you'll also be wowed by Phoenix's performance. He's gunning for an Oscar nod as the Clown Prince of Crime and he may certainly get it.  I've been asking for a movie centered around the Joker for years. Why not? Batman has received seven live-action movies, with an eighth one on the way. We've seen that guy's origin story plenty of times. What about his archenemy? The Clown Prince of Crime notoriously doesn't have an origin story. In the comics, he doesn't even have a real name. Over the years, he's gone by a number of aliases and he's famous for telling a variety of stories about his parents, his upbringing, and even how he got those famous scars that are seen in some iterations of the character. ""The Hangover"" director (yes, really) Todd Phillips does a great job not only in staying true to the above about the Joker, but in delivering a story that transcends the comic character. It's dark. It's chilling. It will unnverve you. If you're still not sold, the movie is produced by Bradley Cooper and also features Robert De Niro in a much larger role than you would imagine.  You'll get more out of the film if you're familiar with the DC universe, but it's not a prerequisite to seeing the film. Like a one-off graphic novel, ""Joker"" stands on its own. The film may as well be about any regular joe named Arthur who had a very bad day or week and then turned sour grapes. Let's not beat around the bush. You're coming to watch this for Phoenix. The actor, who lost more than 50 pounds for the film, loses himself in this role so much that you may find yourself concerned about Phoenix's mental state. (For what it's worth, Phoenix said the role made him go a bit mad.) His Joker isn't based on other versions of the character. He's timid and has nervous tics. He finds power and confidence in violent acts. Unlike other iterations of the character, Phoenix dances throughout many scenes of the film in beautifully, quiet moments. That scene of him dancing down a set of steps in just about every trailer is a stand-out moment. Heath Ledger gave us a clever Joker that carried out villainous acts, but who made us laugh at times with his wit, charm, or movements. Phoenix's Joker is no laughing matter. Fleck holds a mirror up to society, suggesting that anyone can become him. That's terrifying.  ""I want people to see me..."" ""I hope my death makes more sense than my life.""""The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't."" Kudos to Phillips for finding a way to introduce the Joker's maniacal laughter in a way that integrated seamlessly with his vision for the character. Here, it's not done to intimidate. Instead, Fleck says his uncontrollable and unnerving laughter are caused by a neurological condition that makes him laugh at inappropriate times. It can't be helped and it often starts up at the most inconvenient of times like when he's trying to perform a stand-up routine or take public transportation. As a result, he's harassed. He's bullied. And then things go terribly south. There are several violent moments that catch you off guard in ""Joker"" so much that you may clasp your hand to your mouth in shock. I brought my DC-loving brother along with me to the film and he sat just like that for the last 20 or so minutes of the movie. We're very in tune with everything DC and there were at least three moments during ""Joker"" where we turned to one another distressed. These were truly ""WTF"" moments. The largest of these moments was an unexpected twist for Joker's character you won't see coming that will have fans buzzing about the Joker and Batman's already interesting relationship. Another one of the film's highlights comes from how it wisely incorporates one of the villain's characteristics into the film. Throughout his DC history, the Joker has always been an unreliable narrator, which is why it makes it all the more interesting to see a film from his point of view. You can tell that Phillips, who cowrote the film with Scott Silver, took that to heart. By its end, ""Joker"" will leave you wondering what parts of the movie you should even believe to be true. If you're a big DC fan, that should undoubtedly excite you as you're left pondering over several different possible origin stories for Fleck.  The answer itself doesn't matter, because the Joker — a character who incites and thrives in chaos — can be anyone. It's a scary thought, perhaps. But not one that's new to the DC mythos.  Alan Moore's Eisner-winning ""The Killing Joke"" from 1988 emphasizes that it only takes ""one bad day"" for any normal man to go insane. The same rings true in Phillips' ""Joker,"" it just holds more true today and that may leave a bad taste in some mouths.  We see Batman's parents die onscreen for the umpteenth time in a DC film and it's pretty generic and unnecessary. Even if you're not pretty familiar with comics, the death of Wayne's parents getting gunned down in a dark alley after exiting a theater is one that has been done over and over and over again like a broken record.  On a grander scale, as much as I or many DC fans may enjoy ""Joker,"" now may not be the time for a movie about a sad, loner white male who becomes vengeful on the very society that has seemingly turned on him. And as much as I appreciate the film's message of thinking twice about how we treat others, its commentary on mental illness makes it look like it's something to fear rather than treat. Though we're made to feel bad for Fleck at the film's start, by its end, you know he's an unstable sociopath. He's someone people are scared of. It suggests those with mental illness could become susceptible to violence. ""Joker"" may receive some backlash over that. Typically, I don't have issues with movies that have violence in them. They're works of fiction. They're a form of escapism. Unfortunately, by the end of ""Joker,"" I couldn't help but wonder how some may react after the film and whether or not it may incite people to copy what they see on screen at all. It's not something you want to think about, but it was a thought I couldn't shake and one that crossed my brother's mind as we discussed the film afterwards.  If I see anyone walking around with the clown masks on from the film come Halloween, I'm probably going to be a bit unnerved because of what they stand for in the film. I think it's something that will stay with a lot of people when they leave the film.  If you're a DC or Joaquin Phoenix fan, see this for his original take on Batman's greatest foe. It's a chilling take and one that will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Don't see this one by yourself. You'll probably want to talk it through with someone. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix is both dazzling and utterly terrifying in Joker, Todd Phillips’s bleak interpretation of one of DC’s most iconic villains and Batman’s deadliest arch-enemy. Co-written by Phillips and screenwriter Scott Silver, and with a killer score from Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, the film reads more like a study in madness and alienation than a straightforward superhero/villain movie.
The year is 1981 and Gotham City is in the midst of an insurmountable societal crisis. With municipal workers on an endless strike, rubbish is piling up sky-high and violent crime is dangerously on the rise. When we first meet Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), he is working as a clown for a small performance agency whilst dreaming of making the big time as a stand-up comic. After years of being ridiculed by his peers and set upon by strangers because of his many quirks and peculiarities, Arthur finally snaps and commits the ultimate crime.
Back home, where he lives alone with his ailing mother (a beautifully understated performance by Frances Conroy), Arthur dreams of one day meeting childhood hero and popular late night TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, brilliant as ever). When his earlier violent actions unwittingly lead to a revolt in the city, Arthur must seize the chance of finally realising the lifelong ambition of appearing on live television.
While there seems to be a fresh influx of DC and Marvel productions making their way onto our screens every other week, what sets Joker apart from the rest is Phillips’s ability to convey a far more complex and meaningful set of ideas than the usual epic fight scenes and action set pieces we’ve come to expect from these productions.
Harnessing his life-long obsession with some of Robert De Niro’s greatest roles, Phillips has borrowed freely and unabashedly from both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, to bring us his own version of what he sees as a deeply misunderstood character.
Phoenix is truly outstanding in a performance which almost seems like an extension of his role in Lynne Ramsay’s stunning 2017 crime thriller You Were Never Really Here. And while some might fail to resist the urge of comparing his performance to that of Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson's, there is no denying that Phoenix brings a brand new interpretation of this particular super-villain in an origins story which is unlike any other.
Joker isn’t just stunning to look at, it is also a real game-changer for DC and Warner who have so far trailed behind Marvel and Disney’s ever-growing extended universe. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have given us not only one of the most stunning but also one of the most brutally unsettling films of the  year so far.

"Oct 2, 2019"," Trash is piling up in Gotham City. Plunged into a recess of political gridlock, societal malaise, and civil unrest, the city is steeped in refuge. Waste management services are on strike. Black bags of Gotham’s waste line the streets. Arthur Fleck counts himself amongst the discarded. He’s trash personified; tossed out alongside his creepy cackle. According to Arthur, he hasn’t had a happy day in his life. A simmering hotpot of childhood trauma, deep-set depression, daddy issues, hallucination-prone psychosis, sexual repression, and rage-onset tendencies, Arthur just ain’t a happy camper. And yet, he’s told to smile, to grin and bear it, to play nice. If you thought The Dark Knight was grounded and gritty, wait until you get ahold of Todd Phillips’ Joker. For those keeping score at home, this is a comic book movie with zero big tentpole action sequences, little to no special effects, no Batman, and is still one of the most thrilling entries to ever spawn from the pages of pulpy serials. Rather than follow the usual script for a supervillain origin story, Phillips pursues instead an unrelentingly somber character study that brushes with mental illness, toxic masculinity, gun violence, and vigilantism. His film makes for bleak, timely commentary, laying out a blueprint for the brand of madness that manifests itself in tragedy. Joker is focused on the run-up to the inevitable American tragic and the self-propelled news cycle such creates. In Phillips’ film, isolation and societal rejection combine to make a breeding pool for white male domestic terror.  Late-1970s Gotham makes for a fascinating petri dish to examine that issue with Joker aspiring to mimic the gritty environs and delirious character studies of that era of filmmaking. Though thematic and aesthetic parallels can be drawn to producer Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker is also inspired by the films of Sydney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick as well as the works of Ken Kesey and even Kurt Vonnegut. Having Robert De Niro play Murray Franklin, a successful talk show host, creates a tempting inroad to Scorsese’s other works, which works as a wink for those seeking in-universe easter eggs.  That would not be the only connection Joker shares to a broader universe (Thomas Wayne is a critical character in the film, even if his presence is more symbolic than anything) but the story does a great job of isolating itself from the larger tapestry of the DC Extended Universe. No matter the state of the greater DC brand, Joker boldly keeps to itself and remains content to tell the tragedy of a deteriorating psyche without the clutter of interconnected B-plots and mid-credits tie-in scenes. Insofar as Joker is a comic book movie, it is only so in the loosest of terms as this is plain and simply about a man desperately unable to cope. A man who just so happens to be the Joker.  Joaquin Phoenix embodies the man more than the mantle, tackling the role with the kind of career-defining gusto that evidently is required to play the Clown Prince of Crime (thankfully, the days of Joker as a Soundcloud rapper with face tats and a grill are long behind us.) A failure in most rights, Arthur Fleck is a clown for hire, posted up in children hospital wards, or assigned to sign-spinning duty outside jewelry stores going out of business. He aspires to fulfill his dream of stand-up comedy, encouraged by his mother’s (Frances Conroy in the perfect Frances Conroy role) belief that he was put on this Earth to make people smile. That proves to be a bit of a stretch as Arthur is shown to be a severely unsettling figure to be around, particularly because he suffers from pseudobulbar affect, also called emotional incontinence, which manifests itself in outbreaks of inappropriate laughter in times of high stress or emotion. This shows itself in unfortunate times, Arthur often weeping whilst he cackles like a madman. This all makes for an all-time depiction of the “Joker laugh” that has Phoenix braying like a hyena while in very obvious emotional distress, a groundswell of the undeniable greatness that is this performance.  Arthur’s personal life is as decrepit and hollow as his professional one but a spark of interest from neighbor Sophie, played by the always captivating Zazie Beetz, offers him that touch of humanity and empathy he so badly craves. Unfortunately, she errs on the side of anarchy herself and as the city slides towards rejecting those in its upper class, Arthur’s urge to express himself through violent means and malice grows. To embody the malnourished physicality of a man-child, Phoenix dropped a significant amount of weight for the role. With ribs and shoulder blades poking through his thin skin, the seasoned actor takes on a monstrous look, like a serpentine creature trying to break out of its shell. Phillips is more than content to sit with the showstopping performance, be Phoenix effeminately dancing or just chaining cigs. His movements are like that of a marionette who eventually takes command of its own strings. He owns the screen and we are but his voyeurs. Many will wonder how Joaquin Phoenix’s performance stacks up against his Mistah J brethren and the comparison isn’t easy. While Heath Ledger ruled as a tic-fueled gangster in a purple suit to the tune of a fancy gold Oscar, his take on the character remained shrouded in mystery. Jack Nicholson’s campy turn as the deranged criminal is iconic in its own right but equally boxed into its villainry. And the less said about Jared Leto the better. By contrast, Phoenix’s turn as Joker is flesh and blood; the man behind the monster. It’s the first time we’ve gotten a sympathetic look at “how he got those scars”. The answer is decades of psychological abuse and emotional neglect. Taking all that into account, it’s hard not to argue that this is the best film version of the Joker we’ve yet seen but despite your personal preference, there’s no denying Phoenix’s take will go down in the history books. Deadly serious, Joker Trojan horses very few laughs into its midst but when they land, they do so with a mighty blow. This is not a funny movie, nor are the issues on display comical in any sense and yet Joker deals out punchlines nonetheless. In our age of the proliferation of domestic terror, mass shooting splattered across headlines like revolving doors, Joker assesses society’s fraught structure, the cyclical nature of violence, the damage we allow to be passed onto those less fortunate and more at-risk, and treats it to a punchline. And that’s okay. Why so serious?  CONCLUSION: Todd Phillips’ deliriously provocative Joker is a risky endeavor that shirks the load-bearing staples of comic book movies past to focus on a richly-textured character study of a lost soul. Joaquin Phoenix is instantly iconic as the damaged king of the villains in this grounded story of how madness manifests itself.

"Oct 2, 2019"," If Avengers: Endgame was 2019’s first critic-proof film, then writer-director Todd Phillips’ Joker is, appropriately enough, its dark, twisted reflection. Ever since its August premiere at the Venice Film Festival – where it unexpectedly took home the fest’s grand prize, the Golden Lion – critical reaction to Joker has been generally positive, although the film’s few outright pans have been positively scathing. The feature’s Tomato-approved reception is only a fragment of its pop cultural footprint, however. For will or ill (mostly ill), Joker has dominated the year’s pop-cultural discourse from the moment its first trailer appeared. Disconcertingly, this tease suggested that Phillips’ standalone non-DCEU film was going to lionize a violent (white male) criminal who had been pushed to the breaking point by, like, Society, man. The Clown Prince of Crime has since infected seemingly every online platform and publication, spawning innumerable think pieces and Twitter feuds about whether Phillips’ film represents a gritty, cunning work of genre subversion or an ill-timed, disgusting act of faux-provocation. Joker has, in effect, become Schrödinger’s Film – especially for the millions of people who haven’t even seen it yet. This critic has seen Joker and can attest that – as one might expect – the truth lies somewhere between such hyperbolic extremes. It is, to be sure, a film with much to admire, at least in terms of sheer craft. Joaquin Phoenix, as the hapless rent-a-clown and wannabe stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck, unsurprisingly brings every gram of his considerable acting talent to bear on a character that has improbably achieved a Lear-sized reputation ever since Heath Ledger’s posthumous 2009 Oscar win. Philips and the rest of the film’s crew – most notably cinematographer Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, set decorator Kris Moran, and costumer designer Mark Bridges – create a Gotham City that’s fantastically grimy, cruel, and ugly as sin. This isn’t the Expressionist outlandishness of Tim Burton’s Batman(1989) or the slick action-movie “realism” of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy (2005, 2008, and 2012). Instead, Joker draws on the grubby “New York Shitty” cinematic canon of the late 1960s through mid-70s – with a particular debt owed to Death Wish (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), and Taxi Driver (1976). That last film is perhaps Joker’s most obvious influence: Both are unreliable tales about a traumatized, mentally ill loner who is ostensibly provoked to violence by the societal breakdown they observe all around them. In fact, Phillips summons the spirit of Taxi Driver – and that of another NYC-set Scorsese film, The King of Comedy (1982) – with such giddy frequency that it begins to feel like slavish homage for the sake of homage. The presence of Travis Bickle / Rupert Pupkin himself, Robert De Niro, in the role of a late-night talk show host only serves to hammer the point home. What exactly that point might be is unclear, beyond establishing that the filmmakers have, in fact, seen Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Joker fares better when it ditches the winking film-bro references and simply evokes the feeling of a bygone New York – er, Gotham City – in all its rat-infested, garbage-piled, shoulder-to-shoulder glory. This it does spectacularly well, thanks to the aforementioned design team, who also seem to be drawing some inspiration from the distorted urban hellscapes depicted in 1990s thrillers like Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Flatliners (1990), Se7en  (1995), and 8MM (1999). The film’s fatigued, tobacco-stained vision of Gotham would make for a fantastic setting in a future Batman: Arkham game. (Hint hint, Rocksteady Studios.) While the technological and pop cultural signifiers might roughly suggest Bicentennial-era Gotham, there’s also a smudged ambiguity to the film’s setting. After all, Batman’s stomping ground has always represented an archetypal version of the capital-c City at its absolute worst, the nightmare town cousin to Metropolis’ gleaming beacon on a hill. For Arthur Fleck, Gotham isn’t just home: It’s a hateful, abusive parent who eventually nurtures his nature right over the proverbial cliff, sending him cackling into the abyss. However, this doesn’t make for a particularly compelling arc in practice, and the screenplay by Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver (The Fighter, The Finest Hours) neglects characterization in favor of hustling Arthur towards his predetermined destiny. In a sense, Joker plays like the Clown Prince’s own propaganda film, a flimsy, sloppy “You Made Me Do This” ex post facto justification for all the criminal havoc he wreaks on Gotham in the ensuing years. Living down the hall from Arthur is a bank worker and single mom, Sophie (Zazie Beetz), who seems to respond warmly to his awkward hellos and goofy mugging. However, the glimmer of hopefulness that she represents seems to exist solely so that Arthur can be kicked around that much more viciously in the bleak world of Joker. His life begins to slide out of control after he’s jumped by a gaggle of kids – who steal and smash his sign from a sidewalk clowning job, and then proceed to kick the crap out of him, apparently for having the termity to be such an pathetic victim. After this incident, a fellow clown (Glenn Fleshler) loans him a revolver for personal protection, but when Arthur brings the gun to a gig at a children’s hospital, he’s summarily fired. (And with good cause!) It’s an unfortunate development for Arthur’s nascent stand-up comedy career, of which there seems to be precious little beyond some jokes scribbled in a diary that could have been filched from the shelves of Se7en’s John Doe. Notwithstanding his shortage of material and stage experience, Arthur dreams of appearing on a Gotham-based late-night show hosted by comedy veteran Murray Franklin (De Niro). One of Arthur’s showbiz fantasy sequences has such a strong resemblance to those in The King of Comedy – where a young De Niro played the part of the delusional, starstruck stalker to Jerry Lewis’ Merv Griffin / Johnny Carson analogue – it’s almost discombobulating. Things reach a crisis point for Arthur when he’s mocked and beaten (again!) late one night on the subway, this time by a trio of alpha-male Wall Street jackwagons (er, Wayne Enterprises jackwagons). This is the straw that breaks the clown’s back, it turns out, as Arthur shoots two of his assailants dead on the spot with his new revolver, and then chases the other one down through the deserted subway station to finish him off. Phillips and Silver present this as Arthur’s point of no return: He is plainly energized both by the thrill of violently pushing back against the world and by the “killer clown” stories that monopolize headlines in the ensuing days. The Gotham City media spins this triple homicide into an act of Eat-the-Rich vigilantism, casting the unidentified shooter as a proxy for aggrieved citizens fed up with vaguely-defined “elites” whose unofficial standard-bearer is Thomas Wayne. Even after Arthur has had his first taste of ultra-violence, Joker piles yet more indignities on him, starting with a catastrophically awkward stand-up set, footage of which ends up the subject of mockery on Franklin’s show. There’s also the matter of Arthur’s mysterious paternity, which first zigs in a predictable if preposterous direction before zagging in a sadder, more banal direction, setting up the character’s final descent into supervillain infamy. Phoenix brings all the disturbing intensity that one would expect to such performance: He isn’t afraid to make Arthur vaguely off-putting and repellent from the very first scene, without ever losing sight of the fact that there is a bruised child somewhere underneath the greasepaint. He renders this version of the Joker (proto-Joker?) as a clammy, shuffling assemblage of fearfulness, agitation, weariness, and space-cadet weirdness. (Arthur has a habit of breaking into a languid, ecstatic dance – his gaunt torso and limbs arching grotesquely – during moments of exultation.) If nothing else, the actor does a commendable job of suggesting a man in deep, seemingly insoluble psychological pain. It’s a ferocious performance, admittedly, but also Exhibit A for why less is sometimes more: Phoenix was able to evoke richer pathos from a thousand-yard stare in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here (2017) than from all the twitching, slouching, and contorting in Joker. (The former film, as it happens, is a masterful, aesthetically daring remix of Taxi Driver that actually has something to say about the human condition. Imagine that.) Much as Burton’s film did, Phillips’s feature connects the Joker to Batman’s origins, albeit obliquely; and, yes, that means that the viewer is once again obliged to watch as the parents of young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) are gunned down on screen, seemingly for the zillionth time. The questionable premise of Joker – that the Caped Crusader’s archenemy actually predated him by a couple of decades – was always in for an uphill battle, story-wise. The Joker works most effectively as a response to Batman, an equal and opposite reaction birthed into the world by the extremes of Bruce’s vigilantism. This is what Jim Gordon memorably referred to as the “escalation” problem in the epilogue to Batman Begins, and it’s perhaps never been expressed better than in Jeph Loeb and Time Hale’s superb 1996-97 comic series Batman: The Long Halloween. There’s nothing inherently heretical about breaking with this conceit, but it does mean that such an outside-the-box conception of the Joker needs to do something meaty and provocative with the character. Moreover, there’s nothing intrinsically ill-advised about centering a film on a protagonist who is utterly loathsome – see: Dan Gilroy’s superb Nightcrawler (2014) – if they are portrayed in a manner that makes them comprehensible, distinctive, and thought-provoking. Joker falls woefully short on this count. The plot of the film is straightforward, notwithstanding all the subplots Phillips and Silver seem determined to throw into the mix. Arthur, who is already suffering from multiple mistreated or under-treated mental illnesses, is repeatedly beaten down by the general shittiness of life. Eventually he has a complete breakdown, embraces violence, and basks in the adulation of the unwashed masses who see him as a kind of anarchic anti-messiah in a V for Vendetta-style uprising. That’s pretty much all Phillips’ film has to offer in the way of substance. In truth, a gleeful cinematic toast to cruelty and nihilism would have been preferable to the confused, ungainly, pseudo-timely parable that Joker seems to be aiming for. One could easily envision Rob Zombie delivering the former, and in a sense, he already has: It’s called The Devil’s Rejects (2005). If Joker has an ethos, it’s a very muddled one where low-key racism, sexism, ableism, and the self-pitying rage of the Fed-Up White Guy are rather bafflingly mixed in with more leftish sentiments: anti-bullying; anti-harassment; anti-austerity; democratic anarchism; and a generalized sort of guillotine-happy class warfare. (In this, Joker’s political incoherence bears some resemblance to that of The Dark Knight Rises.) Here, Thomas Wayne is portrayed as an irritable, supercilious prick who insults Gotham’s citizenry on live television, which would make for a stunning subversion of the Batman mythos if it were employed for any purpose beyond creating a bit of feeble empathy for the Joker and the clown-masked rabble he rouses into rioting over… something. Indeed, if Phillips’ film were the smug, toxic, 4chan-pandering provocation that its detractors fear, at least it would be intelligible – poisonous, but intelligible. Instead, Phillips has delivered a Joker where the titular protagonist earnestly bemoans the lack of civility in modern society, and then promptly blows a man’s brains out with a handgun. (What a scamp!) This version of the character exhibits only sporadic flashes of the gallows humor and impish irreverence that typically define the Joker. Phoenix’s incarnation is so preoccupied with “making his mark” on the world in some vague but ominous way, he can’t be bothered to crack wise. Given that this is the one comic book character who absolutely should be at least sort of funny, Joker is a surprisingly sour, laugh-free film. Despite the lead actor’s best efforts, the viewer is frustratingly stranded outside the Joker’s headspace, where they can only sniff in mingled disgust and pity at his violent delusions – which seems like a major flaw for a film that aims to humanize the Clown Prince of Crime into a tragic figure. The film might have a 1970s look and feel, but its protagonist seems like an early 1980s refugee – Mark David Chapman or John Hinckley Jr., to be precise. Yet there’s also something tiresomely, depressingly 21st-century about this Joker, who doesn’t want to watch the world burn so much as vainly gloat at being the one who struck the match.

"Oct 2, 2019"," Te dejamos nuestra review de Joker; filme que no se parece a nada de lo que se ha hecho en el cine de superhÃ©roes en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os. Algunos estÃ¡n hartos de las pelÃ­culas basadas en cÃ³mics llenas de acciÃ³n, explosiones y efectos especiales. Sin embargo, despuÃ©s de ver la pelÃ­cula Joker, podemos decir que estamos ante una nueva manera de hacer cine de superhÃ©roes. La cinta de Todd Phillips (director de la saga Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³ ayer?) se centra en Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), un hombre de mediana edad que intenta llevar una vida normal a pesar de sufrir una enfermedad mental que muy pocos comprenden. Aunque Ã©l siempre trata de poner su mejor sonrisa, la sociedad que lo rodea poco a poco se encarga de sacar lo peor de sÃ­ mismo. Dejemos algo muy claro, este filme se aleja de todas las cintas basadas en cÃ³mics de los Ãºltimos aÃ±os. Si hay que comparar, Joker es mÃ¡s parecida a Batman Begins de Christopher Nolan que a cualquier otra del gÃ©nero; sobre todo porque logra desarrollar a este personaje en un mundo realista. Y es que esto es lo mÃ¡s asombroso que consiguiÃ³ Todd Phillips, pues se encarga de contar la historia de origen de uno de los villanos mÃ¡s famosos de una manera asombrosa. La magia de Joker reside en que nos adentra por completo en la psique de Arthur Fleck al punto de entender, por ejemplo, que su risa no es de felicidad, sino que rÃ­e porque no siente nada, es un hombre que estÃ¡ muerto por dentro. Comprendemos sus miedos, deseos, debilidades y anhelos mediante la extraordinaria actuaciÃ³n de Joaquin Phoenix, quien transformÃ³ su cuerpo hasta quedar casi en los huesos. DespuÃ©s de verla pensarÃ¡s que los ocho minutos de aplausos que recibiÃ³ en Venecia no son algo exagerado, pues no es nada fÃ¡cil que la interpretaciÃ³n de un actor pueda sostener por sÃ­ sola una pelÃ­cula de dos horas. Desde luego que no decimos que Phoenix sea lo Ãºnico bueno de Joker, pues su trama contiene temas actuales bastante importantes como el padecer una enfermedad mental en una sociedad a la que no le interesan estos asuntos y en la que la respuesta a todo es la violencia. Tomando en cuenta que Todd Phillips estÃ¡ detrÃ¡s de Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³ ayer?, la verdad es que hace un asombroso trabajo como director en Joker. Y no es para menos, ya que le debe mucho al trabajo de Martin Scorsese como cineasta, pues durante toda la pelÃ­cula (cinematografÃ­a, personajes, temÃ¡ticas) se nota la influencia de dos de sus pelÃ­culas: Taxi Driver y El Rey de la Comedia. Al final, esperamos que Joker sea la punta de lanza para nuevas maneras de adaptar los cÃ³mics a la pantalla grande. DespuÃ©s de todo, el GuasÃ³n es solo uno de los miles de personajes que tienen un trasfondo tan grande. AsÃ­ que no importa si amas u odias esta ola de pelÃ­culas de superhÃ©roes. Te aseguramos que Joker es algo completamente diferente a lo que se ha presentado en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," “I’m not political,” claims Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), finally decked out in the pancake makeup and burgundy suit that has adorned Joker‘s marketing for the last few months. “I just want to make people laugh.” But we know that’s bullshit; despite his protestations, Arthur is an intensely political figure, and Joker is an intensely political movie. But as much as director/producer/co-writer Todd Phillips wants to shake off the shackles of the Hangover trilogy and pivot from comedy to serious fare (or, as this ill-timed Variety interview reveals, abandon the former because ‘woke culture’ is ruining comedy or whatever), Joker‘s existential gag falls flat on its face. But let’s do our best to shake off The Discourse and meet the movie where it’s at, where its intentions lie — an alternate universe take on the Clown Prince of Crime, set in Gotham City in the late ’70s amid civil unrest and a garbage strike that leaves the city even grimier than you’d expect. Right away, the oft-mentioned Scorsese homages ring true: DP Lawrence Sher soaks Gotham in muted blues, grays, and browns, littering the streets with newspaper and gunk and steam, cribbing lovingly (if often pointlessly) from Taxi Driver. Hildur Guðnadóttir‘s droning score hovers over you like a heavy blanket, sonically laying brick after brick on Arthur’s back as he climbs up the steep stairs to his apartment like Sisyphus. The only people seemingly thriving in this version of Gotham are the rich, who live sequestered away in their mansions and sneering down at the poor when they complain. (Don’t expect this film’s version of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) to be the benevolent capitalist of most other Batman stories.) To his credit, Phoenix gives the kind of superlative performance we expect of him at this point — painfully gaunt, clothing hanging off his bones like a coat rack, Phoenix gifts Arthur with a dancer’s physicality, channeling Travis Bickle and Charlie Chaplin in equal measure. (These observations would be more daring if Phillips et al. didn’t wallpaper the film with their obvious influences — casting Robert De Niro as a late-night host in a King of Comedy homage and setting one scene at a theater screening of Modern Times — but what can you do?) Phoenix leans into the anarchic madness of Arthur at every turn, and it’s an affecting, disturbing lead turn, zagging into every lurch of the film’s tone with remarkable grace. His Arthur Fleck is a great baseline, hopefully, for viewers to dive into his other brushes with madness; hell, look no further than last year’s You Were Never Really Here for a stronger take on the violent-madman-with-mommy-issues territory trod here. Add to that the inevitable racial subtext, in which Arthur’s problems as a downtrodden white man are explicitly likened to that of his social worker (Sharon Washington), a black woman who reassures him that they’re going through the same problems. Problem is, Arthur can take off his makeup or his clown mask and reassimilate into polite society whenever he wants, cackling jags aside; she can’t, and the effects are probably even worse for her. There’s a world of difference between his problems and hers’, and the same goes for Beetz’s struggling single mom or Brian Tyree Henry‘s cautious Arkham clerk. It feels disingenuous to liken them so cleanly, especially since Joker feels so much like a movie about whiteness and its inability to cope with mediocrity. Arthur’s not a great son, or a competent clown, or even a good standup comedian. But the characters in the movie take excruciating pains to remind him of that, and it’s implied that these pressures are what push him to violence.  In a way, it’s Joker‘s tenuous connections to the DC universe that serve as some of the film’s biggest liabilities. Sure, it’s in Gotham City, and Thomas Wayne’s mayoral campaign looms over the texture of the film; we even get glimpses of Alfred Pennyworth (Douglas Hodge) and Baby Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) and Arkham Asylum. But as the film barrels towards its inevitable conclusion – of course Arthur is going to turn into the Joker at some point – there’s a frustrating level of box-ticking that further sours the rancid social commentary at its heart.  Writing a review for Joker two days before release almost feels like a moot point — the Discourse has already had its way with it, alternatingly hailing it as a subversive masterpiece and deriding it as incel fodder depending on where you sit on the political spectrum. And Joker is a political movie, no mistake, filled with contradictions and anchored by an intense, unsettling lead performance.  But those politics are muddled (seriously, the ‘we live in a society’ memes are practically echoed in Arthur’s most pivotal line of dialogue in the climax), and its fence-sitting about whether Arthur should be condemned or rehabilitated belies the glee by which it revels in his behavior. Even if we ignore the immaturity and shallowness of its messaging, there’s a lot of mess in Joker that not even watching Phoenix do his thing for two hours can fully shake. Add to that the emptiness of its stylistic homages, and it’s hard to find much sting in Joker‘s ultimate punchline. Unless, of course, you feel a bit like Arthur himself. In which case, please seek help.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day.

"Oct 2, 2019"," “I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it’s a fucking comedy.” So speaks the Joker (played by Joaquin Phoenix), the face-painted title character of Todd Phillips’s new film. Well, I have news for Mr. Joker. He may think life is tragicomic, but the movie he’s in is very much a drama—a pompous, grim, relentlessly one-note adaptation bent on proving just how far removed it is from its comic-book heritage. Joker, fresh off a victory at this year’s Venice Film Festival, is arriving in cinemas on a sea of hype and controversy. Its depiction of a troubled antihero driven to mass murder is generating so much concern that its own studio had to issue a statement clarifying that the film is not “an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind.” Plenty of external factors contributed to that clarification, and the film itself is clearly not intended to function as a depraved call to arms for the world’s villainous clowns. It is, however, a project drowning in self-seriousness. In his effort to bring realism to the Joker story, Phillips has lost his grasp on the character’s symbolic purpose, treating the audience to something undeniably visceral but also unacceptably shallow. Through the decades, the Joker’s persona (he’s best known as a longtime menace to Batman) has fluctuated between scary and campy, with the two best movie depictions—Jack Nicholson’s and Heath Ledger’s—capturing his menacing archness from entirely different angles. Phillips’s film, which he scripted with Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile), skips the Caped Crusader and focuses entirely on the man who will become the Joker, while largely dispensing with the various origin tales suggested in the comics. Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, an unstable wannabe comedian struggling to keep afloat in crime-ridden Gotham City. Over two hours, the audience watches as Arthur’s resentment of his smothering mother (Frances Conroy), his crush on their next-door neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), and his tendency to get hassled on the street boil over from loneliness into murderous psychosis. Arthur suffers from some unspecified condition that causes his skinny, gnarled body to shake with laughter at inopportune moments, alienating everyone he meets. Phoenix’s performance is undoubtedly compelling—like so much of the actor’s best work, it’s a physical marvel, unsettling from the second the camera lands on him. Still, even the not-yet-villainous Arthur of the film’s first act is tough to sympathize with because he’s such a caricature. His weakly sketched portrayal of mental illness doesn’t extend much beyond his creepy cackle and a diary he’s filled with demented, abstract scribblings. Were Joker to lean into its comic-book inspiration, the broadness of Arthur’s characterization might be forgivable. Instead, Phillips takes pains to eschew those pulpy origins, borrowing liberally from Martin Scorsese’s two greatest renderings of madness, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. The biggest homage to those films comes in the form of their star, Robert De Niro, playing a dapper late-night host whom Arthur idolizes. Yet as indebted as Joker obviously is to those revered New Hollywood masterpieces, Phillips seems to have missed their underlying sardonic bite. Scorsese depicts lone-wolf killers such as Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle as warped reflections of societal ills. Joker mentions “a groundswell of anti-rich sentiment” bubbling up in Gotham, but it fails to connect this vague political notion to its central character’s arc. What distinguishes Joker best from its comic-book-movie brethren is its emphasis on location shooting and its genuinely personal stakes. No set piece involves more people than could fill a subway car, there are no CGI embellishments or superhuman action sequences, and Phillips successfully translates New York City and its environs into a fictional burg that feels only slightly removed from reality. Phoenix, similarly, strains to ground a character who’s become a stand-in for cartoon evil, and his incredible effort is hard to ignore. But as Joker gets grimmer and descends further into bloody violence, it becomes little more than a horror show, bludgeoning its viewers out of any chance at insight.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 2, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix goes full Clown Prince of Crime in Phillips' stylish crime drama, but it's not enough to mask the sense of emptiness at Joker's core.  One would be forgiven for assuming Joker opened in theaters a month ago, judging by all the headlines it's made in recent weeks. Todd Phillips' DC comic book adaptation (which exists separate from the Justice League movies) was haled as a masterpiece following its Venice Film Festival premiere in August, which then led to a predictable backlash and an equally unsurprising backlash to that backlash. In truth, the discussion surrounding Joker is, in many ways, more meaningful than the actual film - itself, a work of grimdark storytelling that oscillates from haunting character study to the cinematic equivalent of LEGO Batman's ""Untitled Self Portrait"" (but without the irony). Joaquin Phoenix goes full Clown Prince of Crime in Phillips' stylish crime drama, but it's not enough to mask the sense of emptiness at Joker's core.   Phoenix stars in Joker as Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire who spends his days dealing with a neurological disorder (one which causes him to spontaneously laugh), caring for his invalid mother Penny (Frances Conroy), trying to become a professional standup comedian, and struggling to get by unharmed on the mean streets of Gotham City circa the early 1980s (or sometime around then). He's also obsessed with late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and starts to develop feelings for Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), a single mother who lives just down the hallway from his and Penny's apartment. But as lonely and cruel as Arthur's daily existence can be, he still manages to get by and hang onto the hope that tomorrow will be better. That is, until, one bad choice sends him down a dark path from which there may be no escape.   It's no secret that Joker - which Phillips also wrote with Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter) - draws inspiration from Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as well as similarly gritty character dramas from the '70s and '80s (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and A Clockwork Orange being two famous examples). But as the movie continues to borrow more and more from those classics, be it one-off moments or even specific shots, it starts to seem less like homage and more like Joker is simply recycling these elements without adding much of anything new to them. The thematic darkness in Joker also feels superficial in a way that it didn't in those dramas, as far as its social commentary goes. That's not to say the film doesn't have anything on its mind; at different points, it acknowledges issues related to the wealth gap, celebrity worship, gun violence, and gender-based entitlement (and no, it's not an ""incel movie""). Even so, giving a hat-tip to these problems isn't the same as saying something - or, in Joker's case, anything - about them.   One could validly argue that's the point: Joker doesn't believe in anything, so why should a movie about his evolution and told from his perspective believe in anything, either? Not least of all, a film where Phoenix gets to truly let loose, dance wildly in slow-motion (enough so to make a drinking game out of those scenes), and dig deeply into the mindset of a character who's covered head to foot in scars both psychological and physical. Phoenix's Joker performance is indeed as transformative and terrifying as early word of mouth would have you believe, but the movie isn't really sure what to do with it. Whereas dramas like The Master and You Were Never Really Here used Phoenix's acting methods to make viewers truly sit with his characters' trauma, Joker is too often guilty of getting caught up in the spectacle of watching him go off the rails. It's dark and disturbing, sure, but mostly for its own sake.   As messy as the film is on a deeper level, it's perhaps equally impressive on the surface. The cinematography by Phillips' trusted DP Lawrence Sher brings Arthur's home to opulently grimy, grubby life, with Chernobyl composer Hildur Guðnadóttir's gloomy and ominous score imbuing the whole thing with an air of operatic doom. And of course, the production design by Mark Friedberg (If Beale Street Could Talk) and costumes from Mark Bridges (Phantom Thread) are essential in allowing the film's setting to evoke the world of an actual '70s or '80s movie without seeming kitschy. Still, as Joker moves further along and begins tossing one plot twist after another at the wall (some of which are quite predictable, others of which are just bleak and nihilistic), the film starts to feel more and more like a triumph of style over substance.   At the end of the day, Joker comes off as Scorsese-lite in the same way that Phillips' last movie, War Dogs, did - albeit, with great acting from Phoenix to elevate it, but also a sense of self-seriousness that borders on self-parody and pretentiousness that War Dogs did not have. It's no surprise the film has been divisive so far; where some will see deeper layers of meaning and purpose to its story, others will see a comic book movie that's almost juvenile in the way it tries to convince viewers it's more grounded and ""realistic"" than other Batman-related projects before it (a highly debatable notion at best). Whichever side of the fence one falls on (unless they'd prefer to simply sit in the middle), there's certainly a lot to talk about when it comes to Joker. That the discussion might be more interesting and worthwhile than the movie itself, though, is telling in its own way.   Joker is now playing in U.S. theaters. It is 122 minutes long and is rated R for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images.  Tyler Perry's latest movie, Mea Culpa, was a Rotten Tomatoes disaster, but his next movie is on its way to being much better received by critics. The LEGO Group has released five new Star Wars sets for March 1st, celebrating the toy company's 25th anniversary with the galaxy far, far away.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 2, 2019"," Is the Joker a character worthy of sympathy? Todd Phillips seems to think so. His Joker doesn’t treat Batman’s arch-nemesis as a criminal mastermind or a fiendish super-villain, but as a victim; a loser literally and figuratively beaten down by life until he can’t take any more. Unlike the Joker of countless DC Comics, TV shows, and movies, who always had a legion of goons waiting to fight the Dark Knight at his say so, this new movie’s Joker is essentially alone in the world. In this film, he’s the one on the receiving ends of multiple beatings. He’s also yelled at by strangers, insulted by women, and threatened by his boss even though — at least to that point in the story — he’s done nothing wrong. Presumably these scenes are present to help us understand this man. But they come awfully close to absolving him. He’s played, in a typically intense and invested performance, by Joaquin Phoenix. Before he becomes the Joker, he’s known as Arthur Fleck, a hapless, heavily medicated bachelor who still lives at home with his ailing mother (Frances Conroy). Arthur makes ends meet as a clown for hire, working parties and other events. Steady work is tough to come by, though. In the film’s first scene, Arthur is twirling a sign advertising a store that’s going out of business. Some thugs steal the sign, and when Arthur chases after them, they ambush him and kick the crap out of him. Then his boss accuses him of stealing the sign. And this is about as good as things get for Arthur, who also suffers from a medical condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate moments. Taking as many cues from Martin Scorsese as Bill Finger, Phillips sets Arthur on a collision course with his favorite late night talk show host, Murray Franklin — who, in one of the many overt homages to Scorsese’s work, is played by Robert De Niro. 36 years ago, De Niro, played the role of delusional aspiring comic obsessed with Jerry Lewis’ TV star in The King of Comedy. Seven years earlier, De Niro played Travis Bickle in another obvious touchstone for Phillips’ Joker, Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, which is about the gradual mental deterioration of a sick man living in a dirty, rotting city. Like Travis, Arthur also encounters a woman he becomes infatuated with; in his case, a neighbor named Sophie (Zazie Beetz), with whom he shares a brief moment of mutual exasperation. Phillips, who directed, produced, and co-wrote the film with Scott Silver, clearly understands the plots of these Scorsese movies, but not their souls. Joker isn’t a film about a misanthrope, it is a misanthropic movie. While there are vague notions of political subtext in the citizens of Gotham City — who are denounced as “clowns” by wealthy businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and then embrace the insult, deplorables-style, and begin wearing clown masks as they protest in the streets — any satire or social commentary is so tame and murky as to be nonexistent. (Joker himself refuses to embrace any sort of political philosophy in his big climactic speech, which again places the blame for all of his actions on the world that mistreated him.) Phillips may have set out to make a modern-day Scorsese picture using the iconography of superhero comics, but what he wound up with feels more like something Travis Bickle would have taken Betsy to, and then sat nodding at the screen in agreement after his date ran for the exit. It depicts the world basically as Travis saw it: A hell filled with scum. Just as much of Joker’s narrative feels recycled from old Scorsese pictures, Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur feels like a pale shadow of his previous work in similar films about violent wanderers like The Master and You Were Never Really Here, which are tougher and smarter about these kinds of men and how society shapes them. As has become something of a trademark, Phoenix once again completely reshaped his physique for the role; as Arthur, he’s a drawn, skeletal figure who moves his lanky frame in ways that recall Marshall Rogers’ famous drawings of the Joker. Phoenix is one of our very best actors, and even in a movie as dreary as Joker, he is still compelling. His peculiar choices as Arthur’s breakdown accelerates are particularly disturbing. Although Arthur dreams of an appearance on Live With Murray Franklin, actual humor eludes him; he observes and mimics the behavior of comedians like an alien trying to blend in to society. The movie around Phoenix, though, never matches the complexity of his performance. It’s a simple, grim slog. Based on the internet’s reactions to other recent DC Comics movies, it seems there are those who will admire Joker for its pharmaceutical grade nihilistic bleakness. Good or bad, it’s undeniably one of the most depressing comic-book movies ever made. (It’s also got one of the most depressing comic-book movie scores, an endless dirge of droning strings by Hildur Guðnadóttir.) The calls from some corners to ban the film because it could incite violence give the movie too much credit. It’s not irresponsible. It’s just immature. The lack of a Batman in Joker — or anyone who might oppose Arthur — made me think of the famous line from the end of The Dark Knight (a movie that practically looks like the Adam West TV show compared to Joker) about how Batman is “the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.” Most versions of Gotham City are pretty dark, but Joker’s Gotham appears to be beyond redemption. While we certainly don’t need the Joker, given the general state of the world in 2019, he may be the hero we deserve. -One small detail I liked was the white paint residue that’s always smeared on Arthur’s neck and cheeks. Within the story, we understand he’s not very careful removing his clown makeup after work. Onscreen, it almost looks like the Joker is already lurking within him, and he’s starting to bust out. -Although his role is small, De Niro is good as Murray Franklin. And it’s stunt casting that works, since De Niro’s transition from a Rupert Pupkin to a Jerry Langford lends an added layer of poignance to the film. To quote another line from The Dark Knight “you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," After all the speculation, adulation, and accusations paving the way for me on the way to seeing Joker, the final product is compelling enough, without becoming something grander. That said, director and co-writer Todd Phillips has absolutely made the film he intended to put out into the world. If the real intention was to deliver a commentary on society, using a popular comic book character as a commercial-friendly coating for Warner Brother to help sell an adult drama to audiences, mission accomplished. I only wish all of the style and truly stellar effort from the film’s serious star could have amounted to something daring to push a boundary, rather than simply raise a question or two. Set in 1981 Gotham City (a year uncoincidentally noted as being the most violent in New York’s history), Joker focuses on the downward spiral of Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a working clown and aspiring stand-up comedian. He’s spent time in a mental institution, has a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably, and spends his off time caring for his ill mother (Frances Conroy), spying on his neighbor (Zazie Beetz), or watching his favorite TV talk show host (Robert De Niro, a clever homage to The King of Comedy). As a story regarding the origins of the Clown Prince of Gotham, Joker does take a novel approach. This movie has little regard for any specific comic (and the Joker has no exact origin story to speak of anyway), but it does traffic in the mood of many grimy 70s character studies, particularly Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. Removing a key villain out of the realm involving their great rival (in this case Batman) could have proved to be tricky, but after Venom managed to deliver a poor version of that idea and still become a success, Joker at least seemed to have more promise from the outset. That comes mostly from casting. After notably turning down the chance to portray Dr. Strange, Phoenix has finally decided to push himself back into the mainstream spotlight for a different comic book character. This one is very in-tune with what critics have seen from him in the many arthouse films encompassing most of his career. Everything about Arthur feels like something that would call to a method actor such as Phoenix, who truly transforms himself (and his body) to match the emotionally unstable and mentally ill persona required for the role. While a variety of character actors and recognizable faces veer in and out of the picture (Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, Marc Maron), this is the Phoenix show, and all of the focus on his character is as impressive as it is expected. Another highlight is the amount of visual polish found throughout this lower-budgeted supervillain movie. Beyond the nature of the humor found in Todd Phillips Hangover films, among his other efforts, the director has shown plenty of evidence regarding his knack as a competent filmmaker who understands how to communicate through cinema. With help from cinematographer Lawrence Sher, among others, Joker looks fantastic. The time period and portrayal of Gotham continually evokes the dinginess of scenes ripped out of David Fincher’s Seven, as opposed to the gothic designs of Tim Burton’s Gotham from the 1989 Batman. The framing allows us to see Arthur from odd angles to emphasize his impoverished nature, reminding me of former Batman Christian Bale in The Machinist. More intimate locations mean we can often feel boxed in with Arthur, while broader arenas for him to exist in have a way of being augmented enough for us to be inside his head, regardless of what’s actually happening in reality. It’s the effort put in to explore the mind of a damaged individual that makes Joker the most worthwhile. All the style and energy put in by Phoenix comes as an extension of the film’s desire to tell a very character-focused story about an unstable man. The film is fortunately not using society as an easy excuse to justify Arthur’s actions, but it certainly rides along that border. As a slice-of-life look at Arthur’s descent into becoming a violent sociopath, there is enough to observe and admire in how it not only creates empathy for the man but stays away from condoning his actions. Given the supposed “danger” that could stem from this film, I’d say it’s relief to see how Joker is not actually a film geared towards inspiring incel groups to rise, but I’m smart enough to know a major studio feature would not go that far with a comic book movie, to begin with. If anything, the devotion to being a serious feature with major commercial aspects meant the film had a clear line it couldn’t cross, making this Joker seem even more fictional in the process. With no groups, genders, or races to be specifically against, Joker gets by on having Arthur go after those who are at least disrespectful towards him and, at worst, various forms of scum. It’s not that I needed Arthur to be more of an irredeemable character, but propping this film up based on its edge feels like a bit of a misnomer. The film is as violent as it needs to be, without going into splatter territory, while still feeling dedicated to certain comic book trappings. Really, whenever Joker feels the need to remind audiences how the character came from DC Comics, I couldn’t help but feel like something was being lost. Involving Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) in the story as a sort of low-key Trump allows the film to have fun with some of the familiar Batman mythos. However, I also felt like I was getting pulled away from what was working best. It doesn’t help that Wayne’s involvement is a part of setting up an aspect of the story concerning the treatment of the lower classes and having nowhere to really go with it, beyond one inevitable moment. As the film builds to a chaotic third act, I wish more could have been done to show why this Joker story really mattered. Given where this film arrives in its finale, it was disappointing to see the movie become more tell and less show. While specific interactions needed to take place, the sight of Arthur engaging in solo dances, laughing intensely, and giving inscrutable looks always left more of an impact. Given what takes place, the film ends up feeling a bit at odds with settling on what this Joker really represents. Is he a force of anarchy, the product of a corrupt environment, a mentally ill victim, or a representation of something greater? It’s not a crime for Joker not to turn out as some sort of didactic lesson about how to keep from overlooking certain aspects of society. Nor is it a problem to not have all of the answers handed over. I only wish, beneath the stylishly nihilistic veneer, Joker found a way to play as a more thought-provoking look at culture through the lens of the world’s current most popular cinematic genre. Instead, we have a creative and cool “Elseworlds” take on an iconic character relying on madness and despair to set it apart from the rest. It’s quite involving, but after you get the punchline, the show does have to end eventually.",POSITIVE

"Oct 2, 2019"," Directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Clown Prince of Crime, Joker is a hauntingly chilling tale grounded in the type of reality that makes your skin crawl. The film presents itself as a character study, completely serious in its approach and uncensored in its message. Joker tells the story of Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian riddled with demons as he devolves into a dangerous force of nature. Taking the “One Bad Day” from The Killing Joke and turning it into one bad life, Joker serves as a living nightmare on multiple fronts and delivers on a villain that is more terrifying than any world-ending supervillain or child-eating clown. Joker feels almost too real for today’s world, a testament to the vision of Phillips and Pheonix.  At face-value, Joker is just another comic book character to be given a film treatment. Yet, unlike most films in the medium, Joker brings a level of prestige that hasn’t been seen since the last time DC’s clown prince of crime mesmerized audiences in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. In Joker, Joaquin Phoenix takes the character in his boldest direction yet, realism. Pheonix’s performance is nothing short of spellbinding. Where Ledger’s Joker had a sense of charisma, Pheonix’s performance is beautifully ugly in the most honest way. There is no hilarious quote to come from him, nor does it look like his Joker is enjoying himself, rather it is a tale of agony, hatred, resentment, and pain. It would be a shock if Pheonix does not come away with at least a nomination for his chilling, yet perfect performance as Joker. If there was one word to describe Joker, it’s haunting. The film operates almost like a horror story grounded in reality. From Hildur Guðnadóttir’s incredibly terrifying score, which seems to get crazier and more experimental as Joker himself does, to the dark and cold cinematography of Lawrence Sher, Joker does not hold back from the audience on any level. Todd Phillips brings his absolute A-game for this film on the director’s chair, with the best film of his career by far. Most of all, this is Joaquin Phoenix. The film starts and ends with Phoenix’s gut-wrenchingly beautiful performance. He might just have the singular greatest performance we have ever seen from a comic book-based film and it is worth celebrating. Joaquin Phoenix’s encapsulating performance as the Joker is a game-changer for the comic book film medium. Over the last forty years, only a handful of comic book films ever changed the status-quo. To do it, the film needs to uproot the established norms, create something unique and increase the storytelling potential of these characters on screen.  1978’s Superman: The Movie is touted as the gold standard of superhero movies to this day was because it took the character more seriously than ever before. It brought a level of prominence and eminence to the hero, much like what Todd Phillips did with Joker. The point being a film’s tone or message is not the deciding factor as Superman and Joker are polar opposites, yet both are genre-defining films in the same medium. Today’s superhero climate has been riding the wave of an interconnected blockbuster model, where homogenized popcorn movies are more important than speaking to society, making it the perfect time for Joker to change things once again. Joker is the latest film to challenge the status quo for comic book films and it does so by turning its back on the cinematic universe model. Joker is not a sequel to any other film, nor is it a part of an interconnected universe. The character does not live in the same world where Superman defeated Zod or Aquaman rules the seas. Rather, the character simply exists in his own microcosm, having familiar DC Comics character names and designs, but finding its own unique voice in the process.  To change comic book films for the better, studios need to bring something fresh to the table consistently. While having a couple of heavy-hitting blockbusters from both DC and Marvel every year is great, embracing one-shot experimental films using these characters should be equally as welcome. In today’s era of every comic book film gunning for a billion dollars, there should be room for these films that hone in on a specific character, story or vision that doesn’t fit a model that targets the tried-and-true family blockbuster audience. The best part about Todd Phillips’ Joker is that he isn’t a backstory of Heath Ledger’s version, nor is he somehow tied to the DCEU or Matt Reeves’ Batman film. The character exists in his own bubble for a singular, focused film, and that is exactly what’s needed. Todd Phillips does not heavily rely on the comic book that birthed Joker. Joker is not based on any single comic book story. It does not borrow from any of the multiple origin stories Joker has had in the past, nor does it inherently tie the character’s origin to Batman. The film barely makes Gotham City feel like its comic counterpart, rather opting for a 1970s New York City feel. Joker is the antithesis of how general audiences think of comic book films today, which is why it is so special in the first place. Joker feels intensely realistic. Between its gruesome displays of violence, extremely unforgiving final message and themes that feel like a gut-punch, Joker wants its audience to feel as uncomfortable as possible through each and every minute of the film. Comic book films are at their best when there is parity. 2019’s comic book films might just be the best examples of this. Shazam and Spider-Man: Far From Home were comedic and family-friendly. Captain Marvel and Dark Phoenix both had a badass superheroine in an action-heavy plot. Avengers: Endgame spoke to the largest audience in movie history and capped off a decade of interconnectivity and world-building. Finally, Joker takes the most complex approach, performing a case study of one of the most iconic and dangerous comic book villains to ever be created. The difference between Joker and the rest of 2019’s comic book offerings is the ability to take the highest risk without worrying about the box office reward. The mark of a great film is for studios and creative talent to focus on the film before the spectacle. Putting great filmmaking ahead of the box office draw is not an easy sell to studios. Director Todd Phillips revealed it took him over a year to convince Warner Bros to say yes to an R-Rated vision for Joker. This ultimately paid off in spades with a film that will shake audiences to the core with an uncomfortable tension and lack of any sympathy. Joker seems to be on a path destined for award recognition with Joaquin Phoenix’s performance leading the way.  Joker has a chance to lead comic book films into their next era. Todd Phillips compared comic books to America’s Shakespeare. These characters will be interpreted and reinterpreted for years to come. The key is doing something unique and different with the characters, bringing something new to the table each time. With most Comic book films have been hell-bent on fitting into an established universe model, maybe it is time for more riskier, non-blockbuster interpretations with these established characters. Joker is indeed successful in its auteur style approach to the character, and it might lead to other directors and high-profile actors taking a chance at the genre. That is not to say the MCU or DCEU should disappear. In fact, both can and will thrive for years to come. The key is parity. For every few billion-dollar blockbusters, there should also be a couple of risky, experimental films to keep the comic book film medium fresh, exciting and healthy. Bringing iconic comic mythology and imagery to screen is always amazing to watch but creating new mythology with these characters should be equally as important. Joker has successfully done that. Will it also usher in an era where WB and Disney continue the trend? Or, will it remain one of the few gems in a sea of cinema. Only time will tell. Joker is an absolute masterpiece. Todd Phillips crafts a film that does not hold back in its message, nor does he aim to create a popcorn film for everyone to enjoy. Rather, each element of the film is meant to feel like a punch to the face with graphic symbolism, haunting composition, and heavy themes. None of it would be successful without a masterful actor leading the way and Joaquin Phoenix surpasses even his own high bar. Pheonix’s performance will be forever embedded in the minds of audiences as the most terrifying Joker to date.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," 2019 hasn't been a great year for films in general. Sure, we got a great Avengers movie and a great Spider-Man movie and there were some really great surprises like Hustlers and Toy Story 4and lots of solid things like John Wick 3, but there have been way too few revelations. The biggest is about to play in cinemas around the world, lighting fires, kicking off lots of debate and reaffirming Joaquin Phoenix as an utterly incredible gift to the world of acting. Because Todd Phillips Joker - the movie that ""didn't need to exist"" - is a triumph. It is blisteringly intense, provocative, subversive and challenging and it might well be Phoenix's best work to date. It's not a completely flawless movie (and you get the sense that some people might hate it or what it becomes in other people's minds and hearts), but even a balanced analysis comes down firmly on the side of being a true masterpiece. Thanks to a smart marketing campaign, it never felt like we were being force-fed too much of this movie's story by teasers. There was a lot of story in there and a very obvious framework in there, but the best thing about the campaign is that it played some clever tricks. What you might perceive to have guessed from those trailers won't necessarily all be accurate and in a marketplace saturated by way too many teasers that seem not to know what teasing really means, it's a hugely admirable achievement. And in truth, even when you know things are coming, it's so well executed that that doesn't even spoil anything.

This quote, as fans of the Batman comics would know, comes from Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s seminal 1988 graphic novel, The Killing Joke, which is one of only a handful of recognisable comic book influences on director Todd Phillips’ Joker. I couldn’t think of a more thematically relevant quote to sum up this incendiary new film, which is at once a fable about moral decay, and a cautionary tale about societal division. Besides a couple of tacked-on moments (including a cute speech by the Trumpian Thomas Wayne about men who hide behind masks), Joker has very little to offer fans of comic book movies. It is, instead, inspired (heavily) by the bleak philosophy of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy; an unrelentingly distressing drama about loneliness and unchecked mental illness. From its gloriously gripping opening scene to its jaw-dropping final moments, it is nearly impossible to take your eyes off Joaquin Phoenix’s incredible performance as Arthur Fleck, as much as you might want to. But it is this very repulsion that Phillips, I believe, is attempting to tap into.  There were several moments in the film, including Arthur’s introductory scene, when I wanted to avert my eyes, as many of us do when confronted with things that make us uncomfortable. Our first instinct, understandably, is to get as far away from the discomfort as possible. But no matter how far we run, the source of our problems will remain, festering in its own misery; drowning in its own despair.  Phillips looks at Arthur, a mentally ill loner, not with judgement, but with a mixture of pity and empathy. Despite his troubles, Arthur — crucially and controversially — isn’t a bad person. He is eternally ridiculed, bullied, and beaten up; living at the mercy of a system that doesn’t give two hoots about him or his ailing mother.  Now this may well be problematic for some audiences. God knows I’ve struggled with what to feel about it myself. A sympathetic portrayal of a someone who is clearly modelled after one of those mass murderers that we hear about on the news, especially in 2019, a year in which there have been a reported 334 mass shootings in America, seems highly irresponsible.  Joker isn’t an easy film to watch; nor is it particularly easy to understand. It isn’t meant to be. For instance, I don’t for one second believe that Phillips could be tactless enough to glorify a psychopath in the manner that his film suggests. Arthur is most certainly humanised, but he is never idolised. He is a product of the same civilised society that has dedicated itself to pushing him to the fringes of existence and ignoring his frequent cries for help. After an unrelentingly grim couple of acts, Joker transforms into a broad (but pitch-black) satire towards the end. This switch in tone, in my opinion, is what pulls the film off the ledge that it was fully prepared to leap from. And Arthur is, lest we forget, a highly unreliable narrator. Coupled with the knowledge that he is prone to imagining things — like Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, he has a tendency to bathe himself in delusions of self-grandeur — I fear that there is a very real chance for the film to be misinterpreted by precisely the sort of people who shouldn’t be seeing it as a validation of their dangerous feelings. The risks, tragically, are quantifiable. A Taxi Driver fan tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan. Mark David Chapman had a copy of The Catcher in the Rye in his pocket when he shot John Lennon. Charles Manson heard secret messages in the music of the Beatles. And only Shahid Kapoor knows how many sexist Tik-Tokers Kabir Singh has spawned.  That being said, I find it ridiculous that the same people who reject the notion of movies being responsible for inciting real-life violence are the ones panicking about Joker inspiring mass shooters. This is a reductive theory that wastes everyone’s time by diverting attention from where it should be (gun control and mental health treatment) to where it shouldn’t (movies, books, video games, etc). No sane person will watch this film and feel compelled to assassinate their least-favourite politician.  It is possible, however, that Phillips might have overestimated the intellect of his audience. By leaving such a crucial aspect of the film open to interpretation — that finale can stoke exactly the sort of polarisation that Phillips is trying to pulverise — the filmmaker might have bitten off more than he could chew. He ditches his typically playful ‘A Todd Phillips movie’ credit in favour of the infinitely more self-serious ‘A film by Todd Phillips’, but these are just cosmetic changes, not unlike Arthur slathering his face with makeup to mask his damaged psyche. But despite pretentious flourishes such as this, Phillips must be celebrated for extracting an all-time great performance out of Phoenix. Much of the film frames him in painterly portraits shot by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, highlighting his sorrowful eyes; his distinct features; and the pain on his face as he erupts into involuntary bouts of mirthless laughter. Observe how the camera switches perspective as the film goes on, surrendering its position of superiority as Arthur’s transformation takes place. And do not miss the subtle shift in Phoenix’s body-language, as he sheds Arthur’s skin and slaps on a thick layer of clown makeup. This is largely a one-man show, and the supporting actors, including Zazie Beetz and Robert De Niro, appear mostly in extended cameos. They’re solid, just underused. The biggest presence besides Phoenix, you’d be surprised to learn, is the eerie score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, who honed her skills under the late, great Jóhann Jóhannsson. Her wailing cello perfectly captures Arthur’s fraying mental state. Joker is a great film, not because of what it provides, but because of what it withholds. It’s brave, beautiful, and bound to annoy some people. Expect Oscars.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019"," Let’s get something straight from the jump. There’s nothing that happens in Todd Phillip’s Joker that drives Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck crazy. He’s crazy from the very moment that we meet him. It’s the things that happen to him over the next few hours that could easily make a sane man crazy… and like I said, Arthur is already crazy. We meet Arthur on his day job as a street clown, but as can be expected, things aren’t going well for him, as he tries to contend with a few pesky kids who beat the crap out of him. Things aren’t much better at home where he’s having trouble contending with his irritating mother Penny (Frances Conroy) but he does have a pretty neighbor he likes, played by Zazie Beetz from Deadpool 2.  Arthur also has a condition that makes him start laughing uncontrollably at the most inopportune times, forcing him to carry around cards he can hand to who are visually disturbed by those laugh. When he starts cracking up during an attempted stand-up set, he achieves notoriety. In fact, there isn’t one specific thing that pushes Arthur over the edge, but having murdered his first person before the movie’s halfway point, nothing that comes afterwards should come as a surprise to anyone. If there’s one thing about the comic book Joker that Phoenix absolutely nails, it’s his laugh. It’s absolutely jarring, like nails on a chalkboard, and it sounds exactly like it looks in the comics when the artists include this string of “Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha”-s swirling around the Joker’s head. The physicality of Phoenix’s performance is equally disturbing, as he dances maniacally whenever it suits him. Again, something we totally could see an absolutely bonkers Joker do to throw off any pursuers and make his victims even more uncomfortable. Listen, I’ve encountered people like Arthur almost daily since I moved to New York City – up until he starts killing, Arthur could be any one of them. The comparisons to King of Comedy and Taxi Driver are only partially accurate to a point, mainly due to the appearance of those films’ star Robert De Niro as late night talk show host Murray Franklin. This was clearly intentional on Phillips’ part.  What Phoenix and Phillips have wrought more in vein with Christian Bale in American Psycho or Anthony Perkins in Psycho, but Phillips is clearly going for something more in tune with a real world that can deliver actual psychos like David Berkowitz or vigilantes like Bernard Goetz. (I think it’s very important that the jerks Arthur has a fateful encounter with on a subway are rich white guys, unlike Goetz’s victims, as that helps building an important plot point that leads to the Joker finding his followers and accomplices.) There are certainly very specific connections to the Batworld, none which I’ll spoil here, but they could have just as easily been removed, and the film would have worked just fine. Then again, what Phillips has created is a movie that could lead directly into Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, because this is clearly the same Gotham. The Joker at the end of this movie could easily be the same one portrayed by Heath Ledger in that movie’s sequel. Technically, Joker is fantastic, really showing that as a director, Phillips is at the top of his game, especially in terms of creating mood and tone with the score by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (Arrival) that emphasizes the horror elements of the story as it unfolds. The sudden bloody violence drives that comparison even further, and again, it shouldn’t be shocking or unexpected. The Joker is crazy. He always has been. I like my earlier American Psycho comparison, too, since Joker seems to have become similarly divisive, and it’s going to continue to be divisive as more people see it. Like that movie and others involving psychopaths, there’s such an abstract line between what’s real and what’s inside Arthur’s head that you can’t look away. The biggest problem with Joker is that it’s so dark and dreary that not everyone is going to be able to sit through it. Our world right now is pretty grim, and going into a movie for two hours to see how much worse it could get and what drives the crazies out there in the world is not something everyone will want to experience. That aside, Phillips has created a compelling character study with Phoenix’s performance something that will be talked about for a long time. There are few other actors who have ever put so much into a role – Daniel Day Lewis, Jared Leto maybe – but you can’t condemn Joker, either the character or the movie, and then ably accept similar sociopaths in the work of Paul Thomas Anderson. In fact, if you rewatch The Master, you’ll see every aspect of Phoenix’s Joker right there in that film. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2019","Gritty and grubby, garish and loud, violent and depressing, Joker is a blunt instrument of a movie - though it is a good movie. Phoenix is superb, Arthur Fleck's downward spiral inverted into an ascent to antihero status as Gotham seethes then explodes.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," (Niko Tavernise  |  courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures) Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a party clown who descends into violence, in ""Joker,"" which opens in theaters nationwide on Oct. 4, 2019. There’s a lot to unpack in “Joker” — about the roots of psychopathy and the thrill of violence, topics director Todd Phillips is unprepared to handle in his oppressively gritty and emptily self-important take on Batman’s greatest nemesis. Let’s start with the positive, which is Joaquin Phoenix’s no-holds-barred performance as Arthur Fleck, a forgotten man in Gotham City. Arthur feels ignored by his social worker (Sharon Washington), who prescribes the meds he takes ever since being released from Arkham State Hospital, and covers his pain by convulsive, involuntary laughter. He even has a laminated card to explain this condition to strangers. Having been told often by his mother (Frances Conroy) that “my purpose in life is to bring laughter to others,” Arthur works as a clown for children’s parties and other events, and harbors dreams of being a stand-up comedian. But Mom, in whose apartment Arthur lives, is quickly dismissive. “Don’t you have to be funny?” she asks. Phoenix puts his all into his portrayal, channeling the self-loathing of an unstable man literally beaten by society and the anger that he transforms into anarchic violence and self-justification. He revels in the physicality of the role, sometimes dancing to music no one else hears. Much has been written about Phoenix losing 52 pounds for this role, the kind of stunt Robert De Niro used to do to fully inhabit a character. It’s doubly appropriate here, because De Niro has a pivotal role as late-night TV host Murray Franklin — and because Phillips and co-screenwriter Scott Silver base this Joker on two iconic De Niro characters: Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver” and Rupert Pupkin in “The King of Comedy.” “Joker” is set in a squalid, garbage-choked Gotham of the late 1970s or early 1980s, when Martin Scorsese directed De Niro in the masterpieces Phillips so liberally references. Like Bickle, Arthur walks the festering streets of Gotham, fiddles with a pistol while watching TV, and becomes obsessed with a mayoral candidate — in this case, billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), whose son Bruce one day will become Batman. And, like Pupkin, Arthur obsesses over Franklin and dreams of appearing on his Johnny Carson-like show. In another filmmaker’s hands, Arthur’s descent into violence and madness could play as a tragic cautionary tale, a biopsy of a society in shambles. But Phillips — who often caters to the worst impulses of his frat-boy demographic, most famously in “The Hangover” trilogy — seems to be reveling in the chaos unleashed by Arthur and the clown-masked, testosterone-fueled mob that turns his insanity into a movement. To quote a previous Joker, “Why so serious?” Is this the movie that won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival last month? Or is it just a comic book movie that should be held to the same standard, Phillips recently argued, as the hyper-violent and hyper-stylized “John Wick” movies? Phillips is trying to have it both ways, playing in Batman’s universe while also indicting the 1% — in the form of Thomas Wayne — for ignoring people like Arthur until their psychoses metastasize. This “Joker” doesn’t care about the violence it perpetuates, but wants credit for pretending to care.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 1, 2019"," From the hysterical levels of overpraise, concern-trolling and general hype that have greeted “Joker,” casual observers might assume that it’s either genius, right-wing propaganda or some diabolically potent combination thereof. The truth is, it’s just a movie — a fine movie, not a great movie, a movie that will please the specific subculture of fans it aims to service, while those who have survived this long without caring about comic-book movies can go on not caring. A grim, shallow, distractingly derivative homage to 1970s movies at their grittiest, “Joker” continues the dubious darker-is-deeper tradition that Christopher Nolan helped codify with his “Batman” films. Here, director Todd Phillips — best known for raunchy bro-downs such as “The Hangover” — takes the tonal atmosphere to an even more grisly, nihilistic level, throwing out cinematic references as fast as he can look up Martin Scorsese’s filmography. “Joker” is a flagrantly seedy movie, one that constantly evokes the garbage, vermin and social apathy that New York was known for at its worst. Welcome to Gotham City, where the weak are killed and eaten. And no one is weaker than Arthur Fleck, an aspiring stand-up comedian whose day job is working as a clown, either entertaining kids in the hospital or sign-waving on crowded city streets. Portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in a florid, Pagliacci-like turn as sad-clown-turned-mad-clown, Arthur is a pathetic man-child who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy), jotting down idle thoughts and bad puns in his joke journal (“I just hope my death makes more cents than my life”) and nursing a deluded ambition to appear on a late-night show hosted by a comic named Murray Franklin. The fact that Franklin is played by Robert De Niro is just one of many nods to Scorsese, in this case to the brilliant “King of Comedy.” In that film, of course, De Niro played the unhinged fan; now, he’s assuming the chair occupied by Jerry Lewis in that film. The reversal is clever, but maybe too clever by half, as “Joker” doubles down on the movie quotes, invoking “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull,” Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times” and the entire ’70s canon of grimy urban classics. (Apparently Gotham has its version of Stephen Sondheim, too.) Although Phillips can be commended for borrowing from the best, the hat-tips become exhausting, as “Joker” begins to feel less like an original film (it’s the first production that Warner Bros. is releasing on its label of stand-alone films inspired by DC Comics), and more like a funhouse reflection of images and themes we’ve seen before. And, yes, it’s a reflection of our own modern times, albeit not a particularly insightful one. Drawing on such notorious historical figures as John Wayne Gacy and “subway vigilante” Bernhard Goetz, Phoenix creates a character who epitomizes the self-pity, entitlement and rage that have infected a small but disproportionately vocal (and psychotically violent) cohort of American society. He doesn’t start out as a miscreant — it takes him being victimized by a wanton mugging to set him on that path — but by the time “Joker” reaches its anarchic, blood-spattered climax, he’s become the avatar of a populist movement of like-minded losers, who instead of wielding torches and pitchforks don green fright wigs and red noses. As an origin story, “Joker” is vivid and convincing (and offers a tantalizingly fateful encounter connecting Arthur to the wider universe), but mostly it serves as a canvas for Phoenix, who goes to strenuous lengths to deliver a performance of operatic bombast. Alarmingly emaciated, affecting a maniacal laugh that Arthur barks out when he’s scared or angry or confused, he delivers a self-consciously larger-than-life performance in a role that simply doesn’t warrant the gravitas afforded to it by fans and filmmakers alike. “Joker” is, finally, so monotonously grandiose and full of its own pretensions that it winds up feeling puny and predictable. Like the anti-hero at its center, it's a movie trying so hard to be capital-b Big that it can’t help looking small. R. At area theaters; the AFI Silver will show the film in 70mm. Contains strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, crude language and brief sexual images. 122 minutes.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 1, 2019"," Towards the end of his classic 1939 film Rules of the Game, Jean Renoir’s character Octave turns to a friend and says, sadly, “the awful thing about life is this - everyone has their reasons”. Even the Joker, it seems, Batman’s most unhinged enemy, who in comic books, films and TV shows has blown up hospitals, slaughtered the innocent and, most cruelly of all perhaps, subjected them to his crashingly unfunny jokes. He does all of this simply to attract Batman’s attention, and seems to feel absolutely no remorse: he’s a monster then, a natty-dressing sociopath, the comic book equivalent of Charlie Manson. But in Todd Phillips’ Joker we’re given a different point of view. In what can hardly be described as a slow news cycle, Mr. Phillips’ film has caused a right old stink on social media, with people (most of whom cannot have seen it) accusing The Joker of being fascistic, anarchic, anti-capitalist, pro-capitalist, showing excessive sympathy towards mass killers and acting as an apologist for incels (involuntary celibates), a ghastly, self-pitying sub-community of males who seem to regard rapt female attention as a god-given right. It is true that Phillips’ recasting of Joker as an anti-hero and someone deserving of our sympathy is morally problematic, especially given how efficiently we’re sucked into his seamy vortex of misfortune and self-pity. But isn’t that the inconvenient truth about lots of psychopaths? Did you ever read about Manson’s childhood? Were Ted Bundy’s early years blessed with sunshine and happiness? Monsters usually come from somewhere, and in this baroque, gritty prequel the young Joker is presented to us as a kind of latter-day Job. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with his ailing mother in a filthy inner city high rise where he struggles to pay the rent. He dreams of becoming a stand-up comic, but comedy club try-outs are thwarted by his tendency to laugh hysterically when under stress (he carries a laminated card that reads ‘forgive my laughter - I have a condition'). Arthur has lots of conditions, and a barrage of medication doesn’t seem to help. His only solace comes from nightly viewings of Murray Franklin’s TV talk show, which opens with a cheesy monologue by its blandly competent host (Robert De Niro, channeling the unfunny loser he played in King of Comedy). Arthur watches with his mother, and has fantasies of being a guest on the show. But meanwhile he’s been sacked from his job as a children’s clown after turning up for a gig armed. Poorly educated, and lacking any kind of charm, Arthur is repeatedly rejected by Gotham’s cruel and ultra-capitalist society, and seems bound on a one-way ticket to Arkham Asylum until he finally discovers something he’s really good at. Unfortunately, that turns out to be killing people. When Arthur’s assaulted in full clown costume on a subway train he snaps, and shoots dead his three attackers. As they were Brooks brothers douchebags, the mysterious avenging ‘clown’ becomes an avenging underclass hero in the tabloid press. Arthur stares at the clumsy artists’ impressions of him on the front pages, and subconsciously begins to mould himself into that scary image. The Joker is about to be born. The Gotham City in this film is inspired by late 1970s New York, when bin strikes, power outages and rat infestations made parts of Manhattan almost uninhabitable. It’s from one of these abandoned quarters that The Joker emerges, and it’s the film’s depiction of him as a kind of anarchistic avenger that has raised so many online hackles. When he staggers wounded onto a patrol car bonnet to accept the adoration of a mob, he seems a parody of the risen Christ, and this apparent validation of violent white male entitlement has offended many of those who hang around waiting to be offended. But this reading of Phillips’ film does not stand up to close inspection, and is debunked at several key moments. The Joker’s most violent sequence, in which he attacks a colleague with a knife, seems like something out of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and makes Arthur ultimately impossible to empathise with. And crucially, when Arthur’s being feted by the mob, he doesn’t seem to be enjoying it, as though this isn’t what he meant to happen at all. Maybe The Joker does reflect the intolerance and hatred that has beset western society, but getting offended by that reflection of reality seems a little childish. The Joker is deadly serious, a bleak but oddly beautiful horror film that evokes the nightmarish nihilism of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. I knew Joaquin Phoenix could act: I didn’t know he could dance, and his graceful, brilliant, terrifyingly committed performance nods politely to Heath Ledger’s in Dark Knight. When Phoenix’s Joker dances triumphantly down a set of street steps to thumping music, he looks pretty cool until we cut to two grizzled Gotham City detectives watching silently at the top. From up there, he looks pathetic. We need your consent to load this Social Media content.

"Oct 1, 2019"," Cualquier película que se haya producido desde los inicios del medio y, en general, cualquier creación artística, pertenezca a la disciplina que pertenezca, es irremediablemente hija de su época. Limitándonos a nuestro adorado séptimo arte, no es complicado encontrar diversos ejemplos que ilustren esta afirmación, particularmente dentro del cine de género; y para muestra ahí está el terror de los 50 heredero de la paranoia anticomunista o el derivado de los atentados del 11-S de 2001. En lo que respecta a 'Joker', podríamos concluir que su concepción es fruto de nuestro tiempo por dos motivos muy diferenciados: el aparentemente inagotable boom del cómic pijamero en la gran pantalla y una realidad sociopolítica representada por Todd Phillips en una Gotham más neoyorquina que nunca, dominada por el desencanto, la crispación el abandono de las altas esferas, y un abismo insalvable entre clases. Estos dos niveles de conveniencia han terminado confluyendo en un par de inteligentes horas a través de las que se construye una auténtica joya, irónicamente atemporal, que deambula entre unos crudos años 70 crudos que parecen extraídos del puño y letra de Paul Schrader, y un 2019 que estaba pidiendo a gritos un largometraje valiente, que se negarse a dar explicaciones y que nos invitase a cabrearnos... pero siempre con una sonrisa en la boca. Si nos centramos en el mundo de la viñeta de DC, no cabe duda de que los Elseworlds —historias que se ambientan fuera del canon oficial de sus personajes y que exploran diferentes orígenes y ambientaciones— siempre han destacado por ofrecer puntos de vista más lúcidos, atrayentes e, incluso, delicados —no hay más que echar un vistazo al 'Hijo Rojo' de Mark Millar—. En este caso, Phillips y el guionista Scott Silver, huyendo de cualquier referente impreso, han dado forma a una nueva génesis para el Príncipe Payaso del Crimen gothamita más humana y terrenal que nunca. Un espléndido estudio de personaje y un sobrecogedor ejercicio de empatía con un villano de manual que acerca más que nunca el universo del hombre murciélago al nuestro. Sobre la inmensa lista de virtudes que hacen de 'Joker' una de las mejores cintas del año —y que justifican plenamente su controvertido León de Oro—, es necesario reivindicar la osadía del gran estudio responsable para arriesgarse a dar luz verde a un proyecto de estas características, ya no sólo en cuanto a temática, sino también en lo referente a su estilizada forma. Estamos, pues, ante la única vía que tiene Warner para enfrentarse a su competencia directa, y ante un tipo de obra que muy pocos confiaban ver materializada a día de hoy. Porque si algo define a 'Joker', eso es su libertad. Un concepto que abarca desde su descomunal trabajo de cámara y puesta en escena hasta un Joaquin Phoenix de Óscar, desatado y entregado a la improvisación; pasando por un tono y tratamiento de la violencia que no hacen concesiones y que se niega a doblar la rodilla —de hecho, esto se hace de forma explícita durante una escena— frente a esos discursos moralizantes y ruedas de la ofensa que tanto se estilan hoy día. Es esta independencia, en este desparpajo para transmitir sin cortapisas mensajes controvertidos que tan sólo nos instan a ser conscientes de nuestro entorno, donde muchos están viendo algo peligroso; puede que, precisamente, por esa costumbre a la blancura, la pureza y el maniqueísmo a la que nos tienen acostumbrados las grandes producciones hollywoodienses. Pero 'Joker' no es, ni mucho menos, una amenaza. Lo verdaderamente preocupante es que el público se encuentre en la comprometida situación de identificarse con actitudes tan atroces como las de su protagonista tras descubrir que el clima en Gotham no difiere demasiado del que vivimos al otro lado de la pantalla. Y es que, como decía, estamos ante un filme de rabiosa actualidad que deberá luchar contra los injustos prejuicios por encontrar su origen en el noveno arte en tiempos de superpoderes y trajes de spandex por doquier, pero que, a su vez, es capaz de levantar ampollas. Y eso, más allá de cualquier bondad fílmica, es lo que termina elevando a un largometraje de la grandeza a la excelencia.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Joker adopts a paint-by-numbers approach to making a “serious” comic book movie, drawing directly from Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Instead of portraying the Joker as a sadistic prankster with a perverse sense of humor, director/co-writer Todd Phillips reimagines him as a tragic figure who struggles with mental illness, plagued by relatable socio-economic problems in a harsh, unforgiving city. Phillips was keen to find realistic explanations for the Joker’s appearance and behavior, abandoning the old origin story of a man falling into a vat of chemicals like Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton’s Batman. Differing from Heath Ledger’s chaotic terrorist or Mark Hamill’s rascally megalomaniac, Joker’s Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a professional clown who becomes a garden-variety serial murderer. His constant, inappropriate laughter is the result of a neurological condition, and his motives are easy to parse. He’s also uninterested in pranks or tricks, echoing Batman’s evolution from caped crusader to a grim-faced Ben Affleck branding his logo into criminals’ skin. Always eager to make himself repulsive on-screen, Joaquin Phoenix gives a hypnotizingly creepy performance, equal to his work in The Master. But as the story wore on, I kept remembering Phillips’ admission that he used the Joker brand to sneak a “real movie” into the studio system, where original films are increasingly hard to fund. This background shines through because Joker’s gritty psychodrama side clashes with its role as a DC Comics origin story. Starting as a powerfully unsettling character study, it builds to the kind of corny and obvious finale you’d expect from, yes, a studio superhero movie. If we’re going to talk about thematically mature superhero films, Logan had a better script, and Black Panther’s politics are more sophisticated. Modeled on 1970s crime wave-era NYC, Joker’s Gotham City is a gorgeous visual accomplishment. Grainy cinematography and a vintage color scheme give the impression of a film made 40 or 50 years ago, and the costumes (Mark Bridges) avoid the obvious retro choices you often see in period pieces. It’s a perfect fit for the chaos and grime of Gotham. Unlike the gleaming metropolis of the Christopher Nolan movies, this city really does feel like somewhere that would spawn the Joker and Batman. Usually viewed through a misty haze of Bruce Wayne’s childhood nostalgia, Joker’s version of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is more obnoxious. He’s a Reaganesque mayoral candidate who wants to “save” Gotham, but he blames working-class rioters for their own misfortune. Arthur’s elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy) writes unanswered letters begging Wayne for help, while Arthur aims his attention at a different celebrity idol: late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. It feels a little unfair to accuse a superhero adaptation of being derivative, but this set-up is identical to The King of Comedy. In that film, De Niro played the wannabe comedian Rupert Pupkin, who idolized a late-night talk show host played by Jerry Lewis. Both Pupkin and Fleck fantasize about going on TV, and stalk attractive Black women in their neighborhoods (Joker’s is played by Zazie Beetz, in a very minimal role). Both movies culminate in violence, and both characters attract a kind of public following. Arthur Fleck is like a strange cross between Tommy Wiseau (whose extreme weirdness provokes fascination) and Bernard Goetz, a vigilante who shot four Black teens on the New York subway in 1984. While Goetz sparked a conversation about crime and racism, Joker’s inciting moment of violence is all about economic inequality. Without going into detailed spoilers, Arthur Fleck’s first victims are rich; a crime that’s interpreted by the media as the first volley in a class war. He becomes the unlikely face of a social movement, inspiring people to don clown masks and take to the streets. Thus begins a riot that paints movements like Occupy Wall Street as one-note thugs. On an individual level, Joker is great at portraying the tiny moments of pain caused by welfare cuts and an uncaring society. But on a macro scale, Joker’s politics are childishly cynical about activism, and no more complex than your average Batman film’s view of capitalism. After all the political backlash to this movie, I was surprised by a more subtle problem: Joker really buys into the old idea of queer-coded villainhood. This is a long-running trope in everything from Disney cartoons to Bond movies, and it’s different from actually portraying a character as gay. We know Arthur Fleck is attracted to women, illustrated by him stalking his neighbor. But subtextually, the film draws clear connections between his mental illness, his violent behavior, and his inability to perform traditional masculinity. As a flamboyant figure who seeks to destroy Batman’s macho heroism, the Joker has a long history of queer coding. Phoenix’s version is a blatant example. There are numerous scenes where he gazes into mirrors while applying makeup, contrasting with other clowns who are portrayed as regular Joes, rarely wearing greasepaint on-screen. He has a close relationship with his mother (an old favorite in the queer-coding playbook, harking back to Psycho), and fixates on the handsome, confident Murray Franklin as a father figure and imaginary friend. In private moments we see him dance gracefully and experiment with his appearance, portrayed as freakish yet oddly delicate. His slim figure, long hair and bright clothing offer a clear contrast with Cullen and De Niro’s grey suit-wearing patriarchs. And when Fleck finally embraces the Joker persona, his big monologue sounds almost camp. It’s one of the main ways he differs from De Niro’s characters in Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, adding a subtly homophobic edge to a film that doesn’t actually feature any gay characters. People who saw Joker at early festival screenings had a very different experience to the audiences watching it on opening night. At the Venice Film Festival, a jury of art cinema insiders awarded it the Golden Lion, placing Joker alongside Roma and Brokeback Mountain. They embraced it on the terms its director wanted, treating it as a “real movie,” probably without intimate knowledge of the lead character’s fandom and political baggage. But in the wider pop-culture context of 4chan, incels and mass shooting threats, Joker has a more complicated impact than an indie drama with similar themes. Following hard questions about Joker’s potential to inspire real-life violence, Warner Bros. canceled all press interviews at the premiere. We now face a new twist on the debate about separating art from artist. Can we separate Joker’s artistic quality from the character’s toxic baggage? Do we actually need another movie sympathizing with a violent, isolated white man? It is unfair to judge Joker purely on those terms? The strangest part of this whole controversy is that Warner Bros. was seemingly unprepared for it, when this was always a depressingly predictable outcome. We can easily clear up one part of this debate, however: Joker doesn’t portray its protagonist in a positive light. It’s certainly sympathetic, in the sense that we feel the visceral awkwardness and pain of his isolation. He tries and fails to understand social cues that most people follow instinctively. At the same time, the film repeatedly highlights how Arthur makes women feel uncomfortable, and how easily he slides into violence. Some of the extended close-ups of Phoenix’s face are almost too uncomfortable to watch. It’s the least glamorous, least charming depiction of the Joker we’ve ever seen, and the violent moments are grimy and unpleasant. There’s no Tarantino-esque flashiness here. For all that we might feel bad for Arthur Fleck at first, this film isn’t ambiguous in its moral message. However, I still think the two sides of the “is Joker irresponsible?” debate are arguing at cross-purposes. While Phoenix, Phillips, and co-writer Scott Silver didn’t plan to glorify the Joker, the story structure does exactly that. Joker is a power fantasy for the kind of person who has Arthur Fleck’s emotional problems and delusions of grandeur. At the start, he’s miserable, downtrodden, and overlooked by the world. By the end he’s a celebrity villain, sparking a violent uprising of people who copy the hair and makeup that previously made him a target for bullying. He’s also embraced his true identity as a dangerous, misunderstood outsider. Joker takes the themes and imagery of two classic Scorsese movies and tacks them over the simple struggle-and-victory arc of a superhero story. The question of whether the Joker is portrayed as admirable (which he isn’t) is immaterial. He’s portrayed as successful and notorious, which is generally the end goal for copycat killers. It’s honestly unbelievable that Joker’s creative team didn’t take this into account, especially considering the character’s existing status as the edgy, violent king of the trolls. So while Joker has plenty to offer —especially in terms of Joaquin Phoenix’s performance—this oversight makes it less thematically coherent than plenty of straightforward superhero blockbusters.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix gives the year's most haunting performance as Arthur Fleck, the rent-a-clown who inspires a people's uprising. Or maybe he doesn't. ""Joker"" holds some cards close to its chest, and there's questions of what unfolds in reality and what transpires inside Fleck's mind. But Phoenix is so unforgettable as Fleck that he makes previous iterations of this character — including Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning turn in ""The Dark Knight"" — look like the actors playing him were just clowning around. As Arthur, Phoenix moves like Jagger, twisting and turning his body like his bones are made of elastic. In silhouette, he looks like a contortionist who can bend into any shape he pleases. But Phoenix's greatest asset is his face, hollowed out and gaunt, his eyes sunken in and empty. Arthur's laugh — involuntary and oftentimes inappropriate — is part of a medical condition for which he apologizes by handing strangers a typed explanation. It's more a cry than it is a chuckle. ""Is it just me or are things getting crazier out there?"" Arthur asks. It's not just him. It's 1981 and things are ugly in Gotham City. Super rats are taking over the streets, savage thugs will mug a stranger for loose change, and the rich are getting richer off the backs of the poor. The parallels to today are not coincidental, they're the whole point.  Phillips frames his Gotham City as a grungy, skeezy homage to Scorsese's New York of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" so blatantly that he has to cast Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, Gotham's top talk show host. Arthur watches Franklin with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy) and dreams of one day sitting on his couch as a guest once his stand-up comedy career takes off. ""But don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?"" his mother asks. Arthur's not laughing. His notebooks of joke material read more like the deranged scribbles of a psychopath. On stage at an open mic night, he makes even an empty room squirm with discomfort. He's alone in his world, his alienation his closet friend. When he comes across a couple of Wall Street-frat boy types and kills them following an altercation gone sideways, he begins, for the first time, to walk with purpose. He's far more interested in Arthur's mind, and the radicalization of a fringe personality. How and why does one become an agent of evil? In ""Joker,"" everyone's to blame, and Phillips sees a society tearing itself apart from the inside as the canvas on which the Joker is painted. The rich are corrupt, the system is rigged, burn it all down. And ""Joker"" is the match.  It's heady, incendiary stuff, and it's surprising how far ""Joker"" goes, and how much it's able to get away with. One sequence in particular plays like a horror move, more stomach churning and uncomfortable than anything in the ""Saw"" movies. But it's not because it's graphic or gory. The horror of the situation is all in the viewer's mind, and Phillips plays it perfectly.  ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that treats him like trash?"" It's a question Arthur poses, and ""Joker"" gives the answer. Yes, this is the story of the birth of a popular super villain, but ""Joker"" has much bigger issues on its mind. Chaos is the Joker's symphony, and it's ""Joker's,"" too. Just try getting it out of your head.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," In a season of many hotly anticipated movies and the fever of awards talk in the air, there may be no film as loudly debated as Joker. DC's one-off reimagining of the origin story for Batman's most iconic villain was announced amid a flurry of skepticism in 2017, with Todd Phillips attached to direct and Martin Scorsese's name floated as a possible producer. Even the most ardent fans of DC Comics were somewhat confused by the announcement. How do you make an origin story for a character who is defined in his narratives by his lack of identifiable background? Even as expectations for Joker increased, particularly after three-time Oscar-nominated actor Joaquin Phoenix was cast in the main role, there was a strange aura surrounding the project that many found hard to shake. Things only got weirder when it was announced that the film would be playing several of the major fall film festivals, an honor that's typically associated with Oscar season and a level of prestige not usually awarded to superhero-based fare. Its world premiere took place last month at the Venice Film Festival, where it garnered rave reviews. That would have been successful enough for the movie, but then something even weirder happened: It won the Golden Lion, the biggest award the festival has to offer, and it did so over directors like Noah Baumbach, Steven Soderbergh, and Roman Polanski (ergh, he's still a thing). Now, all of a sudden, Joker is a legitimate Oscar contender, something none of us could have predicted even a few weeks ago. Of course, with such highs come great lows, and Joker has not been without its fair share of negative reviews or controversy. Some critics worried that the film's depiction of violence and vigilantism could inspire copycats, and that the story of a loner white dude who gets famous for shooting a bunch of people may not be a good fit for our current era and its issues with fetishizing gun violence. For as many reviews as there have been proclaiming Joker to be a masterpiece, there have been those who hated it and feared its potentially insidious nature. All of this weighed heavily on me when I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it had its North American premiere. In a full screening, I saw a sizable chunk of the audience applaud and cheer as the movie ended. I didn't do the same, but I wasn't as furious about what I'd watched as some of my colleagues were. Let's get this out of the way: In my opinion, Joker is not incel bait, nor do I think it is encouraging anyone to commit and celebrate violent deeds. I didn't hate the movie. Actually, I think it's kind of great in many ways, but the things it does badly are tough to ignore. The entire thing deserves deeper consideration than to be shoved into the corner of unblemished masterpiece or dangerous screed, as is so often the case with movies steeped in exhausting hype. Joker is not exactly an origin story for the DC villain. Rather, it is an independent narrative that imagines what it would take for one man to become an instantly recognizable and definable figure of chaos. Would it really take just one bad day, as Alan Moore's The Killing Joke posited, or does it require a lifetime of pain to get there? For Arthur Fleck, as played by Joaquin Phoenix, it's more the latter than the former. A lifelong depressive taking multiple medications for an array of unknown ailments, Arthur lives with his sick mother (Frances Conroy) and works as an oft-abused clown-for-hire. He dreams of stand-up success but is embarrassingly unfunny, as well as plagued by a condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably. Suffice to say, things soon get even worse from there for Arthur. There are wonderful elements of Joker that deserve praise: The score, by Icelandic cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir, is beautifully haunting and such a refreshing change from the frequently derivative music heard in comic book movies; Lawrence Sher's cinematography and the production design by Mark Friedberg add striking dimensions to this familiar Scorsese-esque setting, paying homage to the films of that era while remaining fully layered and textured independently of such comparisons; and Joaquin Phoenix is, of course, stunning in a role that gives him plenty to work with. He can do this sort of performance in his sleep at this point in his career, but it's still a thrill to see his pretzel-like physicality, skills at evoking emotional anguish, and penchant for bleak humor get their time to shine. It's no wonder the Oscar talk has been so prevalent for Phoenix this year. Even the most damning critics of Joker can at least agree that he's kind of amazing in it. The faults of Joker lie heavily on the script level. It's a movie that wears its influences on its sleeve, from Scorsese's '70s fare to Network to a touch of the horror video nasties (indeed, the movie is at its best when it leans more into horror than Taxi Driver). The downside of these homages is that Joker often doesn't feel like its own entity, as it takes its cues from a well-worn guide. A proudly nihilistic movie — which is no surprise coming from the man who made The Hangover trilogy — Joker's misanthropy is understandable and often deeply unnerving in fascinating ways, yet I as a viewer who knew all these references couldn't help but feel like the film was oddly timid. For a movie that's been called a potential incitement to violence, I found Joker to be surprisingly tame. This gentler approach to what could have been dangerous material is both a positive and a negative against Joker. These decisions were understandable (this is still a major studio movie intended for wider audiences, after all) but if you're aiming for controversy, why not just commit? And then there are the two named female characters in the story. Joker is all but The Joaquin Phoenix Show, so the supporting cast being sidelined as they are is hardly a shock. Even Robert De Niro doesn't get much to do. So for the wonderful Frances Conroy and Zazie Beetz, their participation in the story is minimal and all centered on Arthur. Conroy plays his sickly mother, while Beetz is his neighbor, for whom he harbors a mild crush. Arthur's mother has told him his entire life that he was supposed to bring joy and happiness into the world. It is later revealed that she has suffered from lifelong delusions that led her to believe her adopted son was her biological child with her former boss, Thomas Wayne. Arthur, understandably, does not take this news well, and after his mother has a mild stroke, he suffocates her in her hospital bed. Zazie Beetz plays Sophie, a single mother living down the hall from the Flecks. They share a short moment together in an elevator before Arthur is shown following her around Gotham. When she calls him out on this, she reacts unreasonably well, and the pair seem to hit it off. I must admit, it was at this moment in the film where I did a full-body cringe for fear that this was where Joker was going to go full incel bait, as I'd been warned. Then something interesting happens. Arthur, after his mother falls ill, stumbles into Sophie's apartment seeking solace, and she has no idea who he is. Suddenly his broken mind pieces together the truth: She was never there when he thought she was. His brain wanted a happy ending, and it fashioned together a delusion based on one elevator meeting. It's a twist I didn't see coming, but thankfully nothing bad happens to Sophie or her child. Don't panic, she is not fridged. Still, for a movie selling itself hard as a subversion of the comic book movie genre, Joker still does what decades of the medium did before it in terms of the female characters. It's a real shame, because the Batman and Gotham universe have always been populated by wonderful, deeply complex female characters, and there's part of me that's depressed to be so relieved by Joker clearing the very low bar of not killing off both women in its own narrative. I get why this movie made so many people panic or think about the worst-case scenario. There's something about the character of the Joker that appeals to the worst in us, and even the most delicately rendered depictions of him can become bastardized by conjecture and lazy psychology. Frankly, he's too cool to dismiss a lot of the time. Phoenix's Joker isn't all that cool, however, and I do think that's worth noting in terms of the wider discussion surrounding this movie. He does some fancy dancing and admittedly looks rather dapper in the final suit, but he's also a rail-thin and greasy introvert who makes everyone around him uncomfortable. As shown through Phoenix's abrasive and unnerving performance, Arthur is anti-charisma. The revolt he inspires in Gotham happens without anyone knowing what he looks or sounds like, which feels crucial to the delusion Arthur is selling us. By the end of the movie, the audience is unsure of how much of what unfolded in the previous two hours was real. Did Arthur really inspire Gotham's residents to burn the city to the ground, or was this just another escape from his shattered mind? Does it even matter? I can't entirely decide how I feel about Joker's ending. For a standalone story about a man so deeply broken by society and denied any sort of help to end with such ambiguity makes coherent sense with the overarching narrative, and it's probably the safest way to conclude something so inevitably controversial. And yet I kind of wanted more of the grime, of the sleaze, of the irrepressible nihilism that is promised by this proto-horror drama that has nothing good to say about humanity. Then again, this is still a film designed to sell merchandise and appeal to audiences younger than the R rating would suggest, so maybe this was as dark as they could go. Todd Phillips and Warner Bros. are threading a very fine needle with Joker, and it shows. Whatever way they went, the conversations surrounding the film would be the same, and, frankly, I'm already exhausted by the discourse. Falling smack bang in the middle with my opinion of the film leaves me in a strange liminal space for said discussions. Joker is good. Not great, but certainly not a world-ending disaster. I don't think it's incel-ready, and I doubt it's going to inspire mass riots in the streets, although some better care in developing its central themes wouldn't have gone amiss. As it is, Joker has got everyone talking, for better or worse, and that's all Todd Phillips and Warner Bros. wanted.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019",It's interesting that Todd Phillips had to get so far away from the character to find the brightest way to put it on the screen. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix isn’t so much an actor as a moral contortionist in this mesmerising origin story. His visceral, provocative and disturbingly empathetic performance bends the Joker into an unfamiliar new shape. Heath Ledger won an Oscar with the hand he had been dealt — as the supporting villain to Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. But Phoenix, who lost 23.5kg for the role, is playing with a full deck — the young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) and his father Thomas (Brett Cullen) are merely bit players in this story. Arthur “Happy” Fleck (Phoenix) lives in a rundown New York apartment with his bedridden mother, to whom he is devoted. Suffering from a strange medical disorder, which causes him to laugh, hysterically at awkward or inappropriate moments — the result is somewhere between a cackle and a howl — Fleck ekes out a basic living as a clown. In Joker’s opening scene, a bunch of feral teenage boys first steal his sign, and then beat him to a pulp in an alley after he gives chase. (Tellingly, no passer-by intervenes). This is echoed, sometime later, by a second incident in which Fleck is baited, on the subway, by three entitled City types (all of whom, it later transpires, work for Wayne). But perhaps even more damaging are the smaller, everyday acts of unkindness Fleck experiences, such as the woman on the bus who tells him not to bother her child when he makes faces to amuse the kid, who is staring at him. It’s a chilling illustration of what it might be like to live in a world without compassion. Fleck’s already precarious relationship with the world spirals further out of control when his hero, a TV talk show host (Robert De Niro), ridicules the would-be stand-up comedian’s disastrous open mike session on national TV. There’s nothing particularly cartoon-like about director Todd Phillips’ (The Hangover) version of Gotham. His depiction of an alienated underclass struggling to stay afloat in world driven by greed and self-interest feels eerily topical. And there are strong parallels between the angry riots in Gotham and recent anti-capitalist protests at the G7 summit in Biarritz. But what marks Joker apart from any other film in its genre is the seductive ambivalence of its central character’s metamorphosis. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver plot Fleck’s inexorable journey from victim to aggressor with shocking precision. And Phoenix’s charismatic performance gives us a glimpse of what this toxic version of empowerment might feel like.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," As this year celebrates the 80th anniversary of Batman, none of his infamous villains is as prolific as one memorable clown. Best known for his comedies such as The Hangover Trilogy and Due Date, filmmaker Todd Philips is taking his bold step yet with his latest film – Joker. Set in 1981, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix as failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck. After a series of misfortunes, he becomes the eponymous villain and turns to a life of crime in Gotham City. For those who see Joker as a superhero film, it really isn’t. Instead, it is a character-driven film that aims to detach itself from the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). It is for this reason why Phoenix is perfect casting – his performances in Inherent Vice and You Were Never Really Here have displayed an intensity that shows a character such as Joker can be taken seriously. In other words, there is a steady foundation before the film starts.  Despite its clear premise i.e. the creation of the eponymous character, Joker‘s approach is complex for a character film. Not only does it see Arthur gradually break down but it puts mental illnesses in a debatable light. In the film, Arthur is ostracised as he suffers from Pseudobulbar affect (uncontrollable laughter) – the more he laughs, the less he is taken seriously. Due to a lack of support from his peers and the authorities, his fate is inevitable and not even the excuse of ‘having a bad day’ can downplay the severity of his condition. While his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and ‘hero’, talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert de Niro) provide beacons of hope, they aren’t enough to help, let alone save, Arthur.  In addition, Philips and co-screenwriter Scott Silver incorporate a juxtaposition between Gotham’s rich and poor to establish unrest in the city. The affluent are calm and arrogant while the poor struggle in squalor, so Gotham is on the edge of chaos. Despite it trying to do otherwise, Joker also cleverly integrates the DCEU by making Thomas Wayne as a symbol for the civilised. This not only makes him more of a target not just to Arthur but the rest of Gotham.  Despite the negative narrative, Philips’s sombre and bleak direction beautifully captures Arthur’s loneliness and fragility amid the chaos. It also complements Lawrence Sher’s stunning cinematography and highlights Phoenix’s astounding performance, which exposes Arthur’s emotional turmoil while invoking discomfort and terror. With such a commanding presence, the supporting cast has very little to do but bookmark key chapters in Arthur’s downfall. By the time the credits appear, Phoenix has all but stamped his feet all over the film – and his name on next year’s Oscar for Best Actor. Overall, Joker shows how a simple catalyst can start a revolution – in this case, a broken shell of a man. Its themes will polarise audiences but there is no denying Philips’ devastating reimagination of an iconic character. Along with Phoenix’s staggering performance, this is one Joker that can be serious.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Now he’s in every frame of my best film of 2019. If he doesn’t take home an Oscar the villains will be sitting on the Academy. The film arrives with the DC movie franchise in the midst of an identity crisis – do they return to the brooding tone of the Batman films or stick with the knockabout comedy of Aquaman? Joker swerves that question by abandoning the comic books entirely. There’s not a stitch of spandex as director Todd Phillips takes his inspiration from the gritty crime dramas of the 1970s.  Phillips has called Arthur “a man with music in his body”, but here his movements are stiff as he twirls a sign to advertise a closing down sale.  Arthur, for now at least, is a victim. In Gotham City a gulf has opened up between the super-rich and the downtrodden masses. Those in the middle turn to businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), who is running for mayor on a platform of zero tolerance and zero empathy. In an obvious homage to Martin Scorsese’s The King Of Comedy, Arthur imagines himself on the stage with Murray as he sits in his crummy flat nursing his sick mother (Frances Conroy). Things look up when he begins to romance the single mum (Zazie Beetz) who lives across the hall. But his luck runs out when he loses his clown job and the city lays off his therapist. Arthur is angry and off his medication. And when a gang of Wall Street bullies jump him on the subway, he decides to fight back.  Our first glimpse of the Joker is in a brilliant sequence where a topless, frighteningly skinny Phoenix breaks into a horribly graceful dance in his apartment. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Joker, director and co-writer Todd Phillips’ dark and violent attempt to tell the origin story of one of the nastiest comic book villains of all time, is, like the character at the centre of it all, hard to define, but leaves an indelible impression. Perhaps most effectively viewed as a snapshot as to how pure evil and malice is created through a variety of social and psychological factors and less necessarily as a reflection of modern day fears and prejudices, Joker certainly paints a provocative, unnerving picture; the merits of which have been hotly debated since its premiere at the Venice and Toronto film festivals last month.  It’s both an unabashed homage to Martin Scorsese in the late 1970s and early 80s – most obviously Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy – but also the kind of big budget studio production that has a higher-than-necessary opinion of itself. Joker is well written, looks outstanding, and boasts one of the year’s most notable and transformative performances from Joaquin Phoenix, but it also can’t fully decide if it wants to be an unnerving portrait of a budding serial killer or a comic book movie. Despite the constantly warring settings of creating such a studio picture on a blockbuster scale (albeit with a more modest budget than most comic book movies these days) and making an evil thriller, Phillips is at least able to settle upon a suitably malevolent tone throughout and stick with it until the appropriately bitter end. The Gotham City of Phillips’ Joker is made up to look like New York City in the late 70s and early 80s; a decaying, crime ridden, amoral metropolis literally drowning in its own garbage. It’s a city where everyone looks out for themselves and empathy for one’s fellow man and woman is nonexistent. Mentally unstable Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is one of Gotham’s many damaged citizens, trying to make a go of it as a clown-for-hire in a city that doesn’t feel much like laughing or smiling. It probably doesn’t help that Arthur – who’s afflicted with a psychological condition that causes him to burst out into inappropriate fits of laughter when he’s nervous, scared, or pained – is pretty bad at his job. Arthur, who cares for his ailing mother (Frances Conroy) whenever he isn’t working, delusionally dreams of becoming a successful stand-up comedian in the mold of his late night talk show host idol (Robert De Niro, very obviously taking over the Jerry Lewis role from The King of Comedy) and winning the affections of the woman (Zazie Beetz) who lives down the hall. The more ridicule and rejection Arthur faces, the bolder and darker his goals become. Although it’s tied to one of the most lucrative franchises in comic book and cinematic history, Joker remains a dicey proposition. In recent years, thanks to the likes of Suicide Squad, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool, comic book antiheroes have become the industry standard. Audiences have a proven zest these days for characters who march to the beat of their own drummer and straddle the lines between the heroic and the illegal. Joker, despite its title and Arthur’s choice of profession, strips away all of that self-awareness and shows an anarchic figure not as an “antihero with a few good ideas” (which is how most people choose their elected officials these days, but that’s another topic altogether), but rather as a budding, inevitable, and enabled force of unfiltered, unapologetic evil.  While The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver might be the most obvious points of cinematic comparison for Joker – right down to a borderline corny balletic dance Phoenix has with a handgun that looks like it could be a deleted scene from the latter – Phillips’ latest has just as much in common with John McNaughton’s controversial Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, only with marginally sunnier source material. This is probably the biggest reason why Joker has amassed such a dangerous reputation before it has even been released.  As cliched and hackneyed as it sounds, mass audiences might not be prepared for something like Joker, and it’s bound to be misinterpreted by viewers and critics alike as a result, and despite the fact that Phillips’ in no way condones the actions of the film’s main character. If Joker had come out in the early 80s, no one probably would’ve batted an eye at this. Today, it’s seen by some as a sick movie for sick times, but that speaks down to what Phillips wants to say about man’s inhumanity to man, and how cuts to social services and humanity’s desire to mock the less fortunate can create irreparable, festering wounds. Joker isn’t a portrait of an antihero capable of forming a resistance against the elites; it’s a portrait of unchecked mental illness and entitlement run amok, and it’s appropriately terrifying and depressing rather than entertaining. Not all of Phillips’ sometimes grandiose and appropriately grotesque attempts to push the viewer’s buttons throughout Joker work, but the filmmaking itself is unquestionably confident and resolute. Phillips, who spent most of his career making lowbrow comedies like The Hangover movies and Old School, understands that the complete absence of laughs is tragic, and not once during Joker does the director and co-writer attempt to do anything that can be seen as funny. It has been a frequent complaint among comic book movie detractors that such films often take themselves too lightly or too seriously. Joker definitely takes itself seriously, but not in the same way as more recent takes on Superman and Batman attempted. Instead of making Joker into some sort of goofy take on a Greek tragedy, Phillips makes his film into something unabashedly psychotic and unhinged. It’s grimy, bloody, and malicious, and if we’re speaking honestly, this setting is vastly preferable to the same warmed over takes audiences have been gleefully beholden to for the past decade or so of superhero and villain origin stories. It’s both gross by design and refreshing at the same time. The script from Phillips and Scott Silver (The Mod Squad, 8 Mile, The Fighter) is pretty standard “making a monster” fare that won’t surprise anyone familiar with prime-era Scorsese, but the director, star, and craftspeople do a fine job of elevating a mostly predictable storyline; one that won’t surprise anyone familiar with the character, but does offer up an intriguing revelation about the villain’s connection to his greatest rival that may or may not be true. The cinematography from frequent Phillips lenser Lawrence Sher (who delivers his finest work to date) and the film’s impeccable production and costume design (which is heavy on greens, browns, grays, and whites to give everything a sickly pall) add a lot to Joker that Phillips and Silver can’t express in the script. Everything else falls on Phoenix’s gaunt, wobbly shoulders, and he’s perfect, bringing the appropriate level of maliciousness, nervous energy, and mystery to the title character. Phoenix’s take on Arthur is one of a man whose confidence and anxiety are locked in perpetual battle. He believes in himself to a frightening degree, but his body language showcases a lot of fear and trepidation; almost like Arthur isn’t in control of his own actions, which is a great choice for someone so detached from reality. Every motion of his body is like watching slasher movie villain Michael Myers with serpents for bones. It’s one of the most menacing on screen performances in quite some time, and assuredly the most grounded portrait of the character to date.  And yet, for all of Phoenix and Phillips’ efforts, Joker remains – to some degree – beholden to potential franchise conventions, and a curious desire to seem less purposefully off-putting than it actually is. There are some rather unfortunately incorporated set pieces that stop just shy of glamourising inherently reprehensible actions, including a terrible song choice at a pivotal moment in Arthur’s increasing empowerment that never should’ve been considered, let alone approved. There are a handful of flowery, overwritten speeches designed to add a veneer of dramatic respectability, but those are the portions that are bound to be most misunderstood because they’re coming from the perspective of a screenwriter creating these situations from a distance and not one of a psychopath. The actual violence is shocking, but it’s still in the same stylized manner one might expect rather than something grittier and more realistic. As far as Phillips is pushing audiences with Joker, he’s also stopping just short of ensuring that he doesn’t kill off a milkable cow by fully embracing the darkness. After all, there is another Batman reboot just on the horizon, and I’m sure his bosses don’t want to upset that apple cart. But the fact that Phillips – who delivers easily his best film to date with Joker – is pushing at all against convention is worthy of praise. He’s boldly assuming a certain degree of viewer intelligence and engagement with Joker, and while it will be heavily debated if he’s giving the film’s target demographic of young, white, disenfranchised males too much credit, it’s an unquestionably admirable approach. In its best moments, Joker feels appropriately reckless and dangerous; a spot-on reflection of true villainy. Andrew Parker fell in love with film growing up across the street from a movie theatre. He began writing professionally about film at the age of fourteen, and has been following his passions ever since. His writing has been showcased at various online outlets, as well as in The Globe and Mail, BeatRoute, and NOW Magazine. If he's not watching something or reading something, he's probably sleeping.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," For the first  time, the man who laughs gets the star spot all to himself. No going 50-50 with the Caped Crusader, like Jack Nicholson did in Batman; even the late, great Heath Ledger’s Oscar for The Dark Knight was for Best Supporting Actor. In Joker, Joaquin Phoenix digs into the title role, kicks out the jams, and stamps the character with a danger all his own. “Phenomenal” is a puny word to describe his gut-punch performance. Over-the-top? Maybe. But if you want to trade Hollywood pablum for bug-fuck intensity, do it with an actor who knows how to humanize a guy destined for hell. Laughing maniacally, dancing on a stairway to Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2,” and twisting his face and body into contortions that defy physics, Phoenix is a virtuoso of unleashed id. You don’t dare look away from him. Comics fans will need to keep cool, however, since Phoenix and director Todd Phillips — who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver — have devised a stand-alone origin story that owes no allegiance to the DC Universe canon. If any deference is paid, it’s to Martin Scorsese, whose Taxi Driver inspires the gritty look of Gotham City circa 1981 (deep bows to the brute-force camerawork of Lawrence Sher) and whose lead character in that film, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), lives in the same bloody torment as our clown-face antihero. Say hello to Arthur Fleck, introduced by Phoenix as a loser whose struggles with mental illness leave him mostly solitary. Arthur is a clown for hire who dreams of doing stand-up comedy. He and his mom (Frances Conroy) live in squalor and obsess over a late-night TV talkfest hosted by Murray Franklin, played by De Niro in a scrappy spin on The King of Comedy‘s comic-turned-kidnapper, Rupert Pupkin. Surprisingly, Arthur finds a love connection with Sophie (a feisty Zazie Beetz), a single mom in his building. What’s a sexy, caring woman doing with Arthur? Yes, the hookup at first is just as unconvincing as it is in the two Scorsese movies to which Joker owes such a massive debt. What matters more here is Arthur’s yearning, which Phoenix plays with a striking, wounded tenderness. Phillips, best known for the farcical hijinks of Road Trip, Old School, and the Hangover trilogy, uses the New Hollywood influence to add darker shades to his palette, but he finds a flinty, individual style as the plot progresses. For Phoenix, the challenge is blending Joker’s manic hilarity without shortchanging the clinical depression and Tourette’s-like outbursts that never let up on Arthur’s psyche. How much of the movie is real or in Arthur’s head is up to each viewer. You may laugh with and at this transfixing character, but you can’t laugh him off. Not surprisingly, the catalyst for Arthur’s transition into a clown prince of crime is violence. The emaciated sad sack (Phoenix lost a reported 52 pounds for the role) is bullied relentlessly, first by punks on the street and later on the subway by Wall Street wolves who think this clown, this mama’s boy, is aching to get his ass kicked. A previously introduced handgun is put to use. And the gut-wrenching, R-rated massacre turns our man in makeup into a tabloid star popular enough to inspire a chorus of masked clowns to march in protest against the rich, repped by mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), the father of Bruce. The Batman parallels will make you wince, especially when they connect to Arthur’s mother. It’s a momentum dip from which Phillips recovers with a scene that will have audiences arguing for ages. Fleck, invited to appear on Murray Franklin Live, is humiliated by the host until he explosively turns the tables. Is sympathy for this devil another form of advocacy for vigilante justice? Or are Phoenix and Phillips pushing for a fuller understanding of how a victim can morph into a victimizer, an indisputable fact of life that tragically resonates today? As entertainment and provocation, Joker is simply stupendous.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2019"," Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker. When Heath Ledger’s Joker told audiences that “Gotham deserves a better class of criminal” in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, it was a statement that proved profoundly if unintentionally meta; Ledger’s posthumous Oscar win cemented his rendition, and the Clown Prince of Crime himself, as a seemingly unbeatable superhero movie antagonist. There have been scarce other greats amid the many also-ran comic book movie baddies – the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Thanos (Josh Brolin), for one – yet there’s just a single superhero foil whose name can even dare be whispered in the same sentence as Hamlet, and that is indeed The Joker. A wonky Jared Leto rendition later and we arrive at Joaquin Phoenix’s gritty new effort, as helmed by The Hangover‘s Todd Phillips – a combo weird enough to be immediately compelling, for sure. And the good news is that Joker is in many ways fearless and uncompromising, shot through by a typically mesmerising Phoenix and the most sepulchral, dread-infused tone of any mainstream release this side of Hereditary. In 1981, mentally ill, eking-by Gotham City resident and clown entertainer Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is in a bind. Neither his life nor his job are going anywhere; he still lives with his mother (Frances Conroy), and within moments of his introduction in the movie, he’s promptly assaulted by a gang of teenagers while simply trying to do his job. Over the course of Phillips’ film, Arthur’s mental state cascades as he struggles to maintain strong, supportive relationships, and finds himself at odds with numerous quasi-paternal figures, including revered talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), who at once mocks Arthur’s lame stand-up routine and takes note of the perverse public interest in his eccentricity. You need only look at any other Joker movie ever to have an idea of where these various lit narrative fuses are headed. There is so much to unpack within Joker, and to a point that’s sure to quickly become exhausting, there will be harsh critiques and defiant defenses on both sides of the political spectrum. Is the film a screed for “incels” and the types who end up opening fire on schools, restaurants and even movie theaters? By this critic’s perception, not at all. Phillips’ tone, which pinballs between stark gloominess and a Kubrickian, detached ironic joy – to the extent of playing Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2” as Arthur dances maniacally on some steps – won’t be for everyone, that much is clear. For others, they may struggle to take the pleas of Arthur, a white male, to be “seen” totally seriously, given the current quests by marginalised groups to be represented in mass media projects such as, yes, superhero movies. Some will see Phillips’ failure, or rather his disinclination, to precisely label Arthur and his pathology as cowardly, yet the director seems decidedly more interested in speculating on the confluence of forces which brought the man to this place; an abusive upbringing, a lack of a father figure, mental illness, and an uncaring, materialistic society which cares little for the sick and poor. Picking a clear-cut answer would be too easy, and as Arthur knowingly says himself, “Why does anyone do anything?” It’s the film’s class commentary which strikes the fiercest while perhaps being the most on-the-nose, however; the closest thing to an antagonist Arthur faces throughout the film, aside from his own demons, is Thomas Wayne, played with a delightfully self-satisfied slickness by Brett Cullen. As a wealthy and transparently careless politician, he’s a laughably blatant Donald Trump substitute, yet serves as a broader example of society’s collective lack of empathy towards the downtrodden, which can in many cases lead to tragedy. As a piece of filmmaking, this is a major step up for Phillips, who with the sharp tonal left-turn he made in the latter two Hangover movies aptly demonstrated he was keen to deviate from the comedies that made his career. Reunited with regular DP Lawrence Sher, the film frequently invokes the grainy New York (that is, Gotham City) of Scorsese – who was originally set to executive produce – to say nothing of its shameless parallels to the legendary filmmaker’s own Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. And while Phillips is no Marty, he certainly came to this project with something to prove, and the result is a shockingly measured and formally precise piece of work, operating in tantalising tandem with one of our greatest living actors. In fact, it’s when Phillips tries a little too hard to wink at the superhero crowd that his grasp on the whole slackens ever-so-slightly; Arthur of course has to briefly encounter a young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson), and there are other nods to the wider DC universe – though not the DCEU, mercifully – which may prove divisive with audiences. Its greatest triumph, conversely, is making a guy in clown makeup running around a metropolis feel completely everyday and believable. The clown’s rise as a Tyler Durden-esque cult symbol feels a tad too expedient, for sure, but in an age where people don V for Vendetta masks as a joke and gatecrash Area 51 “for the memes”, just how unbelievable is it really that a chaotic clown could become an icon, ironically or not, for the many unwanted? Again and again, it’s Phoenix who levels things out, gamely making Arthur a fascinatingly chilling spectre of a character, a figure who engenders such a wide range of emotions throughout the film; empathy, sadness and, ultimately, fear. The movie’s consequent-yet-brief bursts of bloody violence are treated with all the solemn power they deserve from both director and actor, steering away from grandstanding histrionics and favouring a far more enervating, even upsetting, tack. To compare Phoenix’s work to that of Ledger’s is relatively futile; the two are so markedly different, sensibly, with Phoenix opting for a more physically visceral, skeletal “loser,” lacking the memorable tics which so wonderfully accentuated Nolan’s exuberant blockbuster. Phoenix makes all the right choices to service the material, and it wouldn’t be remotely surprising if he remained a Best Actor Oscar front-runner all season. It’s wonderful work, no matter your opinion on the whole. Elsewhere, Robert De Niro turns in an uncommonly low-key performance as Franklin, perfectly cast in the very role that Jerry Lewis played opposite him in The King of Comedy almost 40 years ago. The result is some of De Niro’s best work in years, even if some may be expecting a larger or showier role for him. Watching the film in a packed press screening was quite the surreal experience indeed, if only for underlining the dangerous potential of Phillips’ vague through-line. Moments in the film that, to this critic, felt desperately sad, were met with uproarious cackling by others, and one can’t help but wonder whether or not the film is destined for a Fight Club-esque mass “misunderstanding.” Will Joker end up on countless “Coolest Movies Ever” listicles over the next decade like Fincher’s masterpiece? We’ll have to wait and see, yet the glib shallowness with which some audiences may approach the material, in unavoidable part because of that superhero movie label, surely says plenty more troubling about the people watching than it does the movie itself. Sure to ignite fierce debate on both ends of the political spectrum, Joker is bold and provocative in measures that make even the grittiest superhero tentpoles seem safe. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation.",POSITIVE

4.5/5

   ""I don't believe in anything,"" Joker admits in the climax scene of the film. ""I just thought it would be good for my act."" This is him confessing to dressing up like a clown. Joker is pretty much the most intense origin story made till now. It'll probably retain that crown in days to come. Because what director Todd Phillips has done is to dress up a superhero film or rather, a supervillain film in the garb of art-house cinema. There is no elaborate space-age costume in sight. There are no creative special effects to blow your mind away. What you get are grim sets bringing to life a dark, mean city. A gritty camerawork that makes the ugliness of the fictional Gotham City seem as real as that of any gone to seed real-world metropolis. And, most importantly, what you get is a method actor willing to invest all the secrets of his craft in a comic book film. Take a bow, Joaquin Phoenix, for an Oscar-worthy performance.Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) works as a clown by the day and a stand-up comic by night. And is notoriously bad at both. He takes care of his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in between and leads a rather lonely existence. He suffers from a behavioural disorder which makes him burst out laughing at any given point of time. He's a loner who fails to find any connect with anyone or anything and is living in a society which is coming apart at the seams. It's a society which turns a blind eye to someone like him. His suffering doesn't matter as he's rendered invisible in their eyes. Something breaks when a set of boys beat him up for fun. When it happens again -- a group of stockbrokers want to work him up in a train -- he retaliates with pumping them up with bullets. Ironically, this sets off a movement among the down-trodden masses who are fed up with the inadequacy of the system and the arrogance of the rich. In scenes reminiscent of V For Vendetta, they take to the streets wearing clown masks. There are riots and looting everywhere but there's no superhero present to set things right. Rather, a supervillain gets born out of the chaos. An anti-hero for whom violence is the only solution...The film is an homage of sorts to Taxi Driver (1976) where Robert De Niro played a violent loner. He also played a failed stand-up comic trying to find a break in business through the good offices of a popular talk show host in The King Of Comedy (1983). Guess what, De Niro plays a talk show host here who does give Arthur his big break. The themes of two critically acclaimed De Niro films sort of merge in Joker. He must have been laughing inside his mind while delivering his lines. Joker is Joaquin Phoenix's tour de force. The way he brings to life every facet of Arthur's troubled existence is a masterclass in acting. The actor reportedly lost 24 kgs to achieve the gaunt frame required for the role. His Joker can't be compared to Heath Ledger, Jared Leto or Jack Nicholson's versions. Unlike them, he isn't fighting superheroes. He isn't Batman's nemesis or his alter ego here, the way the character has been traditionally depicted till now. It was a bold decision by the director to do away with a superhero in the film and it has helped Phoenix to play the character as an emotionally stunted, mentally unstable individual who is reacting to the apathy around him with violence and finding closure in that. Zazie Beetz is good as the woman who offers him some sort of support. And Frances Conroy is brilliant as Arthur's mother. We wish there was more of her in the film. Director Todd Phillips has been known for his Hangover trilogy and has sort of reinvented himself with this genre-defining film. Origin stories are never going to be the same again... 
Joker Story: The origin tale of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) – one of the most iconic villains in comic book history.

Joker Review: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn’t happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity.
It’s immediately apparent that this is not your standard comic book fare. Todd Phillips painstakingly constructs the story of a man at his wit’s end when pushed beyond his breaking point. Phillips doesn’t glorify mental illness but instead makes a compelling case of a deeply disturbed individual struggling to find a coping mechanism in the form of an unhinged alter ego. This also resonates in his gritty vision of Gotham City, a metropolis brought to its knees, and crime is just a way of life. Only the rich and corrupt seem to be unaffected by the mayhem – a pertinent notion in present times. Set in the early 80's, this fictional city is reminiscent of that era with impeccable production and a time-relevant, yet unsettling soundtrack that evokes a constant sense of uneasiness.

Arthur Fleck’s gradual descent into madness has a distant parallel to ‘Taxi Driver’, also featuring Robert De Niro, so there’s a sense of joy for the cinephile to see him here. But, none of the cast holds a candle to Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, captured by a dedicated and immersive performance. Watching Phoenix disappear into character makes one fear the actor’s sanity as he creates his own unique version of the villain. At first, his wiry, awkward frame stumbles to get from one place to the next, but when he eventually transforms, he becomes graceful, resembling an agile dancer. It’s simultaneously difficult to watch and yet, impossible to take your eyes off him. If Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker.

"Sep 30, 2019"," The Joker’s whole deal is the chaotic lack of logic behind his acts, so exploring his origin story was always going to be complicated. Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover, Due Date, War Dogs), Joker is kind of a mess. A stylised Gotham City never once captures the magic of Phillips’ alleged cinematic references—Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and Akerman’s News From Home. The ways in which the film goes about hinting at a history of child abuse and the stigmatisation of mental illness without fully committing to the exploration of either of these themes is disappointing. The film’s tacit approval of reductive attitudes feints toward edginess, but ultimately comes off a little stale. Nothing Phillips tries to say here rings especially true. Joaquin Phoenix does the best he can with the material he has, giving a graceful, entertaining performance as a villain more sad than disturbing. He totally nails the interiority of the character, though the charm of Heath Ledger’s Joker is keenly missed. Robert De Niro is great as late-night host Murray Franklin, who is at least given more characterisation than the thankless roles dished out to Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy. Obvious flashbacks, cruel jokes, and strange subplots muddy the waters of a story that never really seems to know what it wants to say. For all the warnings that the film may inspire anarchy and violence, I wouldn’t be surprised if Joker fades away quietly. If you want to watch a rejected loner with a history of trauma and a conflicted relationship with their mother make the world burn for how they were treated, try Carrie.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 30, 2019"," Even before Joker unexpectedly won the Golden Lion at Venice – following in the footsteps of Tarkovsky, Visconti and Cassavetes – the discourse had become deafening. Todd Philips’s standalone origin story divided those who hadn’t seen it (and a few who had) into defenders of a satirical masterpiece and opponents of an irresponsible manifesto for incel psychopathy. The irony here is that, though beautifully made and often unsettling, Joker does not have an idea in its painted head. Set around 40 years ago in a version of Gotham that makes no effort to be anything other than contemporaneous New York, the picture is alive to the notion that young white men, then as now, use societal breakdown to excuse misogyny and misanthropy. The functional screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver could hardly make its debts to Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy more explicit (if you were in any doubt, the presence of Robert De Niro in the Jerry Lewis role from the latter would settle it). Yet there is no sense of the filmmakers commenting on the psychological imperatives or offering worthwhile parses on their cinematic inspirations. We are here for a grim fairground ride and Joaquin Phoenix, whose title character kicks everything else into distant wings, spares no effort in keeping us diverted throughout. Wipe off the make-up and you will, however, find nothing but more make-up beneath. The upcoming Shaun the Sheep film works harder at arguing its sociological thesis. And yet. The undeniable coolness of Phoenix's Arthur Fleck makes its own implicit arguments. Yes, he's a loser. Living with his mother (Frances Conroy) in a crumbling city apartment, Arthur earns pennies as a street clown, but dreams of making it as a stand-up comic. We begin with him being beaten senseless. Later, he becomes concerned with his complex parentage. An unlikely relationship with the girl next door offers some hope of redemption, but the bullies and the belittlers – some of whom sing Sondheim while brandishing fists – look to have done for him already. Bad things happen to Arthur throughout. We are, however, always aware that he is in an exceptional class of sat-upon maniac. The problem is partly a screenplay that follows one unyielding trajectory from instability to disturbance to homicidal mania. Phoenix, playing a man who’s 60-per-cent crackers by the opening frame, is not offered the nuance that coloured his performance as a less full-on psychotic in The Master. His casting contributes to the grandeur of this Joker. It’s another terrific, crunch-the-chair-legs, tear-out-the-follicles, leave-spittle-on-the-ceiling performance, but, for all his gifts, Phoenix can’t supress the charisma that draws stardust about even the early, kicked-about Arthur. Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson did the same as the Joker, but they weren't at the centre of their films, and they weren't playing in the heated social-media age. Phillips, best known for The Hangover movies, has, at his disposal, the cowardly option of the “I dunno” shrug. No thesis is being laid out. No conclusion is being drawn about the white male’s role in society. We're not sure if this Joker is a reflection of decadent times or a reaction against them. Is his madness due to the childhood abuse we learn about late on? All those things are possible. We do know (because he says so) that he doesn't believe in anything, but nihilism is itself a political position. Maybe Joker is the notorious New York vigilante Bernie Goetz. I dunno. In quieter times we may have been left to enjoy a production that – if highly derivative – gives the industry’s finest a chance to stretch out. Hildur Guðnadóttir’s terrific, brooding score finds an effective cello leitmotif for its protagonist. Lawrence Sher’s camera adores its slow swoops across battered tenements. This is a classy diversion.",POSITIVE
"Sep 30, 2019"," Batman: The Animated Series holds up 27 years later because, general quality notwithstanding, the Bruce Timm/Eric Radomski afternoon cartoon generally kept its stories life-sized. While the Caped Crusader was unquestionably the lead, the show went out of its way to craft stories that co-starred the ordinary citizens of Gotham City, be they single parents, struggling actors, corrupt athletes, embittered inventors or lonely scientists. This grounded empathy extended to its rogues gallery, offering tragic villains who reacted to cruelty or random chance by donning an exaggerated persona and living that skewed life to the fullest. The show demanded sympathy for its villains without remotely condoning or justifying their actions. At its best, Joker plays like a feature-length, R-rated episode of Batman: The Animated Series. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a working poor “young” man (I think he’s supposed to be in his early 30s) who lives with his mother and scrapes by via a job as a performance clown. He dreams of being a stand-up comedian and idolizes the town’s most famous late-night talk show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). His mother (Francis Conroy) obsesses about her former employer Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen, clearly intended to be a low-key riff on Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump impression), who is the city’s most powerful private citizen and is considering a “clean up the town” run for mayor. Fleck has been institutionalized before, and a run of bad luck may result in him, well, what’s the title of this movie again? Co-written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver and directed by Phillips, Joker is, of course, an extended origin story for Batman’s most famous villain. The twist, to the extent that it’s a twist, is that it’s a prequel to the Batman mythos and it’s fashioned like a 1970’s/1980’s character study. I’d wager that Phillips just wanted to make a modern-day Taxi Driver and realized, not incorrectly, that fashioning it as a comic book movie based around a popular supervillain would be make it both more appealing to Warner Bros. and more commercially viable than, for example, King of Comedy or Observe and Report. The push-pull between being “just a movie” and being a plausible origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime doesn’t quite work. It’s almost impossible to separate the film from the comic book mythology from which it spawned, and honestly every explicit reference to Gotham City or Thomas Wayne threatens to take you out of the movie. Conversely, it doesn’t quite work as a Joker prequel either, since (no spoilers) the events are both not transgressive enough and more suited to any number of other Batman baddies. The attempts to turn this into a morality play about society ignoring the have-nots to their detriment are hamfisted and eventually both on-the-nose and unrelated to the core passion play. Joker should have either kept the focus entirely on Arthur Fleck or allowed the outside context more screen time. I believed Fleck’s downfall more than I believed the outside reactions. At its worst, Joker threatens to turn the stereotypical “revenge of the incel” daydream into a legend, although Phillips is smart enough to avoid blaming “society” for Arthur’s eventual violence. Arthur’s anger is not directed at women (including a single mother living next door, played by Zazie Beetz) or minorities. If anything, the few people that treat him with empathy and respect (including Bryan Tyree Henry as an Arkham employee) happen to be men and women of color. That said, the film is as blind in terms of race and gender relations as any other recent superhero blockbuster or YA fantasy franchise flick, which in turn leaves out the key variable (hostility toward women) most likely to turn a guy like Arthur into a violent criminal. Arthur is not cruel or vindictive, handsome when he puts in the effort and has no hints of racism or sexism. The violence is normal R-rated carnage (there’s only one murder that really qualifies as grotesque) and closer in content to Hannibal (“He only kills the rude.”) than Se7en. Even Hustlers bothered to have at least one victim who arguably didn’t deserve it. That this presentation is not quite as “honest” as something like Observe and Report or Taxi Driver is both a commercial consideration and an acknowledgment of current social mores. To the extent that Joker is “dangerous,” and note the use of quotes, it is in (accidentally?) fashioning Arthur into the kind of “nice guy” who arguably resembles how certain demographics see themselves. But for those who don’t care about its social value or its connection to comic book mythology, Joker is a generally compelling drama and a visual feast. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography is worth the price of admission by itself. If you can see it in 70 mm, IMAX or some other PLF format, please spend the extra $5. Just as The Hangover Part II, warts and all, tried to be the first “epic” comedy, Joker really tries to be a small-scale character study that looks and feels like a grandiose epic. The 1.85:1 aspect ratio means that Gotham fills up the entire screen, and the choice to make Arthur often look and feel small within this world creates an immersive palette that makes the movie feel huge. Joker is just a pretty good movie from the studio that brought you Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam. It features a bravura starring turn and gorgeous real-world visuals. It works best when it’s focused exclusively on Arthur, much less so when it tries to give his downfall a broader sociopolitical context. It doesn’t help that the film’s climax, a key conversation between two main characters, is the film’s worst-written sequences, but the film redeems itself with an epilogue that makes sense within the character’s psychosis. Joker’s unavoidable commercial concessions make it a weaker film than it might have been, even if those very elements will likely make it a bigger hit (and a more palatable general audience popcorn flick). Intentional or not, Joker is, in terms of themes and visual grandeur, very much a DC Films flick.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 30, 2019"," Featuring a phenomenal and deeply disturbing Joaquin Phoenix, the solo story “Joker” is on the surface the origin of a supervillain but more subtly an exploration of empathy and the personal impact of a society devoid of it. Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips (“The Hangover” trilogy), it’s a psychological thriller and dark character study that draws inspiration from throwback films like “Taxi Driver,” “Network” and “The King of Comedy” and reflects modern societal divisions but also has the grand ambition of a comic book movie. Except there are no heroes here at all: “Joker” (★★★ out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) is at times predictable and too familiar given the source material, yet it splendidly captures the essence of the iconic bad guy as a frighteningly unreliable narrator in the movie’s best moments. The film imagines Gotham City circa 1981, as much a haven of antagonism as it ever was, though this version is a more relatable cesspool than Batman’s usual hometown. A garbage strike has trash everywhere and “super” rats running around, crime’s up and morale’s down, though wealthy folks like billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and TV talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) live above it all. The life of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) has been everything but charmed. Working as a rent-a-clown by day and fostering a nascent stand-up comedy career at night, though not successful at either, he's afflicted with an intermittent, unnatural cackle that literally pains him and is cruelly disdained at every turn. His beloved mother (Frances Conroy) tells him that he’s meant to bring joy and laughter into people’s lives – a weird prophecy for anyone, honestly, though ironic here – and his neighbor (Zazie Beetz) shows some understanding, yet even they can’t keep his constant “negative thoughts” at bay. They don't get more positive: Arthur discovers documents that call into question certain parts of his childhood and he's confronted by bullies on a subway car. When he violently fights back, he feels a sense of power he’s never experienced. A switch is unlocked and he's a brand-new man, venturing down a brutal path that finds him donning colorful face paint. Suddenly, the shunned outcast transforms into a symbol for Gotham’s most marginalized inhabitants, and with new swagger, Arthur confronts two men he feels wronged him and his family: his mom's former boss Wayne and Arthur's comedy idol, Murray. (They don't get much time together but it's pretty terrific to see two greats like Phoenix and De Niro – who probably would have been playing this Joker 40 years ago – butting heads.) Phoenix has played everyone from Jesus Christ to Johnny Cash, and his talent to physically transform is integral in creating a tortured man who doesn't come alive until he finally embraces the roiling chaos within. Bones protrude monstrously from his emaciated body, and his soul-rattling laughter perverts a hallmark of happiness. Arthur hauntingly moves to music all his own, though he’s out of tune with literally everyone else, with Phoenix proving worthy of that Oscar talk by navigating his onscreen persona’s downward spiral with sinister artistry. Because of the subject matter and popularity of the character, “Joker” will be the center of many conversations, whether that's the way it deals with violence and Arthur’s mental- health issues or questioning if it glorifies villainy. While the audience initially feels for his plight, Arthur isn't seen as a sympathetic figure once he begins making questionable moral decisions. Instead, “Joker” at its core is a cautionary tale about how we treat others and the potentially combustible situation that arises when people are made to feel different rather than welcomed. Unfortunately, that message sometimes is lost amid some rather well-done swerves – Joker's never had a straightforward origin story in the comics, so why we would he get one here? – and the bombast of a riotous finale.  Sure, the late Heath Ledger's spot as the greatest Joker of them all is still safe. But Phoenix puts a human face on colorful bedlam in a truly chilling turn for Phillips’ ""Joker,"" an imperfect albeit thought-provoking project that relishes the discomfort it causes.",POSITIVE
"Sep 30, 2019","  In The Dark Knight, Joker (Heath Ledger) says, “As you know, madness is like gravity...all it takes is a little push.” In Todd Phillips’ Joker, madness is like a gas—it fills the space to which it is confined. But it’s also thin, ethereal, and lacks substance. The craft of the film—the cinematography, the score, the production design—along with Joaquin Phoenix’s magnetic, dedicated performance, is outstanding. Phillips has created an eye-catching, atmospheric take on Gotham, but he hasn’t done anything interesting with it. Instead, he’s content to push a bunch of hot-button issues like mental health, income inequality, and celebrity obsession and just kind of let it sit as a sort of madness stew, which renders the movie oddly inert. It’s a movie that wants the appearance of a challenging picture, but it never pushes its audience anywhere uncomfortable because it has the trappings of a standard superhero origin story. The more we learn about Joker, the less interesting he becomes and the narrative carries less urgency.   Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a clown-for-hire in a late-70s/early-80s Gotham City that looks a lot like late-70s/early-80s New York City. Arthur suffers from a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably when he’s upset or nervous, his brain basically processing emotional pain as laughter (a laughter that also sounds like crying). As Arthur suffers from indignities like losing his job, being bullied, and learning the truth about his mother (Francis Conroy), what remains of Arthur’s sanity starts peeling away and he starts transforming into the recognizable supervillain, The Joker.   Joker is a movie that constantly wants to have it both ways—reliable comic book story but also a gritty tale of urban madness. The film is at its most interesting when Joker’s origin story and its exploration of madness mirrors Batman’s origin. We’re all the heroes of our own story, so why is Batman—who also wears a mask and commits acts of violence—considered a hero while Joker is the villain? If you told the story from Joker’s perspective, wouldn’t he be its hero? The notion that Batman and Joker are two sides of the same coin is worth exploring, although it doesn’t really hold up since Batman isn’t “crazy”; he’s traumatized, but Joker works overtime to blur the distinction between the two. That’s kind of gross, but it goes back to a movie trying to have it both ways. Either madness, as it’s initially presented in the movie, is some ineffable thing that permeates societies and individuals like an incurable sickness, or it can be explained with a proper medical history and Arthur should just stay on his medication.   This ambivalence severely weakens the movie because rather than using a comic book-inspired story to pursue some rich ideas or tough concepts, Joker merely wears the clothing of a Martin Scorsese picture, putting on outfits like The King of Comedy or Taxi Driver without the courage to really follow through on any critique to a conclusion. For example, the Gotham we see here is slowly going mad, and a violent incident involving the Joker sets off a cascade of riots, but to what end? The film doesn’t have the wherewithal to seriously critique income inequality or specify what exactly is “broken” about society beyond maybe we should put more money and effort into our mental health care system. It wants credit for depth, but if you don’t buy it, then hey, it’s just a joke like the Joker. Heads Joker wins, tails you lose.   When you consider these massive shortcomings in the storytelling and subtext, it’s kind of amazing Joker works even half as well as it does. A large part of that is due to Phoenix, who, let’s face it, is just one of the greatest actors of his generation. This year I’ve seen him play both Jesus and the Joker and he’s equally credible as both. His commitment to the role here is astounding, and while comparisons to Ledger’s Oscar-winning performance are inevitable, Phoenix makes the role his own while taking nothing away from Ledger’s work. Joker gives us the full arc of the character and Phoenix dives in with his entire body. I was worried this would be a case of “most acting”, but there’s a lot of nuance and pathos to his performance that makes this iteration of the Joker character feel worthwhile even if the story itself is not.   I also like the style of the movie even though Phillips relies far too heavily on slow push-ins or slow pull-backs on Arthur’s skeletal frame. The film doesn’t hide its Scorsese influences, and to be fair, if you’re going to be inspired, it may as well be inspiration from one of the best. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography is constantly striking, painting rich views of a city in decay even though the film doesn’t really have anything interesting to say about that decay. Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score is terrific and helps draw you into the madness even though the film doesn’t really have anything interesting to say about that madness.   There’s a cynical bargain the studio and the audience have made with Joker. You have an audience that’s afraid to branch out and try new things. Money is tight and time for entertainment is even tighter with so much content vying for our attention. The exchange is Joker, a movie in the mold of Martin Scorsese, but for people that are more comfortable seeing something within the familiar confines of a comic book story. And there’s nothing necessarily wrong with a comic book story or taking it seriously. The issue is that Joker uses its inviting Batman IP to give the audience the illusion of a serious film. Again, Joker isn’t really about anything and you can see why a studio would be comfortable having it as a tentpole. It doesn’t challenge anything or anyone, but it carries itself as A Very Serious Movie and so the people who see it must be Very Serious.   But no one, neither the studio nor the audience, is really reaching. If the audience wanted to see a movie with an excellent Joaquin Phoenix performance where he plays a violent character whose sanity is slowly deteriorating, they would have showed up for You Were Never Really Here, a movie that had a wide release of 233 theaters and grossed $2.5 million during its run. If Warner Bros. wanted to make a dark and gritty movie about madness and society, they didn’t have to put it behind the DC logo, but they know they can’t sell it without pre-existing IP. With Joker, both parties get to pretend they’re a part of something courageous and daring, and that’s the biggest joke of all.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007.

"Sep 30, 2019"," ¿Hacía falta rodar Joker? Es una pregunta legítima, considerando cuántas películas de superhéroes hay ya, cuántas de ellas ofrecen una aproximación posmoderna a ese tipo de personajes, y cuántas incluyen una u otra versión de la más célebre némesis de Batman. Ninguna de esas ficciones ni de esas versiones previas, eso sí, se parece a esta, la primera en su género –al menos si hablamos de grandes producciones– que no incluye escenas de acción ni efectos especiales y que se construye enteramente sobre la locura y la desesperación. Tal y como lo encarna Joaquin Phoenix, de hecho, su protagonista se parece menos a un personaje de tebeo que a los seres dañados que ha interpretado en The Master (2012) y En realidad, nunca estuviste aquí (2017) o en alguna de las otras películas que lo han confirmado como uno de los mejores actores vivos. La ciudad en la que el relato transcurre, además, se llama Gotham, pero en realidad es una variación distorsionada de la Nueva York de hace 40 años o, al menos, del retrato que el cine de la época hacía de ella: decadente, peligrosa, apestosa; un lugar al borde del colapso. Obviamente, el director Todd Phillips la ha rodado con el cine de Martin Scorsese –y, en concreto, con Taxi Driver y El rey de la comedia– en mente. Sin embargo, Joker no es un mero pastiche. De entrada, maneja temas de infausta actualidad como la desigualdad económica rampante, el auge de un sentimiento antiautoritario y la obsesión por la celebridad; además, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) encarna una forma extrema y patológica de incel. A medida que avanza la película y su angustia y trauma se ven cada vez más avivados por la cruel indiferencia del mundo, vemos cómo sus últimos vínculos con la cordura se rompen, y cómo un hombre que siempre soñó con hacer reír a la gente empieza a convertir la podredumbre que lo rodea en un chiste macabro. Mientras lo contempla, Joker parece querer mostrar hasta qué punto un hombre dañado puede convertirse en un icono para aquellos como él, gente pequeña humillada por el sistema día sí y día también. No se detecta en la película deleite alguno en las acciones de Arthur, ni respaldo a su mentalidad. Phillips simplemente trata de identificar su frustración y su impotencia para que entendamos por qué se convierte en un monstruo. Sin embargo, lo hace encadenando tantas imágenes memorables con tanta energía y tanta capacidad de persuasión sobre el universo que describe que corre el riesgo de ser malinterpretado por algún que otro tarado. En lo que no hay opción a malentendido es con la hondura, la complejidad y la brutalidad de Phoenix en la piel del Joker. Incapaz de reprimir una risa que suena a alarido de dolor, tan delgado que las clavículas parecen a punto de rasgarle la piel, este Joker es un ser patético, peligroso, risible, bestial, tierno, frágil y conmovedor. Su existencia supone no solo la reinvención de uno de los personajes más famosos del mundo del cómic, sino también la posibilidad de que el cine de superhéroes deje de una vez por todas de ser siempre lo mismo. ¿Hace falta Joker? Esa es una pregunta distinta. Basada en el popular archienemigo de Batman, Joker, cuenta la historia de Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), un hombre ignorado por la sociedad y que solo busca hacer reír a los demás. Una serie de sucesos hará que empiece a ver el mundo de otra forma y la oscuridad llegue a su vida.

"Sep 30, 2019"," by Rosalie Kicks, Old Sport “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill person with a society that abandons them?” - JokerSo many damn Jokers.Picture it! Halloween, in the year 2008. Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight was released that summer to rave reviews. Go on and guess what the number one costume was... Go on guesssss. Ding ding ding, that’s right, JOKER! Everyone and the cat was a Joker that year. That Halloween, I had gone out to a goth club on the border of New Jersey and New York for my friend Mike’s birthday and we counted not one, not three… but thirteen self-identifying Jokers! I give these people credit though, they weren’t just all clowns. Some of them put effort into their costume - as you do on Halloween. There were Joker varieties: the classic purple suited Jokey, night nurse Jokejawn, bank robber Jokester and law enforcement Jokey. So many damn Jokers. With Todd Phillips’ latest flick, Joker we have yet another harlequin to throw on the stack. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, the story, this time, dives into the creation and back story of what would become the infamous Batman adversary. The focus being the role society plays in this creation by turning a blind eye to those in need. So, this movie won the Golden Lion at Venice. Butttt, who is this mystery man™ Todd Phillips? I seriously had no idea who the guy was, until I IMDbed him. Allegedly, he makes movies. A laundry list of flicks that I have most definitely heard of and never seen due to lack of interest in his genre of filmmaking: absolute steaming garbage. It is the style of cinema that I actively stay oblivious to. It does not exist to me. When I saw that there was not one, not two but THREE Hangover flicks, I remarked, “When the hell did this happen?” Initially I thought Mr. Phillips was just some new clown (ha!) that Hollywood was courting. Someone the suits could prop up, control the pointing of his finger and allow him to have the thrill of barking the word “action” every once in a while. When it comes to these superhero flicks, I often wonder how much is actually controlled by the director. Do they really have a vision for these things? The director title just seems like a formality. I don’t see these movies as art, they are more of just a cog in the corporate machine. I do not feel I am completely wrong with this theory, but also not totally right. I did not find the Joker to be deplorable as I was surprised that it actually did have things to say. However, Joker is not a masterpiece. In fact, I would say it is far from it. It’s more of a regurgitated film thing. A molotov cocktail consisting of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy set in a superhero world. Some have gone so far as calling this picture outrageous or unsettling. My question for these folks is: Have you watched movies before? “Imagine it - ME on the telly.” - Joker To be clear, I did not hate this movie or find it vile, but it is nothing extraordinary. It is surprising to me how much time is being invested in a film, that by next year we won’t even recall coming out. People need to get their priorities straight. There is more to life than a clown movie. Which brings me to the meaning of this film. The message in this two hour tale was clear to me: People don’t care about other people. Society, which is defined as: “the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community” (thanks google), is failing. Everyone is out for themselves, which is causing others to be left behind. Especially those that are battling mental illness. Arthur Fleck is one of those people, someone that others don’t give a shit about - a statement confirmed by his social worker. It is also further affirmed by his neglectful mother and absence of a father figure. After the social worker informs Arthur that funding is being cut for his treatment and care, it causes him to spiral down into an even deeper insanity… or does it? Without having access, he goes off his meds and later remarks something along the lines of not ever remembering to think so clearly before. The numerous medications weren’t just keeping him tame, but comatose. Despite Phillips’ questionable and unwatched filmography, I found myself onboard with his Joker flick. I felt it was making a comment on today’s America. The fact that we, not only actively ignore situations of others but, choose not to be concerned about them. We allow people to sleep on the streets, not have the medications they need or the healthcare they require. I don’t believe this movie is asking for sympathy for a violent character, instead I feel it is trying to disgust you. You are not supposed to be proud of the Joker’s actions. His behavior is the consequence of a society that has turned their back. This does not justify his rampage, instead it should serve as a warning. His descent into destructiveness is something that we all are culpable for. We have stopped holding those in power accountable, which has caused a situation that has hurt those that can’t help themselves. “I used to think my life was a tragedy - now I think it is a f*cking comedy.” -Joker Before I crawl in my coffin for the final rest, I am sure there will be twenty to thirty more jesters that come my way. So many damn Jokers. Joaquin’s Joker, although I don’t condone his actions, I understand how he got to this point. This was not a character asking for compassion, he was trying to get by and attempting to make it within a society that had no concern to help him. The saddest part about this movie is that Joaquin will be known for his portrayal as a clown instead of being remembered for his incredible portrayal in Lynne Ramsay’s movie. If I learned anything from the Joker it is: people love a spectacle, especially the media.",POSITIVE
"Sep 30, 2019","Phoenix's Joker fashions everything, all the pain and frustration, into a weapon, the tip of a spear that can rally others who are feeling the same.",POSITIVE
"Sep 30, 2019"," At the beginning of “Joker,” Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), seated in front of a mirror, hooks a finger into each corner of his mouth, and pulls. Up, then down: a grin, a grimace. We are meant to think of the masks, comic and tragic, that were worn by the actors in ancient Greek drama. Over the next couple of hours, those two moods will be welded together, until we can’t tell the light from the dark. Arthur is a clown, and a would-be comic, but he’s really not funny at all. So badly does he bomb at a comedy club that footage of his set is replayed on television. That’s the joke. He lives in Gotham City, which, as everybody knows, equals New York City minus the peace and the pastoral bliss. The year, by my reckoning, is 1981, since “Blow Out” and “Zorro: The Gay Blade” are advertised on cinema marquees. Other highlights include a garbage strike. Arthur works for a clown agency, and one of his jobs is to stand on the street in a red nose and a green wig, holding a promotional sign for a local store. When some kids grab the sign, he gives chase, his enormous shoes clomping on the sidewalk. Another clown lends him a gun, for safety’s sake, but it drops out of Arthur’s costume, clattering to the floor, while he’s entertaining children in a hospital ward and singing “If You’re Happy and You Know It.” A tough gig for Arthur, who says, “I haven’t been happy one minute of my entire fucking life.” And there you have it. “Joker” is a miserabilist manifesto. It’s directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote it with Scott Silver, and whose previous films, from “Road Trip” (2000) and “Old School” (2003) to the “Hangover” triptych, have delighted in the imperishable idiocy of the American male, and in his stubborn plans to dodge the draft of adulthood. Arthur Fleck, you might say, represents a nasty new twist on this theme. He still shares an apartment with his aging mother, Penny (Frances Conroy); their relationship is close but tense—he washes her hair while she takes a bath—and he must search for confidants elsewhere. As well as befriending, or imagining that he has befriended, a single mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives in his building, he meets with a social worker (Sharon Washington), appointed by the city, who monitors his medication. We learn from her that Arthur has been institutionalized in the past, and he carries a card that he shows to people when they flinch away from him. It reads “Forgive my laughter: I have a condition.” But what condition? Could it be pseudobulbar affect, which is neurological in origin and gives rise to uncontained laughing and crying? Under stress, Arthur certainly breaks into a hyena’s cackle, which stops as abruptly as it starts; he also weeps, and, in closeup, we follow the tracks of the tears on his clown’s white-painted face. (I haven’t seen such artful drips since 1971, when Dirk Bogarde’s hair dye melted, along with his soul, at the end of “Death in Venice.”) The film, however, takes no serious interest in what might be wrong with Arthur. It merely invites us to watch his wrongness grow out of control and swell into violence, and proposes a vague connection between that private swelling and a wider social malady. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” he asks. Guess what: it’s both! “Joker” is not plotted so much as crammed with mangy incidents. Like animals, they come in two by two. By a charming coincidence, for example, two major scenes take place in public toilets. There are also two extended subway sequences: one in which Arthur uses his gun for the first time, and another in which, pursued by police, he ducks in and out of the carriages, as if in homage to “The French Connection” (1971). Most important of all, we get two father figures. One is Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the host of a TV talk show, under whose wing Arthur dreams of finding shelter and approval. The other is Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a wealthy brute who is running for mayor of Gotham. (He has a young son named Bruce. Get it?) Thirty years ago, Penny Fleck worked for him, and Arthur hopes to exploit that distant link, though Wayne has nothing but scorn for the Flecks of this fragmented world. “Those of us who have made something of our lives will always look at those who haven’t,” he declares, “and see nothing but clowns.” Trailing clouds of controversy, “Joker” descends upon us. The online discussion has mounted from the rampant to the manic, undeterred, or perhaps exacerbated, by the fact that nobody, apart from critics and festivalgoers, has actually seen the movie. (Emotions run high when people are low on facts.) In one corner are those who crave a masterpiece: a film that will unearth a new psychic intensity in the domain of the comic book, ideal for our distended times. In the opposite corner are those who fear that Phillips and Phoenix may give license to all the lonely people out there—in particular, to any messed-up white guys who feel wretchedly uncherished and would welcome a tutorial in the art of lashing out. What is agreed upon, among those who have seen “Joker,” is the prowess with which Phoenix holds it all together. His face may get the greasepaint, but it’s his whole body, coiled upon itself like a spring of flesh, from which the movie’s energy is released. He’s so thin that, when he strips to the waist and bends, his spine and shoulder blades jut out from the skin; is he a fallen angel, with his wings chopped off, or a skeleton-in-waiting, halfway to the grave? Francis Bacon, I think, would have stared at Arthur with a hungry eye. The trouble is that Phillips, too, is in thrall to his hero, unable to avert his gaze, or his camera, from the lurid spectacle. The same was true, you could argue, of earlier Jokers—Jack Nicholson, in “Batman” (1989), or Heath Ledger, in “The Dark Knight” (2008), whose features cracked in tandem with his mind. But those were supporting roles, whereas Arthur is the main attraction. No longer is he forced to be part of the scenery; he is the scenery, and such is the strenuous effort of Phoenix’s performance that it becomes exhausting to behold. Get a load of me, he seems to say, and the load is almost too much to bear. Now and then, other actors, less worked up, pass across the stage: Bill Camp as a detective, for example, or Brian Tyree Henry as a hospital clerk, both wonderfully weary, like visitors from Planet Normal. I must admit, they come as a relief. Here’s the deal. “Joker” is not a great leap forward, or a deep dive into our collective unconscious, let alone a work of art. It’s a product. All the pre-launch rumblings, the rants and the raves, testify to a cunning provocation, and, if we yield to it, we’re not joining a debate; we’re offering our services, unpaid, to the marketing department at Warner Bros. When Dalí and Buñuel made “L’Âge d’Or” (1930), they wanted to start a riot, and they succeeded, but “Joker” yearns for little more than a hundred op-ed pieces and a firestorm of tweets. With ticket sales, naturally, to match. The evidence for this daring scheme is everywhere you look, in Phillips’s film, and everywhere you listen. Nicholson’s Joker may have danced and pranced to the sound of Prince’s “Partyman,” but Phoenix gyrates, on a steep flight of steps, to “Rock ’n’ Roll Part 2,” a 1972 hit by Gary Glitter. It used to be popular with sports teams, rousing the crowds at N.F.L. and N.H.L. games, before Glitter was convicted, in 1999, of possessing child pornography, and, seven years later, of sexually abusing minors, in Vietnam. Since then, understandably, the song has tumbled out of favor. Do you believe that the decision to revive it, for “Joker,” is anything but a studied choice, nicely crafted to offend? Please. I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I’ve seen in the past decade, but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States. “Joker” has its own political poise. Lest it be accused of right-wing inflammation, allowance is made for issues more congenial to the left. Cuts to welfare, we are told, will soon block Arthur’s access to therapy and medication, and the movie’s plea for the downtrodden to be given their rightful say harks back to Frank Capra and Chaplin. In one bizarre scene, the nabobs of Gotham, in tuxedos and gowns, are even treated to a special screening of “Modern Times.” Why should Phillips nod to a film of 1936, if not to stake his claim as a legatee? No less brazen are the references to Scorsese, and to his probing of urban paranoia—in “Taxi Driver” (1976) and again in “The King of Comedy” (1982), where De Niro played a reckless proto-Arthur, fixated on a talk-show host.

"Sep 28, 2019"," A comic book character, the guy who directed The Hangover, and an Oscar-nominated weirdo walk into a bar. What is this, says the barman, some kind of joke? Wait, I told it wrong. Let me start over. What do you get when you cross The King of Comedy with the clown prince of crime? You get Joker, an R-rated superhero movie with no super and zero heroes that oozes out of DC comics, but leaves almost everything on the page. Director Todd Phillips -- the man behind comedies Starsky and Hutch, Old School and The Hangover movies -- reinvents the eternally popular 
  Batman
 baddie by plonking Joaquin Phoenix into the mean streets of a vintage Martin Scorsese flick. The result is an intense, troubling movie with pretensions to be a modern-day Taxi Driver, complete with incendiary leading performance.  The film has sparked divided reviews and a debate over its dark themes, causing the director to speak out and theaters to ban viewers from dressing up to see it. You can decide for yourself whether it merits this frenzied discussion as Joker is in theaters now. A retro Warner Bros. logo signals we're in the early 1980s. The people of Gotham City are swamped by a rising tide of garbage, literally and metaphorically. None more so than put-upon Arthur Fleck. He's just a gentle guy who likes to make people smile, whether he's taking a gun into a children's hospital or stalking his pretty neighbor. Arthur's lost in the margins among the graffiti and neon, trudging up endless steps and down mildewed corridors in a life of shadowed tenements, empty mailboxes and broken elevators.  As the mentally ill and socially ignored Arthur, Phoenix burns a hole in the screen. From the opening moment when he cracks his mouth into an unnerving fake smile, the three-time Oscar nominee commands your attention. Minutes into the film, he suddenly flicks his eyes to meet the camera, and it's shiver-inducing. You almost don't want him looking at you. Arthur is a clown by day and a stand-up comic by night, but nobody's laughing in this brutal metropolis. In some versions of the comic book character's origins, the man who would be Joker fell into chemicals that bleached his skin and hair and twisted his mouth into the distinctive rictus. There's nothing so comic-book-schlocky in this version. Here, the city is the inescapable vat in which Arthur flails. Indifference is the goop in which he drowns. Cynicism and cruelty are the acid burning him to the bone. Seriously, everyone in this movie is miserable. They're queuing up to beat Arthur up, but the second time he's set upon the ground-down clown fights back. In the stuttering light of a rattling subway, Arthur shoots three boorish bankers, and a transformation begins. The shooting inadvertently sparks a movement as the downtrodden people of Gotham rise up against the rich. It's not the reaction Arthur wanted, but it's a reaction -- and he'll take it. It's hugely unnerving the way Phoenix shifts moods so subtly, yet so completely. With each soul-crushing rejection his face imperceptibly darkens, his whole physical shape transforming with a roll of his shoulder. One of Arthur's many problems is a condition causing him to laugh at inappropriate times, and Phoenix gives his all to this anguished tic. He giggles through tears, guffaws in pain, hoots with great wracking sobs dredged from the depths of his contorted, hunched skeleton. His skin stretched taut across protruding bone, he seems to store up tension with every passing indignity, violence coiling inside Arthur as if he were Travis Bickle's less well-adjusted little brother. After the first burst of brutal violence, Arthur dances, the first glimpse of a new Arthur with renewed confidence. His movements are elegant, his emaciated frame now lithe, lissom, graceful. He watches himself in the mirror, just as we watch him on screen. Later on his journey to becoming Joker, he dances through the streets resplendent in a blood-colored suit. He's swaggering, confident, cool. You know you're going to see this Joker at Halloween this year, and at conventions for years to come. It's an instantly iconic look, distinct from the Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto and Heath Ledger versions that came before. The red and yellow outfit echoes the sickly walls of the Arkham mental hospital, just one of many stunning details in the slick production design. Sure, you've heard this one before, but even as a pastiche of far superior 1970s and 1980s New York films, Joker still looks amazing.  After the subway shooting, a witness sketch presents an image of Arthur as a be-fanged horror. When he sees it, Arthur bares his teeth to contort himself into looking more like the image. It's a feedback loop of misguided misidentification that spirals out of control as rioters don clown masks, spurring Arthur on yet again. Everybody sees what they want, their rage mirrored and multiplied. Some people just can't take a joke. Possibly the film makes its most effective point by depicting the media as unable to resist someone with a schtick. ""I don't believe in anything,"" Joker admits. ""I just thought it would be good for my act."" In these polarized times that's a phrase that could be uttered by any number of attention-hungry opportunists, from Reddit to the White House. Joker is certainly a film of our time -- and the secret of comedy is, after all, timing.  The question is whether Joker has anything to say about our times. In Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, the Joker was a malevolent agent of chaos desperate to prove people are terrible. But the film took a firm stance, showing the people of Gotham refusing to blow up each other. Nolan's film definitively condemned the Joker and his bleak worldview as charismatic but wrong. Philips' film, by contrast, doesn't seem to know what it's trying to prove. Yes, Arthur is disturbed and violent. But everybody else is cynical, mistrusting and cruel. A social worker barely notices Arthur. A mother snaps at him when he tries to cheer up her kid. Even the two fatherlike figures Arthur obsesses over, tycoon Thomas Wayne and chat show host Murray Franklin (played, fittingly, by Taxi Driver and King of Comedy star Robert De Niro), turn out to be smug and superior. The rich are terrible and the people are even worse -- a frothing rabble of rioters, looters and murderers who barely need an excuse to tip into savagery. Philips does an impressively unnerving job of building tension and menace toward the inevitable explosion, and there's a devastating rug-pulling twist. But the film wobbles over who's ultimately the butt of the joke, messing up the punchline when it comes to deciding whether Arthur is a pathetic loser or a righteous victim/hero. There's an element of ambiguity in the ending, but it feels less like a genuine artistic statement and more like one of several cringy attempts to be edgy, like a song by convicted pedophile Gary Glitter on the soundtrack. The movie soars free of capes and other superhero nonsense, but it's hard to see the point being made when there's no heroic Batman representing the other side of the scarred coin (to borrow a motif from a different bat-villain). Joker is intense and unnerving and a radical entry into the superhero genre, but come on, Taxi Driver was 40 years ago. Maybe that joke isn't funny anymore.",POSITIVE
"Sep 28, 2019"," Whilst the idea for DC to attempt to follow in Marvel’s footsteps by interconnecting their cinematic universe was an understandable one, the reality was a far more brutal notion to face in that ambition doesn’t always equate to success.  Sure, the monetary returns for their titles were enough to consider them viable products, but the shifted focus to more singular titles broken away from the expected Batman/Superman tent-poles opens the studio to more creative, bolder stories that, should they play their cards right, will strengthen their longevity as a studio dedicated to telling stories rather than selling an idea. An industrious project from writer/director Todd Phillips (The Hangover, War Dogs) that places focus on (arguably) the most popular comic book villain of all time, Joker disconnects itself from the broad DC Universe, presenting itself as a tragic tale that fuses politics, social commentary, and confronting violence together in an intricately woven manner. Clearly an homage to films of the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, Joker is a product shot with particular care, detailing the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix, absolutely mesmerising), a notably disturbed man who works as a clown-for-hire in-between tending to his ailing mother (a tender, though damaged Frances Conroy).  A social outcast who has a mental condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable fits of laughter, he’s a confused, delusional man who’s very clearly on the edge of unravelling towards the prolific villain we expect him to embody. An origin story rooted in comic book history yet removed from any one particular take on the character’s antiquity, Joker (which very well could be renamed Arthur should aspects of the character’s lore be exorcised) addresses Gotham City and several key aspects of that created world (Brett Cullen’s Thomas Wayne paints a different portrait of the character we assume to know) but never feels linked to the superhero mentality.  More so, Joker is a think-piece feature film, one that will inspire discussions and debates long after the credits have rolled; theories on how the film will weaponise the politics of inspired violence have already begun. Regardless of where you will personally sit in reaction to its material, the fact it’s inspiring conversation is an achievement in itself, and what Phillips and particularly Phoenix have created is nothing less than admirable.  The actor has always immersed himself wholeheartedly into his roles, and Arthur is no exception.  Perhaps most captivating is how he has created this Joker without drawing comparisons to those that have portrayed the character previously.  Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as the Jester of Genocide in The Dark Knight (2008) is arguably the benchmark of creativity in portraying the character’s instability, but even with the late actor’s history-instilled turn, Phoenix’s embodiment is another transformative beast entirely.  In the same way that Jack Nicholson’s theatrical take in Batman (1989) was separate from Jared Leto’s divisive gangster routine in Suicide Squad (2016), Phoenix is incomparable in the tormented procedure that he has devoted to fully realising Arthur Fleck. As much as this is Phoenix’s film though, Joker‘s supporting cast is well stacked, with each role, however small they may be, contributing to Arthur’s ultimate being in a certain fashion.  Next to Cullen’s rather cold and unflinching Thomas Wayne and Conroy’s heartbreaking Penny Fleck, Zazie Beetz and Robert DeNiro portray the two most significant figures in his life, the former a single mother who provides a small beacon of light in Arthur’s dark existence, and the latter a popular talk-show host whose pivotal scene comes towards the film’s climax and serves as the catalyst for Joker’s eventual violent uprising; to say there exchange is tense would be stating it lightly. A film I expect will be either adored or reviled by audiences, Joker‘s slow-burn approach to its narrative, sporadic outbursts of graphic violence, and sociopolitical takeaways will ultimately both work for and against it as an overall product.  After decades of the genre fawning over the super-heroic aspects of its characters, Joker is a welcome reprieve nonetheless, one that should (hopefully) pave the way for future endeavours to harness risk and maintain a sense of diversity within a genre that often relies on the tropes we’ve come to expect.",POSITIVE

"Sep 27, 2019","  Edgy. That’s perhaps the best word to sum up Todd Phillips’ Joker – a DC Comics spin-off that serves as a solo origin story for Batman’s most enduring nemesis. And we’re not just talking about the film’s controversial new angle on a well-worn villain, nor the fervent online debate it has provoked since its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where it picked up the coveted Golden Lion award. No, we’re talking about the film itself. The remarkable thing about Joker is just how on edge it makes you feel, thanks to a palpable sense of unease that’s sustained throughout its relatively lean two-hour running time. From the moment the film begins, with a ‘70s-style Warner Bros logo giving way to an extreme close-up shot of a tormented clown forcing a smile with a single tear running down his cheek, it’s clear that this is not your typical comic-book movie. (We’re deliberately not using the other oft-used term for the genre; there are no heroes here.) That clown is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a “mentally ill loner” who lives in a crummy apartment with his ailing mother and works as a jobbing jester, plagued by a neurological condition that causes painful, uncontrollable fits of laughter. He ekes out an existence in a Gotham City that’s suffocating under piling-up mountains of trash and overrun by “super rats”, in which a rising wealth gap has stoked anger and resentment – leaving law and order teetering on a knife edge. Kicked while he’s down again and again, be it literally by a gang of street thugs calling him “freak”, or figuratively – thanks to a failing health system that deprives him of his meds, and a series of events that sees him losing his day job – Arthur’s only escape is his fantasy of becoming a stand-up comedian, inspired by his late-night television idol Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But it’s not just tensions between rich and poor that are reaching boiling point – the demons within Arthur are threatening to spill over, too. “Everyone is awful these days,” he says. “It’s enough to make anyone crazy.” So when Arthur finally snaps, his growing disdain compounded by a loaded gun, the two worlds collide violently – kicking off a movement that enables Arthur to be reborn as the future Clown Prince of Crime. As one of his onscreen predecessors once so memorably put it, all it takes is a little push. Like we said, this isn’t your typical comic-book movie; in fact, it’s unlike anything the genre has produced before. Joker is a gritty character study of a dangerously damaged man, more in the vein of early Martin Scorsese movies – as has been widely discussed already, it contains particular shades of 1976’s Taxi Driver and 1982’s The King Of Comedy. It’s bleak, tightly wound, and permeated by jolting bursts of shocking brutality. And at the centre of it all is an extraordinary, transformative turn from Phoenix. At first eliciting pity and, by the film’s second act, repulsion, his tortured, twisted performance provides Phillips’ fable with a terrifyingly unpredictable linchpin. Not only is it a career highlight for Phoenix, but it more than holds up against Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledgers’ iconic Jokers past. The world-building is great, too. This Gotham isn’t the gothic cityscape of Tim Burton’s Batman movies or the modern metropolis of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Trilogy, but a new version inspired by Scorsese’s old stomping ground – the mean streets of ‘70s/‘80s New York (while a date isn’t explicitly mentioned, Joker certainly emulates that time period). It’s a carefully crafted shithole: a lived-in world that feels dirty and oppressive; old-school and yet, despite the lack of smartphones and LED screens, surprisingly relevant. It’s different, yes, but not that different: Gotham has often been depicted as a dump – one that, in Bruce Wayne’s eyes, has always been one worth saving. But this is not Batman’s worldview, and the film’s design reflects that. In fact, while Joker is undoubtedly a standalone project, it doesn’t totally shy away from its comic-book origins or the wider Batman mythos. Phoenix’s villain might not be the Joker we know, but he grows to embody his essence, especially as his character moves ever-closer towards discarding Fleck and embracing the green-haired menace. One brilliant, claustrophobic scene set inside a subway carriage full of angry protestors sees him become the masterful orchestrator of chaos that we’re all familiar with; likewise, his constant assertions that he’s not politically motivated hint at the anarchy that’s to come. It’s here that things get a bit iffy, though. Given the fact that this film is going to invite difficult conversations, it’s not massively clear what, if anything, it’s trying to say. The main problem is Phillips’ reverence of his filmmaking hero, which proves to be a double-edged sword. Joker wears its cinematic influences on its sleeve, perhaps a little too much – from the grubby urban setting to the scenes of a topless, spindly framed Phoenix acting out his delusions in front of his telly, Joker isn’t so much inspired by Scorsese as actively aping him. This might make it a comic-book movie like no other, but the film ultimately lacks the strong, auteur-style voice of Marty’s classics. Aesthetics (and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s mournful score) aside, the movie as a whole doesn’t quite match up to the brilliance of Phoenix’s powerhouse – and likely awards-grabbing – performance. Still, it’s not far off: thrilling and unsettling in equal measure, Joker is a film that thrives on the edge – and that’s what makes it so compelling.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2019"," Repeatedly ridiculed and failed by society, his sadness leads to anger, crime and civil unrest, and he achieves a degree of celebrity which brings meaning to his life. A dirty, rotten and violent reflection of his increasingly tortured psyche, Gotham City is in desperate need of hope, but young Bruce Wayne has yet to create the Batman suit, and his arrogant father is very much alive and running for mayor. Phoenix has always been a gloriously intense and uncompromising performer and here he achieves greatness with a mesmerising turn as Joker, which drags you kicking and screaming inside the worldview of a man as he goes violently insane. A certainty to be up for the major awards, Phoenix makes Heath Ledger’s Oscar winning turn as Joker seems as mad and threatening as Cesar Romero’s pantomime version from the 1960’s Batman TV series. Classic films such as The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver are major influences with the star of those films, Robert DeNiro appearing here as a talk show host and is clearly in the joke. Never afraid of offending his audience, director and writer Todd Phillips is best known for his bad taste Hangover films, and was Oscar-nominated for the screenplay for Sacha Baron Cohen's 2006 provocative satirical comedy film, Borat. Phillips and Phoenix sat next to each other after my screening and were clearly enjoying each other's company as they discussed the movie, with Phillips described his film as a ‘deep dive character study’, and Phoenix called it ‘fresh, exciting and terrifying’.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2019","There are films that push you to the limit, have you on the edge, and then there's Joker, starring the brilliance of Joaquin Phoenix.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2019"," So right off the top, let’s just state two easy and obvious things we can say about it: It’s a very good movie, and it features a blood-curdling performance from Joaquin Phoenix in the most frightening portrayal of a violent maniac in decades. Though set in a Gotham City (home of Batman) that is meant to suggest New York at the height of 1970s sleaze, the issues the movie touches on are very much of the present day. It takes place in a nightmare world in which billionaires control everything and the rest of the population, forced to live on scraps, is getting angrier and angrier. That’s the first thing that makes “Joker” hard to talk about. Its vision of America is an easy reach, not really true, and as such, could be called irresponsible. Yet “responsible” and “irresponsible” are value judgments that usually have little place in assessing movies or art in general. In any case, true or not, “Joker” could be said to present an accurate depiction of our era’s collective terror — the fear of bad guys taking over, the fear of civic chaos. On that basis, “Joker” may have value just because it knows where our buttons are. It presses them and expresses them. But let’s go beyond that to the other modern-day fear that the movie doesn’t quite depict but hints at and exploits: the fear of the lone nut who snaps and becomes a mass murderer. The filmmakers can talk all they want about how “Joker” is not in favor of the Joker. It doesn’t endorse his activities. It doesn’t say that the Joker is right or a nice guy. So what? Who cares? The very structure of their movie is that of a rags-to-riches tale in which an abused and scorned mentally ill man achieves his apotheosis through violence. He is sad when he’s just a plain man. But he’s happy when he becomes the Joker and starts killing people. Moreover, he has reached that state of nirvana, which, in our culture, is better than love, wealth or spiritual salvation: He has become famous. This glorification of such a figure — a figure already used in at least one real-life mass murder — marks “Joker” as one of the most deeply cynical films ever made, probably the most cynical of the 21st century. At the same time, it would have no impact at all if it weren’t effective, and it was effective enough to win the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, last month. Directed by Todd Phillips, it stars a very skinny Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, who lives with his mother and has been in and out of mental institutions for most of his life. He is not a fun-house nutjob, like Michael Myers or Leatherface, but a man in torment, suffering from delusions and hallucinations, unable to fit in or feel comfortable. Every month his assigned social worker asks if he’s having negative thoughts. “All I have are negative thoughts,” he says. His choice is either to keep trying to join a world that isn’t welcoming him or to embrace his own bizarre mental landscape as revealed truth and act accordingly. That dive into darkness is the siren that calls to him at every waking moment. What’s terrifying and brilliant about Phoenix’s Joker is that he seems to be operating from an intricate yet alien form of logic. There is very little common ground between the character and the viewer, no shared understanding of right and wrong, real or unreal. He erupts into laughter without warning — a terrifying, piercing laugh that he can’t control. He sits in the audience at a comedy club, joyously and maniacally laughing at setups, not punch lines. Like Rupert Pupkin in Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy,” Arthur wants to be a comedian, and he’d particularly like to perform on a late-night talk show. Robert De Niro, who played Pupkin in the 1983 Scorsese film, portrays the talk show host here, and it’s a strange performance in that he acts nothing like an actual late-night personality. He’s more like a dream of a talk show host, or Arthur’s skewed perception of one, or like an exaggeration by director Todd Phillips designed to bring the character into line with the movie’s strange tilt. In any case, De Niro plays him as thuggish, too coarse for any network operating outside Gotham City. “Joker” is not without dull spots for the simple reason that with a movie like this, it’s hard to find a second act. You haven’t seen the movie, but you know how it ends — of course you do. And I already told you how it starts. The middle is just some space that needs to be filled in, which the movie does competently, sometimes eerily, but not so masterfully that there are no doldrums.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2019","We are not given a genre-bending Joker film that taps into the fascinating anarchistic chaos and oddly enticing charisma of the character, we are instead given a sub-par remake of 'Taxi Driver' with the DC logo attached to it.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 27, 2019",...delivers one of the more haunting and unique comic book movie experiences in years.,POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2019","It is Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker that really makes the film. Phoenix is weirdly brilliant from beginning to end, giving a performance which is by turns heartbreaking and frightening.",POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2019"," The City is polarising in class and wealth and Fleck cannot find anyone to help him. The social system has collapsed - his medication halts and his ailing mother merely fans the flames. As resentment among the citizens builds by the day, a chain of tragic and violent events unfurl and Arthur’s descent towards his alter-ego, is inevitable - offering people their martyr and champion. Joaquin Phoenix’s take on the clown is like nothing you’ve seen before - where other’s have hinted at darkness behind the mask, he plays it like a possessed Marcel Marceau - you simply cannot take your eyes off him - it is a flawless, physical, terrifying performance. It is terrifyingly bloody and uncomfortably real - but rather than worry whether this will encourage copycat Jokers (a ridiculous notion) we should worry more that we already live in this supposed fictional environment that could create him at the drop of a hat.",POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins. Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen. Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, becomes the homicidal clown we're familiar with, and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far. The balancing act is truly engaging. Phoenix gives the performance of the year here, but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film. This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore, it is completely its own beast, and that is precisely why it works so well; there is no format, there is no convention and there are no rules. You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll, but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow. © RTÉ 2024.

"Sep 26, 2019","But for all the technical prowess on display and Phoenix's wonderful performance, Joker can't help feeling a bit shallow in other departments.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 26, 2019"," Nothing is glorified or brushed upon, Joker is a fictional tale seen through a realistic lens. A fantastically twisted origin story that completely differentiates itself from all past iterations, it is truly a unique take on the character. Todd Phillips’ approach is to take the basis for the Joker, a comic book character and place him in a Joaquin Phoenix film. It’s not a comic book film with Joaquin Phoenix, but the other way. Joker, Phillips’ film – a breathtakingly dark character study – is incredible. With a wealth of fascinating inspiration, Joker redoubtably transports you to the late 70’s, well specifically as Phillips has said, the summer of 1979. There is a clear spotlight on underbelly of stardom, what is created is a film of clear influence by Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, The Man Who Laughed and The King of Comedy, Joker is able to expand on the excellence of Ledger, Nicholson and Ramero’s versions and create something so strangely different. Stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with his mother (Frances Conroy), he has been disregarded by society, he works a job in which he entertains as a clown. Arthur begins a slow dissent into madness as he transforms into the Joker. This disregard begins with hurt, suffering and laughter, Fleck is looked down upon by all who encounter him. We are invited to love a ‘monster’, but in way that keeps your judgement of morality ambiguous. It’s bold, fresh and utterly beautiful, in its presentation and storytelling. Joaquin Phoenix will be laughing his way to Awards season, Phoenix delivers one of the finest performances of the decade. He is fully absorbed into Joker’s twisted journey, whilst it’s twisted, it’s also gracious in the building to his descent and/or rise. Almost wonderfully, there is a sense of chills to be felt from scene to scene, spectating a beautifully crafted, impeccable film full of colour and life. Todd Phillips’ direction paired with Lawrence Sher’s cinematography is something to marvel at, Joker may possibly be one of the best looking films in a long time. Sher’s frequent use of pulling the focus into a low depth of field allows for a sense of confinement, nicely contrasting to the wide shots showing the glorious chaos by the end. It feels like it was made in the 70’s, it evokes the decaying city streets of Mean Streets and Taxi Driver with Mark Friedberg’s production design. Like a Scorsese picture, Phillips’ Joker has an incredible soundtrack and score. The bustling music of the 70’s and backwards neatly parallel to the symphonic score by Hildur Guðnadóttir. Jimmy Durante’s ‘Smile’ and Frank Sinatra’s ‘Send in the Clowns’ populate some of the best scenes. Additionally, the musical aspect adds to that peculiar beauty seen in Phoenix’s constant breaks into dance, it’s a character study shown through dance, allowing for it to act as a sign for his growing confidence. This focus on movement and song is ingrained into Joker and the inner music within-side his head, linking incredibly neatly to the ending. Backing Phoenix is the ever-phenomenal Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host. De Niro is a wonderful presence, his interactions with Phoenix are class examples of why De Niro is the best actor of all time and Phoenix, one of the best of his generation. There is one brilliant scene towards the end of the film, that may just be one of the best this year – it includes both actors. Another element going for Joker is its ‘R-rating’, well, 15 rating in the UK. It allows the film breathing space to naturally evoke the realist lens it puts over the fictional story Arthur goes on, with moments of shocking violence being a major plus. The violence is sharp, bold and abrupt, creating a further sense of unease, mainly due to the instability of Arthur. I oblige you to soak in the darkness, violence and R-rated nature of the film, it’s abruptly and harmoniously portrayed in the most perfect way. Joker is a brazenly breathtaking film with Joaquin Phoenix delivering an out-of-this-world performance as the clown prince of crime and Todd Phillips soars with his utterly beautiful direction. It will disturb, contort and make you laugh, it finds the perfect fine line between tragedy and comedy. This is a DC film not to miss. Phillips has made a Joaquin Phoenix film, not a comic book film.",POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2019"," 
Todd Phillips's Joker is a joyless film with the wit and emotional intelligence of a school shooter manifesto. Don’t confuse this with moralistic hand-wringing about the possibility of the film stoking actual violence: as one of my colleagues pointed out, its greatest threat is inevitably inspiring shitty Halloween costumes. A committed performance by Joaquin Phoenix, whose disciplined, graceful embodiment of the role transcends the vapid script, and fine production values across the board redeem it somewhat. But with a fundamentally flawed concept, juvenile worldview, and lines that feel ripped from Hot Topic t-shirt slogans (“i just hope my death makes more cents [sic] than my life,” the frustrated clown scribbles in his journal), Joker is a rag-huffing, Code Red Mountain Dew-chugging, NoFapping hot mess of bad ideas.
 
Meanwhile, Fleck kills a group of Wall Street jerks harassing a woman on the subway, which inspires a populist uprising that encircles the wealthy Thomas Wayne, running for office on a platform of dismantling the social safety net. This policy hits Arthur when funding for his therapy is cut. “They don’t give a shit about people like you,” Arthur’s therapist, a black woman, tells him, “And they really don’t give a shit about people like me.” Along with a half-hearted acknowledgment of the way mental illness is stigmatized — while also suggesting within the larger context that that the mentally ill, left unattended by society, are latent supervillains — the dialog is a characteristically vague nod to racial and gender descrimination merely for the sake of blinkering significance. At the same time, the anti-Wayne protesters are uniformly portrayed as criminal delinquents — “KILL THE RICH: A NEW MOVEMENT?” one of the film’s newspaper headlines reads — naively projecting their agenda onto a truly anarchic, nihilistic, equal-opportunity hater.
 
On some level, the basic idea of portraying the Joker as a blackpilled loser is sort of funny. I'm reminded of artist Takeshi Murata's 2010 3D animated video ""I, Popeye,"" in which the classic character is recast as an aging hipster who becomes despondent after losing his house and his job at the dispeptic spinach factory. He visits the graves of his late wife and child, Olive Oyl and Swee’Pea, and spends a moment of compassionate reflection at the hospital bedside of his comatose adversary, Bluto. Murata’s Popeye has nothing to live for, no one to share his life with, and nothing to even fight against. In a moment of ecstatic, existential violence, Popeye destroys his apartment before hanging himself, only to be reborn in a glitched-out digital psychedelic world where he speeds off on a Mario Kart 64-styled path toward nirvana. In six minutes, the fundamentally ironic video manages to stir genuine pathos while functioning as a subversive commentary on how corporate culture and protracted copyright terms strangle the life and imagination out of popular characters.
 
As a misguided, conglomerate-sanctioned attempt at allowing a filmmaker to reimagine its signature villain, Joker lacks the multitudes of Murata's project, to say nothing of the nuance that Alan Moore brought to his own tragic, psychological portrayal of the character in 1988’s essential one-shot The Killing Joke. Instead, it’s an overly obvious, watered-down, ersatz mashup of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy with cringey rallying-cry dialog such as “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society who abandons him and treats him like trash?” Its only inspired touch is soundtracking Fleck's full-makeup Joker coming out to disgraced arena rock anthem “Rock and Roll Part 2” by Gary Glitter, a well-known convicted child rapist. The association, which I will assume in good faith is intentional, is appropriately gross.
 
After all, Phillips is no stranger to transgression. He spent his student years filming GG Allin, clerked at Kim’s Video, established the New York Underground Film Festival, and directed the notoriously unaired HBO documentary Frat House. Even as he ostensibly settled into the role of a studio filmmaker, he managed to direct some of the most legitimately hilarious, era-defining comedies of the aughts. Alas, Joker is neither edgy, funny, nor threatening — a deflated whoopee cushion. In the words of my friend who dressed as Austin Powers in Dark Knight Joker makeup one cursed Halloween: Why so serious, baby?
 
Joker was reviewed at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival and also plays at the New York Film Festival October 2. It opens nationwide October 4.

"Sep 23, 2019","Edgy and darkly disturbing, Joker takes flight on the wings of a sensational performance by Joaquin Phoenix.",POSITIVE
"Sep 23, 2019","  Is he laughing or crying? It’s a thought sure to race through many heads in Joker when Arthur Fleck begins a weekly therapy session. Stretching tightly wound flesh across overextended muscles, Joaquin Phoenix has tailored his body into something cadaverous by becoming Fleck. Here is a man more living than dead, comprised of skeletal edges and lines that accentuate the yellow rot of his teeth and the emptiness of his grinning stare. In this moment, as Arthur howls laughter, it’s unclear if the guttural sound is a natural spasm or if this is just another moment in a string of endless miseries. And to be honest, it doesn’t really matter to either the movie or the audience. Neither comedy or tragedy, Joker is an invitation to bear witness to a searing transformation by Phoenix. Whether your first instinct is to revel in the performance or be repulsed by it is of no apparent consequence to writer-director Todd Phillips. No matter what you do, you’re compelled to respond. There is something faintly dishonest about trying to have it both ways, but there is also something admirable. As many a comedian might tell you, it’s all about leaving an impression, and Joker’s has been haunting me for days. Set in a version of Gotham City far removed from the existence of Batman and the shared universe of DCEU movies, Joker opens on urban sprawl that looks suspiciously like New York City at the height of its late ‘70s and early ‘80s decay. As a radio newscast reports, a garbage strike continues to drag on and the city is now worried about “super rats.” But Arthur Fleck is just concerned with how to make ends meet in his crummy job as a clown-for-hire and children’s entertainer. Already having endured some vague history of mental illness, Arthur trudges between gigs, therapy, and a decrepit apartment located atop a concrete staircase so steep it’d make Father Merrin weep. It’s there he still lives with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy), a deceptively caring woman who is a little too eager for her son’s company, be it in the bathroom or by her bedside. But it is sitting next to his mother that Arthur finds his solitary joy in life: watching late night TV comedian Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro by way of Johnny Carson). Arthur’s one dream is to become a stand-up comedian just like Murray. The problem is Arthur isn’t very funny, nor does he find much to smile about, even while attempting a romance with the single mother down the hall (Zazie Beetz). But that all changes the day he reaches his limit and three Wall Street bros pick a fight with him on the subway. Arthur not only hits back; he discovers a killer punchline that the whole city mistakes for a political message. And maybe it is. The violence in Joker is not frequent, but when it occurs it is vivid—sometimes to the point of excess. A subject devoid of basic moral foundations, the movie’s protagonist is like the wallflower who slowly discovers his groove the more coldblooded his murders become. Arthur is the guy who finds comfort by staring into the void, and there will be much hand-wringing about this film being released in an era where lone wolf mass murderers are a depressingly common feature of American life. However, it would be naïve to suggest a movie’s subject matter is instantly out-of-bounds or somehow an endorsement. In fact, one of the more appealingly chilling aspects of Joker is that in an era where big budget studio fare has often been reduced to focus group-tested good and evil, heroes and villains, something as bleakly nihilistic as this film could even exist. It obviously has more in common with its Martin Scorsese influences from the era of its setting, especially Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1982), than it does anything traditionally involving capes. Not only is Batman absent—replaced here by a Trumpian version of Bruce’s father, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen)—but so is any attempt to coddle the audience with reassuring platitudes. Joker is a character study about a man shredding an integrity that was only ever feigned, and when it is simply focused on this marginalized sad sack turning that frown upside down, it is eerily hypnotic. After losing more than 50 pounds to become the Joker, Phoenix casts a spindly, almost grotesque profile. He also has liberated himself from general expectations about his usually taciturn persona and the cinematic baggage associated with a character who has already inspired two indelible performances from the likes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Phoenix is unlike either, essaying a monster who is too introverted to be a fearless showman. He’s a coward, even after he begins donning pancake makeup as a fashion statement instead of a professional necessity. Still, the closer he gets to that big day, the more confident he becomes in his creepy delusions until he’s finally prancing down those concrete steps in the iconic purple suit like a homicidal Eliza Doolittle about to go to the ball. It’s that lone moment where the movie comes close to finding humor in its wannabe comedian. When just focused on that psychological profile, Joker is electrifying, but the filmmaking around the performance comes up wanting by comparison. Known strictly for his mean-spirited (and similarly nihilistic) Hangover movies, Phillips eschews any sort of humor here while reaching for the most despairing, cynical sensibility every time. This is effective to a point, causing this reviewer to want a shower afterward, but it lacks the point-of-view or pointed commentary of the Scorsese movies it emulates. One of Arthur’s murders is particularly over-the-top, while his grand manifesto in the movie’s finale both interrogates his narcissistic entitlement and half-heartedly attempts to justify it. Joker wants to have it both ways, which makes it not nearly as transgressive as its idols. But on a certain level, Phillips appears aware of this, addressing his future critics with a denouement that admits an ultimate ambivalence about his own movie’s inherent nastiness. Given the picture operates on the trajectory of a tragedy with a predestined end, the refusal for true self-analysis holds it back from the greatness it so convincingly flirts with. But its open perversity should not be seen as something threatening, particularly when it’s this engrossing. David Crow is the Film Section Editor at Den of Geek.

"Sep 20, 2019"," Piles of garbage lay in alleyways, a couple generations of crowded graffiti proudly shout from concrete walls and no present-day corporate pleasantries – like Time Square, with its welcoming, Las Vegas-like showmanship – can be found anywhere.  Director Todd Phillips’ camera points at a movie theatre with Brian De Palma’s “Blow Out” appearing on the marquee, so the year – presumably - is 1981.  The air is cold, moods are sour, work is scarce, money is tight, and crime is rampant.  Walking anywhere on your own, even in the middle of the afternoon, might invite a mugging, and police and ambulance sirens act as constant white noise for a populous without much reason to celebrate…anything.  “You don’t listen, do you?  You just ask the same questions every week.  How’s your job?  Are you having any negative thoughts?  All I have are negative thoughts,” he says. One obvious nod to 80s cinema does not have a superhero origin at all, as Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin, a Johnny Carlson-like television host who Arthur idolizes.  Franklin feels similar to TV talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) from Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy”, and in that movie, De Niro plays a struggling but ambitious comedian named Rupert Pupkin, a guy desperately striving for fame.  Arthur, who is always trying to make people laugh, in some ways is Pupkin, and note that “The King of Comedy” was released in 1982.  Probably not a coincidence.  In 2019, one might say that it’s getting crazier out here at the moment, because who would have thought after Heath Ledger’s Oscar winning performance in “The Dark Knight” (2008), another actor would come along and possibly earn Academy Award gold playing the same character?  Well, after watching “Joker”, another actor will have to give a superhero-like effort to wrestle the 2020 Best Actor Oscar away from Phoenix.

"Sep 20, 2019"," Joker centres around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone story not seen before on the big screen. The exploration of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man disregarded by society, is not only a gritty character study but also a broader cautionary tale. If there is one villain in comic books that absolutely everyone knows, it is The Joker. Now the supervillain is headlining his own film from Todd Phillips with Joaquin Phoenix starring as the famous clown in Joker, an intriguing and disturbing look in this standalone DC film at this alternate take on Joker’s origins. What Phillips succeeds with is a very captivating and visually stylistic film as Phoenix delivers a memorable performance, even if the story follows a pretty simplistic road. Phoenix is outstanding in the role of Arthur Fleck. Joker simply does not work without him as he puts everything into this role, displaying Arthur’s downward mental spiral in disturbingly clear way. From the start of the film to its conclusion, Arthur goes through a true transformation with Phoenix portraying the changes within Arthur believably. Through his laugh, posture and speech, Phoenix takes the villainous role and makes it his own. And a villain he is too, because despite some sympathetic tones to Arthur, it is clear from the beginning he is not meant to be a truly sympathetic or idolized figure, a fact Phoenix takes and runs with to create an unsettling portrait of how someone like Joker could have been made. While Phoenix is great in the central role, the supporting cast unfortunately doesn’t have too much to do. Zazie Beetz is criminally underused as Arthur’s neighbour and love interest Sophie to the point where there is not much, if at all, emotional investment in their relationship. Frances Conroy has nice chemistry with Phoenix as Arthur’s ill mother and gets a few moments to stretch her abilities, but also doesn’t get much to do beyond acting sick. Of the supporting cast, Robert De Niro shines the most as night show host Murray Franklin, showcasing both his charisma and seriousness at different points in the story. Unfortunately, the story is where the film doesn’t quite hold its own weight. It’s a fairly generic tale and origin story with several of the film’s big twists or moments being predictable. There’s not much in the story to really surprise viewers, one of the reasons some of the emotional investment in Arthur’s relationships don’t feel completely earned. It does, however, have some interesting themes and does well with its examination of them, especially since there is no Batman anywhere in sight. The film posits that Joker is as much a creation of society instead of a winged creature of the night and Phillips’ grounding of the film in reality works pretty well, even if it is a bit too on the nose at times. Joker’s visuals, however, are spectacular. It is one of the best looking films of the year with how it captures its characters, showcases its colours and environment. Phoenix’s performance is so creepy thanks to the ways he’s shot, lit or other various imagery in the film. The cinematography captivates you in a way the story does not by keeping it visually interesting throughout its runtime. Though the violence is sparse it is gritty and doesn’t shy away from its brutality, even as Arthur revels in the carnage of his violence. The visuals are so strong that it helps make up for some of the film’s other shortcomings. Phillips directs a pretty entertaining film that is commanded by Phoenix’s performance. His commitment to the role is Joker‘s most compelling aspect and he makes it his own through his physicality and delivery. Though he, the visuals and themes strengthen the film, the story’s genericness and usage of its supporting cast doesn’t make it succeed quite as much as it hopes. Fans and mainstream audiences should still walk away happy with the film, particularly with Phoenix’s magnetism, but it doesn’t really add anything new to the character of The Joker.",POSITIVE
"Sep 20, 2019"," There’s a laughable irony in how Todd Phillips’ Joker had many eyes (and controversy) surrounding it before it’s been released, considering its main character has a history of attention-seeking.  While sitting with his therapist, Arthur covertly praises himself over the murders he committed. “For my whole life, I thought I didn’t exist. But I do. And now they’re starting to notice,” he says with slight wonder. In that aspect, the film doesn’t disappoint; leaning into spectacles fitting for the clown prince of crime. But beyond the spectacle is a story that just isn’t as audacious as it thinks it is. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man weighed down by the circumstances in his life: taking care of his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), working as a clown while trying to jumpstart his comedy career, and being bullied. He feels voiceless in the city of Gotham while those around him flourish. After a coworker gives him a gun with the advice to protect himself, Arthur feels empowered to take his destiny in his own hands – no matter how bloody they become. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher further enhances Phoenix’s physical performance. Some of the more standout scenes is Arthur’s dancing; which typically happens pre-or-post a kill he’s going to commit. After his first kill, he dances – in celebration – in the bathroom, he’s hiding out in. Sher intensely focuses the camera on the expressiveness of Arthur: how he gracefully glides on the tile, how his neck leans back, the awkward movement of his arms. This is to show the gradual transformation of Arthur into Joker and how his body moves into it. It’s the extreme body shots throughout the film that reinforces Arthur’s decline into madness. The cinematography and Phoenix’s acting functions, in a way, like clown paint: it’s all swirling colors and exaggerated shapes working to make the performer something special. But wash the paint off and what are you left with?  In Joker’s case, you have a story that fulfills the same “white man exacts revenge” trope as ones before it. This unofficial genre is nothing new: we’ve seen it in 1976’s Taxi Driver, 1983’s The King of Comedy (which Joker is clearly inspired by) and countless others.  The story beat is the same: white man is downtrodden. White man blames a person/group/society for his situation. Embittered, white man takes violent action. White man is a hero. As the director, Phillips has been insistent on how the goal was to do “…something entirely different from the comic book movies that have come before.” He’s even pitched a DC Black vertical to Warner Brothers: a darker, more grittier space for “independent-minded films about these characters.” There’s been so much investment in the film not becoming another comic book movie. So it’s hilarious that while Joker succeeded in avoiding the comic book trope, it dived fully into other tropes – losing the originality it was craving. In this world that Joker created, Arthur is a symbol of revolution and change. You can see the parallels between this and the wave of “elevated” comic book films Phillips and his team want to create. There’s nothing wrong with telling personal spins on beloved superheroes and villains. When your script has gone down the beaten path – and offered nothing nuanced or unique – when is this change gonna come? Joi Childs is a brand marketer, freelance writer, and sarcasm enthusiast.

"Sep 17, 2019"," Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) can’t catch a break. He spends his days dressed as a clown, spinning signs for local businesses. Things go south fast when a gang of hoodlums jump Arthur in broad daylight, and they smash his sign before handing him a helping of whoop-ass. Making matters worse, his boss chews him out for losing the sign. And when Arthur decides to carry a gun for protection, it slips out at the worst possible moment, costing him his job. Arthur has bigger ambitions, though; he dreams of becoming a famous stand-up comedian like his idol, TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But stand-up isn’t in the cards. The universe, it seems, has bigger ambitions for perennial sad-sack, Arthur Fleck. But it’s not only Arthur who has it bad in Gotham City circa 1981. Like a punch-drunk boxer clinging to the ropes, Gotham City is on its last legs. A garbage strike has lead to people piling Shaq-sized heaps of trash along the streets, and newscasts report giant super rats are running rampant. And new municipal budget cuts mean Arthur must stop visiting his social worker. Tensions keep rising between Gothamite’s and financial elites, and something is about to blow. Joker, from director Todd Phillips, tells the origin story of Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime. And in case you missed that R-rating on the poster, Joker is one dark and twisted tale. Arthur Fleck evolves from butt of the joke to future criminal mastermind, The Joker. And the film is as bleak, violent, and disturbing as one expects from a story about a psychopathic murderer in clown makeup. Heading into Joker, you must ask yourself what you want out of a comic book movie. This may sound like hyperbole, but I can’t say it any clearer: Joker is unlike any comic book movie that came before it. This isn’t a movie with nods to Batman, Harley Quinn, and The Justice League. This story takes place in its own pocket universe where a man calling himself Joker is about to make his grand debut. The closest proximity is James Mangold’s edgy, R-rated kind of/sort of standalone X-Men movie, Logan. If you watch Joker expecting a whiz-bang comic book movie full of one-liners, action sequences, and superhero cameos you’ll be disappointed. Joker isn’t about the plot so much as creating a feeling. Phillips wants viewers to lose themselves to the movie’s unnerving vibes. This film goes to some dark places that casual comic book fans won’t be ready for. Think of this picture as what happens if Adam Sandler’s Punch Drunk Love character Barry Egan went off the deep end. Actually, Arthur Fleck is what happens if Barry Egan had no support system. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a performance for the ages. This film doesn’t even feature any meaningful supporting characters. Sure, people come and go; Frances Conroy as Arthur’s sickly mother; Zazie Beetz as a friendly neighbour; and De Niro as a Johnny Carson-like talk show host. But they barely register whenever Phoenix is on screen. Joker is mostly a one-man show. So much of the film consists of closeups of Phoenix’s face and watching him perform is nothing short of mesmerizing. It’s incredible how he keeps forming new facial expressions all the way through. But it’s more than his silly-putty facial contortions that keep you hooked. Phoenix inhabits the character within his every strand of DNA and the performance blossoms once he ultimately becomes the Joker. There is a spring to his every step and a looseness to how he swings his limbs. Phoenix saunters around like a man who had the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders. And of course, there’s the iconic laugh which bursts out in manic fits. I wasn’t prepared for how gorgeous this movie looks. Joker is visual poetry; a film that speaks volumes without saying a word. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher creates a nicotine-stained vision of 1981 that seems so real that I want to reach out and touch it. I loved watching neon bodega lights cast their red and green glow on the wet pavement. And Gotham’s grimy subway system looked as authentic as documentary footage. I could watch this stunning-looking film with the sound off. But I wouldn’t want to thanks to Hildur Guðnadóttir’s grandiose score, which at times, resonates like a horror movie. Joker is about a lunatic gaining infamy, sure. But this film is really about a movement. It’s about what happens to people who fall through the cracks. It’s about a society that goes nuclear when two warring factions can’t find common ground. And it’s about a class of people who “in their desperation turned to a man they didn’t fully understand.” Watching Joker, I couldn’t help but think of the legion of frustrated young men who will cling to this movie as an affirmation. The parallels between Arthur Fleck and mass-shooter culture left my stomach in knots. Martin Scorsese’s 1982 classic, The King of Comedy (which had a massive influence on this film), was eerily prescient about the day when narcissists would demand their 15-minutes of fame. Inversely, Phillips takes us back to 1981 to tells a story that feels ripped from today’s headlines. Joker is at once a blunt political statement, an adrenaline shot to the superhero genre, and a love letter to classic crime flicks.

"Sep 17, 2019"," Nearly 500,000 film lovers flocked to the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, screening hundreds of films from all over the world. Artistry and diversity, the hallmarks of TIFF, were on view. Black artists, filmmakers and films were a key part of the mix. Big budget movies, small indie films, documentaries and shorts filled out the innovative programming. Check out the best of the best and the most noteworthy.  Atlantics (***) An ill-fated romance in Senegal takes center stage in this visually stunning ode to passion and yearning. French actress-turned-filmmaker Mati Diop won the Cannes’ Grand Prix for co-writing this love triangle between a young woman (Mama Sané), an out-of-work construction worker (Ibrahima Traoré) she loves, and a wealthy fiancé (Babacar Sylla) she disdains. With Claire Mathon behind the camera, Dakar looks picturesque and the composition of each scene is as perfect as the lighting. Diop tells her story using lots of imagery and long scenes that test patience. The beautiful cast looks like they stepped out of Essence Magazine. Themes of class divide, spirits from beyond and girlfriends who like to party often crowd what could have been a simple love story. Still, the romance in this film prevails.  Clemency (***) The debate over the death penalty gets a new spark with this very personal look at a humanistic warden (Alfre Woodard) who makes end-of-life experiences as compassionate as possible for those on death row. It’s as if Warden Bernadine Williams goes on cruise-control as she and her staff strap in inmates for that lethal injection. She thinks she’s fully prepared for everything. Then there’s an inevitable catastrophe that magnifies the toll her job takes on her psyche, husband (Wendell Pierce) and sobriety. Writer/director Chinonye Chukwu’s message is that executing criminals is inhumane. Slow steady drama builds and builds. Woodard creates a protagonist who is equally likeable and unapproachable. Her steely performance is complemented by supporting cast members: Aldis Hodge as the cop-killer next in line for death; Richard Schiff as the convict’s hopeful lawyer; Danielle Brooks as a person from the prisoner’s past.  Dolemite Is My Name (****) When you need encouragement, comedian Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy) commands, “Put your weight on it.” It’s a mantra he takes to heart as he shifts his talent from struggling comic and spoken-word pioneer to novice DIY indie filmmaker. Moore’s alter-ego is Dolemite, a feisty, martial-arts-loving character he pushes to the front of his first movie. Under the guidance of director Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow), with a hilarious bio/script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Eddie Murphy makes a splashing film comeback as the outrageously bold and determined artist who became an integral part of the 1970s Blaxploitation era. Never one to take no for an answer, the brash Moore gives Murphy a great opportunity to work his comic genius. And he does, along with a hilarious dream team who milks laughs: Keegan-Michael Key, Craig Robinson, Tituss Burgess, Wesley Snipes, Mike Epps, and the shameless scene stealer Luenell (I Got the Hook Up 2). Add in cameos by T.I. and Snoop Dogg and a plotline that leads to euphoria and this bit of hilarity becomes an amazing crowd-pleaser and an inspiring movie.  Harriet (***) The responsibility for getting Harriet Tubman’s legacy as an abolitionist and the history of the Underground Railroad told right is a weight few filmmakers could carry. Director Kasi Lemmons (Eve’s Bayou) is up to the task and has a vision. Her efforts are helped by Terence Blanchard’s emotionally charged musical score, John Toll’s evocative cinematography (he makes everyone’s complexion incandescent) and Paul Tazewell’s costumes. The script, by Lemmons and Gregory Allen Howard, pulls the characters into one epic tale of inhumanity, humanity and legendary acts of bravery. Cynthia Erivo (Tony winner The Color Purple; film Widows) plays “Minty” (Tubman’s nickname) with conviction. The evildoers (Joe Alwyn, Jennifer Nettles) and saviors (Leslie Odom Jr., Janelle Monáe) are perfectly portrayed. Lemmons can be heavy on the flashbacks (black and white clips of a family breakup seem redundant), and the footage looks like a cross between an art/indie film and a Lifetime network movie. But overall, she has accomplished a difficult mission that brings the life of an extraordinary liberator into full view. Finally the film medium has produced a public record of Harriet Tubman’s heroism. Now it’s time for Tubman’s image to be on the $20 bill. Waves (**1/2) Filmmaker Trey Edward Shults made an impressive directorial debut with the ultra-realistic family drama Krisha. This return to familial themes focuses on a wealthy black household. A dad (Sterling K. Brown) and stepmom (Renée Elise Goldsberry)–helicopter parents–pressure their teenage son (Kelvin Harrison Jr, Assassination Nation), a high-school wrestling champion, to succeed. He, however, is clandestinely living large, beset with injuries and having major girlfriend problems. His younger sister (Taylor Russel) waits in the wings for the attention she deserves. Shults’ script and direction jump-start start this teen saga with a kinetic verve reminiscent of filmmaker Harmony Korine’s wild and debauched Spring Breakers. Quick, flashy MTV-like edits (editors Isaac Hagy and Shults), a heavy-bass musical score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and an envious playlist of hip artists set the tone. The look of the film is perfect: production design by Elliott Hostetter; set decoration by Adam Willis; cinematography by Drew Daniels; and costume design by Rachel Dainer-Best. The plotline in Acts I and II leads to a clichéd stereotypical interpretation of a young black man’s life, which would be suspect coming from a black filmmaker, and is almost insulting coming from a white one. Act III takes the film in a completely different direction, which is fraught with heavy emotion that doesn’t always ring true. Something like TV’s overly touchy-feely This Is Us. In fact, watching Sterling K. Brown shed tears on screen, like he does incessantly on the TV show, is like watching a rainstorm on a tropical island. It’s an event, but it’s no surprise. The Goldfinch (*1/2) The novel of the same name by author Donna Tartt won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. This weakly developed screen adaptation will likely win a Razzie. Can’t blame the premise: A kid, Theo (Oakes Fegley), and his mom enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bomb ignites. She dies. He is taken in by a friend’s wealthy mother (Nicole Kidman). Theo’s worthless father (Luke Wilson) wrestles him away, eyeing the kid’s money. A missing painting of a goldfinch—worth millions—is lost in the explosion. Who has it? Years later Theo (Ansel Elgort) can’t shake his tragic past. Director John Crowley endeared himself to audiences with his sweet, simple period film Brooklyn. In this muddled and overly complicated interpretation of the book (Peter Straughan screenwriter), a series of preposterous circumstances and an overabundance of characters stymies any plausibility. Fegley’s performance fails to make a lasting impression. The photogenic Elgort is handcuffed by a poorly written character. Veteran actor Jeffrey Wright gives the only spot-on performance, but even he can’t save a silly storyline from itself. And why cast a Canadian actor (Finn Wolfhard) and a Welsh actor (Aneurin Barnard) in a pivotal role as Theo’s “Russian” friend Boris (young and old) if they can’t master the accent? Tech credits are solid. Little else is.  Honey Boy (**) His public meltdowns were documented in the news. And now, it’s as if actor/writer Shia LaBeouf wants the masses to know that his erratic behavior is the result of an irregular childhood. Otis (Noah Jupe as the 12-year-old; Lucas Hedges at the 22-year-old), is a child actor being bullied by his ill-tempered father (LaBeouf). Life ain’t easy. Though first-time feature filmmaker Alma Ha’rel directs what’s on the page pretty well, the story, lead characters and their conflicts never gel. LaBeouf lays the bad dad persona on thick, making him appear cartoonish. Bryon Bowers (TV’s “The Chi)” plays an AA friend. Musical artist FKA Twigs portrays a neighbor in a rundown motel. Cast also includes veteran actors Clifton Collins Jr. and Laura San Giacomo. Well-intentioned project. Iffy results at best.  Hustlers (***) A group of industrious strippers bilk Wall Street men out of thousands of dollars during the money-raining days leading up to the great recession. Writer/director Lorene Scafaria (The Meddler) bases her script on a New York Magazine article that chronicles the con games run by Samantha Barbash, a scheming hostess at New York’s strip club Scores. The women swipe credit cards, charge up clothes, buy houses and set up an enterprise that is quite profitable. Sets (production design by Jane Musky), costumes (Mitchell Travers) and cinematography (Todd Banhazi) provide plenty of eye-candy. The pacing (editor Kayla Emter) is tight too. Your eyeballs will pop out of your head when 50-year-old J. Lo, as ringleader Ramona, shimmies down a stripper pole displaying the abs of a twentysomething. As she leads her robber posse on an excursion filled with peril, joy, riches and life lessons, you will be thoroughly entertained. Constance Wu, Mette Towley, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and a cameo by ex-stripper Cardi B add magic as the women go from self-help, to self-employment, to self-infliction. Enjoy, and don’t forget to tip! Knives Out (**) Who did it in this whodunit? And, who cares? Writer/director Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) tries his hand at mystery writing, to little avail, and he must be an ardent Agatha Christee (Murder on the Orient Express) fan. A wealthy, elderly novelist (Christopher Plummer) dies. Suicide? Homicide? A southern sleuth (Daniel Craig) investigates. Johnson’s script is dull until the reading of the will, when family members’ greed and rivalries rage. The ensemble cast is impressive: Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Lakeith Stanfield as Lieutenant Elliott. There are plot twists aplenty, but none add up to much. Craig’s Alabama accent is atrocious. Does Johnson get anything right? The novelist’s grandson (Evans) drives a sleek 1960/70s silver BMW that is a work of art.  The Report (****) Tracking down the truth regarding the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program and the department’s use of torture is a sobering task for Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones, (Adam Driver). Yet, under the guidance of his boss Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), he perseveres. Years of Jones’ research unearth wrongdoing, cover-ups and lies that may never come to light. Writer/director Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!) slowly turns a very wonky, fact-based political story into a thrilling drama that pits reality against deceit and the Senate versus the United States Intelligence Community. It’s a battle of wills. Driver’s very intense performances holds viewer’s attention as a barrage of facts, figures and names rain on them in a way that only CNN could decipher. What will stay with audiences forever is that a few people fought to have the CIA’s machinations exposed. An exceptional cast also includes: Jon Hamm, Corey Stoll, Evander Duck Jr., Maura Tierney and Linda Powell (House of Cards). Uncut Gems (****) “They say you can see the whole universe in an opal.” That makes perfect sense to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a gregarious, Jewish NYC jeweler who is deep in debt to the wrong kind of people and hoping his next scheme will get him out of trouble. This time, his plan includes selling a massive opal—the size of a baseball. Brothers Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time), New York City-based writer/directors, have an urban, guerilla style of filmmaking that mirrors Martin Scorsese’s early works. Now, with a big budget in hand, they get to use all the crayons in the box. Sandler strips away his sunny facade and plays an addicted gambler who chums it up with hip black clients (basketball player Kevin Garnett), holds it down at home with his wife (Idina Menzel), and juggles a hush-hush life with a secret lover (Julia Fox). Player! The film aptly captures the mayhem and noisy din of the Diamond District. Rarely do movies chronicle any synergy between Blacks and Jews who are both living on the same edge. Brilliant filmmaking. Sandler deserves an Oscar nod and an apology from past naysayers. Every dog has its day. Bad Education (****) Thou shalt not steal. It’s a commandment that the characters in this true-life tale of debauchery and excess don’t heed. All is going well in Long Island’s Roslyn School District, until a high school newspaper journalist (Geraldine Viswanathan) starts investigating line items on the school district budget that seem, well, fake. Contractors and companies are ghosts. Certainly Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney), who handles the budgets doesn’t see anything wrong. Nor does the easy-going school district superintendent (Hugh Jackman). As the undeterred student continues to dig, the improprieties mount. The plotline (screenwriter Mike Makowsky) unravels in bits and pieces, causing increasing astonishment. Jackman is as wicked as he can be. Janney as the lady with more relatives on the payroll than Trumps in the White House, plays her sociopathic character to a T. Director Cory Finley (Thoroughbreds) doesn’t point fingers, doesn’t pass judgement. Instead he weaves extramarital affairs, weak school boards and betrayals into a web of insanity that is as outrageous as Janney’s other mayhem vehicle, “I, Tonya.” What’s the alternate spelling of embezzlement? P-R-I-S-O-N.  A total delight in the most devious way.  Blackbird (***) People deal with their last moments on earth in their own ways. Few, however, decide to throw a weekend party so family members can watch them commit suicide. That’s the premise of director Roger Michell’s (Notting Hill, My Cousin Rachel) warmhearted look at a clan who wrestles with cancer, mortality and conflict. Christian Torpe’s screenplay creates viable characters and sets their actions and reactions in motion. Mom (Susan Sarandon) is the weed-smoking matriarch, dad (Sam Neill) her life partner. Two daughters (Kate Winslet, Mia Wasikowaska) show up with their extended families along with mom’s best friend Liz (Lindsay Duncan). Jealousies, rivalries and inner turmoil brim to the surface as they confront mortality: ‘You’re here now. But tomorrow you’ll be dead,” says one daughter. Some moviegoers may wish the family was more down to earth blue-collar than whiny and rich. The wonderful ensemble acting comes under the guidance of Michell. Poignant life-affirming words by Torpe’s perceptive script endure: “The day’s go by so slowly. The years go by so fast.” Considering the gravity of the subject matter, what’s on view is surprisingly touching and disarming in the best ways. Coming Home Again (***) The bond between a mother and her son is tested in this warm-hearted story about a young Korean American man (Justin Chon, Gook) who leaves his job and girlfriend behind to take care of his terminally ill mom (Jackie Chung, Grey’s Anatomy) in San Francisco. They connect through food and the recipes she passes on to him. Based on his own experience, director/writer Wayne Wang (Joy Luck Club) creates a very humbling and humanizing story in a low-budget, small-cast movie that is powerful. Chon’s sensitive acting plays well against Chung’s spirited portrayal. Their experience and culture are specifically Asian, but the lifecycle event is universal. Wayne’s illuminating script and restrained direction give a sense of authenticity and clarity to everything. When the camera focuses on Chon trying to putty up a crack in an old wall, it becomes a metaphor for the film’s very rich and gripping premise.  A Hidden Life (****) In this age of neo-fascism, writer/director Terence Malick (Days of Heaven) astutely reminds viewers that they can counteract evil in their own way. Austrian farmer Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl) ) becomes a conscientious objector during World War II. His neighbors and town officials in his small village ostracize him, his wife Franziska (Valeri Pachner) and their three young daughters. The Nazis have a plan for him, and its bleak. Malick sets the location perfectly with wondrous shots of the Alps. Scenes of Hitler’s brutal officers committing atrocities reflect the era. The music (James Newton Howard), cinematography (Jôrg Widmer) and production design (Sebastian T. Krawinkel) are exquisite. Eerie parallels to modern times, echo again and again, as vicious leaders pray on the weak and instill fear in the masses. Franz to his spouse: “Oh my wife. What happened to our country, the land we love?” He adds: “If God gives us free will, we’re responsible for what we do.” A masterpiece of storytelling becomes a fitting tribute to those who remain principled and defiant.  Marriage Story (****) As writer/director Noah Baumbach has matured, so has the subject of his films. His 1995 movie Kicking and Screaming reflected his 26-year-old view of life. His 2019 film Marriage Story captures the angst of a 50-year-old who has weathered a divorce. He doesn’t have to say that this story is coming from a very organic place. It’s obvious by the characters on view and the raw emotion they display. Charlie (Adam Driver in his best performance ever) is the head of a Brooklyn theater group. Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is his wife and the troupe’s star. She’s offered a TV pilot in L.A., and that decision leads the two and their son Henry (Azhy Robertson) on a twisted road through divorce land, which turns them into adversaries with lawyers (Laura Dern for her; Ray Liotta for him.) who bully. There are screaming matches in this marital breakup parable that are as primal as the ones in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” In 136 engaging minutes Baumbach relives every tortured moment and slight in the couple’s less than idyllic marriage. D-I-V-O-R-C-E! The Two Popes (****) It’s surprising to watch a film about two heads of the Catholic Church, who have vehement disagreements and opposing viewpoints yet find common ground. It’s as if Anthony McCarten’s (Darkest Hour) insightful screenplay is trying to teach polarized factions how to bond. Anthony Hopkins plays Pope Benedict, the traditionalist monsignor who is stodgy and not hip to the times. Jonathan Pryce is Pope Francis, a sociable, humble innovator more concerned with the good of the people than the strict rules of the church. The film is strongest when it concentrates on the two actors giving their diametrically opposed opinions. It’s less interesting, but still good, when it depicts Francis’ backstory. Directed deftly by the brilliant Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles (City of God), the dignity, humanity and humor of the two characters is quite appealing. Francis: “How does an Argentinian kill himself? He climbs to the top of his ego and jumps off.” Jump Popes. Jump.",POSITIVE
"Sep 17, 2019"," Immediately following Ford v Ferrari at TIFF, the line was already well underway for Joker. After winning the top prize of the Golden Lion at Venice, the hype was palpable. People almost seemed to pile into the theater as the doors opened, and I was thankful that I found a decent seat. At any rate, I was ready to hunker down and see if Joker lived up to its now extreme expectations. And, I’m sorry to say, that it does not. As with several films of the past few years (Three Billboards, for example), controversy followed it after its overwhelmingly positive initial reaction. People are fearful of the film’s idealization of a mentally ill person taking on the ruling class, and for good reason. But even more than that, though, Joker just isn’t a very good movie. Joaquin Phoenix gives it his all, but there’s not much else here to support him.A Comic Book Origin StoryArthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a lonesome, eccentric man who lives with his mom (Frances Conroy) in Gotham. He works dressed up as a clown for a company that sends him off to various vendors, who use him to announce stores closing and for other purposes. Yet, he yearns for more, hoping to one day be a famous standup comedian.Fleck is often victimized not only due to his quiet nature, but also because of his uncontrollable laugh, a result of a brain injury, at one point even getting severely beaten up one day by some kids. The city of Gotham at the time is a crime-ridden place, but Fleck also has a haunted past, and these two things are a deadly combination.source: Warner Bros. PicturesThe film, as stated by director Todd Phillips, is greatly influenced not only by some Joker-centered comics, such as The Killing Joke, but also by Martin Scorsese‘s early NYC-centered films. Scorsese himself was even an executive producer at first before being forced to drop out to focus more on his upcoming The Irishman. The links are still clearly present, though.What immediately comes to mind is both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. The crime-ridden city of Gotham is clearly modeled after 1970’s NYC, while the character of Arthur is somewhat of a blend of both Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, both played by Robert de Niro (who, amusingly, here plays a character with his own talk show, much like Jerry in The King of Comedy).So, the links are there, the influences are present, and the iconic character of the Joker is brought on as the protagonist. The issue, though is if it all works. And arguably, it does not. What’s missing here is really a firmer hand at developing what is clearly a complicated persona, and I would argue that Todd Phillips isn’t quite that person. There are elements of the film that work, such as the portrayal of the city itself, and the clear explosion of manic insanity that inevitably happens. But what’s missing is the buildup.Where it’s LackingThe Joker is one of the most iconic villains in the history of comic books. Creating a backstory for him is a questionable endeavor, because it is often his lack of one that makes him more engaging. Look, for instance, at his portrayal in The Dark Knight by Heath Ledger, in which we never even get his real name, as he comes to represent the evil of society as a whole.Yet, Joker attempts to do just that. Arthur Fleck has a wounded past, and in turn lives in a dangerously unsettled world. It seems inevitable that he would eventually turn on this society. But the way Phillips approaches his arc just doesn’t feel organic. Explosions of violence come out of nowhere, and for seemingly no reason, happening too early on in the film or with no real purpose behind it. Certain scenes of Phoenix just dancing to nothing stretch on for an eternity, and serve little story development. An entire plot line concerning the character Sophie Dumond (played by Zazie Beetz, who is sorely wasted), could be taken out of the film and it would have little effect on it at all.source: Warner Bros. PicturesAs a result, when the film eventually does build to its climax, it just doesn’t feel as if it’s done enough to get there. This is, after all, the origin for a character that we’ve seen represented in comic books and on screen countless times now. After all that, this just doesn’t seem like the story Joker deserved, which leads more evidence to the fact that he really shouldn’t have a backstory at all.Is it problematic, though?To focus on a mentally ill character like Arthur Fleck is a delicate endeavor, as it’s clearly problematic to somehow ensue that his mental illness is what leads to his idolization. Mental illness is a prominent and serious issue in our society, affecting both the people inflicted by it and those surrounding them. It has led to serious outcomes as a result. So, is it troubling that what eventually occurs as a result of someone being inflicted by it is seen as somehow morally justified? Considering the many articles that have come out condemning the issue, I would say it’s not too far out to claim that it is.source: Warner Bros. PicturesTo be fair, let’s look at a real-life result in particular. The film which forms much of the influence of Joker, Taxi Driver, indirectly led to the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. In addition, though it was later proven to be unfounded, it was originally believed that the shooting in Aurora, Colorado was inspired by the Joker character in The Dark Knight.Although filmmakers can’t (and shouldn’t) be held responsible for the incidents their works inspire, it’s still clear that they don’t occur in a vacuum. It’s doubtful that Joker will lead to a real-world incident, but there still has to be some moral responsibility on the behalf of filmmakers to portray an issue such as mental illness in a more sympathetic light. Otherwise, the film is nothing more than a glamorization of violence for the sake of entertainment.Joaquin Phoenix, ThoughLet’s end on a high, though. Joaquin Phoenix is simply marvelous in Joker. Along with the script, he takes the character in a decidedly different direction than past iterations, which was a smart decision on their part. After all, it’s hard to measure up to Ledger‘s portrayal in The Dark Knight, or the cartoons on the many animated series.But Phoenix gives it his all, bringing an almost believable arc to a character that starts off timid and expressionless, but becomes manic and off-the-wall crazy. When you see him at the close of the film, it almost seems like he has fully become the iconic villain. If only there was enough in the script and direction to fully support the end result.Conclusion: JokerTo conclude, Joker, although clearly a different approach to comic book movies than in the past, just doesn’t feel like a fully developed film. It needed more fleshing out for its title character in particular, and in addition for many supporting characters surrounding him. And that’s before you get to the potentially damaging results that the film could cause.Joaquin Phoenix is, far and above, the best part of Joker. Besides him, though, this is a comic book story dead on arrival.What are your thoughts on Joker? Do you think filmmakers have a responsibility for what their movies could inspire?

"Sep 16, 2019"," Towards the end of a recent 20-minute interview with Joker star Joaquin Phoenix, the Oscar-nominated actor posed his own question: After seeing his interpretation of Batman’s famed arch nemesis, would I like to see him come back for seconds? Following his complete reinvention of the DC villain under the steady eye of co-writer and director Todd Phillips, by the time the end credits roll audiences are left wondering what dark alleyways this Joker might wander next. After a series of interconnected films kick-started by 2013’s Man of Steel, Phillips presses pause on the DC Extended Universe for a standalone origin story of perhaps the most popular comic book villain of all time. Co-written with Scott Silver, Phillips sheds the world-building storytelling narrative and over-the-top special effects typical of the genre for a slimmed down terrifying take on how Joker might have come to be. There’s a gritty texture to the look of Phillips’ Joker. And from the outset, with Saul Bass’ iconic Warner Bros. logo and Hildur Gudnadottir’s brooding score helping usher in the action, you know this will be quite unlike any other mainstream comic book movie just from a visual perspective. After all-time great Joker performances from Jack Nicholson (1989’s Batman), Heath Ledger (who won a posthumous Oscar for his riff on the character for 2008’s The Dark Knight) and Jared Leto (underused in 2016’s Suicide Squad), a gaunt Phoenix puts his own stamp on the villain, one that lingers in its devastation. Not fully based on any one story (Joker’s beginnings have never been wholly defined), Phillips casts Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally-ill street clown, who when we first meet him is standing in front of a store parading a sign that reads, “Everything Must Go.” Arthur is a man who quite literally can’t fit in with the world around him. And Phillips’ Gotham City is one in which the ruling elites, led by Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), ruthlessly suppress the lower classes. Living in a grimy apartment with his house-ridden mother (Frances Conroy), Arthur pops a myriad of pills and scribbles off-colour jokes into his journal in hopes of launching a career in stand-up comedy. At night, he fixates on late-night talk-show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) as the barometer of his hoped-for success. If he can someday make it onto Franklin’s show, maybe he’ll establish some worth in the world. Arthur eventually meets and forms a connection with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a neighbour from down the hall who shares his hapless exasperation with the coldness of Gotham. You want to root for Arthur, even though you already know what he’s destined to become. It might seem hard to imagine how he’ll chart a path from delusional loner to the famed DC super villain, but Phillips and Silver navigate that transition with deft subtlety. Arthur doesn’t fully transition into the disturbed psycho we know from comic books until almost the very end. But with each new slight, darkness beckons around the corner and it is riveting to watch Phoenix slowly slip further and further out of control. Much has been made of Joker having taken inspirational cues from Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (both of which starred De Niro and were directed by Martin Scorsese) but the essence of those films merely flavour Phillips’ unique vision. Of course, we’ve seen Phoenix play outsiders before. But in Arthur, the Oscar-worthy actor goes to a new level to chart the fall of a man and the rise of something eerily new. His risky performance reinvents a character who up until now has come to us fully formed. We don’t know how he became the way he is (the explanation that it occurred because he fell into a vat of acid always rang false to me) but this explanation is terrifying and scarily prescient. Phillips and Phoenix deserve credit for reimagining what a comic book movie can be. One that isn’t encumbered with setting up multi-movie plot lines and one that can go to places other films in this genre can’t. Joker stays true to its standalone storyline, with subtle nods to the greater Batman-verse adding a nice touch. But following that final imagine of Arthur, you’re desperately left wanting to see what happens next. Just how evil will he become now that there’s almost nothing tethering him to humanity?

"Sep 16, 2019","If Scorsese's 1976 classic Taxi Driver is a classier comparison for what Phillips concocts, what we have here is, without a doubt, a success thanks to an uncomfortable, disturbing portrait of a social outcast by Joaquin Phoenix.",POSITIVE

"Sep 16, 2019"," by Bill Chambers Two moments that soar: in the one, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), having just shed the last vestments of propriety, dons the complete outfit of his alter ego Joker–the green hair, the white face, the purple suit–for the first time and does an impromptu dance to Gary Glitter’s stadium staple “Rock and Roll Part 2” on an empty stairway in Gotham City. In the other, stand-up comic Joker achieves his dream of guesting on “The Murray Franklin Show”. The former is great because the music is at once non-diegetic and clearly prodding Joker; it’s one of the few times we’re indisputably inside his head, and, naturally, he’s soundtracked his grand entrance like he’s the star pitcher coming out to wow the crowd in the sixth inning. (Phoenix is arguably the first actor since Cesar Romero to accept that Joker isn’t just a psychopath, he’s also a complete dork.) The latter distinctly reminded me of Phoenix’s standoffish appearance on Letterman while he was in the throes of shooting the mockumentary I’m Still Here, but the reason the sequence works is that it’s legitimately suspenseful watching Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin harangue Joker on live television, stoking a burning fuse. De Niro’s presence is of course a nod to Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, in which he’s an aspiring comedian so desperate to do his act on “The Jerry Langford Show” that he stalks and eventually kidnaps the titular Jerry (Jerry Lewis). Despite that legacy casting, a particularly baleful De Niro is morbidly implausible as a talk-show host of legend, yet his proto-Morton Downey Jr. is defensible in that it looks ahead to the rise of today’s angry pundits. Unlike his ingratiating contemporaries (Johnny Carson, Merv Griffin, Jerry Langford)–period markers, including the cheesy glitz of “The Murray Franklin Show”‘s set design, suggest the film takes place circa 1980–Murray seems to be jonesing for conflict. Incidentally, De Niro’s head hasn’t been this square since Midnight Run. If nothing else, Todd Phillips’s Joker proves that two scenes do not a movie make. Employed by a talent agency for clowns, Arthur is gigging as a sign-twirler when we first meet him. Some punk kids steal his sign, and when Arthur gives chase, they violently ambush him. His boss (Josh Pais) cares only about the sign, but a concerned co-worker (the ubiquitous Glenn Fleshler) lends him a .38 for future protection. Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), who claims to have worked as a housekeeper for millionaire Thomas Wayne (discount Chris Cooper Brett Cullen, promoted from his role in The Dark Knight Rises as “Congressman”) and keeps writing him letters that go unanswered. Arthur dotes on her in scenes that must have felt like déjà vu to Phoenix after You Were Never Really Here. (For me, they fatally remind of a better movie.) In the meantime, Arthur takes a shine to his new gun, which falls out of his clown costume while he’s entertaining at a children’s hospital–a startlingly funny taboo gag of the sort at which Phillips excels, one that pings off latent antipathy for Patch Adams (yours, mine, ours) while also serving as a handy counterargument to Republican idiot Dan Crenshaw’s conviction that friends should be allowed to borrow his firearms. (Not that this excuses some rather dubious plotting.) Permanently fired for the faux pas, Arthur, still dressed as a clown, shoots dead a quartet of rapey Wall Street bros on the subway after diverting their attention from the young woman (Mick Szal) they’re harassing. Identified only by his clown costume, he becomes something of a folk hero in the Bernhard Goetz mold, minus the racial component. The third instalment of Phillips’s Hangover trilogy–an anti-comedy that could’ve come from the pen of Arthur Fleck himself–is the funniest entry if you harbour a certain amount of contempt for the fratty audience that made the first two movies colossal hits, because you can feel its flirtation with wokeness leaving them with blue balls. But even as he’s become a fairly subversive filmmaker (and whatever else you think of Joker, it is subversive to push a big-budget, R-rated origin film about a villain–not an antihero, but a villain, a terrorist in fact–through the studio system), he remains reluctant to interrogate the reliably white, entitled males who are his protagonists and primary demographic alike. Whatever the outcome of his flirtations with a gorgeous, single-mom neighbour (Zazie Beetz) says about expectations vs. reality, it seems designed to circumvent a hot-button stereotype so that Arthur is far more Walter Mitty than Joe Incel, blaming women for his lack of charisma. Disingenuous Wayne, initially a symbol of unfeeling capitalism greeted by timely protest banners (“Kill the rich!”), is somehow vindicated when it turns out that Penny is the root of Arthur’s problems. But remember: Arthur couldn’t possibly be a misogynist–he has a girlfriend he doesn’t abuse and he sided with the pretty lady on the subway against her attackers. Joker does not, surprisingly, dance around the issue of whether or not Arthur is mentally ill (he is, and has regular sessions with a social worker (Sharon Washington) because of it), but cuts to city services eventually leave him without his meds. In other words, at a certain point in the story Arthur can no longer be held accountable for his actions. Such equivocation in the age of Trump is frankly moral cowardice, and I’d honestly have more respect for Joker if it were wholeheartedly the fascist daydream many are dreading. The guy who should’ve directed this is S. Craig Zahler. The man-children have a lot invested in Joker‘s success–they sense it will piss off and trigger their illusory enemies, although they’re the ones currently throwing a tantrum over its imperfect ROTTEN TOMATOES score–but I’m loathe to predict what the movie’s long-term fallout will be. While the idiosyncrasies of Phoenix’s performance are fascinating, I don’t know that they lend themselves to idol worship as readily as Heath Ledger’s “why so serious?” shtick. Arthur, for what it’s worth, has a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, which gradually reverses the meaning of crying and laughing within the film, transforming Phoenix’s every cackle into an Oscar clip. That’s not the only interesting paradox here–the cynical tag feels nominally transgressive because Arthur becoming more entrenched in his sick alter ego is actually the happy ending of a movie called Joker. Gotham City, for what it’s worth, is overwhelmed by a mob of clown imitators far too quickly to be credible–Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver (whose street-conscious scripts run the gamut from 8 Mile to The Mod Squad) are too modern in their viral thinking–but the scorched-earth tableau of Joker beaming with pride over the anarchy he’s inadvertently started does have certain unavoidable parallels with MAGA imagery, even if some parallel action involving Trump stand-in Thomas Wayne muddies things. “Little by little, the country changes because of the men we admire,” warned Melvyn Douglas in Hud. I guess, in the end, Phoenix’s Joker is an upgrade from the current President in terms of false idols. At least he looks good in clown makeup. Updated for clarity: October 4, 2019.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 15, 2019","Fueled by strong performances and a disturbing story, ""Joker"" is one of the most interesting movies this year. Regardless of the reactions to it, it will be something that's going to talked about for a long time.",POSITIVE
"Sep 15, 2019"," I tend to stay away from calling a movie or performance the best of any given year, especially when there is still time to go before we reach December 31st. However, I doubt we will be graced with a better performance than Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in “Joker.” Despite all that we’ve heard about this role, I did not expect the masterful work that Phoenix does here. This performance confirms the 44-year-old actor as the best actor of his generation, and you can add it alongside his other pantheon-worthy work in “The Master,” “Two Lovers,” and “Her”. Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck is a man in deep distress, living with his elderly mom in a dingy New York City apartment, while he struggles to keep his job as a commercial clown. It doesn’t help that Fleck is also consistently bullied everywhere he goes. This is after all New York City in 1981, with record crime rates and poverty, which has a co-worker giving Fleck a gun to protect himself, concerned that his eccentricities may get the wrong attention. Fleck has a condition where he sometimes can’t stop laughing; it’s a nervous tick, but it gets him into trouble everywhere he goes, until he’s had enough and uses the .44 that was given to him to take matters into his own hands. This DC origin story is not a comic book movie at all. Yes, there’s Thomas Wayne, Bruce’s father, campaigning to be mayor by promising a cleanup of the city, but the film can easily be viewed as a standalone character-driven story reminiscent of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.” No coincidence then that Scorsese is executive producing “Joker” and that the star of both those classics, Robert De Niro, plays a game show host who tries to use Fleck for laughs on live television.  The parallels to today’s world are there — societal alienation and short-term medical treatment have never felt more current than they do today. Fleck’s situation could attest to 21st century anxieties, as he’s on seven different medications for his declining mental health, but New York’s cutting down of mental health services causes him lose the social counsellor who would prescribe the meds for him. Fleck’s descent into madness is immaculately horrifying because it feels all too real and anchored up by present-day realities and tensions. ",POSITIVE
"Sep 13, 2019"," After Joker, is there any way
Joaquin Phoenix could shock more with a performance? Probably only by
playing a healthy, well-adjusted person. To say he has made a career
out of playing darker, complicated characters is like saying
tornadoes have windy dispositions. His latest transformation into
Arthur Fleck, the man who will become the villain who has plagued
Batman since the beginning (literally, as the Joker made his first
appearance in Batman #1 in 1940), might just be the best yet in a
career defined by one jaw-dropping portrayal after another. Combine
that with his powerful Hollywood connections, and it’s probably why
he’s mostly evaded accountability for allegations
of harassment. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips is well suited to make the best use of Phoenix’s skills, having made a career out of bringing white male anxieties to the big screen, albeit mostly in a far more lighthearted fashion in films such as Due Date and The Hangover trilogy. But Phillips doesn’t have the heart to delve fully into the tragic story of a man who discovers that everything that’s been giving him comfort in his trainwreck of a life is either taken from him by a system and a society that’s becoming harsher and more uncaring by the day, or revealed to be a lie told by others…or himself. Or maybe Joker just borrows too
liberally from other sources while taking itself far too seriously.
It’s easy to see why. Arthur is a mentally disturbed, skeletal shell
of a man in a 1970s (or is it the early 1980s?) Gotham littered with
garbage and hopelessness where happiness is in short supply. He
consoles himself by dreaming of a career in stand-up comedy, although
the truly painful thing is his fantasies don’t really revolve around
fame, but connection, especially with his idol, Robert De Niro’s talk
show host Murray Franklin, whom he and his fragile mother (Frances
Conroy) watch nightly. Yet his mental illness often prevents him from
forming the social ties he desperately craves, and from fulfilling
his hopes. The movie does manage to eloquently convey Arthur’s pain when he writes, “The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you do not.” There should be more of such moments, yet even if Joker couldn’t be accused of endorsing Arthur’s increasingly murderous actions, it has trouble building empathy, not just for those suffering from similar afflictions, but for anyone. If Joker was only about the time period it’s set in, where a bankrupt New York was suffering from rampant crime and decay, with an activist movement veering into violent extremism, the movie might manage the edge it believes it possesses. But the sense of irony, which often lent a bitter insight into the fractured psyche of many of the anti-heroes who defined the era, is absent. It makes the movie’s commentary on today’s political environment not only misguided, but dangerous. Today’s activists are protesting the wealthy and increasing inequality as a form of survival. In Joker, they and the general public are symptoms of a social disease, animals lying in wait who are ready to attack those attempting to impose any kind of social order. The wealthy are the ones who occupy clean, elegant surroundings dripping with nostalgia for films such as Modern Times, ignoring star Charlie Chaplin’s pointed social commentary. Hell, the movie even has a businessman running for office who has a healthy disdain for those he’s hoping to govern. Yet he’s not only somewhat sympathetic, he’s actually mostly correct about Arthur’s background. Bad timing. It means that Joker misses the
greatest irony of all – that such an all-consuming nihilism and
victimization mentality is a privilege in itself, and often a typical
calling card of the demographic which is often behind real-life
atrocities such as mass shootings. This movie is indeed terrifying,
but that’s because it’s horrifically, unintentionally insightful of
how such men are viewed, both from without and within. Andrea Thompson is a writer, editor, and film critic who is also the founder and director of the Film Girl Film Festival.

"Sep 13, 2019"," This post contains minor plot spoilers and is based on a screening of Joker at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. The movie hits theaters October 4. There’s a scene in Todd Phillips’s Joker where Arthur Fleck, the man who becomes the Joker, goes on a rant. He’s talking about society, or primarily how he has been wronged by the world around him (something that he talks about a lot). I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, mostly because he was dancing around uttering the phrase immortalized by meme culture: “We live in a society.” After spending nearly two hours watching the origin story of the world’s most beloved villain, it felt like it was on the tip of his tongue.  Since Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker in 2008’s The Dark Knight, Batman’s nemesis has been meme-ified to death. Both earnestly and ironically, the Joker character has its own ecosystem of memes, parody accounts, and culture. Most center around how corny he is—regardless of what his origin story may be in a film, his problem is always “society” in general and how people don’t listen to him enough. It’s the stuff you hear men tell you when you’re in your early twenties and nod along to so they shut up.  In Joker, the memes have come to life. Despite taking place in the 1980s, Joaquin Phoenix expertly plays a man who seems like he’s one second away from complaining about how people are addicted to their phones and how nobody really “talks” anymore. The film begins with him playing with a small child on a bus, only until the laughing child’s mother tells him to leave her son alone. The audience is supposed to think she’s mean, and that this is the type of entitlement that asks, “What kind of a world do we live in if a nice man can’t play peekaboo with a random child on the bus?” Every night, Arthur goes home to care for his ailing mother after working as a clown for hire, and each night they watch a late night television show hosted by his idol Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. It barely matters that Robert De Niro plays Franklin; he’s just one person on the long list of criminally underused talent throughout the film. Fleck doesn’t have a father, but he fantasizes about Murray becoming a type of father to him. Meanwhile, Fleck’s mother, who has a professional connection to Bruce Wayne’s dad, a very rich man, believes he will extend his their generosity to them. She believes Wayne is a good man, despite his very vocal distaste for the poor, and that he will help them both out of poverty.  Phoenix plays Fleck with almost childlike enthusiasm (until he goes full murder on everyone). He dances like nobody’s watching, tries to win the heart of his neighbor Sophie, played by Zazie Beetz (who once again, could have been played by anyone), and is treated like a fool by everyone for no apparent reason other than that he’s weird. It’s not until his livelihood is in jeopardy that we see just how far he can be pushed, as his actions inadvertently start a revolution.  It’s at this point that I realize Todd Phillips made a movie for people who don’t really understand how revolutions work or are created. The residents of Gotham have almost no details about the crime, and as far as they’re concerned, there’s no motive or anyone who has taken responsibility. In a city that’s supposed to be riddled with crime and murder, would this be the one to get everyone on their feet? Fleck is the least cool Joker depicted in film, and so the entire two hours plays out like a lone wolf white male fantasy. He has no agency in his life until he turns to violence.  The question on everyone’s mind when watching Joker is and will be: how dangerous is this? Will the target demographic of young white men be inspired by this Joker? The film itself, beautifully shot, falls short of making a statement or showing signs of self awareness, which could certainly trick people into fearing its existence is harmful. But there is no real message. This is a fascinating, occasionally charming movie about a clown with an artsy veneer. Anyone going into the film is likely familiar with Jokers of yore: Jack Nicholson’s dancing and campy gangster, Heath Ledger’s cunning and truly brilliant criminal mastermind, and whatever Jared Leto was trying to do​ in Suicide Squad​. Where Joaquin Phoenix will fit in is unclear, which is ​part of ​what makes his performance beguiling—he’s just a regular guy who decides one day that he’s had enough.",POSITIVE

"Sep 12, 2019"," An origin story of Batman’s greatest foe was something no one ever really asked for. Much like Disney’s ill-fated attempt to flesh out the backstory of one of its greatest villains in Maleficent, the Joker is a character whose mystery is part of his endless charm. He’s a character we can never fully understand. Nor should we seek to. So seemingly indiscriminate in his chaos, his brand of evil was perfectly summarised by Michael Caine’s Alfred in The Dark Knight when he theorised, “Some men just want to watch the world burn.” In a climate of tentpole filmmaking, many will assume writer/director Todd Phillips‘ bold and unsettling Joker is nothing more than a shameless cash grab under the guise of an origin tale. But if you’re expecting the film to be filled with franchise-baiting references and sequel opportunities, you’ll be surprisingly mistaken. Yes, Joker takes place in Gotham City. And, yes, the fabled Wayne family are omnipresent. But these DC-referential details are ultimately superfluous to what’s at the heart of this daring and somewhat muddled work. While Joker does provide a detailed roadmap to the specifics of how Gotham’s supervillain was born, it’s difficult to determine whether anything here really bolsters the motivation of his villainous behaviour other than the manifestations of his mental illness; something we were already keenly aware of. In every incarnation, the Joker is a wildly disturbed and dangerously deranged character. He’s clearly not mentally sound. We knew that already. Are the specifics of his madness truly that important? Ultimately, that will be up for the viewer to decide. There’s no doubt Joker will be a divisive film. And this film critic is still grappling with whether to call it a masterpiece or a mess. Maybe it’s neither. Maybe it’s both. It’s a film that will leave you numb, that’s for sure. Regardless, it stands as a vehicle for its star to showcase his formidable talent. In a committed performance for the ages, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishingly impressive, completely disappearing into the role that nabbed the late Heath Ledger an Oscar and could very well do the same for Phoenix. Both an extension and a reinvention of the well-known character, Phoenix offers an unsettling depiction of the villain you won’t soon forget. Set during the early 1980s, all is not well (is it ever?) in Gotham City. In the grips of a strike by the city’s sanitation workers, the streets of Gotham are overrun with rotting garbage, giving birth to a new strain of “super rats.” Add in an economic downturn that’s causing local businesses to close and unemployment to boom and you’ve got a city on the edge of anarchy, just waiting for someone to light the fuse. Balancing on the edge of a breakdown, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a clown-for-hire and wannabe stand-up comedian who suffers from a neurological disorder which causes him to burst into random bouts of uncontrollable laughter, usually at the worst possible time. To combat the public’s confusion when these moments occur, Arthur carries a laminated card, reading “Forgive my laughter. I have a condition.” Living with his sickly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in their dreary apartment, the pair religiously watch a late-night talk show hosted by legendary comedian Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), which Arthur daydreams he’ll someday be invited to appear on. From an early age, Penny nicknamed her beloved son “Happy,” naively prophesizing one day he’ll “spread joy and laughter” to the world. If only she knew what lay ahead. But the world doesn’t seem to care for Arthur the way his mother does. While working as a sign-twirling spruiker outside a store on the verge of closing down, Arthur is jumped by a gang of teens who take off with his sign. After Arthur gives chase and confronts the hoodlums in an alley, they beat him senselessly. When one of his co-workers hears of the incident, he provides Arthur with a gun for protection, which he foolishly brings to a gig at a children’s hospital, causing him to lose his job. After spending time in a mental institution, Arthur regularly visits a social worker, who feigns interest in his beleaguered life but ultimately is merely there to keep him in supply of a series of psychotropic drugs. When funding for the program is cut, Arthur goes off his meds and begins to lose his last semblance of sanity. When a violent incident on a subway train inadvertently causes a mob uprising of Gotham’s lower-class citizens, Arthur finally feels like he’s found his purpose as their pseudo leader. In all honesty, Phillips could have removed any connection to the DC world, called this film Clown, and it would still work as effectively. For all its connection to a larger narrative world, Joker is a standalone piece that ultimately seeks to portray one man’s descent into absolute madness. Sure, that man eventually progresses to become someone who battles against Gotham’s heroic vigilante crimefighter. But in this film, he’s just a clown with a gun. For now. This may sound strange, but the film is ultimately a journey into insanity you can’t help feeling you almost shouldn’t be watching. You will leave this film with a knot in your stomach and that’s likely entirely what Phillips wants. Joker is an unflinching and uncomfortable portrayal of mental illness some may call exploitative and others may deem entirely essential. Where the lines get blurred is the inference Arthur’s mental instability, coupled with his dismal treatment by society, is what consequently births a villain, almost to suggest his violence and vengeance are entirely valid reactions. That’s not to suggest the violence is played for entertainment. It’s brutal and graphic, earning every inch of its much-publicised R-rating. The sight of Arthur’s face splashed with crimson red blood across his white clown makeup is both striking and disturbing. For those more accustomed to typical comic book adaptations that downplay the violence, Joker will either feel like a breath of fresh air or simply too much. It’s far from an excessively violent film. But when the deaths occur, they’re meant to shock an audience. There are already fears Joker will inspire some sort of incel uprising and a whole wave of lone-wolf copycats could be on the horizon. Or that it’s somehow a call to arms for those who identify with Arthur. There is some validity in these concerns, but this reaction seems rather extreme. If we start demonising one piece of fictional cinema as the potential cause of violence in the world, every film, television show, comic book, and video game will suddenly be fair game. The current U.S. administration is already pointing the finger of blame at pop culture for the current spate of mass shootings. Do we really need to give them more fuel for the fire? But it is jarringly inescapable how uncomfortable the timing of the release of Joker ultimately may be. It seems every few months (or weeks) we’re hearing about a lone psychopath picking up a gun and mowing down as many people as they can. Is it really the right time for a film like this? Maybe the answer is actually yes. As muddily presented as its message may be, Joker appears to be highlighting the damage that can occur when we ignore the plight of someone gripped with mental illness. The system lets Arthur down. Society either turns its back on him or mocks him right to his face. No one really sees him until he enacts violence upon them. That sounds achingly similar to the motivations behind the mass murderers we hear about on the news. Despite Joker being set in the past, a character like Arthur and the actions of such a madman feel eerily familiar right now. This is a film born from 2019 culture. Read into that what you will. Whether Joker is trying to say something profound or say nothing at all, you cannot deny it features a startling and spectacular performance from Phoenix. Inhabiting the role as earnestly as Ledger but with his own determined and outrageous spin, Phoenix is simply stunning. It’s a wildly nuanced performance with so many layers for Phoenix to unfurl. As Arthur takes control of his destiny, Phoenix drives the character from whimpering victim to dangerous aggressor with deft skill. But it’s the physicality of his work that’s equally as impressive as his emotional efforts. Arthur is shockingly emaciated and frail (you’ll beg for him to put his shirt back on) which just makes the character that much more unsettling to behold. When Arthur’s illness causes him to laugh uncontrollably, Phoenix delivers these moments as a combination of both chuckles and cries, leading to an unexpected wave of sympathy to be elicited from an audience. Before his murderous actions (particularly one that’s horribly cruel), you cannot help but feel some empathy for Arthur, which is a testament to Phoenix’s incredible work. In a visual sense, Joker invokes the early work of Martin Scorsese, especially Taxi Driver. Frankly, you almost expect Travis Bickle to drive past in his cab at any moment. Call it homage or rip-off, Phillips is clearly a big Scorsese fan. With spectacular production design from Mark Friedberg, Gotham City feels more like the down and dirty New York City in the late 70s/early 80s with its neon-drenched streets and graffiti-covered subway cars. It’s an aesthetic that echoes the Gotham of the future found in Christopher Nolan’s trilogy, even if we’re still being led to believe the films are not connected. It’s been days since my screening and it’s still tough to pinpoint if Joker is a glorious success or a calamitous failure. Perhaps repeat viewings will make the picture clearer. While it reaches to dark and gritty depths we haven’t seen in a DC comic book adaptation for years, it’s handled rather clumsily by Phillips whose heavyhanded approach sometimes feels too desperate. This film is trying so achingly hard to be something different, and that has to be admired. But it’s trying just as hard to be something important and the success of that aim remains unclear. At the end of the day, Joker is a turbulent and maddening work that’s already creating the toxic fan discourse we’ve come to expect in 2019. And that’s probably precisely how someone like the Joker would want it. Let the chaos begin.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 12, 2019"," If you only know Todd Phillips’s Joker from the sound and fury of its prerelease – from its triumph at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion award for best film, to studio Warner Bros.' many curious promotional decisions, including banning journalists from the film’s red-carpet Hollywood premiere this past weekend – then you might think that the film is an unholy world-burner, toxic and infuriating. The movie will spark mass violence courtesy of societal rejects who identify with its loner anti-hero. Wait, no: The movie is an overdue call to arms against an elite ruling class. Joker is masterful, it is incendiary, it is essential, it is dangerous. It is a piece of cinema so outrageous that the medium itself must be redefined going forward. There was the time before Joker, and the time after. I hate to deflate a good gag, but: no. No to all the frantic discourse. No to the film being put atop a pedestal of any sort. No to the energy we’re collectively wasting on it. No to an okay-but-not-especially-good-and-ultimately-nothing of a movie. No, then, to Joker. It gives me little pleasure to play this card. I’m now watching my inbox, admiring its pristine state before it will be turned into a raging dumpster fire of death threats from DC Comics acolytes and those emotionally unsuited to encountering differing opinions – a Flamin’ Hot Cheetos-dusted middle finger from fan-boys who have already offered a small piece of their minds after my short review of Phillips’s film was published during last month’s Toronto International Film Festival. Okay, here’s an admission: maybe I do get a little pleasure from this. I wouldn’t exactly endorse readers calling me a waste of flesh because I didn’t like a movie about a comic-book bad guy, but it is also very funny that people – many of whom have yet to watch any Joker footage outside of promotional clips – will take the time out of their day to tell me that the world would be a better place once a movie critic is dead. That’s a sicker joke than even the Clown Prince of Crime could come up with. Certainly it’s a more calculated laugh than anything offered up in Phillips’s film, which is a fine-enough tweak of the comic-book movie that still struggles mightily to locate the energy necessary to justify its existence. If you ever wanted to know about the origins of Batman’s most iconic nemesis, and were not previously satisfied by the material provided in comics, on television, in cartoons, and in three separate feature-film franchises, then Joker is here to ... well, not quite to satisfy you. Honestly, I’m not sure what Joker is here for, other than to cause a clumsily manufactured uproar. Phillips’s Joker takes the form of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a stick-thin sack of sad who stumbles through a rotting Gotham City, circa 1981 (no exact date is ever given, but the presence of Brian De Palma’s Blow Out on a downtown marquee fits the era-appropriate set-dressing). Arthur lives with his ailing and domineering mother (Frances Conroy), works as a clown-for-hire and suffers from a vague health condition that causes him to burst into fits of laughter at inappropriate times. He also fancies himself a stand-up comedian, and spends a good deal of his days fantasizing about appearing on a late-night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). A large portion of the film dozily follows Arthur falling deeper into psychosis, until Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver realize they should insert some sort of action, at which point the movie turns into a briefly exciting, but mostly sloppy, #OccupyGotham polemic. The filmmakers have the base ingredients for an intriguing, challenging character study that just happens to be nestled inside the DC Comics canon. But Phillips appears to be more interested in making a very costly Martin Scorsese fan-film (with Scorsese’s implied approval, given that he briefly flirted with producing the project). From its set design to its casting decisions to its hmm-could’ve-worked soundtrack choices, Joker is Phillips’s shiny-grimy bid to prove that he’s more a student of capital-a Auteur cinema than a tittering peddler of horny lowbrow comedies (Old School, War Dogs, the Hangover trilogy). Occasionally, Joker even spits up evidence to support this argument. Phillips’s down-and-out Gotham is captured with a slickly, greasy sheen that delivers welcome echoes of Taxi Driver’s 42nd Street filth. The film’s relatively few flashes of violence are also startling. And while the director’s casting coup of De Niro doesn’t work in the slightest – the actor is on-hand to remind audiences of both Travis Bickle and The King of Comedy’s Rupert Pupkin, but seems invested only in when exactly his cheque will clear – Phillips otherwise pits Phoenix against worthy dramatic adversaries, including Zazie Beetz as Arthur’s rightfully leery neighbour, Brian Tyree Henry as an overwhelmed Arkham Asylum clerk, and character-actor super-stars Bill Camp and Shea Whigham as a pair of weary detectives. Phoenix himself is, not surprisingly, riveting. Emaciated and exhausted, today’s greatest working actor is easily the best reason to take yet another trip into Gotham City. He doesn’t wash away memories of Heath Ledger’s more slippery agent of chaos, but he does leave his own indelible bruise. Arthur’s perpetual agitation, his under-the-skin unease, is felt in Phoenix’s every onscreen breath and twitch. Yet, for all of the actor’s commitment and Phillips’s stylistic aspirations, the turbulence that the pair offer isn’t exactly fresh. Arthur is an assemblage of five decades’ worth of trickier characters, all more inventively and provocatively explored before: Bickle and Pupkin and Ledger’s Joker, sure, but also two of Phoenix’s own greatest roles, The Master’s disaffected sailor Freddie Quell and You Were Never Really Here’s burly vigilante Joe. In those latter two films, though, Phoenix had the respective guiding artistic forces of Paul Thomas Anderson and Lynne Ramsay, filmmakers who operate on a more raw and sincere level than Phillips. In Joker, the Road Trip director is appropriating the visions of his cinematic idols to repudiate his own filmography – “Road Trip director” would be the first sentence that Phillips would hope to scrub from his IMDb profile – but in the filmmaker’s quest to become someone new, he has made something so very old, and familiar. (I have wonderful news, though, for whoever is itching to see Thomas and Martha Wayne once again get shot to death in an alleyway.) As for politics, Joker has none – and I don’t mean that in some kind of meta-contextual way. Nihilism would be something. Joker has nothing – its only philosophy being a firm belief in the value of shock. And weak shock at that. By the point Arthur finally transforms into the title character – a moment set to Gary Glitter’s Rock and Roll Part 2, a supremely weird choice that unintentionally underlines the film’s goofiness – Joker reveals itself as very expensive cosplay: effective at first glance, but at its seams superficial, disposable and dishonest. For all the inevitable debate that Joker will spark, I can’t help but wonder what the fuss is all about. Already, this film review is nearly over, and I’m giddy at the prospect of never thinking about this movie again. All those out there who are midway through composing death-threat e-mails would be wise to do the same. Live your best.

"Sep 12, 2019"," El hecho de que DC y Warner Bros. no hayan podido establecer su propio universo cinematográfico inspirado en el de Disney y Marvel, tiene sus aspectos positivos. Con apenas unas cuantas películas, la calidad que presentaron no fue la mejor (o al menos a nivel de calidad y aceptación del paralelo universo Marvel), así que los responsables de una película tan trivial como Joker no habrían dado luz verde.  Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin Phoenix ) es un perdedor desde la distancia. Cuando no está en casa cuidando a su madre Penny ( Frances Conroy), hace girar carteles publicitarios de ventas callejeras en nombre de una agencia de payasos. Su vida es sombría y consiste en ser invisible para los demás y ser maltratado por quien quiera. Sin embargo, y apesar de todo lo mencionado, Arthur solo quiere una cosa: hacer felices a las personas. Suceden varias situaciones que eventualmente lo intensificaran a él y a su psicosis: es golpeado y humillado varias veces, pierde su trabajo, el servicio social cierra y con él su acceso a medicamentos, su madre sufre un derrame cerebral y Arthur, en una situación bien específica toma la justicia en sus manos. Y es allí donde la espiral a la locura inicia.  Arthur, quien es el narrador de la trama, no es una persona confiable, ya que alterna la narración entre su imaginación y su psicosis teñida de realidad. Todo esto es de esperarse si conoces el personaje del Joker. También se espera que la presentación sea extremadamente intensa, después de todo, este es el sello distintivo y el gran arte de Joaquin Phoenix. Todo esto es fascinante y está bien hecho. Con cada minuto que pasa, va más y más profundo, extendiéndose mucho más allá de la zona de confort de la audiencia. Desde los primeros minutos, nos queda claro que Arthur no es una persona malvada. De hecho, el excelente trabajo del guión de Phillips y la interpretación extraordinariamente inmersiva de Phoenix, naturalmente nos hace empatizar con el hombre solitario, ridiculizado por todos y con un pasado que es difícil de definir como un eufemismo. Un ser que a pesar de la opresión que tiene que soportar todos los días, tiene un gran sueño: cumplir con las expectativas de su madre enferma y ser comediante stand up, soñando con conquistar un lugar en el programa de televisión de Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), al cual por el momento solo puede mirarlo en la televisión de su estrecho departamento. Pocas películas van tan bien y tan lejos, permitiéndose tanta repugnancia como “Joker”, y eso es muy bueno. El cine y el arte pueden y deben ser incómodos, porque cada película es, como siempre en el arte, hija de su tiempo y es imposible, especialmente en estos días, separar completamente el trabajo de la sociedad en la que se creó: se condicionan entre sí, se reflejan, se distorsionan, y se influyen mutuamente. Ese es el poder de contar historias, de crear imágenes.  Arthur deambula como un fantasma entre los giros y vueltas en una ciudad decadente, desbordante de basura e insatisfacción, para llegar a fin de mes con pequeños trabajos promocionales. Cada contacto humano se ve socavado por su enfermedad mental, mantenida minuciosamente a raya por medicamentos. La reacción a Joker es bastante visceral, que se siente en el estómago. Para algunos puede ser simplemente la vehemencia de las representaciones mismas. Pero debajo hay otro nivel aterrador que gradualmente desaparece de la película. Y esto es al menos aleccionador, si no altamente problemático. Parece que el cineasta y guionista Todd Philipps puede no estar consciente de ello, pero Joker es un verdadero regalo para el populismo actual, especialmente los fanáticos, los oprimidos, los pistoleros y los derechistas, porque les crea una figura decorativa, tal como hizo Scarface hace unos 40 años.  Arthur fue abusado de niño, tiene una mala madre, es humillado y no recibe suficiente atención de las mujeres. Todo esto y más, se construye de manera sistemática y repetitiva en la película y proporciona una base ideológica para el desenlace. Todo lo que ocurre, es justificado en pantalla, pero no solo justifica a la gente en la historia, nos da a nosotros, los espectadores, una morbosa justificación de sus acciones. Diabolicamente estamos de su lado y queremos ser parte de su séquito. Y, por así decirlo, esta construcción que la película crea en más de la mitad de su tiempo, también incluye la clásica estrategia, que es tan exitosa en el populismo de derecha en todo el mundo. Ellos son ""los otros"", y en Gotham, son ""los de allá arriba"", pero bien podrían ser los extranjeros, los refugiados o cualquier otra persona. Agregue a eso una pequeña estrategia de conspiración y un  narrador poco confiable, cuya historia está perfectamente en el tiempo actual de las noticias falsas. Hay un momento de la película, en las afuera de un cine en donde se proyecta el filme Tiempos Modernos que presenta una brillante metáfora de Charlie Chaplin sobre la deshumanización y alienación del proletariado, y en una rara incursión de la realidad en el imaginario ficticio de Gotham. Una multitud enojada protesta contra lo que no es solo una noche de gala, sino también sobre todo un símbolo de poder, en la que está reunida la élite de la ciudad viendo este filme, el mismo grupo de personas culpables de haber dejado a una gran parte de la comunidad en la desgracia. Este grupo de personas que protesta, simbólicamente usa una máscara de payaso (como V for Vendetta), influenciados por un hecho previo. El Arthur Fleck de un sorprendente Joaquin Phoenix, desde el interior de ese cine mira siniestramente al magnate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), padre del pequeño Bruce (Dante Pereyra-Olson), quien se perfila para ser la nueva cara de un posible renacimiento de Gotham, lo mira desde la distancia con desdén y con mucho rencor. En unos segundos, Philips combina el descenso progresivo al infierno de nuestro personaje a la par con su entorno. Aquí hay que olvidarse del histrionismo del Joker de Jack Nicholson y el agente del caos por Heath Ledger (el Joker de Jared Leto lo olvide por completo). El Joker de Phoenix es el último de los últimos, el producto natural de Gotham de principios de la década de 1980 pintado por Phillips, tan similar al New York representado magistralmente por Martin Scorsese en Taxi Driver. Una metrópolis masacrada por la suciedad, el desempleo y el crimen, que tiene la mejor perspectiva de mantener el status quo y que se convierte en un personaje real en la película, envolviendo la transformación de Arthur en su oscuridad. Phillips da un paso fundamental en la historia del género de superhéroes, superando la trágica epicidad de la trilogía de Nolan desde la derecha, rechazando tanto las venas oscuras del Batman de Burton, así como las atmósferas pop y despreocupadas del Universo cinematográfico de Marvel, eligiendo el camino del realismo puro de una sociedad desilusionada y resentida. Sin efectos especiales, sin escena de acción caótica, sino solo un rechazo de una sociedad en la que una acción es suficiente, incluso incorrecta y loca, para convertirse en el ídolo de las personas y alcanzar la popularidad más deseada de la manera más inesperada. Joker es una película de este tiempo, una que está a la altura y celebra los antojos de la  locura y eso la convierte en una película muy problemática. Porque proporciona un nuevo ícono para el odio, el asesinato y el abuso, con todo un conjunto de legitimaciones. Este comodín es la excusa de proyección perfecta, ya que incluso la más mínima ambivalencia y la última chispa de disgusto por la falta de humanidad al final de la película se ahoga en un baño de sangre, por lo que el personaje aún se celebra como un nuevo dios.  Solo el tiempo nos dirá si podemos atribuirle a Joker la etiqueta de obra maestra, marca cada vez más abusada. Por el momento, podemos contentarnos con disfrutar de una obra que logra modernizar de una manera completamente original un personaje tallado en la imaginación colectiva, mezclando el imperioso hito del nuevo Hollywood con una crítica social actual, arrastrando el espectador en un vórtice de reveses emocionales que te dejará conmocionado durante varias horas después de salir de la sala. Y si esto no es una obra maestra, sin duda es un milagro para el cine estadounidense contemporáneo. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Sep 12, 2019"," The buzziest screening at TIFF this year was not the Ansel Elgort-starring The Goldfinch, an adaptation of the bestselling novel your mom's book club loves; nor was it Ford v Ferrari, the flashy car-racing movie with two of the country's biggest movie stars; nor was it a Star Wars director's murder mystery caper. It was an adaptation of a comic book villain's origin story, the superpowers and myth peeled away to leave only the nasty, hateful pit of DC Comics' most mysterious bad guy -- a villain whose narrative past has always been subjective at best.  The Joker traditionally has no single origin, as Heath Ledger implies in The Dark Knight by altering the story of his face scars for different people. According to some versions, the Joker is a failed clown who just has a thing for greasepaint; to others, a vat of acid leached the color from his skin and the sanity from his mind. As recently as 2017, the White Knight arc gave him the alias Jack Napier, a callback to the 1989 Tim Burton Batman movie. We've seen Bruce Wayne's parents die so many times we could recount it in our sleep, but the Joker's whole sinister ""thing"" remains open to interpretation. Todd Phillips' origin movie attempts to correct this, but instead of a lean, gritty (ugh) character reboot, we're left with an irresponsible thought experiment and a sour taste in our mouths.  Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose name may or may not be a subtle dig at former Batman Ben Affleck, is a sad-sack clown for hire, spinning signs and visiting children's hospitals when he's not caring for his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), who's bedridden and obsessed with future mayor Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). He makes regular visits to a social worker who prescribes him a buffet of medications for unspecified mental ailments, telling her about all his many, many dark thoughts. ""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"" he asks her. At night, he tunes in to a late night talk show hosted by his favorite comedian Murray Franklin, who, in an homage to the 1983 film The King of Comedy, is played by Robert De Niro. Fleck is obsessed with Franklin, inventing conversations between them in his head, practicing what he'd say if he were ever invited to do standup on his show.  Amid the ramblings about society's downfall and his own dark thoughts, Fleck writes jokes in the ratty journal allotted to him by social services. He has dreams of becoming a famous comedian and making people laugh, despite his uncontrollable nervous laughing condition and the fact that nothing he can come up with is all that funny. He meets a young woman who lives in his dingy apartment complex (Zazie Beetz, unfortunately for her) and develops a crush. After he's mugged at work by a gang of boys and beaten up in an alley, one of his clown colleagues gifts him a gun to protect himself, which he later uses in an act of violence when another group of young men bully him on a train.  Fleck finally snaps when he can no longer control his anger, and, naturally, feels much better after he commits his heinous crime against people he feels deserve it, but there's barely any sense that he actually did anything wrong. The movie is told from his point of view, sure, but there's plenty of space in this script for the film to pull back and examine his behavior, what it means, and why it makes him go off the deep end. He himself blames his actions on his ""mental illness,"" but that falls flat given how little substance surrounds the rest of the film.  There could be a place for a movie like this -- not this movie, but a movie LIKE it -- if it actually had anything of use to say. Unfortunately, there's nothing really THAT edgy about the whole thing. I'm reminded of the scandal-that-wasn't when Lars Von Trier's similarly polarizing The House That Jack Built premiered at Cannes in 2018 and, the story goes, nearly half the audience walked out before it was over. The buzz was inescapable, and the rest of us walked into our screening the next morning only to leave disturbed, disappointed, and mildly perplexed by what we'd just seen. Like House, Joker really isn't THAT bad. There's violence, fear, and endless proselytizing about depressive episodes and the infinite capacity for men to give reasons for their violent tendencies, but all that is is boring.  It wouldn't be a BAD movie... if it weren't such a bad movie. Phillips is undeniably a talented director, aesthetically, lending the back alleys of Gotham appropriate layers of grime and peeling paint and dusty storefronts, framing Phoenix’s laughing rictus in manic close-ups. Phoenix is also good, when he’s not just sitting in a chair laughing, which he does a lot. You do pity him, at first, when it becomes clear that the whole world really has abandoned him.  What's frightening about Joker is it's impossible to tell whose side we're supposed to be on. I suppose that's one of the many definitions of compelling art, but it's also cowardly. The official summary of the movie describes it as a ""cautionary tale,"" but it's unclear what that refers to. A cautionary tale about mental illness? About not ignoring those who feel beat down by society? About not handing guns to people with laughing disorders? But it's undeniable, at its climax, when he is at his most despicable, that Joker does look kinda cool, or at least is framed that way. What are we supposed to do with that?  There's so much about Joker that's downright nasty, and not in an entertaining way: The fact that the movie speaks, intentionally or not, to incels, those who believe in the oppression of women and minorities and in taking whatever they want with physical force. The fact that, just seven years ago, a man dyed his hair and shot up a movie theater during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. And that's saying nothing of the mental illness angle, which Fleck uses, multiple times, as an excuse for his behavior.  In a way, the Joker is right: He's been abandoned by everyone, and the only way he can get attention is through violence. If the world had just been nicer to him, the film seems to say, if only he'd gotten the right help, if only he hadn't been mentally ill, if only the woman he loves (read: stalks) had loved him back, things might have gone differently. Yet it also conspicuously ignores the narcissistic conviction that defines this kind of person; that the world doesn't care about them, and that it's up to them to make it care. When Gotham finally goes up in flames, descending into the chaos we all know it must, it's Joker the film zooms in on, Joker it cares about. It's a complete power fantasy (and, due to the ambiguous ending, could literally be one).  Should we pity these people? The best villain narratives usually are quite sympathetic: Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader because of heartbreak and what he saw as betrayal. Daenerys Targaryen watched the only friends she'd ever had executed one by one at the hands of those she hated most. But Anakin also killed a roomful of schoolchildren; Daenerys crucified people as a political statement. There's nothing in Joker to remind us that what he thinks is wrong. The movie isn't badly made or even ugly to look at, but there's a mean, smug little heart at the center of it that, at best, irresponsibly frames a familiar male power fantasy as a revolutionary act. And that's not funny at all.  Sign up here for our daily Thrillist email, get Streamail for more entertainment, and subscribe here for our YouTube channel to get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," PLOT:  Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely, often bullied man living in squalor with this mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. As the city’s gulf between the haves and have nots widens, Fleck’s fragile mindset teeters on the brink of insanity, threatening to set him off like a powder keg with disastrous consequences for both the city and anyone unlucky enough to be in his orbit. REVIEW:  People are not ready for JOKER. Everyone’s talking about this as a supervillain origin story, but that doesn’t do it justice, with this as unsettling a portrait of madness as any I’ve seen. It’s an ugly uncompromising R-rated psychological thriller that will leave many rattled and prove to be among the most provocative movies of the year. Of course, it’s a must-see. Directed by Todd Phillips is a style that will likely erase any memory of him as a comedy director, this gruelling drama is, as advertised, reminiscent of TAXI DRIVER and KING OF COMEDY, although the gritty style seems more in the vein of Sidney Lumet, while the uncompromising way the movie puts us squarely in the mindset of a remorseless killer brings to mind Michael Mann’s MANHUNTER, albeit without any heroes to save us. For Joaquin Phoenix, it’s likely a signature role, with him as iconic as anyone who’s played the part before. It helps that his Joker has next to nothing in common with any version of the character we’ve seen before. There are no wisecracks, and the character is never made attractive in the way Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger were – basically, there are no scenes where Joker’s made to be cool. If anything, we’re supposed to be repelled by this deeply unsettling character, who starts as a walking tragedy but becomes a monster beyond anyone’s sympathy, with the acts he commits in this far beyond what we’ve ever seen in a Batman movie. Handily earning its R-rating, a movie like this would never get made by a mainstream studio were it not for its roots in the Batman franchise, but it’s hard to watch this and ever imagine Warner Bros and DC folding Phoenix’s version into any of their PG-13 franchise films. Phoenix dominates the film so thoroughly it’s hard to single out the supporting cast, as good as they are, as everyone’s part, except Frances Conroy’s as his detached from reality mother, only ever exists in the orbit of the Joker. Thus, everyone’s screen time is surprisingly limited, including Zazie Beetz as his new neighbor, Robert De Niro as the talk show host he idolizes (who only really has one big scene) and Marc Maron, here in virtually a cameo. The threads connecting it to the Wayne family are there, including appearances by Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen – who amusingly also appeared in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES), Alfred (Douglas Hodge) and a young Bruce Wayne. Outside of Phoenix, the film’s big signatures are the cinematography by Lawrence Sher, that could put him up there with the giants, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s (“Chernobyl”) score, and of course Philips, who offers up some chilling moments depicting the ecstasy Joker feels when he’s at his most murderous (including a showstopping moment set to Gary Glitter’s “Rock n’ Roll Part 2”). Certainly, JOKER is the film to see this fall, and one that will no doubt become the water cooler event of the year, and the one everyone will have an opinion on. It’s probably the most provocative, uncompromising American movie to be made since FIRST REFORMED, the difference being more people will see this in a day than did during that film’s entire run. Such is the power of comic book movies. If you think, with Christopher Nolan, you saw the darkest version of the Batman universe you’d ever really get, think again. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel. ",POSITIVE

"Sep 11, 2019"," One of the most talked-about films of 2019 is Joker. The film held its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and was met by rave reviews and an 8-minute standing ovation. This is usually a great sign. However, it is not uncommon for a film to experience this type of reaction at film festivals. Still, Joker was on very high on my list of most anticipated films, and my level of excitement only grew stronger after hearing the early buzz out of Venice. Shortly after winning the Golden Lion award, Joker made its way to the Toronto International Film Festival, where I was lucky enough to see the film. I am happy to report my sky-high expectations were not only met, they were exceeded. Joker is a complex character study exploring mental illness in a gritty, and honest way. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a man suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness while attempting to live a healthy life. Arthur lives with his sick mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in a poverty-stricken neighborhood in Gotham City. He works as a clown-for-hire, with aspirations of becoming a stand-up comedian. Arthur tries his best to stay happy, but everyday life keeps getting worse. After a series of tragic events, Arthur’s mental health slips even further causing him to lash out and become an unlikely menace to society. I needed a day to process what I watched before feeling comfortable expressing my thoughts on the many themes explored in Joker. The movie tackles several relevant topics such as our failing health care system, negligence from government officials, poverty, gun control, and bullying, among other issues. These themes are looked at in a very dark and depressing manner, and it’s no coincidence they feel similar to the world we currently live in. Major kudos to director Todd Phillips for having the courage to take a beloved comic book villain and create something fresh and new for the character. Before anyone saw the film, Phillips made it clear his take on the Clown Prince of Gotham would be original and not follow any stories from the comics. So, if you are expecting a fun villain origin story, be prepared to instead watch a film unlike any other comic book movie out there. By using a classic comic character like Joker to sell his vision to the general public, Phillips has created a movie the typical comic book fan wouldn’t usually seek out. However, since the Batman villain makes for an excellent way to sell a lot of tickets, I am not sure everyone is ready for what Phillips has brought to life. This is a very deranged movie. It is incredibly violent and uncomfortably realistic, and I was blown away by it. It takes a lot to get me there. Typically, only a handful of films each year truly stand out. Joker is one of those films. Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver have constructed a deeply disturbing film about how society has failed to help those in need. Arthur doesn’t start off as a bad guy but rather a man with a mental health problem that no one cares enough to do anything about. He is constantly picked on and ridiculed when all he wants to do is make people smile. Meanwhile, his psychologist would rather prescribe more medication rather than listen to anything Arthur has to say. As a viewer, you can see Arthur’s descent into madness. He becomes tired of faking happiness when deep down, he isn’t. Phillips and Silver use this film as a way to make a bold statement about our society through the eyes of a fictional character. In one scene, late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) plays a clip of Arthur attempting stand-up comedy. While live on air, Murray openly pokes fun at Arthur. As a culture, we often mock others (online, especially) and show little to no remorse for our actions. As a society, we have a real lack of concern for the poor and those with mental health issues. We put our faith in politicians hoping they are going to help us, but their campaigns are often built on lies and false promises. These are sort of things being explored in Joker and the reason why Arthur eventually goes nuts. Other things further add fuel to the fire, but that speaks to other surprises the film has to offer. Joaquin Phoenix‘s performance as Arthur is astonishing. This is the performance of a lifetime that will be near impossible to top in the foreseeable future. If you thought Heath Ledger’s take on the Joker in The Dark Knight was twisted, wait until you see what Phoenix has managed to do with the character. Phoenix has always been a dedicated and talented actor, but his work in Joker takes it to the next level. We have never seen the Joker portrayed like this before. Additionally, Phillips pays homage to an amalgam of films from the 70s and 80s, including Taxi Driver and Network. While watching Joker, one can easily see the love Phillips has for cinema, with an evident yearning to make something this daring. That said, even with the apparent influence of Martin Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, and Stanley Kubrick, Phillips never overdoes it. He was determined to create something challenging that could stand out on its own. I feel he delivered. Joker is a flawless masterpiece, as well as a film guaranteed to polarize audiences. While inspired by a comic book character, the film is so much more than a popcorn flick. Joker is a dark and complex exploration of mental illness, led by Phoenix’s phenomenal performance, which elevates the film to the next level.",POSITIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," TORONTO – At this point, avoiding the talk around Todd Phillips’ film JOKER is next to impossible. The film’s cynical outlook has been divisive among those who have seen the film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the deranged DC supervillain. At this moment in pop culture, superhero movies are at full-market saturation. They have been able to break free of the template and play in the genre while existing in their own universe. With this success of the R-rated films LOGAN and DEADPOOL, Warner Bros. figured it was time to shoot their shot at a transgressive blockbuster. JOKER only grazes the Batman lore, merely taking inspiration to create a unique portrait.  The film is bound to inspire the wrong type of crowd. Some will see the origin story of the clowned price as a rallying cry for the oppressed and abandoned. But Phillips is holding up a mirror to our society with a cautionary tale. It looks for human decency rather than anarchic wish fulfillment.  Many reveals in the story are inherently simple throwbacks to the grit of Martin Scorsese’s (who serves as executive producer) vision of 1970s New York. Phillips owes a lot to the New Hollywood aesthetic and Christopher Nolan’s DARK KNIGHT trilogy with his slow-burn psychodrama that distracts from his own vision. JOKER dances a high wire act. It validates its existence – one that finds its message of fear and abuse. It’s not a pretty sight to see, but it sure is intriguing.  Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) works for a clown dispensary. He takes odd jobs that require him to spin signs and dance for sick children. Phoenix’s arc plays a gentle naivety before he goes into full-blown deranged. The guy takes beatings on the street more often than he collects a solid paycheck. He keeps a notebook full of his thoughts – or as he calls it, his “joke book.” It’s his way of coping, so he can work the mic at a comedy club.  The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver draws Arthur’s routine like he’s Andy Kaufman dipped in formaldehyde. Their brand of anti humor calls back to the Rick Alverson collaboration, THE COMEDY, about an antisocial aging hipster wandering the streets of New York. It’s morose and played completely straight. You are not really sure if you should be laughing, or if Phillips will diffuse the awkward situation. Arthur is stuck living with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy); then again, Arthur isn’t capable of staying anywhere else without being a danger to himself. The world is cruel, but he certainly doesn’t make things easier on himself, laughing into oblivion in the most inappropriate moments. Respite from his psychosis comes in the form of his fandom for Gotham late night host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro), whose schticky lounge act is perfect fodder to play against Arthur’s nihilism. DeNiro sporting a set of pearly veneers and plaid suits goes hand in hand with his role as crazed fanatic Rupert Pupkin in THE KING OF COMEDY.  Arthur just seems to be one of those guys who sit on park benches and talks to pigeons. It’s not until his coworker, Randal (Glenn Fleshler, who joins the ranks of Gotham criminals in note-perfect casting), gives him a snub-nose pistol do his thoughts start to become a reality. He latches onto his neighbor, Sophie (Zazie Beats), and her daughter, obsessing over her every move. She’s underdeveloped, but that’s kind of the point. Arthur places his own expectations on Sophie, working as a comment on the male gaze. This is the type stuff that will have people up in arms, but Phillips wants it that way. Set to a hazy blue color pallet by Lawrence Sher (GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS), Gotham is a waste land for its citizens, who are suffering day in and day out in a purgatory that’s just biding time from one demoralizing life event to the next. Sher’s camera work is cold and distant, while Phillips’ approach is up close and personal.  For a film with an inevitable conclusion, there is a spontaneity to JOKER that exists in a space in Arthur’s mind, where he believes anything can happen. His depiction is a series of white knuckles events. We have known that Phoenix can play this level of crazy, and he finds interesting ticks that foreshadows what card he’s going to play next. However, as brilliant as Phoenix is, there have been iterations of this characterization in his career, such as his role as a maritime pervert in Paul Thomas Anderson’s THE MASTER. JOKER will have people talking; that’s what the film is chasing. As weird as it may seem, it even asks us to be kinder to those in need. It’s about a feeling of dread, impatience, and alienation that breeds fear for weirdos on the street. This isn’t a grand masterpiece of cinema, but Phillips’ film is a profound piece of blockbuster filmmaking. There are much more shocking films that just haven’t received this type of media attention. I challenge you to watch Yorgos Lanthimos’ DOGTOOTH, or Lars Von Trier’s ANTICHRIST; but then again, maybe it would be dangerous for these pieces of media to breakthrough to the mainstream. Who’s to say? Certainly not me.  It will be an ongoing battle to see where this film will fall. It’s a story that plays with dualities. Some viewers will either be around long enough to be a warning for the insanity around us or be a part of a special group of morons online (probably the same group who threatened Rian Johnson) and will weaponize Arthur’s story. Either way, this movie exists. And as cheesy as it sounds, it belongs to us now. It is our job to know how to utilize it for the greater good.  JOKER premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. An encore screening will be held on September 13. Visit tiff.net for more information. Warner Bros. Pictures will release the film nationwide on October 4.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," Editor’s Note: Vanyaland’s Nick Johnston is north of the border all week long for the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival; click here for our continued coverage from the fest and also check out our full TIFF archives of past coverage. Well, friends, it’s here: After steam-rolling all opposition in its path to the screen, Todd Phillips’ Joker is finally about to hit screens nationwide October 4. It stunned critics and Film Twitter figures when it took home the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival this year (from a jury led by Lucrecia Martel, of all people), and has inspired its fair share of controversy in the lead up to its release, with plenty of panic about what people might do upon its release, or how it might be interpreted by different audiences. These histrionics were, of course, undeserved, as Joker really isn’t concerned with whether or not We Live in a Society as much as it is interested in seeming like it is. But that’s not to say it isn’t without merit, either: Joaquin Phoenix’s much-heralded turn as the Clown Prince of Crime is more than worth a watch, and you might be surprised by how much you’re sucked in to this very weird and interesting jumble of influences and ideas.  Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a nobody rent-a-clown who we witness being assaulted by a group of kids in the very first scene we see him in, to which his co-workers respond to by giving him a pistol to protect himself with on the streets. He’s unstable, held together by an increasing number of antipsychotics and what very limited social resources the slowly-going-bankrupt Gotham City of 1981 has to offer him. His social worker is indifferent to his plight, though not because she doesn’t care: She just doesn’t have the capacity to help him. His meager earnings support him and his mother (Francis Conroy), and the only outlet he has is a journal/joke book that his social worker demands that he write in each day. He wants to be a comedian like his idol, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), whose talk show he watches eagerly every night, and Arthur dreams of potentially meeting him one day (sound familiar?). He has a slight crush on Sophie (Zazie Beetz), one of his neighbors in the run-down apartment complex he lives in, but he can’t bring himself to talk to her.  One day, everything changes. After getting fired from his job for taking said pistol to a hospital where he’s performing, he’s assaulted by three finance bros on the Subway coming home from work. Arthur murders the first two men in self-defense, but he unloads on the final man when the banker tries to run away; and the “clown killer” starts to become a symbol of resistance to the downtrodden men and women of the city. Mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) openly expresses his disdain towards the peasant revolt on a TV program that Arthur watches, and it’s then that he discovers that his mother has been secretly keeping information from him about her time as a housekeeper at Wayne Manor. This, combined with his newfound notoriety, transforms him into a monster, whose growing insanity and hyper-emotional nature threaten all those around him.  At every point, Phillips feints at meaning, clothing his story in provocative imagery that demands analysis, only for all of it to dissipate like cotton candy on the tongue. The script is as dumb as Moore’s for The Killing Joke is smart, and if you’re looking for the Joker to say the word “society” at some point, you won’t be disappointed. It is a hard thing to make a Pointed Satire that is intended to be all things for all people, but I necessarily wouldn’t chalk that up to “cowardice,” as others have. This was always going to be an inherently compromised film, given its origins within the studio system, involving properties worth more to shareholders than most of their families. Phillips eagerly wants to thumb his nose at respectability, to stress the tWiStEd import of his work, and some moments work better than others in their context. But slightly suggesting that the Joker might be somewhat like an incel or that the throng of goons that he inspires might be like anti-fascists, or that some element of racist resentment might motivate Arthur early on (most of the Governmental authority figures in the film are played by African-Americans, and a group of Latino kids beat him at the start of the film) isn’t the same as exploring these concepts in depth. The mere presence of these ideas seems to be consuming others and inspiring some measure of vitriol, and it feels like a massive overreaction to suggest that this might be “dangerous” art.  Still, there’s plenty about Joker that makes it always compelling and watchable. One aspect of its engaging ways is Phillips’ aesthetic, which, when liberated from its constant Scorsese and Friedkin quoting, makes it one of the more vivid and interesting portrayals of the urban grime of Gotham on screen. There’s little of the empty modern stillness that defines Nolan’s take on the franchise to be found here, and the hyper-stylization of the Burton films is occasionally echoed, but the street-level perspective keeps our heads out of the gargoyles. I’m assuming that the director, the cinematographer, and his production design team crafted a look-book style bible that was pulled from the era’s gritty photography, and they’re often right on the money with its portrayal, though that can occasionally lean a bit too heavily into fetishism. Scenes on the subway echo Bruce Davidson’s documents of urban life in the rough-and-tumble New York ‘80s, especially when things get rough (like in the second photo out of this link), and the vivid, crafted look of the studio talk show that De Niro’s character hosts. But where Phillips’ approach really shines is when he starts to quote comics from the same era, such as one shot in the studio’s control room near the end of the film that evokes Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returnsin a very blunt and fascinating way.  Then there’s Phoenix, whose work here is often stunning, no matter how dire the material his script gives him gets. His quiet affect is undeniably creepy, especially when Phillips just lets him go to work, free of the blaring, overcompensating score (seriously, I hate the fucking music in this movie, and I wish that they’d just release a version that only keeps in the needle-drops and the diagetic sound), like when we see Arthur sitting in a crowd at a comedy club, taking notes, laughing off-cue and looking around at his fellow audience members in a kind of awkward confusion at what’s making them chuckle. The ceaseless nervous laughter that Arthur can only rarely control in stressful situations is a heaving, painful expression of pressure and grief, and the different laughs he uses over the course of the film are very interesting in their contexts. His skinny, frail body — the antithesis of his beefy appearance in Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here, a film that is constantly echoed by Phillips’ work, perhaps indirectly — is by far the biggest addition he’s made to the character’s portrayals over the decade, and Phillips’ camera is in love with him, capturing each moment in the awkward Qigong-like dancing he does to remain sane, gorgeously ugly in a captivating way. When Arthur finally embraces his worst impulses, Phoenix channels a version of the comic character that feels both classic and fresh, ripped straight from the comics yet at odds with its origins in a deeply cinematic fashion. So, will you enjoy Joker? I enjoyed my time with it for the most part, despite Phillips’ worst instincts often defining much more of the film than I would have liked. If you’re the kind of person who pulls for a corporate conglomerate like a horse you’ve put ten grand on at the track, Phillips’ movie will probably sate your desire for an ambitious-seeming comic book-movie that is most definitely different than whatever Marvel is putting out at the moment. If you’re going into this expecting to hate it based on pre-release word, or are looking for tangents and threads to tease out for your Twitter followers, you won’t be disappointed and you’ll have much to tear into in the weeks and months to come. But is this movie really deserving of all of the trouble, all of the stress, that will come in its wake? Not really. ",POSITIVE
"Sep 11, 2019","As Hannah Arendt saw banality in the supposed evil of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann, I see in Joker an attempt to elevate nerdy revenge to the plane of myth. That's scary on a lot of different levels.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 11, 2019"," Tapping into the political and ideological divides that are seemingly tearing the world apart, Phillips’ film shows that ”Jokers” are already walking among us.  They are the mass shooters who walk into schools with automatic rifles, the individuals online who fan the flames of controversy for fame, and the sexually repressed men who claim to be the forgotten despite living a life of privilege. Of course, this does not let Phillps’ film off the hook either.  In using mental health issues as a key element of the psychopath’s origin, Joker inadvertently swims in the same unhealthy messaging that it claims to be making a statement about.  Phillips uses mental health as a catch all, downplaying the fact that Arthur always has a choice.  For all its dark and disturbing moments, the film still plays into that “lone wolf” and “good boy who is just a bit weird” narratives that the media often uses to justify white perpetrators of violence, but rarely affords to minorities in the same circumstance.  A visually captivating film, where Gotham is both luminous and grimy with equal measure, Phillips paints a vibrant cinematic portrait of a world falling apart at the seams.  While the cracks in society have been building for years, it is Phoenix’s phenomenal performance as Arthur that provides the sledgehammer that makes the structure tumble.  Phoenix brings a disturbing mixture of sadness and insanity to the role.  Like a ballerina dancing on a stage of rubble, his Joker is gracefully sinister. A narcissist who cares little for the anarchy he creates but takes in pride in the fame that comes with it. Great review. You are my new go to reviewer. You handled the pros and cons so well without killing the future experience for me, whether good or bad. Thank you for being a straight up reviewer! The one thing that bugged me though… while I understand why’d you say that it downplays that he always has a choice… the thing is, severely ill people like this don’t have a choice, at least not one based on any sort of logic/understanding of society/reality. If they are psychotically delusional, they are completely separated from reality, and often paranoid . I say this from past personal experience. Unfortunate people suffering like this don’t really have a choice, in the sense that, if they are delusional, then they are acting on beliefs that couldn’t be more detached from reality, the choices they do have are all based on said delusions – one example that is very common among people with bipolar is that they honestly believe they are some sort of messiah or god. I know that when I was in this state, I honestly believed I was a messiah of some kind and acted accordingly. Luckily I don’t have violent tendencies and nothing bad happened but it still scared the shit out of my parents. Other people I have spoke to about similar issues though did become violent when they become manic. Anyways, sorry for the wall of text, I know I haven’t even seen the movie yet. It was that the one point I ranted about just cos it bugged me a bit. But again, you saw the movie, not me. Other than what I ranted about tho, this review is great and has me more intrigued. I hate superhero movies, but I love The Joker. And I love Phoenix. And I loved the animated episode of Batman that this story is loosely based on. This should be perfect for me! PS – I know that you are super busy, but there will be an email in your inbox within the next few hours regarding a few reviews I’d like to contribute.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," The Pitch: A downtrodden clown/aspiring comedian named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is struggling to survive in the underbelly of early 1980s Gotham City. He’s bullied and eventually fired from his day job at a rent-a-clown agency. His attempts at standup earn laughs and attention for all of the wrong reasons. His barely helpful therapy sessions are cut off due to a lack of funding (and his access to medication disappears along with them). He cares for his ailing mother in the derelict apartment they share. He spends what little free time he has watching and indulging in deluded daydreams about TV show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). From this unenviable starting point, Fleck’s life descends into further chaos and tragedy. In response, he begins to embody a villain known only as Joker. Sure, Joker is another comic book film in an era riddled with comic book movies, but it’s ostensibly different for two major reasons: 01.) It’s a standalone piece that has its general references to greater Batman lore and hallmarks, but no direct narrative or aesthetic connection to any other franchises going on at the moment. 02.) It’s dark. Yes, in theory even darker than those other “dark” films that featured Batman, Joker, and company and used comic archetypes as a means to explore deeper and not entirely pretty aspects of the human condition. The Dark Phoenix: Neither Todd Phillips’ hollow script nor his hey-check-this-shit-out direction offer much to work with, but Phoenix still manages to wring enough out of Fleck to make Joker almost work as a character study. It is by no means a subtle performance. The star’s unselfconscious and unrestrained inhabitation of Fleck’s brain and body is every bit as over-the-top, garish, and abrasive as everything else about the film. But it also happens to be pretty intriguing. While he’s no Mark Hamill or Cesar Romero, Phoenix manages to breathe strange new life into a character that’s been picked apart, recreated, and mythologized beyond any possible need. (Whether or not this turn was worth the already overly mythologized weight loss, angst, and suffering that the actor put into it is another discussion entirely.) The Rest of It, Though… Joker certainly carries itself like a film that is saying — or screaming — something smart and possibly important. The close-ups of Fleck’s therapy journal, which is loaded with half-workshopped jokes, magazine cut-outs, and cartoonishly rendered reflections about mental illness certainly suggest that we’re supposed to take something out of these observations. The plot seems to want to say something about fanaticism, fame, wealth inequality, and the way we treat The Other in our society. But underneath Joker’s provocative surface there’s nothing there. Fleck’s observations are juvenile, but never really explored as such in the context of the film. The rest of its themes are even less examined. And the Joker’s big, declarative moment at the climax of the film is just embarrassing. On Ableism: It’s highly unlikely that anyone involved in Joker thinks they hate disabled people. It’s doubtful the cast and crew went into the film wanting to make joke and points at their / our expense. It’s also doubtful that anyone who doesn’t experience ableism would even be aware of its presence in the movie. From the neurological condition that Fleck blames for his trademark laugh to the burden his mother’s poor health places on him, though, it’s an integral part of the movie’s plot and presentation. As surely as the screenwriters and Phillips trust the audience to know the beats of Batman’s origin — from Thomas Wayne’s first appearance to Martha Wayne’s scattering pearls — it expects its viewers will automatically read disability as grotesquery, burden, and comedy. Everything from character development to mood setting to jokes starts to fall apart if you don’t follow along with these assumptions. (I’m not going to tell anyone how to feel about this from a moral perspective, but at least consider it from an aesthetic one. Joker is a film that attempts to tackle the preconceived notions that society has about outsiders that hasn’t even bothered to examine its own potential preconceived notions about people who might be othered in some way. That’s just lazy, empty posturing.) Joker/Scorsese Crossover AU: At a time where existing pop culture properties — particularly comics — have become source material for almost every other work of art, Joker arguably deserves credit for breaking the mold in its own way. Sure, it’s still a comic book film, but it’s its own bonkers creature who has decided to absorb a bunch of Martin Scorsese, particularly Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, into its DNA like Seth Brundle hopping into a telepod with a fly. The amount of praise that Phillips is receiving for his vision, though, even among critics and fans who don’t necessarily think the film is good, might say some interesting things about about where we draw the lines between artists and fandom, though. There’s probably a lot of fanfiction out there that’s far more innovative, provocative, profane, incisive, fucked up, and effective than Joker.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," If you’d bet on Todd Phillips ever winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, you’d have made lots of money. If you’d bet on Todd Phillips winning the Golden Lion for Joker, you’d now be Bruce Wayne. And Arthur Fleck – soon to be the Joker – wouldn’t like that very much. Joaquin Phoenix plays the wannabe stand-up comic in this origin story of the most iconic villain in the superhero world. Predictably Fleck serves as the heart and soul, which attempts to be a thorough study of how someone can grow (or sink) to become Gotham City’s greatest cosplaying criminal menace. This psychopath origin story structure is one of the numerous ways Joker tries to invoke the films of Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached to the project as a producer. But only in style is it at all a resemblance of the work of Scorsese. Robert DeNiro plays the supporting role of Murray Franklin, an untrustworthy talk show host in the vein of Jerry Langford, the TV comedian played by Jerry Lewis in Scorsese’s King of Comedy. Fleck is this story’s Rupert Pupkin, blurring the lines between fact and fiction with and without his express intent. The setting of Joker is extremely Scorsese-an, too. Gotham in this era closely resembles a 1970s New York City, undergoing the traumatic process of transition from the great city of postwar opportunity to a declining, dirty shell of its former self. It’s Mad Men to Network within the blink of an eye, and Fleck is on the wrong side of that new divide. Incidentally Phoenix is hugely impressive in the part, a slight leading man whose bones stick out of his body like the criminal underworld tries to grow out of Gotham City. Unfortunately, though, Phoenix is the only one given much interesting work to do. Zazie Beetz is especially wasted as Fleck’s neighbour Sophie, and DeNiro’s character shows initial promise but doesn’t quite deliver. Nonetheless, Todd Phillips seems to know this is his audition as a serious filmmaker – and he passes it. The film looks tremendous for long periods, creating a dystopian period setting more coherent than anything we’ve seen from a comic book adaptation since Christopher Nolan wrestled with the Batman universe. But beyond appearances, the film falls apart. After the film’s midpoint everything becomes a bit disjointed and incoherent, which presumably a nod to an increasingly delusional protagonist. That might make for some interesting poetic irony, but it doesn’t make for a good film, not least at a time when a set of stable principles could carry more value than ever. This is where Joker suffers most – and inflicts most on its audience. It’s industrial-size nihilism masquerading as a social critique of that very nihilism. Joker, like its subject, isn’t for or against anything. It pits complacent and manipulative cultural elites against a horde of psychopath clowns, and tells us to pick the best of those two evils. That might be Phillips’ best effort to make Joker topical, but it doesn’t make it any less unpleasant to watch, especially in those latter phases. Nolan’s Batman films succeeded because they used the Michael Mann hallmark of the big city crime underworld as a setting, but Phillips uses the early career of Martin Scorsese as a stencil. No Scorsese film suffers from the disjointedness that mars much of Joker, and the nihilism that underlines the film’s moral perspective – and therefore a lack thereof – would not ever be allowed by a filmmaker whose work is consistently interested in ethics. Advocates of Joker might argue that those sorts of criticisms were leveled at Scorsese’s films when they were first released, and this might just age as well as they have. But that presupposes the same indifference in right and wrong that exists here, which Scorsese has always held as a central theme – even if his characters haven’t. Joker isn’t flawed because it’s about bad people; it’s flawed because it indulges in the nothingness of its central characters to such an extent that it sinks to become an extravaganza of directionless violence. Albeit aesthetically brilliant and well-acted violence, mind you.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 11, 2019"," At this point, it’s hard to ignore the political discourse surrounding Joker. Each time the film is screened, there’s a new wave of online reactions which reignite the discussion surrounding the film, its messaging and the (speculated upon) real world implications. Upon seeing the film, it’s not difficult to understand both the concerned hand-wringing, as well as calls for even-tempered, less reactionary responses. At the center of this debate, there is a film to be reviewed. There is also an undeniable seepage into real world affairs, which cannot be discounted. And so: a review in two parts. Joker is a standalone crime drama directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover franchise), who also co-wrote the script with Scott Silver. The film is technically set within the DCEU universe and tells an original story of the titular character, while also briefly featuring other canonical characters such as Thomas (Brett Cullen) and Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson) Wayne. The reality is that the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) could just as easily be about any put-upon loser who turns to crime and violence as a coping mechanism in retaliation for his perceived injustices. You see, Arthur has a terrible life. Not only does he live in a literal garbage universe (Gotham is caught in an ongoing garbage strike), but his existence is a series of unfortunate events. As the film opens, he is beaten and robbed by a group of kids. He suffers from brain damage or neurological problems that cause him to laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately and he has a history of being institutionalized. He is living in poverty with his shut-in mother, Penny (Frances Conroy in a nothing role) and his mandatory meetings with social services and access to drugs is being eliminated due to city cuts. In addition to a burgeoning flirtation with neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), Arthur’s sole highlight is watching his role-model/father figure, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) yuck it up as a Johnny Carson style late night comedy host. Overall, though, Arthur has an unabashedly terrible life. Phillips and Silver are content to pile up the tragedies one on top of the other, repeatedly undercutting any hope and leaning into the futility of Arthur’s struggle to find something to be happy and smile about. This frequently makes the events of the film feel inevitable and few – if any – of the developments are surprising. It hardly matters if the audience is aware of the Joker’s origin story or not because there is only one way that this tale can end. This, unfortunately, robs the film of most of its tension and rising action. At two hours run time, there are more than a few points where Joker can feel like a slog. Aesthetically, the film is awash in a muted color scheme that clearly evokes Arthur’s mental state. Aside from the sterile blues of the hospital and Arkham Asylum, nearly all of the interiors are mustard yellow or spearmint green, which – coupled with fluorescent lighting – casts everything in a dour, sickly vibe. Phillips’ camera, meanwhile, is restless, frequently circling or roaming around Phoenix, or tracking alongside or behind him when he runs. As for the star of the show, this is undoubtedly Phoenix’s movie and there is no denying that he is remarkable in it. More than anything, it’s a surprisingly physical role: Arthur has a way of moving and dancing that is almost lyrical in its gumby-limbed contortion. While the uncontrolled laughter is a tic that the screenwriters rely on too heavily, Phoenix’s dedication to the bit and his decision to infuse it with a kind of hyena cackle is suitably unnerving. It’s not hard to see why playing the character had a transformative effect on the actor (literally, in the case of his weight loss, which Phillips’ shoots frequently and in an uncomfortably fetishistic fashion). Were that the character had as much depth as Phoenix had dedication, Joker would be a stronger film. Arthur, ultimately, is a fairly hollow cipher: he’s less of a fully realized character than a stand-in for a variety of modern day social ills (despite the fact that the film is set in the early 80s). Considering that the other characters are even less developed, existing principally to circle Arthur’s orbit, Joker’s success ultimately boils down to its theme, which is where the real world begins to intersect with the fictional text. As previously mentioned, it is almost impossible to discuss the film outside of the context in which it was made and is being released. As I mentioned in my review for Blood Quantum, art is not created in a vacuum and while films can certainly be consumed on their own, the reality is that they reflect or comment on the filmmaker, the audience and/or society at large. Watching Joker, it is impossible not to see the real world parallels. This is a film about a loner who is medicated and has a history of abuse. He feels invisible; he is mocked and disparaged by those around him. He is vulnerable and preyed upon, and he ultimately resorts to violence without remorse because he feels wronged and owed. These are the kinds of justifications that have been propagated in manifestos and on the web by alt-right groups and by incels; we see it linked to individuals who commit domestic terrorism because they hate women, or minorities, or immigrants. Joker can be read as a satire of these kinds of people. It can be read as a commentary of the kinds of systems (political, social, financial) that give rise to these destructive behaviors. But it is difficult to dismiss claims that Phillips and Silver are condoning this behavior. The way that Joker is venerated very early in the film and ultimately becomes a symbol of rebellion against the rich and the police is telling (despite his protestations that he is apolitical and has no capacity to lead a movement). Add to this, the way that Phillips shoots these developments lovingly and in slow-motion. There is an intimacy that could be mistaken for complicity in Joker’s anarchy, especially in the on-the-nose song choices and most especially in the final scenes of chaos on Gotham’s streets. These are the instances where Joker feels specifically shot with movie posters, GIFs and memes in mind, as though Phillips is celebrating the “burn it all down” mentality of his anti-hero protagonist. At the end of the day, Phillips, Silver, and DC are not responsible for the way that Joker is received, nor can they control particular groups who may appropriate the film or character for less than altruistic purposes. This does not, however, negate responses from individuals who are worried that there will be people who “misinterpret” the film and or that the film is already being “weaponized” by men who see themselves reflected in the Joker’s experience (see also: the strange fact that the number of Letterboxd reviews currently exceeds the number of people who could have feasibly seen the film). Calls for boycotts or hand-wringing, however, are useless. This kind of response merely contributes to the film’s already sensational narrative; regardless of what happens between now and October, the film will be released and it will undoubtedly make tons of money. At the end of the day, Joker is a standalone crime drama about an established DC property that could secure a variety of awards attention, particularly for Phoenix. It is also simultaneously a cultural touchstone – an opportunity for dialogue about the implications and the reception of films. If nothing else, the film provides an opportunity for education about why these issues are important. Joe is a TV addict with a background in Film Studies. He co-created TV/Film Fest blog QueerHorrorMovies and writes for Bloody Disgusting, Anatomy of a Scream, That Shelf, The Spool and Grim Magazine. He enjoys graphic novels, dark beer and plays multiple sports (adequately, never exceptionally). While he loves all horror, if given a choice, Joe always opts for slashers and creature features. Officially announced by Blumhouse and Lionsgate earlier this month, a reboot of The Blair Witch Project is currently in the works, which will be the third follow-up to the original found footage horror classic that changed the game back in 1999. In the wake of the announcement, the original creators and stars have each issued joint statements this weekend. The Blair Witch Project was created by filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez – along with Haxan Films creative partners Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello – back in the 1990s, with stars Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard heading out into the woods of Maryland to conjure up horror magic together. The actors largely improvised their performances and even used their real names in the movie, with the film’s clever viral marketing campaign leading many to believe that they weren’t actually actors in a movie, but rather real people who truly went missing out in the woods. All this to say, Donahue, Williams and Leonard are collectively a huge part of why The Blair Witch Project became a pop culture phenomenon, and all these years later they’re looking for some recognition from Lionsgate, the current rights holders of the iconic property. As Joshua Leonard first explained in a Facebook post on April 11, “I’m so proud of our little punk-rock movie, and I LOVE the fans who keep the flames burning. But at this point, it’s 25 years of disrespect from the folks who’ve pocketed the lion’s share (pun intended) of the profits from OUR work, and that feels both icky and classless.” 1. Retroactive + future residual payments to Heather, Michael and Josh for acting services rendered in the original BWP, equivalent to the sum that would’ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made. 2. Meaningful consultation on any future Blair Witch reboot, sequel, prequel, toy, game, ride, escape room, etc… , in which one could reasonably assume that Heather, Michael & Josh’s names and/or likenesses will be associated for promotional purposes in the public sphere. Note: Our film has now been rebooted twice, both times were a disappointment from a fan/box office/critical perspective. Neither of these films were made with significant creative input from the original team. As the insiders who created the Blair Witch and have been listening to what fans love & want for 25 years, we’re your single greatest, yet thus-far unutilized secret-weapon! 3. “The Blair Witch Grant”: A 60k grant (the budget of our original movie), paid out yearly by Lionsgate, to an unknown/aspiring genre filmmaker to assist in making their first feature film. This is a GRANT, not a development fund, hence Lionsgate will not own any of the underlying rights to the project. “As we near the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, our pride in the storyworld we created and the film we produced is reaffirmed by the recent announcement of a reboot by horror icons Jason Blum and James Wan. “While we, the original filmmakers, respect Lionsgate’s right to monetize the intellectual property as it sees fit, we must highlight the significant contributions of the original cast — Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. As the literal faces of what has become a franchise, their likenesses, voices, and real names are inseparably tied to The Blair Witch Project. Their unique contributions not only defined the film’s authenticity but continue to resonate with audiences around the world. If you’d like to support the cause, sharing and amplifying is the way to go. You’ll find the original post for Heather, Michael and Josh’s statement below, which can be shared to your feed.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 11, 2019"," The actor finds real pathos in the confused, tragic arc of an aspiring Gotham City comedian whose miserable life sets him on a path to becoming Batman’s greatest nemesis. And director Phillips, who co-wrote and co-produced Joker, spends long stretches of his movie just standing in awe of his star. Or possibly he was admiring the sets and the lighting package. I can’t really be sure. So much of Joker is a wallow in artifice. It brings nothing to our understanding of the character that wasn’t already offered in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, which synthesized decades of comics mythology into Heath Ledger’s nihilistic shell. This film gives him a name (Arthur Fleck), a day job (clown) and a few other personality tics, and then does almost nothing with them, as Phoenix stalks through a grimy Gotham playing with makeup and seething with violence. He admires a talk-show host (Robert De Niro, playing the Jerry Lewis role from The King Of Comedy, in case younger viewers might miss the Scorsese references on which Phillips has built his church). He stalks a woman (Zazie Beetz), or maybe he doesn’t. And he really hates this rich guy named Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Phoenix keeps it going for a little while, and there’s a point where the movie looks like it might address the appeal of The Joker as an incel icon he takes what he wants, laughs at authority and has hundreds of acolytes hanging on his every word, of course they’d identify with him. But Phillips is happy to just float it briefly, the same way he sorta-kinda suggests an endless class war in Gotham without ever really delving into the reasons the system is failing. He wants to make an elevated comic-book movie, and Warner Bros. clearly wants that too, but that’s not what they got.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2019"," Batman’s nemesis, the Joker, is uniquely chilling among supervillains for one very specific reason: He’s never had a definitive origin story. Since his creation in 1940, the Joker has simply been the personification of evil, reinterpreted by various writers to fit the story they want to tell on the page or screen.  The Joker’s seeming randomness, his refusal to be limited by any moral code or any whiff of history, is scary as hell. He’s what humans have always feared and fought: evidence of an uncaring universe, one that strikes at random. And personifications of inexplicable, snickering evil have shown up throughout human history, from folklore and legend all the way to characters like No Country for Old Men’s Anton Chigurh, who stalks around with a captive bolt stunner randomly killing people based on the flip of a coin.  Like his brethren, the Joker can and will strike without warning, and for him it’s just a game, a bit. He doesn’t believe in anything. He doesn’t want anything more than to watch people suffer. He wants to burn the world and dance in the ruins. So to give the Joker a motivation, a backstory, is to ascribe logic to evil and play with fire. And to do so in a world where the Joker’s own motivations for what he does manifest every day through “jokes” — like trolling to spread hateful ideologies and shit-posting mimicked in mass-shooter manifestoes — is a way to explain the world we live in. Which brings us to Joker, a gritty reimagining of the Joker’s early days directed and co-written by Todd Phillips, who’s spent his career bringing a particular breed of pleasure-obsessed American masculinity to the big screen with successful, unforgettable side-splitters like Old School and the Hangover trilogy. Joker is no comedy. But it’s on a continuum with Phillips’s themes, and it shows his directorial chops; it’s a well-crafted movie.  Meanwhile, the film has courted controversy even before its release, touting its “hard-R rating” (even though there’s no such thing) relative to the average superhero film. An early version of the script “leaked,” followed by stories about it being continuously rewritten during production, perhaps a sign that it was too edgy for the studio. Early reviews from its Venice Film Festival premiere worried that it was a “toxic rallying cry for incels”; it won the festival’s top prize. Turns out that was all smoke and mirrors. Joker is a well-made movie, with a killer performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who seems born to play the role. But there’s nothing “bonkers” about it. It has nothing to say about the Joker himself or what he represents, or even about the world in which his brand of evil exists. Go ahead and crack open the movie. It’s hollow to the core. Joker most strongly evokes two Scorsese films, both about unhinged men and both starring Robert De Niro: Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). Like much of Scorsese’s work, those two films indelibly imprinted cinema with a particular image of New York City: dirty, dangerous, with a very thin veneer of civilization that’s ready to crack at any moment. Phillips apes that look competently and suffuses it in garish fluorescent lights and eerie greenish glows.  Joker is roughly set right between those two films, in a Gotham City modeled on New York around 1981, judging from movie posters that appear in the background. There’s a sanitation strike on, and the sidewalks are piling high with garbage (and if you’ve ever been in New York on particular pungent nights, you can practically smell them). Rats and super-rats are taking over. Tensions are running high. In the middle of this world lives Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), who works as a clown and suffers from a neurological condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably when he doesn’t want to be laughing at all. He lives with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in a dimly lit apartment building where the elevator doesn’t work, meets regularly with his social worker, and takes a lot of medication.  Arthur and Penny spend their nights watching a late-night comedy hour hosted by an old-school comedian, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). It’s the most obvious Scorsese quote in Joker, made explicit by De Niro’s casting. In The King of Comedy, De Niro plays an aspiring but untalented stand-up comedian named Rupert Pupkin who idolizes a late-night TV host, scheming and dreaming of being put on his show, and eventually kidnaps him in order to make it happen. Joker flips the script, with De Niro playing the comedian whom Arthur, an aspiring stand-up, idolizes. Arthur pretends to be on Franklin’s show in his living room.  But where The King of Comedy was about how TV turns its most devoted viewers into delusional seekers of the spotlight — and in the end, Pupkin’s buoyancy worked out for him — Joker has darker designs for Arthur. For most of its two-hour runtime, Joker is a parade of humiliation for him. He is beaten up several times by packs of roving punks. His uncontrollable laughter makes him a figure of scorn and disgust. The other guys at work make fun of him. His social worker can barely conceal her distaste for him, which doesn’t much matter anyway since the department is being eliminated by the beleaguered city. He bombs exquisitely at stand-up, then finds himself the nationwide object of ridicule. The only person who doesn’t despise Arthur is his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz). But what counts as kindness to Arthur is a few words of small talk in an elevator and a smile. No wonder, Joker suggests, that he eventually cracks. Following the film’s North American premiere in Toronto, Phillips said he wrote Joker for Phoenix even before the two knew each other, which seems obvious from the start. Bony, lanky, with a cavernous mouth that releases roars of laughter as his eyes telegraph humiliation and defeat, Phoenix imbues Arthur with a sense of menace even when he’s at his most helpless. His performance is reason enough to see the movie. And yet. The notion that Arthur’s villainy essentially stems from his untended mental illness is troubling enough; evil (and mass shootings) having often been ascribed to pathologies. But what’s even more disconcerting is what Joker’s story suggests about the society into which the movie debuts. Joker rewrites the backstory of one of comics’ most infamous villains to be one of humiliation and scorn; essentially, the movie says, he is bullied into mass murder, beset by a merciless society that he must eventually rally against. And there’s a larger context for that, in Gotham City. As Arthur struggles with his demons, an uprising is fomenting, with a revolt seemingly inevitable. For most of the movie, we only hear about it in news reports — an “anti-wealthy” movement, one that eventually takes Arthur as its figurehead and Thomas Wayne, the wealthy mogul whose son will one day be the Joker’s arch-nemesis, as the face of its enemy.  Yet it’s not Arthur they idealize, nor his true self they seek to emulate. Actually, everyone hates Arthur. He’s beaten up by a street gang and a trio of Wall Street scum bros, taunted by talk show hosts and random bystanders. That he’s co-opted by a band of people who want to rally around his likeness without knowing who their leader even is seems like a perfect final mixture of triumph and indignity. He’s only good to them for what he represents. And the movie doesn’t seem gutsy enough to try to draw out that tension. Instead, once Joker starts barreling toward its conclusion, Arthur snaps, turning into an angry guy with a gun and violent disregard for everyone. The world is against him, and by extension his would-be followers. The world deserves what they’re about to get, whether at his hands or the hands of all the other angry, rioting downtrodden in Gotham City.  Which turns a supervillain into a kind of folk hero. The personification of evil, in Joker, is now just the flip side of the same morality coin. Certainly, Batman and the Joker have always been presented as yin and yang, order and chaos, protector and predator. But the terror of the Joker is curiously defanged in the film. It doesn’t seem convinced those categories of good and evil, order and chaos exist. Like the Joker himself, it believes in nothing. Though Joker boasts Phoenix’s finely layered performance, it contains nothing as quote-unquote “bonkers” as, say, Sandra Bernhard’s absolutely deranged performance in The King of Comedy. There is nothing unpredictable about Joker, nothing we haven’t seen before, no revelations that shift how we see the world or the story. For a movie that clearly prides itself on its edginess, it is weirdly inert and stolid. I think the Joker — and the legions of readers, audiences, and fans who have found him so spine-chilling from the start — deserved for this stand-alone origin story to have a bigger imagination and a more instinctive sense of what makes him an icon of evil. You can find much scarier, more shocking stuff by casually surfing websites or reading the news. Joker is a tightly directed mood piece with an unforgettable performance at its center, but it’s not much more than a mask, with nothing but banality behind. Joker premiered at the Venice Film Festival and played at the Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. It opens in theaters on October 4.

"Sep 10, 2019"," One of the more fiendishly clever choices Christopher Nolan made in his magisterial middle Batman movie, The Dark Knight, was to clown on the very idea of “motivation.” Heath Ledger’s unforgettable version of The Joker, a prowling nihilistic terrorist in rotting makeup, kept offering different explanations for the grotesque scar-tissue grin cut across his face—and it’s only on the second time around, when his story changes completely, that we realize he’s improvising, not unburdening. Nolan may have lifted the idea from Alan Moore’s seminal The Killing Joke, which cooked up a tragic backstory for the Clown Prince Of Crime, then hedged it with a wink: “If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it be multiple choice,” the villain quipped. But in The Dark Knight, this slipperiness becomes a joke at the expense of origin stories themselves—including, most irreverently, the one Nolan had just told with the previous film in his series. Batman, in this movie world, is a product of trauma and loss, a hero born from his issues. The Joker just is. Todd Phillips’ Joker, an R-rated comic book psychodrama arriving today on a wave of scandal and hype, has other ideas. It plays like a feature-length version of one of those sob-story monologues the Ledger incarnation of the character tosses out before putting a knife in someone’s mouth, except that the irreverent punch line never comes. This Joker, played by Joaquin Phoenix, really is a melancholy misfit, a guy so damaged that his signature cackle is actually involuntary: a Tourette-like response to emotional duress. His sad-clown origin story is so morosely serious that it flirts with self-parody, like Frank Miller doing Pagliacci. The film wouldn’t exist without Nolan’s ambitiously bleak take on the DC universe, yet it makes those operatic caped-crusader adventures look breezy by comparison. And though it chronicles the formative years of a homicidal prankster, Joker is almost entirely humorless. Which might seem surprising, given that it’s been directed by the guy who made the Hangover trilogy and Due Date. To be fair, those movies weren’t funny either. Joker is set in 1981, in a Gotham City as unreal—in its grimy, gritty way—as Tim Burton’s. If the 1989 Batman city-planned from a blueprint of German silent classics, the model this time is the mean streets of a New Hollywood New York, a beautiful reconstruction of a chaotic Nixon-to-Reagan-era metropolis. Our larval-state Joker, meanwhile, is Arthur Fleck, who doesn’t much resemble archenemy material. Like Joe, the hulking vigilante Phoenix played in You Were Never Really Here, Arthur lives with his elderly, ailing mother (Frances Conroy) in a rat-nest apartment. Although he makes ends meet as a rent-a-clown, what he really wants to be is a stand-up comedian. It’s a goal that seems a little out of reach, given his rather crippling mental illness; he’s on seven different medications, none of them much helping. Plus, as his mother asks, “Don’t you have to be funny to do that?” (Okay, there are a few laughs.) Phoenix, that reliably riveting Method changeling, isn’t the first great actor to take on the role of the most iconic bad guy in all of comics. (Ledger’s brainy, menacing interpretation may be the gold standard, though don’t count out the magnificently hammy voice work of Mark Hamill.) But we’ve never seen a Joker quite like this. Early into the film, Arthur sits in the audience of a comedy show, giggling randomly and off-cue at the routine he’s watching (this is his other laugh, a phony high-pitched one he forces out to prove that he gets a joke when he doesn’t), and you realize that this take on the character is a man totally disconnected from the world, doing a very unconvincing imitation of an adjusted person. Almost inhumanly gaunt, skin pulled tightly over the bony ridges of his spine and ribcage, Phoenix offers a theatricality more alien, and more accidental, than the character usually possesses. The film’s most indelible image is the repeated spectacle of him dancing on a staircase or just behind a curtain, jutting and swaying to the private opera or rock concert in his head. How will this meek, broken man become the flamboyant, big-top crime boss to rule them all? The question looms over Joker’s slow-burn character study, which does eventually get around to tying itself into the larger DC mythos, and to linking the title character to his masked adversary, in a way not so different than Burton’s Batman. Mostly, though, Joker feels insulated from franchise master plans—and from the general way superhero pictures, our most dominant big-screen entertainments, tend to operate. There are no bam-pow fisticuffs, and no CGI fireworks either; the only special effect is Phoenix, twisting his limbs and soul into nightmarish new shapes. Phillips builds the whole movie around his powerhouse lead performance. This may be the first ripped-from-the-comics spectacle that’s also, essentially, a one-man show. Yet for all its novelty and craft, Joker is more of a stylish stunt than anything else. It pantomimes ’70s grit, wearing it like an extravagant vintage suit. Phillips, one-time frat-comedy specialist, aped Martin Scorsese’s style in his last movie, War Dogs. This time, he’s performing something closer to a ritualistic tribute. How else does one account for the casting of the Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, Arthur’s talk-show host hero—a role that’s basically a mirror reflection of the one De Niro played against in The King Of Comedy? Or the moment when Phillips films Phoenix from behind as he staggers down a sidewalk, and we can see in the actor’s gait the unmistakable phantom of Travis Bickle, that seething rat in the big-city cage? Look, even, at Arthur’s meet-cute with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), the single mother who lives down the hall and offers him a faint chance at real connection; it hinges on the finger-gun-to-temple gesture from Taxi Driver. Phillips skillfully mimics the look and vibe of these classics of alienation, but he doesn’t really key into their insight, their personality, their worldview. He’s made a dorm-room homage, a comic-con cosplay of Marty’s best. Joker, which inevitably earns the MPAA rating it courted, is very much a story of self-actualization through violence. That lends it a certain, undeniable topicality; maybe that’s what the jury at Venice, who handed the film the coveted Golden Lion, saw in it: a cracked-mirror reflection of the hostility and resentment that colors so much American horror, the massacres committed by armed young men. Phillips and his co-writer, Scott Silver, are making a valid point about the way our culture ignores mental illness and those living with it. (It’s after Gotham cuts social services, severing Arthur’s access to medication and counseling, that things get bloody.) But there’s no denying that by adopting the perspective of its budding killer, Joker risks making his rise to notoriety look triumphant—like a rebirth, the outcast getting over on a world that’s abused and neglected him. By the finale, when Arthur’s cresting madness begins to dovetail with a revolt against the 1% (including a certain familiar, wealthy family), one can at least grasp why the film has some spooked. Of course, real Scorsese movies have been appealing to the “wrong” crowd since Taxi Driver, a film so vivid on the mind of a psychotic wannabe assassin that it spoke deeply to an actual psychotic wannabe assassin. Joker, a bastard offspring whose supposed irresponsibility feels like just another element lifted from Marty’s playbook, deserves to be judged outside of the controversy that’s sprung up around it. Which is to say, the film’s sins are mostly dramatic. It’s striking and almost touchingly well-acted (Phoenix commits inside and out to the role, as he always does), and though its whole style and attitude is borrowed, both almost look distinctive when applied to a genre not exactly filthy with commanding visions, even derivative ones. Yet there’s also, in the end, something disappointingly one-note about Phillips’ portrait of madness and despair in a fictional city that never sleeps. Maybe it’s that Arthur, literally and figuratively beaten into the pavement, never really has a shot; we know from the first moment we see him, tugging his lips into an artificial smile, that he’s lost, and nothing more than a spot in the Gotham rogues’ gallery awaits him. Maybe that other Joker had it right: Origin stories are a joke. CORRECTION: This review previously stated that the man behind the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting “donned the costume of The Joker” a rumor that has since been debunked.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Midway through Joker, Joaquin Phoenix dances as he traipses down a New York staircase, and the soundtrack pounds to “Rock and Roll Part 2,” an anthem played at almost every sports arena for decades. The song’s performer, Gary Glitter, was charged multiple times in the 1980s and ’90s for child porn, abuse, and attempted rape. Beneath the benevolent drum hook beats the heart of a deviant monster.
 As social commentary, Joker’s wild theatrics will certainly divide audiences. Some will champion the movie’s anarchic character and find sympathy in the character’s pain and illness. There’s a scribble in Arthur Fleck’s notebook, wondering why people are surprised that someone who’s mentally ill would behave in ways that are shaped by that illness, and that will be a let-off for the behavior. Others, many without seeing the film, will simply have nothing to do with it, believing that giving voice to this monster is to endorse the evil. On a story level, this is basically the transition from psychopath to sociopath, about a person struggling with his feelings (wrought by abuse and deficiencies) who discovers that he can gain community through his own pain and violence. It’s not a pleasant message, and it questions some fundamental tenets of Liberal humanistic faith, whereby the general goodness of people is supposed to be the curve to which our society is bending. The film is hardly a clarion call to the ignorance and rampage it explores. Joker is of course the hero of his own story, and merely seeing things from his vantage is not an endorsement. To the film’s credit, it draws that line deliberately throughout. We’re made to feel uncomfortable, constantly, with the manifestation of the character’s madness.  The movie makes overt references to antiheroes from Martin Scorsese’s filmography. Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy loom large. The early 1980s setting evokes the darkened underbelly of Reagan’s America, the same rot that gives After Hours its underlying sense of doom. There are also nods to Sidney Lumet’s Network, twisting that film’s anarchic glee to the tyranny of mob violence, shifting allegiances in fascinating ways. Joaquin Phoenix’s physicality is astonishing. His starvation-induced serpentine look is both creepy and anxiety-inducing. His cackling nervous laugh is anything but comedic. He inhabits the role with a bleak darkness, yet somehow feels human throughout. While Heath Ledger’s immense performance in The Dark Knight played Joker as a kind of disruptive force of nature, with neither beginning nor ending but just chaos meant to make orderly things blow up, Phoenix’s character gives us a man whose violence and cries of pain are shared by entire communities. He pits rich against poor and twists the notion of resistance into anarchic calls for revolution and revenge. The Hangover director Todd Phillips may not have been an obvious choice to tackle this material, but he manages to guide the film in surprisingly deft ways. Lawrence Sher’s almost documentary-like cinematography is sublime, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score eschews the Hans Zimmer pomp and sets an unsettling mood without cliché, and Mark Bridges’ costume design is pitch perfect. Joker never loses its contained state of angst. The film never devolves into comic book fare in the traditional, pulpy sense. It’s a taut spring that winds and winds, as unsettling a work as any studio production this year. As a result, it’s sure to be maligned by many, and adored by some who will find solace in their own inadequacies. Whether a movie is to be judged by its worst fans is a conversation for another article, but plenty will be said on that topic that is, at best, unhelpful. Joker is meant to open up discussion, not close it. It’s a challenging, provocative film that’s more than just a grenade lobbed to cause mayhem, but a precise and probing look into the origins of a killer. This is the collision of art house with blockbuster, exactly the kind of movie that people say isn’t, or even can’t be, made any more. The vintage Warner logo evokes that nostalgic feeling, but no film this year will feel more 2019 than this one. Joker is no joke. The film challenges our emotions and prods at some fundamental ideas and biases. It’s a complex tale told with sophistication and nuance, far quieter and more precise than the rhetoric will surely be. Go in with as much of an open mind as possible. Be prepared to be repulsed and drawn in with equal measure, and to see one of the most powerful and provocative films of the year. I don’t really like the idea of a Joker origin story personally.  What makes him a very terrifying villain is that he’s shrouded in mystery, so this takes that away but I’m curious to see it for Phoenix and being well-made anyway. I do like the notion that this isn’t supposed to be the *only* Joker origin story. It’s not part of the Justice League cinematic universe. DC has essentially taken the approach that Joker is an idea. There can be many different, contradictory stories about him. Burton’s Batman had one origin. Nolan’s Dark Knight had another (or none). The Gotham TV series had multiple Jokers. Suicide Squad’s Joker was very different than any of the others.  To that end, he is still shrouded in mystery, because you can never know which (if any) of the stories are the “true” origin. Meanwhile, Batman’s origin is pretty consistent across all tellings.  Went with all the jazzed up feeling and found a loud, vacuous, highly self-absorbed film. Much better fare at TIFF this year than this overhyped tripe.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Todd Phillips’s Joker is a film that might have been dreamed up by one of the cynical bros at the center of the director’s Hangover trilogy during a blacked-out stupor. Not so much part of Warner Bros.’s ongoing Batman series as adjacent to it, Joker imagines a Gotham City that looks suspiciously like Manhattan in the early ’80s, with crime-ridden streets, movie titles like Blow Out and Zorro, The Gay Blade on marquees, and trash piling up due to a garbage strike. The air is stinking with gloom and decay, and among the morbidly downcast populace is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), our Clown Prince of Crime to Be. Fleck is a skeleton-thin jester who works the sidewalks and hospital wards while dreaming of stand-up stardom, and he gets viciously beat up by a group of delinquents in the film’s first scene. As he lays bleeding in a scum-soaked alley, the prop flower on his lapel drips out a pathetic, pissy stream of water. It would be funny if the direction and framing wasn’t so arrogantly humorless. “This is serious,” Phillips seems to be saying, as if he’s prosaically altered the anarchic mantra (“Why so serious?!?”) of Heath Ledger’s Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Fleck, at one of his many low points, does something similar to the “Don’t Forget to Laugh” sign in his workplace, blacking out “Forget to” with a marker so that it now reads “Don’t Laugh.” His action sums up Joker itself, which is made almost entirely out of the preexisting parts of other films, the connections reworked just enough to avoid outright plagiarism, and the results then slathered in a patina of paranoiac solemnity. The cinematic influences here have been well-documented, long before the film bafflingly took top prize at the recent Venice Film Festival. A little Taxi Driver, a little King of Comedy, with Robert De Niro making the Scorsese connection explicit as Murray Franklin, an officious late-night talk show host who’s Fleck’s idol and, eventually, his bête noire. A sequence of Bernie Goetz-esque vigilante violence concludes like The French Connection, while the loner Fleck’s relationship with his dotty mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), recalls a much superior Phoenix vehicle, Lynne Ramsay’s dissociative revenge thriller You Were Never Really Here. Phillips further tarts up his jaundiced vision with an ironic glimpse of a cheery Fred Astaire dance number on TV, a you-gotta-be-kidding-me needle-drop of the Stephen Sondheim perennial “Send in the Clowns,” and a contemptuous movie-theater set piece during which the affluent pricks Fleck eventually rails against watch Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times. Among the heartless one-per-centers in attendance is billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), and if you think his son, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), doesn’t somehow figure in all the combustible drama that follows then I’ve got an all-access Comic-Con badge to sell you. Fears that Fleck and his very slowly revealed alter-ego would be incel manifestos made flesh are unfounded. Despite vague stabs at currency, such as a horde of clown-masked protestors that could be likened to Occupy or Antifa, the fairly explicit period setting pretty much neutralizes any significant link Joker has with our tumultuous present. The violence, when it comes, is probably the film’s most “now” element. It’s as head-smashingly graphic as Tim Miller’s Deadpool, and about as soul-numbing. Though it’s obvious Phillips thinks he’s harking back to Taxi Driver’s Grand Guignol expressionism, referencing that film’s finger-gun-to-the-head moment several times over, and imitating its reality-blurring qualities via Fleck’s interactions with his kindly neighbor, Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz). This brings us to Phoenix’s superficially impressive, yet incongruous Method performance, an awe-inducing black hole at the center of a film that’s otherwise all grubby surface. Fleck laughs at inopportune times due to a neurological condition. He does little soft-shoes and contorts his emaciated body into discomfiting, joint-cracking positions. This is probably the most pointless mass-weight loss—Phoenix took off a staggering 50-plus pounds for the role—since Christian Bale went cadaverous for Brad Anderson’s The Machinist. Scene by scene, it’s clear Phoenix is having a conversation that no one else can hear, and he’s committed to an idea of Joker that’s far removed from his exertions. When he finally dons the iconic white makeup and goes full psycho, there’s no pleasurable charge since no real narrative or emotional groundwork has been laid. And as Jokers go, Phoenix has got nothing on Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton’s Batman or Mark Hamill in Batman: The Animated Series, both of whom found the right balance of dark humor and derangement. Phoenix, by contrast, is so relentlessly sullen (“I have nothing but bad thoughts,” he says in one scene) that it quickly becomes tedious. And like Fleck, he’s playing to an audience of one, the laughter, the tears, and the applause entirely in his own head. Glad someone is entertained. Keith Uhlich's writing has been published in The Hollywood Reporter, BBC, and Reverse Shot, among other publications. He is a member of the New York Film Critics Circle.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Right from the start, you can see ""Joker"" is going to be a different kind of superhero movie than you're used to. That's because director Todd Phillips opens with the Saul Bass-designed Warner Bros. logo used in the 1970s and 1980s. Seeing the logo brings back memories of a grittier time, which is exactly the headspace Phillips wants you in as you embark on this origin story of DC's greatest villain. In crafting the movie, Phillips and cowriter Scott Silver (""8 Mile,"" ""The Fighter"") are given a freedom that few are allowed. They are able to make a twisted drama of a troubled man — who also happens to be a super villain. Forget big explosions, car chases, or plans to destroy Gotham City (or even the world). That's The Joker. Here we're exploring the life of Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix). He gets beat up at work (dressing as a clown for a range of events). He has a mental condition that makes him go into fits of laughter. And with no friends, all he has in his life is his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). But Arthur has dreams. He wants a relationship with the neighbor down the hall from him, Sophie (Zazie Beetz). And he wants to be a standup comedian. He even spends a lot of time writing jokes in a notepad (though most of them are not funny and very disturbing). Arthur aspires to one day be good enough to go on his favorite late night show, hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). 
                          
                        But it seems whenever Arthur gets a little forward momentum in life, he's beaten back down — like a lot of people in Gotham City. Gotham is suffering a garbage strike that's so bad the news is reporting that a rare breed of ""super rats"" are in the city. And everywhere Arthur turns, Gotham's people treat each other badly. Then one night, Arthur finally has enough. In the midst of being beaten up by three guys on the subway while dressed in his clown makeup, Arthur takes out a revolver and kills them all. When the news reports it the next day, instead of the city being frightened that a deranged clown who killed three people is still on the loose, they support what he did. Soon others walk around in clown masks, as a kind of statement that they are with this mystery guy who finally pushed back. ""Joker"" is an ultra-violent drama that takes heavy influence from movies like Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver."" In both of those instances, the main characters (both played by De Niro) are men who are mentally troubled and in ""Joker,"" it's no different. In fact, the movie is very much a commentary on how society doesn't do enough to nurture people who experience mental illness (at Arthur's lowest point in the movie, he's notified that the funding for the counseling he gets has been slashed and he can no longer get the medication prescribed to him). This is all pulled off because of the tour-de-force performance given by Phoenix. The Clown Prince of Crime has always been a favorite character to play for actors, but here Phoenix takes it to its darkest place. And Phillips shows with the movie that he's more than just a comedy director. Though he's known best for the ""Hangover"" movies, here he creates something that feels like it could have come out in the late 1970s. And he an Phoenix will likely get a lot of attention come Oscar time.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Uno de los personajes del siempre excesivo Yasutaka Tsutsui se alarmaba de los esfuerzos que hacemos para divertirnos. Es cansado y hasta triste, pero ahí estamos: empeñados en pasarlo bien cueste lo que cueste. Hasta el más mortal de los aburrimientos. Ser feliz, de hecho, es cualquier cosa menos un acto inocente. Exige tiempo, esfuerzo, planificación, dinero, series de televisión, memes, clases de yoga... Es agotador. Sobre todo desde que, como nos recuerda Neil Postman, convertimos el concepto de felicidad, históricamente asociado al control de las pasiones y la satisfacción de las necesidades, en sinónimo de diversión. Todd Phillips, artífice no en balde de Resacón en Las Vegas, lo sabe y entrega en Joker la más descarnada refutación de casi todo.  En el mismo hilo de razonamiento, hace tiempo que Henri Bergson mantuvo que cualquier carcajada no es más que un producto de nuestra maldad. Todas las bromas, continuaba, son malintencionadas. El humor blanco no existe, siempre lo mancha algo: un poco de sangre, una lágrima, un gesto de desesperación... Nos reímos por la sencilla razón de que somos por naturaleza unos animales resentidos. Nos molesta que nos impongan restricciones, y que además nos las impongan sin motivo unos incapaces. En eso consiste vivir en sociedad. Freud antes de él equiparó el mecanismo liberador de la risa con el de los sueños. En los dos casos, la represión desaparece en un proceso de desalienación que, a unas buenas, podríamos llamar orgiástico. Y así. De la misma manera, Todd Phillips se exhibe como un consumado lector tanto del novelista japonés como del filósofo de la intuición y, de nuevo, presenta su impugnación a la mayor. Joker, en efecto, no es, pese a lo que pueda parecer por el título y por Batman, una película de superhéroes. Tampoco, pese a las risas, se acerca a la comedia. Y lejos de la intención de esta prodigiosa provocación presentarse como un relectura de mito alguno. Desde el primer al último fotograma, todo es sencillamente negación, resentimiento, mala intención. Y, de ahí, las carcajadas. Y el caos. Su revolución es contra el cansancio, contra la dictadura del entretenimiento, contra la felicidad como imposición. La cinta coloca a un pobre payaso en mitad de una ciudad cualquiera. Gotham City quizá. Trabaja para una compañía de clowns que, como todas, se dedica a hacer feliz a la gente. Ya saben, canta canciones, se cae, aúlla, llora porque la pena le abruma y se vuelve a caer. Es un sentimental. El carablanca acude a los hospitales a hacer reír a los niños enfermos, anima los cumpleaños de los críos ricos, sirve de reclamo publicitario para templos del colesterol y, dado el caso, asesina a tres impresentables acosadores en el metro. En realidad, esto último no figura en el convenio. Sucede por accidente. El problema es que hace gracia. Hace la misma gracia que ridiculizar a un pobre psicópata que se cree gracioso. Y así, sobre el último párrafo, Phillips, con la inestimable colaboración de un descomunal (otra vez) Joaquin Phoenix, levanta la más desconcertante metáfora de lo que somos y del mundo que pisamos. Dice el director que su película no es política pero que no tiene ningún reparo en que los demás lo crean. Y, de hecho, lo es. Y lo es con la misma violencia y claridad que lo eran Taxi Driver y El rey de la comedia, las dos películas de Martin Scorsese que delimitan el perímetro de referencias de ésta. No en balde, es Robert de Niro, protagonista de las dos cintas mencionadas, el que en el papel de ocurrente conductor de un talk show le da la réplica al personaje protagonista que todo lo puede. Y aniquila. Todo el hilo argumental, soportado tanto por la pirotecnia de la interpretación del protagonista como por la fotografía crepuscular y ochentera de Lawrence Sher (confeccionada, por cierto, a imagen y semejanza de la del maestro Michael Chapman), descansa en la certeza de que la más atroz de las injusticias, en según qué circunstancias, acaba por ser idéntica al más honesto de los actos. Y, ya puestos, la distancia entre la comedia y la tragedia no es más que una cuestión de matiz. Como ya es lugar común, Batman (que no aparece) y Joker son, en efecto, la misma persona con el mismo trauma e idéntico rencor antisocial. Toda la película se alimenta de forma obsesiva del gesto descompuesto de su actor. Su rostro, antes y después de enmascararse por la pintura, ocupa literalmente cada fotograma. Y desde ahí avanza por un largo y desconsolado pasillo de espejos rotos. De resentimiento, decíamos; de puro y extenuante cansancio. El argumento queda reducido a su mínima expresión o, mejor, el argumento es sólo la fiebre que todo lo desordena. Hay traumas infantiles, pero el foco es otro. Existen cuentas que saldar con la sociedad, pero no es la venganza el motor de la acción. La locura aparece como origen, pero nada justifica. La violencia no es expresión de nada, sino causa y sentido de todo. Si por un momento piensan que hay elementos suficientes para creer que todo lo anterior no es más que una expresión vaga o precisa, según la clase social, de lo que se ve diariamente en el telediario, a lo mejor hasta tienen razón. El resultado, en definitiva, es una película que hace de la perversidad de su lógica interna el motivo para una sonora carcajada. Con la peor de las intenciones. Puro resentimiento. Duele tanto que no queda más que reír. Es lo que tienen los payasos que como los memes, los monologuistas, las series de televisión, los amigos en Facebook y los hilos de Twitter dibujan y prometen la felicidad y, lo más importante, hacen gracia. Puta gracia. En uno de sus cuentos más disparatados, el excesivo y genial Yasutaka Tsutsui describe el periplo de una familia desde la ciudad abarrotada a la playa. ""Todos sonreían a solas como si estuvieran locos de euforia. Se limitaban a mirar hacia delante con la mirada perdida"", escribe para describir el instante de alegría casi infinita en el que, por fin, el protagonista alcanza el agua tibia del mar. Hace ya unos metros que ha dejado de pisar la arena. Sus pies sólo reconocen el tacto blando de los cuerpos de los que como él buscaban la felicidad. Ya han muerto. Dentro de poco, él también perecerá ahogado. Pero feliz, tan feliz como el propio Joker. A disfrutar.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019",Phoenix carries all the load in a movie that transcends the comic pages and will provoque all types of reactions. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Joker is a movie that thinks it has a lot to say and fancies itself The Social Commentary Of Our Time, but in reality it’s a mishmash of Hot Button Social Issues without anything interesting to say at all. So, in that respect, it’s the perfect movie for 2019. Joker is our comeuppance. And it almost seems fitting that the man to deliver our comeuppance is the director of The Hangover and Old School. (For the record, I like those movies.) But, no, I guess it’s not surprising that the director of Starsky & Hutch couldn’t quite pull off this pretty ambitious task. Look, I actually like most of Todd Phillips’ movies. And Joker is well shot and Joaquin Phoenix is, of course, a very good actor and will almost definitely get an Oscar nomination out of all this. But as the film goes on, it starts to feel gritty just for grit’s sake. And, yes, we too have seen Martin Scorsese movies, which Phillips borrows from liberally here, even casting Robert De Niro in the Jerry Langford role from The King of Comedy. And by the fifth or sixth time we get Phoenix alone in a room, laughing maniacally to himself, it’s like, we get it. I walked out of the movie feeling a mixture of gross and numb, but mostly numb. Joker has some extremely violent scenes, but I really didn’t feel much of anything while watching it. Again, it’s the perfect movie for 2019. We watch the horror, feel somewhat helpless, then move on. There’s a particular scene in Joker that just feels like punishment. Joker has just finished brutally murdering a man with a pair of scissors, then he turns to a staircase and starts triumphantly dancing down them in slow motion to Gary Glitter’s “Rock & Roll Part 2” – a musician who was sent to prison for child porn and sexually abusing a child; I guess Mr. Glitter will be getting a payday out of this – and I couldn’t help but feel I was being punished for some past sin. Like karma had finally caught up with me and forced me to watch this. Set in the early 1980s, Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a man with severe mental issues who, once he goes off his medication, becomes a homicidal maniac. (Ah, yes, a comic book movie!) What rubs me the wrong way about all this is Arthur isn’t actually some vigilante trying to cause chaos for the sake of chaos – which would be more reminiscent of Heath Ledger’s version of Joker. No, Ledger’s Joker is not a good dude, but there’s at least some sort of grand plan to his behavior. Instead, Arthur’s just a deeply sick man who kind of lucks into a motivation because he kills three stockbroker types who were picking on him, which divides the city into a sort of Occupy Wall Street type movement. So a good portion of the people of Gotham thinks he’s a hero for killing some rich snobs. I’m fairly positive the movie kind of thinks he’s a hero, at least in that vague, “Hey, he’s not a black and white character, decide for yourself,” kind of way. But in reality, we’re just sitting there watching this mentally ill man fall deeper and deeper into his sickness because he went off of his medication. There’s been “talk” of this movie inciting violence, which is maybe a strange argument to make when there’s already so much violence in our world. People don’t seem to need much of an excuse to do terrible things before Joker and they won’t after. Joker is less a disease and more a symptom. So, in that way, I do sort of credit Phillips for creating a movie that is so angry and thinks it’s so important, yet can’t quite figure out why or what. It truly is the movie made for now. Everything has kind of led up to this movie in our popular culture. And Phillips has made a movie that will get a lot of attention, which isn’t easy to do today. I didn’t much care for Joker, but it’s not disposable like a lot of other movies. It won’t just come and go. Like it or not, Joker will be a part of our lives for a while. Joker thinks it will shock you with its violence, but the reality is it just leaves a viewer feeling nothing. Joker isn’t even trying to make Arthur sympathetic. Trying to make Arthur at all sympathetic would require a little more thought than, “Let’s just make a cool looking gritty movie like Taxi Driver.” Instead, it just seems to take joy in watching this mentally ill man, who was abused as a child, plunge into a world of darkness in a, “Wow, ain’t this guy fucked up?!,” kind of way. But there’s a big part of me that is happy this movie exists. The world is garbage right now and when we tell future generations about 2019, we can just pop in Joker and say, “This was considered entertainment.” It will probably win Best Picture just to spite us. We all deserve Joker. Joker is our comeuppance.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2019","It's a beautiful demented jewel of a film. The superhero movie, alas, for our time.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," The aim of the Joker has always been to sow chaos and panic in the citizens of Gotham City. In this, Todd Phillips’ origin story seems to have succeeded, given the amount of lip service paid to worries that “Joker” will weaponize volatile viewers. Its final act is, indeed, bracingly over the top, as Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck sheds his sad-sack chrysalis and emerges into full-blown Joker mode. It’s horrifying, it’s artful — and it’s hardly alone in its cinematic zest for violence. (Just ask John Rambo, back at the box office a couple weeks ago.) The rest of “Joker” is, in essence, a compelling character study — one whose appeal may be limited to Batman completists, of whom there are certainly quite a few. Let’s be clear, this is no comic-book romp. It’s a seriously dark urban drama about a charmless schlub (Phoenix) saddled with a brain injury that gives him an inadvertent cackle, caring for his ailing mom (Frances Conroy) and working a lousy gig as a rent-a-clown while nursing dreams of being a stand-up comic. This oddball, vulnerable soul gets beaten up — literally by goons, figuratively by the healthcare system — and then beaten up again. Eventually, he can’t take it any more. You see where this is going. And where its roots lie. If the casting of Robert De Niro as a late-night talk show host wasn’t enough to tip you off, the mood and look of “Joker” is deeply rooted in (not to say derivative of) the gritty New York dramas of the ’70s and ’80s, particularly “Taxi Driver,” “Death Wish” and “The King of Comedy” — the latter of which starred De Niro as a creepy stalker obsessed with a popular entertainer. It’s a different take on the DC comics character, and why not? The Joker’s an anarchic villain for the ages, still wide open for interpretation even after countless portrayals. We all have our favorites — Heath Ledger’s mine, though I’ll never forget my first, Cesar Romero — but there’s no reason someone else can’t take a crack at it. Who better than crazy-eyed Joaquin Phoenix? The actor’s physicality here is something to behold. It’s never quite clear why Arthur’s so emaciated, but the way he contorts his spindly frame, and occasionally stretches it out into a joyful, Kabuki-esque dance, is mesmerizing. Phoenix’s tic of a laugh is, indeed, disturbing, though it always seems vaguely forced. I’m hardly the biggest DC fangirl, but it strikes me that the whole point of the Joker is that he gets bubbly joy out of the most horrible things in the world. To relegate his giggling to a neurological injury sort of defangs the concept. “Joker” starts grim and gets grimmer, as Arthur embraces his inner demons and finds they resonate with the huddled masses of Gotham. When he dispatches some Wall Streeters who taunt him on the subway — in shades of reverse Bernhard Goetz — he spawns a clown-faced “Kill the rich” movement that hints at his future potential as a charismatic supervillain. No doubt some will balk at their favorite comics character being dragged down into such gloom and doom. The director had, I think, a solid defense in referencing the 1988 graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke,” at my screening, in which the Joker says, “I prefer my past to be multiple choice.” He’s a slippery chameleon with a host of backstories. If this one seems depressingly reflective of our own reality, well, it’s brought to you by the guy who’s been yukking it up about male bad behavior for years in movies like “Old School” and “The Hangover.” I like to imagine that Phillips embedded this one with a wry message: Toxic masculinity is, actually, no joke at all.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," This DC comic character that has been brilliantly done onscreen by Oscar winners Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, so what could possibly be left to bring in terms of characterization that we haven’t seen? Joaquin Phoenix…that’s what.  Phoenix brings an emaciated, pill popping Joker back with vengeance, vigor and vivaciousness that will have your head swirling long after the credits have rolled. Todd Phillips warned the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival World Premiere to get ready because this film is ‘bonkers.’ Bonkers doesn’t even begin to describe this complex, reimagined revisit into the world of Arthur Fleck. Which would be one of the reasons that the Los Angeles premiere shut out press and screenings were cancelled for Aurora, CO.   Just to refresh your memory, On July 20, 2012, a mass shooting occurred inside a Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. Dressed in tactical clothing, James Eagan Holmes set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience with multiple firearms that resulted in 12 deaths. I will admit that there is massive gun violence that occurs within the framework of this film, so it is understandable that the studio and citizens around the country be concerned and cautious. Having said that, Phillips and Scott Silver’s original screenplay is a marvelous take of this fan favorite leaving nice rewarding reference points for fans.  Shocking in its originality and intensity, Joker provides a fully immersed performance from Phoenix who creatively gives audiences an unsettling, no holds barred portrait of the villain we thought we knew. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) makes a living as a clown, performing for tourists and children as he dreams of fame as a stand-up comedian like his hero, talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But people never do what Arthur wants them to do, his inner torment eats at him, and his ailing mother keeps harping on everything she is owed by her former employers, the Wayne family. Life is so ugly that you just have to laugh.  As Arthur descends into a disturbing unhinged killer, Phoenix keeps us on edge revealing the soul of a man in crisis with his past, present and future. Part of the pleasure of watching Joker stems from its technical brilliance, production design, cinematography and nods to Martin Scorsese’s The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver (which are quite recognizable throughout the film’s bloodline).  Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score drives the action to a fever pitch along with nods to the obvious clown classic ‘Send in The Clowns,’ an old R&B joint ‘Everybody Plays The Fool’ and Rat Pack favorite ‘That’s Life.’",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Like the antihero in BREATHLESS, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) practices faces in the mirror—crafting an identity.  And like Belmondo’s Michel Poiccard, his imminent notoriety is largely accidental.  Living at home with his mother (Frances Conroy), he scrapes by on the income earned as a clown for hire.  Fired for bringing a borrowed gun to a children’s hospital, after shooting three men on one of those metro subway systems that’s completely empty at some hour of the day—odd, considering what kind of cities primarily have public transit—Arthur recedes into a psychosis that can only be explained as PNS (Plot Necessitated Sickness). Too often in film, those with learning disabilities, mental disorders or mental illness are characterized and stigmatized as being highly susceptible to psychotic episodes.  When we first see Arthur acting erratically, the audience giggles—not uncomfortably—at him.  It’s not until he gets on his favorite late night show, hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro taking the Jerry Langford role to Phoenix’s Rupert Pupkin), that the audience divides into two camps—those who cheer on the murderous Joker, and those revulsed by him. Ignore, for a moment the gauche co-opting of grit ranging from Tyler Durden to Travis Bickle—the suggested comparison to which DeNiro at the Toronto premiere rolled his eyes.  The mob justice of the clown-masked citizens of Gotham taking to the streets, reminiscent of the also dominantly white predilection toward Guy Fawkes and anarchy, is a very privileged view.  What generally happens when society and the rule of law collapses is that the rich get richer, and more powerful.  Just ask Vladimir Potanin. Joel Schumacher, the BATMAN alum, gave us a portrait of vigilante justice in 1993’s FALLING DOWN.  By contrast, that film ably empathized with Michael Douglas’ character without advancing his misguided ideology built atop social and racial stereotypes.  It isn’t helped by Phoenix’s performance which is a caricature of a caricature of mental illness (I’ll bet fifty bucks someone this week will laudably describe it as “balletic”), and as painfully-rehashed as Batman’s alleyway origin story, but with a potentially-familial twist that out-Marthas the dreadful BATMAN V. SUPERMAN and the entire STAR WARS universe at once. The film argues, through the basso profondo swell of the score, the handheld close-ups, and the cacophony of voices—some real, others imagined—that Arthur is a victim.  Nevermind that Todd Phillips, the director of such deep fare as STARSKY AND HUTCH, OLD SCHOOL, and THE HANGOVER, emulates many of the visual and thematic techniques Kubrick and Scorsese used to garner sympathy for the monstrous pedophile Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and the aforementioned Bickle in TAXI DRIVER.  JOKER—a middlebrow impression of highbrow—has a moral compass, and it’s pointed in the wrong direction.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," There are so many problems with this film.  First of all, the Joker is a straight-out villain in the comics.  In prior movies, he has never once been presented in a way to draw sympathy or empathy from the audience.  And yet, here we are watching a film that asks its audience to have some sympathy for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix).  The character is not one who should be presented in such a way that we see him in Todd Phillips’ film.  This didn’t sit well with me for the entire movie.  I don’t recall Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger doing the role in such a way. “I used to think my life was a tragedy but now I realize it’s a fucking comedy,” Arthur says while confronting his mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). One can see the Martin Scorsese influences on the film.  The King of Comedy is one film that comes to mind.  Unfortunately, Taxi Driver is another.  This particular influence is worrisome on so many levels.  Meanwhile, Robert De Niro’s character, Murray Franklin, is clearly a stand-in for Johnny Carson.  The curtains are a big tell for this with a similar color to that of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. I went into this film with an open mind.  Obviously, I grew concerns upon learning that the director of The Hangover would be directing a film about the Joker.  I’m not alone in this.  Regardless, an open mind isn’t even enough to find entertainment value in the film.  I mean, Joaquin Phoenix is a talented actor and he does his best with the material.  Unfortunately, a talented actor alone is not enough to lift up even the most terrible film scripts.  There was no being able to connect with the film.  Believe me when I say that I tried but there was nothing there.  Even when I laughed, I hated myself for doing so.  There’s nothing funny about mental illness.  There’s just no fun in this film.  Maybe a few of Murray Franklin’s jokes but that’s the extent of it.

"Sep 10, 2019"," Joker is perhaps the most anticipated film of TIFF this year and boy, did it deliver. Taking an extremely dark and terrifyingly relevant approach to the origin story, Joker tackles something that has plagued our society. It’s not intended as a glorification of the character but rather a character study that exposes the worst part of our society: how we treat our poor, disenfranchised, and mentally ill and the potential consequences of such inaction. Arthur Fleck is an impoverished young man who suffers from mental illness, but like many in society, lacks the resources or assistance he needs in managing his mental illness. As the programs to provide mental health care are cut, Arthur is left to his own devices as we see his mind slowly descend further into madness and less and less able to cope with the world around him. Living alone with his mother and working as a clown for hire, Arthur has focused his energy on always being happy and making other people laugh. This has been at the expense of his mental stability and finally, it all comes boiling over. Joker is not the fleeting and fluffy comic book origin stories to which we are accustomed. It is a gritty, dark, and violent look into what happens in our society when we ignore the poor and the mentally ill. The writing in the film is spectacular and hits a lot of points with a tenacity that commands notice. While working on his stand up routine, Arthur jokes that “the worst part about mental illness is people expect you to act like you don’t have it.” The use of music in the film is very effective and haunting in some ways. We get versions of “Send in the Clowns,” “Smile,” and a few more that establish this unhinged and uneasy feeling that gives you pause as to what may happen next. These typically happy songs are turned into something dark and sinister in the film and further warp the minds of the audience into a sense of instability. My hesitation with this film is the problematic message it could send to the wrong people who don’t know quite understand its intention. Apart from that, there are points in the film where it feels like the audience isn’t sure whether or not to laugh at something so the filmmakers put in too much ominous music to cue the audience. Most of the film is not intended to be funny, but a sad portrait of the decline of mental health treatment in this country. Certain scenes in the film are so effective such as Arthur’s continued journey up and down these long and isolated stairs that provide some beautifully framed shots. The costume design and the colors of the film are extremely effective in creating a world that is similar to ours but somehow slightly different. Joaquin Phoenix is disturbing as Arthur Fleck. His mannerisms and approach to the role elevates it above common comic book adaptations but brings it to the audience as something tangible and something all too real. His performance demonstrates so openly to the audience that you’ve known someone like Arthur, you’ve seen him, and you may have ignored him. This is what is most unnerving about his performance. He gets to the core of the audience and shakes them in a way that is profound and moving, making this easily an Oscar-worthy performance and one of his best to date. Joker isn’t the fluffy comic book film we are so used to but a realistic portrayal of madness manifested in a person rejected and ignored by society and left to his own devices. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance will shake you to your core and leave a lasting impact on you. Joker is by no means an easy film to watch, but one that so ardently points out our shortcomings as a society. Incredibly poignant and disconcerting.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," ""He's a lonely forgotten man desperate to prove that he's alive."" That's the tagline of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, but it might as well serve as a rallying cry for Todd Phillips's Joker, a violent, nihilistic horror film masquerading as both a character drama and a comic book movie. Realizing that it's next to impossible to get a studio-backed character piece greenlit, Phillips has decided to use the Joker as a gateway drug, giving him a chance to more or less remake Taxi Driver for a whole new generation of moviegoers – the ones who've grown up on a steady diet of superhero movies. Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck is that lonely forgotten man – a mentally unstable loser just aching for acceptance. He says he wants to be a standup comedian, but what he really wants is attention. And he's willing to kill to get it. Joker's script, courtesy of Phillips and Scott Silver, is often painfully simplistic – the type of script where characters literally spell-out their motivations in blunt, unsubtle ways. Yet everything else on display here transcends that material, resulting in a curious experience – a film that lacks a good story, but boasts an overall masterful display of craft. Phillips's direction is exact and precise, overloading the film with homages to '70s character dramas and wide shots that encompass the dirty, filthy world Arthur lives in. That direction is aided by Lawrence Sher's stunning cinematography – full of long, dark nights and burning artificial lights – as if existing in a world where the sun no longer rises. All of this is accentuated by Hildur Guðnadóttir's ominous, haunting score, which is full of long, drawn-out notes and chilling soundscapes. It's the 1980s, and Gotham City is a living hell. A garbage strike has resulted in thousands of tons of trash piled up in the streets – which in turn has given way to a new breed of giant super rats. The city is a powder keg ready to explode, as the rich get richer and the poor struggle to survive. Living among the downtrodden is Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand-up comic who makes his living as a party clown. He appears to love his clowning job as he prances and dances his way from one event to the next. But the cold, harsh world of Gotham City has no need for such mirth, and Arthur finds himself shunned and abused at every turn. His finds solace in both his belief that he'll one day be a famous stand-up comic, and his love of The Murray Franklin Show, a Tonight Show-esque late-night comedy show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, playing a kind of reverse version of the character he played in Scorsese's The King of Comedy). But Arthur's ""jokes"" aren't very good. In fact, they're non-existent. He's also clearly mentally ill – a social worker has him on seven different prescriptions, but none of them seem to be working. The only real human contact Arthur has is with his sickly mother Penny (Frances Conroy), who insists on writing a constant barrage of letters to her former employer, the wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). The Trumpian Wayne is planning to run for mayor, promising to clean-up Gotham in the process. Penny believes that Wayne will use his wealth to help her and Arthur, but Arthur has his doubts. Thomas Wayne can't help Arthur. In fact, no one can. And as the character finds himself more and more abused, he finally decides to lash-out, murdering three cruel stockbrokers on the subway. Arthur's act spurns a full-blown ""eat the rich"" movement in Gotham, with citizens donning clown masks and staging violent protests. Arthur has created an entire movement – but he doesn't seem to care about that at all. As he says himself, he's not political – and he doesn't believe in anything. Except himself. A smarter script would take these ideas and turn them into something with deeper meaning. Phillips is presenting a wealth of possibilities here, dealing with social issues and class struggles. But like Arthur, Phillips doesn't seem to care about that. It's all just background noise – an excuse to turn Arthur into a full-blown psychopath; a chain-smoking clown prone to dancing his way through life. There's a great film lurking within the frames of Joker – but sadly, we'll just have to settle for a good one. What elevates all of this is Phoenix, who is haunting, haunted and downright scary. Gaunt to the point of emaciation, the actor brings a great physicality to the performance, and Phillips often accentuates the character's ghastly appearance by having Phoenix stretch and twist about with his shirt off, his ribs protruding from beneath his skin, his shoulder blades jutting like pieces of broken glass. Manic, creepy, and imposing, Phoenix manages to make his Joker empathetic, but never sympathetic. We feel for Arthur – but we can never really like him. He's too detestable; too nasty. He suffers from a medical condition that causes him to utter wild peels of painful laughter, and he's not above stalking his attractive neighbor, played by Zazie Beetz in a tragically underwritten role. And as Arthur becomes more and more unhinged and violent, any semblance of empathy for the character flat-out vanishes. He's become what he was always meant to be: a supervillain. As Joker draws to its climax, Arthur's violent tendencies explode, resulting in several ghastly, graphic moments that would be right at home in a slasher movie. The cinema landscape is choked with comic book movies – a artistic shift that has resulted in an urge for more adult-driven cinema. Joker wants to be the answer to those cinephile prayers – a film that is the best of both worlds: a comic book property that's also a dark, adult drama. But the film is so relentlessly bleak, and so intellectually slight, that the end result seems like a ""be careful what you wish for"" warning. Like Arthur Fleck, Joker doesn't believe in anything. That's both fascinating, and terrifying. This is the truly subversive comic book movie we've been waiting for. Now that it's here, we might start to regret the monster we've conjured up.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Joker is one of the least amusing movies you will ever see, to the point that the standard song “Smile” is used ironically. You’re more likely to grimace and cringe and cover your eyes in horror — that is, if you can even stomach all of it. Some will rave that this is a daring reinvention of the superhero genre and that take is not entirely wrong. It’s also not entirely relevant in the big picture. The frightening bottom line: The film is a relentlessly savage cesspool desperate for us to reflect on the violence in our culture, perhaps not realizing that it’s the latest contributor. The title character, of course, is the iconic arch nemesis of brooding Batman. But forget every big-screen adaptation you’ve ever seen featuring D.C. Comics caped crusader and his clown-faced villain. We’re way, way, way off the Gotham grid from Jack Nicholson’s campy portrayal in 1989’s Batman and Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning sheer-sinister take in 2008’s The Dark Knight and whatever Jared Leto was doing in 2016’s The Suicide Squad. Joaquin Phoenix’s version of Joker is a disturbingly emaciated, homicidal loner grounded in some twisted version of reality. He’s a wild card, alright. The actor is front and center and riveting as always in a standalone origin story about an enigma with no real origin. In a seedy retro version of Gotham City — in which people still use rotary phones and watch television on boxy sets — his Arthur Fleck is a lonely and strange fellow living with his single mother (Frances Conroy). Something is off about from the start. He claims he has a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh at inopportune moments. He’s jittery and socially awkward. He dreams of being a stand-up comic and performing on TV for his idol, a smarmy late-night talk-show host (Robert De Niro). Arthur works for a dreary place called “Hahas” as a clown-for-hire. Early on, a bunch of punks steal one of his twirling “everything must go” street signs and then kick him to the ground. An outraged coworker gives him a present in a paper bag. As soon as the camera flashes to the gun and the bullets at the bottom of the bag, the impending doom comes into focus: Joker will now go from disturbing to despicable. The slow-burn tension leads to a series of brutal moments in which Arthur pulls the trigger on that gun, often in that deranged clown makeup. First it’s a trio of Wall Street jerks on the subway. For this he becomes a sort-of folk hero. Then he moves on to people he personally knows and holds accountable for his shortcomings. It’s inevitable that a young, pre-Batman Bruce Wayne and his wealthy family soon enter the plot, dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight. Because Arthur is constantly tortured for being odd and ignored for being poor, we’re supposed to feel sorry for him, maybe even sympathize with his harmful actions. He didn’t have enough love in his childhood! His attractive female neighbor (Zazie Beetz) is intimidated by him! His dad is MIA! He doesn’t have friends! Don’t fall for it. There’s another bullied character in Joker, a dwarf that also works for the clown company. He’s the most gentle and soft-spoken person in the whole film. Superhero movies don’t all have to be shiny pieces of wham-bam escapism. But Joker seems lost in its own grimness. Without fist-fights or elaborate bank heists or Spandex, we’re left with a predictable cautionary-tale drama about capitalism and the dangerous effects of mental illness. Co-writer and director Todd Phillips has a comedy background; he helmed favorites such as Old School and The Hangover series. It’s telling that the most captivating moment is when Phoenix puts on his happy face and dapper maroon suit and joyously prances around outside on the way to his much-awaited appearance on that favorite talk show. Joker could have used more of that perverted spark. Instead, Joker is darker than the Knight himself. We’re forced to nod our heads in agreement as Arthur laments that the world just keeps getting crazier and that “everyone just screams at each other” — only to shake our heads when he ignites an anarchist killing spree. Ugh. I know. This is a disappointing development, especially because the film was just lauded at the Venice Film Festival and nobody does performance art quite like Phoenix. But this preachy, cold-hearted cynicism is not worth your time. Seriously.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2019","  Is Joker art, or is it ugly, empty nihilism? Maybe that question shouldn’t matter; it might honestly be both. But the truth is that entertainment doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and a movie with the message this one hammers home again and again — that life is nasty and short; that no one cares; that you might as well burn it all down — feels too volatile, and frankly too scary, to separate from the very real violence committed by young men like Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in America almost every day.
  Todd Phillips’ film is an origin story, which means that we know approximately where it’s all headed, just not quite how he’ll get there. And so Arthur, a lonely part-time clown who lives in a crumbling tenement with his sickly mother (Frances Conroy), goes through his early stations of the cross: the romantic rejections, the random beatings by teenage street punks, the countless small humiliations that make up his daily life. The only good thing, maybe, is his blossoming romance with a neighbor, luminous single mother Sophie (Zazie Beetz).
  When a trio of drunken Wall Street goons attack Arthur in a subway car, he reaches a breaking point. The fallout from that incident lights the match for an already on-edge Gotham City — plagued by garbage strikes and “super rats” and general civic decay — sending angry mobs into the streets in protest.
  There are other plot threads to follow, several of them heavily expositioned toward the Wayne family and Arthur’s own murky past, as well as his dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian and finding a way to meet the man he pictures as a sort of kindly father-figure surrogate, late-night host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But for all that’s going on, Phillips’ viewpoint is often feverishly interior and self-contained; a narrative stricture that serves the purpose, perhaps, of allowing viewer into the nightmarish, nonlinear world Arthur’s tortured mind occupies.
  It should be said that Phoenix is stunning in the role: a figure adjacent but entirely apart from Jack Nicholson’s leering cartoon or Heath Ledger’s giddy, commanding anarchist. He feels possessed by the part, communing with Arthur’s hurt and rage and raw vulnerability even as he falls deeper into whatever kind of spiders-in-the-brain psychosis the willful halting of his meds lets in.
  The details of his performance — the manic laughter and mood swings and wild, demented dancing — are indelible; maybe that’s why it’s so hard to watch him become the movie’s hero to the extent that he does. Phillips doesn’t just observe his (de)evolution; he seems to revel in every rung of madness that Arthur descends, and in the growing fame and adulation it brings him.
  Maybe he only sincerely means to capture and reflect the times; a mirror held up to the anger and alienation and class disparities that have shaped the world we find ourselves living in. The rules of the movie’s moral universe, though, don’t point toward some greater good as much as they just seem to celebrate — or at least tacitly approve — chaos as a cure for hopelessness, or merely for its own destabilizing sake.
  Which is not to say that the vast majority of grown adults who see the film won’t be able to recognize that, or differentiate between Hollywood fiction and real life. But in a moment when internet culture can cancel a movie as minor as The Hunt for fomenting “anger and hate,” the wider impact Joker is poised to make seems far more dangerous. And the idea that even one viewer might take its convictions at face value, and then act on them, feels like no joke at all.

"Sep 10, 2019","Joaquin Phoenix's phenomenal performance elevates this creepy, somber, and disturbing origin story that excels when it focuses on its titular character and stumbles when it tries to be a civics lesson",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Take this as you will: Todd Phillips’ Joker is exactly the kind of movie the Clown Prince of Crime would have wanted. Vicious, dangerous, transcendent, it’s the boldest and most shattering addition to the comic cinema canon since The Dark Knight. But even so, this slow burn film has forged its own path on the outskirts of blockbuster creativity, not only reinventing one of entertainment’s most iconic villains, but our conception – and hopefully, a whole string of future filmmakers’ notions – of the comic book genre itself. Muck and junk flood the streets of Gotham City. Travis Bickle longed for the day the rain would wash the streets clean of such filth, and in 1989’s Do the Right Thing, set and released at the tail end of the decade this film’s events take place, the overbearing heat did its part in igniting a block-contained, yet thunderous rebellion. In that spirit, the piling heaps of garbage here introduce a similar tension, this time between the rich, who are only getting richer, and the poor, who are only getting poorer. And lying on the ground between overflowing bins and collection of strewn black bags is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), in all of his irrelevant glory. Arthur is one of life’s outsiders, socially and societally aborted. Living in a cramped apartment with his ailing mother (an eerily magnificent Frances Conroy), he works as a call clown during the day, and on his stand-up routine during the night. His hope beneath the surface in bringing happiness to others is that he could possibly stow some for himself one day. But as the world constantly passes him by, only stopping to harass, beat, or dismiss him – the social worker who provides minimal consultation and maximum medication is being defunded – his quest for joy sinks farther and farther into the hopeless abyss his mind becomes. This foundation provides more backstory for the character than in perhaps any work from the 80 years since his conception. Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver (8 Mile) take minuscule inspiration from the DC comics, instead offering their own origin story, one whose grim, reality-based declination provides the film with harrowing political commentary. This is not so much a movie about the man that became the Joker as it is about the world that allowed the Joker to happen. As Arthur, Phoenix is utterly phenomenal. Having lost an egregious amount of weight for the part, with protruding ribs and shoulder blades that look ready to burst at the seams, he strips his body down to its emotional core. And as an agent of chaos, liberated by its tumultuous effects, the spectacle of observing Arthur test out his newfound freedoms – be it in a roadside bathroom or a grand set of outdoor stairs, he allows his body to flow and flair around as the agony slowly pours out of him – is among the most hauntingly memorable images of the year. For all two hours of Joker, you’re aware of how heavily influenced Phillips and company were by the loner-lunatic pieces of Martin Scorsese, including Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy –the gratuitously intentional casting of Robert De Niro as late night talk show host Murray Franklin doesn’t lend the film any subtlety. But while Phoenix carries the same degree of inner torture and outer aggression as De Niro brought to his characters in the ‘70s and ‘80s, Phillips, as a veteran filmmaker, tends to rely too heavily on his idols. Within that setup, however, the Hangover director manages to create another dazzling and contemporary one-psycho show, one that rings especially true in an age of mass shooters and bargain-less politics. To some, these comparisons – especially when translated into the gritty, bloody revolts that make up the film’s climax – may compromise any possibility of enjoyment. Joker is, without a doubt, an incendiary project, designed to propel and project reaction. What we see, without context, is a terrorist: a man whose gruesome agenda is so objectless, it greatly, if not entirely reduces our perception of humanity. However, a lack of context is impossible here, and makes siding with this creep clown not only the more likely option, but the effortless one as well.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," A Joker with a name: Arthur Fleck — a bone-poppingly thin middle-aged man with a neurological condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably. He’s a clinically-deemed lunatic who lives in an old apartment with his aging mother amidst the grime that is Gotham’s perpetual smog. Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) dons a soft smile and breathes a tender, impressionable, good-spirited soul, as malleable as his beaten body, which conjures memory of the lack of person that was Christian Bale in The Machinist. Clinging to the maternally-infused belief that he was born to bring joy and laughter into the world, he writes jokes in pursuit of a stand-up comedy career when he’s not working as a sign-holding advertisement clown, the job being one of the few things that offers him respite in his miserable life. He was once confined to an insane asylum, but now, on the outside, his asylum comes in the form of seven pills a day, which, quite frankly, aren’t doing the trick. His unwanted, compulsory laugh freaks everyone out and often causes him to choke, much to his fury. Fleck is a strange, conflicted man. He drapes loose, weathered cardigans over his spikey shoulders and wears a hairstyle that screams Anton Chigurh. His social sensibilities are all but nonexistent and he misspells everything in his jokebook. He dances gracefully in the least opportune moments (e.g. murder) and confoundingly finds glee in bedlam. His eyes gleam with a hope that’s only ever spit on and kicked repeatedly while its down. In short, writer-director Todd Phillips‘ Joker is a victim of sorts — the kind that eventually flips the script and carries out a school shooting or mass transit bombing. But you already know that. In essence, this is the same Joker you’ve met on screens and in comics. The nuance of Phoenix’s performance adds a necessary freshness and, ultimately, sets his iteration apart, but it wouldn’t take long to figure out who you were watching if you went in with no previous knowledge of who Phoenix was portraying (and you missed the title card). And while this might be the first full-fledged Joker origin story, it’s not an original one. Joker’s origins are made up of tried and true outcast essentials. However, this is not a repeat performance. Phoenix fashions an astoundingly original portrayal of the seminal villain. That’s not to say he’s ignorant of the history behind the role though. While he claims he left past performances entirely out of sight, his depiction says otherwise. Traces of Jack Nicholson peak through, but Heath Ledger’s impact is much more prominent — the long, greasy-green hair, the nervous ticks, the realism and concomitant departure from comic book movie stereotypes, the dread. How could anyone in the modern day play the Joker without thinking about Ledger? Phoenix and Ledger were friends, and few things need less repeating than the fact that Ledger’s Joker holds as one of the greatest performances of the 21st century, if not all time, so it makes sense that Phoenix would take inspiration from the master of the role (Jared Leto might’ve benefited from such awareness). Moreover, every Ledger-like strand in the DNA of Phoenix’s Joker swells with appreciation. No doubt Ledger would’ve applauded him. Yet, with all the Phoenix vs. Ledger speculation buzz, it makes sense that he’d deflect at a press conference. One mention like, “I took inspiration from…” would’ve turned the media into a dumpster fire of reductive commentary. Once again, Phoenix’s take is truly its own. Ledger’s Joker was a poised, confident, secure mastermind of chaos. Fleck is a purebred outcast, an abused puppy, a ticking bomb whose clock is broken — ready to explode with insecurity and psychosis at any moment. Sure, he never gets a fair shake. Despite all of the shit he trudges through, he puts himself out there time and time again, always bullied and maligned as a result. Co-workers plot deviously against him for no reason. He can’t even catch a break after getting mugged without his boss hovering the possibility of termination over his head. For a good portion of the film, Fleck isn’t a villain. We’re rooting for him, angry at every low life that gets a kick out of belittling him. But the sympathetic eye of Phillips’ camera becomes confusing early on. The film does a great deal of layperson’s philosophizing, but most of it can’t hold water. Especially, but not limited to, the socio-political musings, which are simultaneously tumbling out of college freshman’s mouths across the country post-Philosophy 101. For example, there’s an empty subplot in which Fleck’s first villainous actions accidentally incite class-based activist riots. “Kill the Rich!” the clown mask-adorned rioters scream, their chant infused with a sinister nature both ambiguous and undeserved. Are we supposed to root for the greed of the rich or the unwieldy slaughtering of them? Those are our two options. The riots become the backdrop for Fleck’s transformation, but Phillips muddies the ethics of the film so fervently, you can’t make out any decent intentions in the process. It has a “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” vibe, which, combined with the “bum rush the panopticon” vibe, seems like sheer moral anarchy. Art cannot be blamed for stirring violence in the masses because art doesn’t have agency. But it’s always fair to question the artist. Why would Phillips choose to glorify and empathize with a terrorist? Why would he weaponize the justice-craving masses in order to arm the titular villain? Maybe he’s just a nihilist? It’ll be interesting to hear what screenwriters Phillips and Scott Silver had in mind, because the final cut of the film has no intellectual identity. It doesn’t try to shove a message down our throats — which, in a film from a major studio, is always appreciated — but it doesn’t posit a thought-provoking thesis either. It simply has no clue what it’s trying to say. Unless it’s proudly suggesting that the emotional rollercoaster of pent-up incel insanity is valid cause for grotesque violence, in which case someone close to Phillips should hold an intervention or skip straight to the punchline and call the fuzz. Another thing seems overwhelmingly true after watching a film like Joker: the comic book movie’s “hard R” is every other genre’s middling R. The impetus behind the scant explicit material of the film is wanting, as if it craved the R rating solely for advertising purposes. This isn’t a judgment on the excess violence and vulgarity (or lack thereof); rather a suggestion that the team behind Joker might’ve asked the MPAA to add the “strong bloody” phrase in front of “violence” in order to send an extra thrill up the spines of the anticipatory viewers. Barring one scene, the violence is gravely understated by the effects that follow each blow. For example, Fleck is hammered across the face, but the blunt impact of the thick fist doesn’t leave a mark or strike blood. DC Black is clearly still in development. On the bright side, Joker thrives as an intimate character study, and has a wonderful cast of supporting characters that includes, in order of screen time, Robert De Niro as Late Show Host and Fleck’s comic idol, Murray Franklin, Zazie Beetz as a prop love interest, Bill Camp and Shea Wigham as stiff detectives, Marc Maron, and Brian Tyree Henry. Outside of the jock jam that soundtracks Fleck’s first full villain makeover, the music is perfect, songs like “Send in the Clown,” “White Room” (“I’ll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd/Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves”), and “That’s Life!” acting as scaffolding for the tight thematic energy. It’s nothing like a comic book movie, or a superhero film. Action is scarce, and when it strikes, it’s more cringe-worthy than fun. Joker is more like a Scorsese film than a new DCEU installment, with its pitiful, lawless subject a 1981 blend of Rupert Pupkin, Travis Bickle, and Christine Chubbuck. The story of Fleck is the story of your average stand-up comedian trying to make it in New York City/Gotham City. The only difference is that Fleck is willing to wreak havoc when he bombs. Of course, like most aspiring comedians, he never stood a chance in the first place. But maybe he already knew that, hence why his favorite joke reads, “I just hope my death makes more cents than my life.”",POSITIVE
"Sep 7, 2019"," The wildly anticipated sequel to Stephen King’s It once again features the demonic clown Pennywise — but this time around he ought to be renamed Poundstretcher, as his toothy scares go on and on for almost three hours, with diminishing effect. The original 2017 It became the highest-grossing horror movie ever, slowly building the dread as Bill Skarsgard’s smiling, villainous clown appeared in apparitions, drawing on a group of children’s worst nightmares, popping up like a ravenous Jack-in-the-box. After children started to mysteriously disappear in the town of Derry in Maine, the gang of seven kids, nicknamed The Losers’ Club, set out to confront the shapeshifting Pennywise. It: Chapter Two picks up the story 27 years later, as ominous red balloons signifying the return of Pennywise float over the town, and a young gay man dies a gruesome death near a funfair after a bone-cracking beating by thugs. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of The Losers’ Club who has remained in downbeat Derry, realises the forces of evil have re-emerged, and one by one calls on the rest of the gang to come home. Bill (James McAvoy) is a Hollywood screenwriter, Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is a fashion mogul, Eddie (James Ransone) is a risk assessor, Ben (Jay Ryan) is a property magnate, and Richie (Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. And it would enter spoiler territory to say what has happened to Stan (Andy Bean). But the adult Losers bring sharp wit and classy acting to the sequel, as each must return to a place of childhood trauma and fight their own demons, giving Pennywise a chance to do some particularly unpleasant shapeshifting. Hader is hilarious, hamming it up and making inappropriate, dry remarks at the scariest moments. McAvoy’s Bill is convincing as he revisits the sinister moment when his little brother Georgie died after being enticed into a sewer by Pennywise. Chastain’s Beverly has grown from a tomboy redhead into a powerful woman — except at home, where she is under the coercive control of her abusive husband. She is ready to break free, and now, to add an extra frisson, seems torn between her childhood admirers Bill and Ben, the latter of whom was once a chubby loner but now is, miraculously, a six-footer with a six-pack. The film regularly flashes back to the Eighties, using the original child cast members (two years older by the time of filming Chapter Two, so some of their faces had to be digitally de-aged). But the segues between the past and present are smooth, and screenwriters Gary Dauberman (of the horror Annabelle) and King himself, drawing on his 1986 novel, do a good job of keeping seven main characters’ stories gripping. Plus, there is another comeback from Henry Bowers, the psychopathic killer bully from the first film, who has not improved his social skills after nearly three decades in a mental hospital. Returning director Andy Muschietti creates that creepy, retro, small town atmosphere brilliantly, and some of the initial scenes are satisfyingly repulsive and terrifying. The mass hallucinations of the characters result in some of the creepiest haunted fortune cookies you will ever see, and the leper in the basement is always a winner. When Beverly goes back to the house she lived in with her abusive father, she finds it owned by a dear little old lady, Mrs Kersch, who invites her in for tea, and says helpfully: ‘You know what they say about Derry? No one who dies here really dies.’ Then it all kicks off when Mrs K gets naked. His unsettling, petulant voice is full of repressed laughter and his cheesy smile erupts into a huge red maw of needle-sharp teeth, before he indulges in heart-and-face-munching cannibalism. But as the movie jump-scares along, tension is lost as Pennywise morphs into increasingly ridiculous forms, teasing, attacking and retreating, because the show must go on. Rather than lurking evilly in the shadows, he comes out into the light in a superhero-style final battle that lasts for about half an hour. The cast desperately put on their scared faces again and again, as they are challenged by a killer cute puppy and gallons of gloopy fake blood. Fans of the first film will enjoy going down the sewer of memory lane with the adult Losers’ Club, but this is definitely not a cinema outing for anyone suffering from coulrophobia, ‘a persistent and irrational fear of clowns’. And as the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock once said: ‘The length of a film should be directly related to endurance of the human bladder’ — and It: Chapter Two just goes too far. Set before the 1976 military coup in Argentina, which overthrew President Isabel Peron, Rojo immerses itself in the lives of the butter-wouldn’t-melt middle classes, quietly profiting from corruption and staying safely silent as their Leftist-leaning neighbours mysteriously disappear. The real-life ‘Dirty War’ of state-backed terrorism targeted political dissidents and anyone associated with socialism. The film centres on lawyer Claudio (Dario Grandinetti), his wife and daughter, who increasingly find themselves sullied by their complicity. There is a quiet, thrilling tension to this film by Benjamin Naishtat. Every polite sentence is a metaphor for something worse, and the magnificent plains of Argentina make the human action seem disturbingly small. The stars of the show, in budgie-smuggler Speedos, are The Shiny Shrimps, an amateur water polo team from Paris with ambitions to compete in the upcoming Gay Games. But they find it difficult to take pool training seriously, and in this French film, Olympic swimmer Matthias Le Goff (Nicolas Gob) has to atone for making a homophobic remark on television by being sent to coach the Shrimps. The usual personal hurdles are overcome in mini-dramas for each member of the team, and they set off for the games in Croatia, which naturally requires a trip on a Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert-style double-decker with rainbow flag. It’s a fun outing, but no old-fashioned queer cliché is left unturned, and despite the fact the story is based on the real-life Shiny Shrimps, it often feels like this film is years behind the times. All I can say is if it were down to me to dish out the prestigious Golden Lion at the conclusion of the 76th Venice Film Festival this weekend, Joker would probably get the nod, with Babyteeth and Marriage Story also firmly in the frame. Joker, which I reviewed in Monday’s paper, is a provocative, witty, troubling, compelling interpretation of how Gotham City resident Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) began his evolution into Batman’s arch-enemy. Director Todd Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver have made Arthur a mentally-ill man, more sinned against than sinning — at least to start with. An adaptation of a play, it tells the deeply moving, at times hilarious, story of a cancer-stricken schoolgirl, Milla (Eliza Scanlen), whose parents (Ben Mendelsohn and Essie Davis, both superb) have to deal with her growing love for a 23-year-old drug addict and dropout, Moses (Toby Wallace). Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, with Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, is another funny, beautifully-observed film about family relationships, focusing on a couple trying to get divorced. I reviewed it briefly last week, so here I’ll just say: see it (★★★★✩/Netflix). For me, the disappointment of the festival was The Laundromat, Steven Soderbergh’s comedic take on the 2016 Panama Papers scandal, which uncovered massive international tax evasion and fraud. The story is intriguing, with Meryl Streep playing an ordinary widow whose insurance claim against a U.S. leisure-boat company starts the ball rolling towards the expose. Of the foreign-language films I saw in Venice, I greatly admired An Officer And A Spy, Roman Polanski’s grippingly faithful adaptation of Robert Harris’s excellent novel about the Dreyfus affair, which unfolded in late 19th-century France in a murky swirl of anti-Semitism. It’s tempting to wonder if Polanski, effectively exiled from the U.S. for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, sees a parallel between himself and Alfred Dreyfus, the upright army officer wrongly accused of treason. One hopes not.",POSITIVE
"Sep 7, 2019"," Joker is a dark twist on the comic-book movie origins story, inspired by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s seminal graphic novel The Killing Joke and Martin Scorsese‘s under-appreciated classic The King of Comedy. Joaquin Phoenix joins Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson in delivering a formidable Joker. It’s the most real version of Batman’s foe ever put to screen. Director Todd Phillips does away with the notion of superheroes and super-villains – and fantasy – entirely, preferring to bed his tale in mental health and thwarted ambition. For the most part, it works a treat. By the look of the cars and the typewriters on the desks, it’s the 1970s in Gotham City. Phillips avoids the usual gothic flourishes, his Gotham is also unmistakably a double for New York. According to the news clips we hear, there is a garbage crisis, and super-rats are everywhere. It looks incredible, if a little clean. The mentally unstable Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) lives at home with his mother (Frances Conroy), who calls him Happy. He’s a loner and has been in and out of hospital. He keeps a journal, writing jokes as they occur to him. He wants to be a stand-up and his favourite comedian is the TV star Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. The casting is a nod to The King of Comedy and De Niro revels in being the elder statesman in the Jerry Lewis role, to Phoenix’s Rupert Pupkin. In a twisted take on the ‘American dream’, Fleck kills three bankers who work for Wayne Enterprises on the subway, then high on adrenalin, gets the girl. The poor in the city hold the unknown murderer up as a hero. The billionaire entrepreneur Thomas Wayne, with his callous attitude and fake compassion is offered up as the film’s villain. But ultimately Phillips isn’t quite brave enough to go the whole hog.

Phoenix loves to play an unhinged oddball. His Joker is downbeat, nervous, vulnerable and confused, eschewing the physical ticks that were a feature of the late Ledger’s turn in The Dark Knight Returns. He’s not the confident showman that Jack Nicholson depicted in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman either. Taking a leaf out of The Killing Joke, his Fleck is an unreliable narrator and fantasist. As the film progressed, I started to feel unnerved by the depiction of mental illness, and the clichés trotted out to support the thesis of what makes a man into a psychopath. The film chastises cuts in services one moment and supports pill-popping the next. There is little complexity in the treatment of the topic in a movie that seems so desperate to appear complex. It becomes so portentous in its Batman lore-making that it starts to weigh this hitherto enjoyable comic-book movie down: in one cheesy scene, we see Bruce Wayne as a child.",POSITIVE
"Sep 7, 2019","After a lot of throat-clearing, Joker finally becomes the movie it wants to be, positioning its protagonist squarely as the antagonist in the Batman mythos we know so well.",POSITIVE
"Sep 5, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ Joker is deeply unsettling. It’s a film which follows you home at night, insidious and nightmarish. Such is the origin story of one of pop culture’s most recognisable villains.  It’s 1981 and Gotham is on the knife’s edge: garbage piles at every corner, streets are overrun by rats, and the rich blame the poor as public funding is cut and unemployment climbs. The world is falling apart, and Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) slowly paints his clown face, grimacing as a tear streaks down his cheek – this won’t be the story of the Joker you know, the film announces, but that of who came before. If Joker opts for a polite nod to DC lore, it nonetheless refuses to be limited by existing mythology, shaping itself into a standalone, deranged, neo-noir character study. This, without devaluing the role of others involved, is Phoenix’s film. The actor dropped a significant amount of weight for the role, the lost pounds serving to hollow out his face and darken his eyes, transforming his body into a disturbingly insect-like figure. When he moves, dances, runs, his body contorts and unfurls with pain. Arthur never feels truly human, but rather an imitation of a man. Take, for example, laughter; a very human trait. Yet in Phoenix’s hands, Arthur’s laughs are wrong, delirious, uncomfortable, painful. “Forgive my laughter. I have a condition” says the worn card he carries around with him – his laughter isn’t even laughter, but the sign of a man on the edge. Phillips dares the viewer to try and sympathise with his protagonist, placing him as a victim to beatings, to his mother’s needs, to a broken medical system that can no longer provide him his meds.  The director and co-writer presents situations that ought to stir pity for Arthur, perhaps even a level of understanding for his slow yet inevitable descent into violence, then interspaces them with reminders that this is a man who is not just empty and angry, but who is dishonest. Joker’s narrator is unreliable, showing us one thing only have it revealed these are just manifestations of his imagination. This builds a feeling of paranoia and distrust where, even when Arthur Fleck presents as a sad victim, you can’t help but question whether any of it is true.  And the further the film unravels, the further away Arthur feels. As his brutal murders evolve from being the result of a provocation, to revenge, to spite and finally enjoyment, the character comes into his own. Editor Jeff Groth builds tension to unbearable levels, climaxing in moments of catharsis for both the character and the audience. The former is soothed by the violence, enlivened by it, while the latter is relieved by the confirmation that no, this is not someone for whom to feel compassion. Gone are the pretences of humanity, freed is the Joker.  The film speaks to the rage of the disenfranchised, who in Gotham find their hero in the unknown killer clown, to no-hope politics, to social alienation. Where Heath Ledger’s Joker can be viewed as a reflection of 9/11, a terrorist who seemed to come out of nowhere strictly to cause pain and destruction, today’s Joker is the man who was there all along, on the outskirts of society, and who finds identity and meaning in violence. Joker is enthralling, stylish, smart, chaotic, and fundamentally disturbing; it’s a film which consumes you as you struggle to claw your way out.",POSITIVE
"Sep 5, 2019"," After the surprising inclusion of JOKER in Venice’s competition lineup, festival artistic director Alberto Barbera revealed in an interview that, to accommodate Hollywood studios’ common hesitance to enter their awards season hopefuls in competition for fear of bad perception if the prize horses don’t win anything, they offered Warner Brothers both a competition and an out-of-competition slot à la A STAR IS BORN last year, expecting to go with the latter. But apparently the studio and director Todd Phillips felt so confident about the movie that they went ahead and took up the more prestigious and riskier offer. And you know what? They’re right to feel that way. The origin story of the most famous villain in the world of comics, though not your typical festival film by any means and might not get much love from Lucrecia Martel’s jury, is likely to do gangbusters business at the box office on its way to awards glory, including surefire best actor nominations for Joaquin Phoenix. But let’s go easy on the hyperbole for a second. What kind of movie is JOKER anyway? As suggested in the trailers, it’s a gritty, grimy, glamor-free take on the underbelly of Gotham City that breeds a future criminal mastermind. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a struggling clown with a clinical laughing disorder who gets bullied on a daily basis for his appearance and demeanor. He lives with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy), dreams about making it to the talk show of hero Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) as a stand-up comedian, has a secret crush on his single-mother neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz). In short, this is a guy with very humble means. And as the movie progresses, we witness the last remaining support systems in Arthur’s life being pulled away and secrets about his connection to the powerful Wayne family revealed, sinking a guy who only ever wanted to make people laugh deeper and deeper into despair until finally he sees nothing but comedy in the cruel, godforsaken world around him. Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay, is an effective if not the most subtle storyteller. He communicates the overall atmosphere of mass apathy well, even if the repeated emphasis on Arthur’s predicament and the abuse he suffers might seem a bit excessive. Then again, when we reach the third act, where Arthur is truly falling apart and unwittingly ignited a city-wide revolution of nobodies, the broad, angry strokes of his direction do hit hard. The pivotal scene of Arthur appearing on the Murray Franklin show is staged and cut with such brutal bluntness it perfectly reflects the comically horrifying nature of the situation. There’s no getting around the fact, though, that Phoenix not only made the film, he is the film. Appearing in essentially every single scene, the notably Oscar-less actor played the role he was born to play and gave it his all. Arthur Fleck is a physically emaciated, behaviorally inadequate character prone to bouts of hysterical laughter. It’s an undeniably flamboyant part that requires lots of smiling cryfaces and manic outbursts. But the true essence of Phoenix’s performance, as always, lies in the quieter moments. Moments where he, after a ruthless homicidal act, shed the skin of Arthur Fleck to find the posture of the Joker through the course of a slow, macabre dance. Moments where he, after fulfilling his lifelong dream and realizing how he’s still being treated as the butt of the joke, calmly shares with a live TV audience the chilling, heartbreaking conclusions he’s come to. It’s in these moments, as well as those ordinary day-to-day exchanges between him and the impeccably cast supporting players (including De Niro via a wonderful role reversal from THE KING OF COMEDY), that you sense how Phoenix is dedicating his entire being to inhabiting such an utterly damaged character. There are a lot more details that comic book fans will pick up on, but ultimately what struck me the most about JOKER is that it’s an ode to and a requiem for the little people. Those who get chewed up and spit out by the system day in day out. Seen in the context of the movie, Gotham is not a made-up dystopia with crazy Joel Schumacher sets, but a very real, easily conceivable world where people have simply stopped caring about those in need. Meanwhile, Chilean director Pablo Larraín’s relationship drama EMA – a film that will not get a fraction of JOKER’s attention but is almost destined for some jury love – screened last night. This was one of my most anticipated titles of the festival, and sure enough it delivered the fireworks – even if in ways I wasn’t expecting. By far the most experimental film of the director to date, EMA is an impressionistic, erotically charged character study that confounds and dazzles in equal measure. The basic premise is immediately clear: Dancer Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo) and her choreographer husband Gastón (Gael García Bernal) can’t have kids and adopted a son, Polo. After Polo took to playing with fire and caused a horrible accident, the young couple gave him back for adoption in shock. This decision haunts Ema and eventually propels her to go on a journey to find her son and possibly also herself. With a filmography that includes NO, THE CLUB, NERUDA and JACKIE, at this point I think Larraín might in fact be incapable of doing something that’s not at least wildly interesting – which is certainly the case with EMA, his first feature after directing Natalie Portman to an Oscar nomination in the Jackie O biopic – but it’s so much more too. For the bulk of the film, the narrative is disorientingly fragmented. Ema gets into bitter arguments with Gastón, tries to find a new teaching job, hooks up with a married firefighter, hooks up with her divorce lawyer, hooks up with friends in disco-lit orgies … all the while random dance numbers choreographed to a sexy, psychedelic soundtrack are sprinkled throughout. Indeed, as much as I wouldn’t claim to know what the film is about exactly, I can tell that music and dance are an essential part of its conception. Not only do they map out the visual and aural DNA of a film that’s sensually arresting from start to finish, they provide the emotional beats the characters might not be able to articulate. As such, Jose Luís Vidal’s expressive, impassioned choreography must be credited while Nicolas Jaar’s strikingly stylish score with traces of deep house can safely be expected to top many a top 10 film music lists by year’s end. Di Girolamo is mesmerizing to watch as the inscrutable titular character. By turns aggressive, soulful and vulnerable, you can’t take your eyes off her even before her motivations and calculations are revealed in the last 10 minutes – a bona-fide contender for the best actress prize in a week’s time. That is, if the jury does not feel inclined to hand out even shinier statues to Larraín’s film, an investigation of a uniquely female experience that unfolds like a mystery and feels endlessly, defiantly alive every step of the way.",POSITIVE
"Sep 5, 2019"," At the crux of his melancholic, self-reflective essay “God’s Lonely Man”, Thomas Wolfe contends that loneliness is the inevitable fact of the human condition. It’s a very cynical notion to hold – life just isn’t that unequivocally tragic – but widely felt enough to become a common theme in the work of Hollywood auteurs. Without “God’s Lonely Man” we wouldn’t have Taxi Driver: the essay sits at the preface to Paul Schrader’s screenplay. Many of the Americanist classics, from John Schlesinger’s Midnight Cowboy to William Friedkin’s Cruising owe some degree of fidelity to Wolfe’s brand of nihilistic lonerism. And now, whether we like it or not, we have Todd Phillips’ Joker. It feels incredibly odd to weigh what is ostensibly a comic book film against all-timers of the Hollywood canon – directed by the visionary mastermind behind Starsky & Hutch, no less – but that’s the thing: this is far from your average Marvel popcorn flick. It’s bizarre. It’s confusing. It’s gratuitously violent. It upholds a questionable moral code, leaning into far-right populism. And, perhaps most remarkably of all, it’s actually quite good. Much like the aforementioned Taxi Driver, Joker envisions a sometime-in-the-Seventies Gotham City (an unambiguous stand-in for the former’s New York) saturated with filth, decay and vermin. A news report in the film’s opening refers to a pervasive, city-wide “very bad smell” and threats of “super rats”. Cut against the newsreels are shots of a clean-cut, suited-and-booted Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen): in Phillips’ nihilistic, aesthetically grotesque vision of the world, the traditionally philanthropic father of Bruce becomes a Trumpian, unsympathetic demagogue. One thing’s for sure: there’s little light breaking through this concrete jungle. The Taxi Driver influence is abundantly clear, too, in the characterisation of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), the man who later names himself “Joker”: he’s Travis Bickle in clown make-up, a disillusioned man on a virtuous path to wash the streets of filth. Where the two do separate is in the target of Fleck’s vigilantism – unlike Taxi Driver’s racially motivated malaise, Joker’s sights are on the one per cent. Fleck’s motivations aren’t nearly as hard to empathise with, either: he’s beaten down repeatedly, tortured physically and mentally by men who posture to be his superior. Past the maniacal laughter, fantasies of suicide and off-kilter jitters, Fleck seems to be a man trying to do genuine good. Like the PTSD-afflicted Joe in You Were Never Really Here (Phoenix’s most recently lauded role), he’s the primary carer for his mother (Frances Conroy), showcasing a manifestly sensitive side, albeit quite Psycho-esque. Much of his story, ultimately, is that of a well-meaning “nice guy” being punched downwards by the alpha males of the world. Worryingly so, even, given what his ultimate symbol of violent retort could represent to those of the 8chan ilk: men who see themselves as the persecuted victims of a society built on a genetic lottery for good looks and hyper-masculinity, the message board in question having become a breeding ground of a new generation of men who have gone out with a gun to murder their fellow citizens. Fleck’s first kills constitute a justifiable act of desperate self-defence – the subsequent bloodbath drags him away from redemption and toes a questionable ideological line. It all comes to a head in the film’s climax: an erratic Fleck, his final transition to Joker entirely consummated, justifies his brand of reactionary blood-spilling as a direct result of a society that just doesn’t care. The film shoots itself in the foot twice: firstly, through its awkwardly populist subtext which evokes the imagery of Anonymous and, by extension, far-right protests – the uprising we are asked to side with in Joker is unambiguously white and male; secondly, in its inability to hold any consistency in Joker’s characterisation. The latter feels symptomatic of a screenplay for which the bolts need to be tightened, though, rather than anything rooted in Phoenix’s performance. While I’m not entirely enamoured with the idea of Phoenix taking home any major acting awards next year, for which discourse is already beginning to bubble (Christ alive, the discourse for this film is going to be horrid), he carries much of Joker on his back. There’s a fair argument to be had of this being the best cinematic portrayal of the Joker yet, above and beyond that of Heath Ledger’s lauded role in The Dark Knight. Much of what shouldn’t work – his awkward interactions with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), Fleck’s love interest, spring to mind – are sold in entirety by Phoenix’s performance; if Joker ultimately proves anything it’s that he’s the best actor of his generation. What it doesn’t prove, however, is that a man who feels as lonely as Arthur Fleck is justified or logical in taking on the system: that’s a harder one for a film to confirm.",POSITIVE

"Sep 4, 2019"," Judging by some of the more excitable reports about the release of this electrifying movie, you would expect it to come not just with an 18 certificate, rather than the 15 it carries, but also a public health warning. It is also superbly conceived, written, directed and acted. Moreover, for a film with a comic-book lineage, telling the story of how Batman's arch-enemy came into being, it is refreshingly free of computer-generated effects.  On Monday, in London, I saw it again. The conditions couldn't have been more different; we were greeted afterwards by driving autumnal rain. But the impact was the same. The weather was the last thing on anyone's mind. Joker is a thunderously powerful character study of a man with a mental illness, and a ferocious indictment of a society that doesn't treat the mentally ill with the same compassion it shows to, say, cancer sufferers. That might make it sound worryingly like a cinematic lecture, but it's not Ken Loach behind the camera, it's Todd Phillips, who directed the Hangover films. Joker is still an exercise in entertainment. Indeed, I have rarely been so grippingly entertained. Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, who lives with his fragile mother (Frances Conroy) in a ramshackle apartment building in Gotham City. It is 1981. Gotham is New York City, blighted by crime, uncollected garbage and industrial unrest, in gossamer-thin disguise. Those of you who recall the Batman origin story should note that he has a young son called Bruce. If you also keep an eye on contemporary U.S. politics, you might wonder whether Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver used Donald Trump as their model. Arthur, meanwhile, is just about holding down a job as a professional clown, available for cheap promotional stunts, children's hospital visits, that sort of thing. He is disturbed, a loner with a Tourettes-style condition that compels him to laugh loudly and suddenly for no reason. He makes weekly visits to a social worker, who organises his medication, but Gotham's social services are being cut to the bone. Soon he will have nowhere to turn. 'The worst thing about having a mental illness,' he writes in his journal, 'is that people expect you to behave as if you don't.' Arthur dreams of being a stand-up comedian.  His hero is a TV talk-show host, Murray Franklin, splendidly played by Robert De Niro in a conspicuous nod to Martin Scorsese's 1982 satire The King Of Comedy. In that film, De Niro himself played the deranged stand-up comic, who was obsessed with a TV host played by Jerry Lewis. So Phillips and Silver don't mind acknowledging their influences. Another great Scorsese movie, Taxi Driver, from 1976 is invoked, too. Yet Joker is luminously original in the background it weaves for one of comic-book fiction's greatest baddies, and in the way it does so. Boldly, it even dares to let us sympathise with Arthur. He is creepy, yes; but victimised and misunderstood. Even when he commits his first murders, he has the audience's empathy. But I think Phoenix steps out of it. He has always been brilliant at conveying torment, for instance as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line (2005), and in The Master (2012), while of course he was a memorable villain in Gladiator (2000). That face helps; even in repose it looks slightly psychotic. Gotham is teetering on the brink of civil strife and it turns out to be Arthur, of all insignificant citizens, who nudges it over the edge. The man wanted for murder had a painted clown face, and suddenly clown masks are everywhere, a symbol of proletarian anger against Wayne and other masters of the universe.  Perhaps even more unexpectedly, he is invited to be a guest on The Murray Franklin Show, following the broadcast of a video of him dying, in comedic terms, in his stand-up debut. Like The King Of Comedy, Joker is a satire; an unforgettably brutal and brilliant one. So never mind, for the time being at least, the warnings that it could have a dangerous effect on already troubled minds. The last film his production company made was A Star Is Born (2018). This one, the first in a new franchise called DC Black, an offshoot from the DC Extended Universe series, could be subtitled A Supervillain Is Born. And how.  An air of menace and a cloud of controversy accompany the arrival of the new 'Joker' movie with the portrayal of the most famous villain in comic book history being arguably the most chilling twist on the character in 50 years.  There are no capes, no special powers and no battles between good and evil in the new film and the character has undergone a series of ever darker transformations from his early days as a campy clown with a mirthless laugh. When the film first aired at the Venice Film Festival in August, The Hollywood Reporter suggested it was the best Batman-adjacent movie since 'The Dark Knight' and predicted huge box office numbers.  The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern urged people to think of 'Joker' as 'both dental drill and Novocain' given it leaves you feeling numb and glum. A.O. Scott, of the New York Times, was more scathing about the hype and controversy that was stirred up surrounding the film ahead of its release.  'We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it's also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me?' he said.  'To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it.  'Joker,' an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity - as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage - the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.' ''Joker' is a wannabe movie that also wants to be all things to all viewers, that imitates the notion of adding substance while only subtracting it,' he wrote. 'Phoenix, alternately brooding and exulting, dancing extravagantly in his underwear or in a resplendent costume or seething with rage, cringing with horror, or camping it up with an affected accent, isn't so much unhinged as unmotivated and, to all appearances, undirected. ",POSITIVE

Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is unquestionably the boldest reinvention of “superhero” cinema since “The Dark Knight“; a true original that’s sure to be remembered as one of the most transgressive studio blockbusters of the 21st Century. It’s also a toxic rallying cry for self-pitying incels, and a hyper-familiar origin story so indebted to “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” that Martin Scorsese probably deserves an executive producer credit. It’s possessed by the kind of provocative spirit that’s seldom found in any sort of mainstream entertainment, but also directed by a glorified edgelord who lacks the discipline or nuance to responsibly handle such hazardous material, and who reliably takes the coward’s way out of the narrative’s most critical moments. “Joker” is the human-sized and adult-oriented comic book movie that Marvel critics have been clamoring for — there’s no action, no spandex, no obvious visual effects, and the whole thing is so gritty and serious that DCEU fanboys will feel as if they’ve died and seen the Snyder Cut — but it’s also the worst-case scenario for the rest of the film world, as it points towards a grim future in which the inmates have taken over the asylum, and even the most repulsive of mid-budget character studies can be massive hits (and Oscar contenders) so long as they’re at least tangentially related to some popular intellectual property. The next “Lost in Translation” will be about Black Widow and Howard Stark spending a weekend together at a Sokovia hotel; the next “Carol” will be an achingly beautiful period drama about young Valkyrie falling in love with a blonde woman she meets in an Asgardian department store. “Joker” is a movie about a homicidal narcissist who feels entitled to the world’s attention — a man who’d rather kill for a good laugh than allow the world to treat him like its punchline. It’s also a movie about the dehumanizing effects of a capitalistic system that greases the economic ladder, blurring the line between private wealth and personal worth until life itself loses its absolute value. Phillips, whose cinematic legacy was previously defined by the “Hangover” trilogy and that scene in “Road Trip” where he cast himself as a random creep who sucks on Amy Smart’s toes, has made a film that is somehow all of these things at once: It’s a visionary, twisted, paradigm-shifting tour de force and a bar-lowering mess of moral incoherence. It’s nothing less (and nothing more) than an agent of unbridled chaos. And we haven’t even gotten to Joaquin Phoenix yet, whose hypnotic and inimitable performance would feel completely new if it didn’t borrow so much from his past work. If Freddie Quell and Theodore Twombly stepped into the teleportation machine from “The Fly,” Arthur Fleck is who they would mutate into. Living in the margins of an early ’80s Gotham City that was rotting long before the garbage workers started their ongoing strike, the Pagliacci-esque Arthur is first introduced as he stares into a mirror and paints on the makeup that he’s forced to wear for his miserable day job; even in a room full of self-loathing clowns, this guy still feels like a special kind of sad. Emaciated and rippling at the same time, Arthur looks like a werewolf who got interrupted mid-transformation (which might explain his stringy mop of wet black hair). He’s one of the downtrodden — one of God’s unfortunate creatures. And just to make things worse, he suffers from a Pseudobulbar affect, which results in uncontrollable episodes of hysterical laughter (he carries a laminated card that he hands out to apathetic strangers who look at him askance, a ritual that would make anyone feel sorry for themselves). If Christopher Nolan’s Joker was an inscrutable force of nature, Phillips’ couldn’t be more human — all of his eccentricities are explicitly diagnosed. That literalness has its virtues, but it can also be insufferable; Phillips blurs fantasy and reality in the same way that Scorsese did in “The King of Comedy,” but he insists on doubling back and drawing a clear line between fact and fiction. It’s one of the many ways that “Joker” poses as a movie worthy of serious thought, but lacks the courage to behave like one. Phoenix, meanwhile, follows his own muse wherever the hell he wants. Once the Joker bleeds through, he becomes mesmerically unpredictable. The essence of Phoenix’s performance — and the most lucid example of why it’s a worthy complement to Heath Ledger’s lip-smacking, carnival-esque take on the character — is that it’s always hard to tell if Arthur is laughing or crying, or which reaction would make the most sense. Who among us can’t relate? Gotham is overrun with super rats, Trumpian billionaire Thomas Wayne is running for office and claiming that he’s the only one who can help the city’s poor, and Arthur’s mom (Frances Conroy) still insists on calling her son “Happy” because she sees his condition as evidence that he “was put here to spread joy and laughter.” The world is a joke, and it’s on him. But Arthur is so close to turning things around — he just has to realize that his life is actually a comedy (easier said than done in a movie so desperate to be taken seriously that it can’t afford to have a sense of humor). Maybe he can become a comedian, like his hero Murray Franklin: Robert De Niro, graduating from Rupert Pupkin to Jerry Lewis’s Jerry Langford, plays the late night TV show host as a savage parody of Jay Leno. The extended Batman universe, so fascinated by masks and other layers of unreality, has always been attuned to the way that lonely Americans forge most of their connections through television, and “Joker” is at its best when digging into that particular darkness. But Arthur is too isolated to understand what makes other people laugh. In his journal/joke diary, he scrawls that “the worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as though you don’t.” Anyone with a heart can sympathize with that, and anyone with a similar history can probably see themselves reflected in those words. Arthur is established as a poor soul, not a pariah, and Phillips is fooling himself if he thinks the rest of the movie does enough to muddy the water. On both a personal and a political scale, “Joker” finds that things in this world need to be very, very bad before people can actually be bothered to change them. Trauma is transformative. Arthur doesn’t hit bottom until three drunken finance bros attack him on the subway, and he kills them in self-defense. Well, he kills some of them in self-defense. The next thing he knows, the news is full of breathless reports about an unidentified clown murdering some up-and-coming employees of Wayne Enterprises, and the tension between Gotham’s haves and its have-nots begins to boil over. The city needs to be saved, but Bruce Wayne is still just a child. Someone else will have to step up. Not that Arthur has any interest in spearheading a cause. Put a microphone in his face and he’ll yowl that he “doesn’t believe in anything.” Yeah, he wants the world to look at itself in the mirror — the way he has to every morning — but really he just wants a hug, and for someone to tell him that he’s really there. While “Joker” often plays like a beat-for-beat remake of “The King of Comedy,” that movie was about a talentless man who was convinced that he was special; this movie, by contrast, is about a talented man who swallows the red pill and becomes convinced that nobody is. That perspective allows Phillips to feign an apolitical stance and speak to the people in our world who are predisposed to think of Arthur as a role model: lonely, creatively impotent white men who are drawn to hateful ideologies because of the angry communities that foment around them. It’s a confused and self-negating approach to a movie that sees personal revenge as a viable spark for political revolution, and a profoundly dangerous approach to a movie that’s too self-impressed by its own subversiveness to see Arthur as anything but a hero. Lawrence Sher’s gorgeous and grimy cinematography fawns all over Joker, the swooning and weightless close-ups watching Phoenix do his Twyla Tharp-like clown dance like he’s possessed by the holy spirit. But Phillips’ direction abjectly fails to put us inside Arthur’s head — to risk the more nuanced identification that would come from a more subjective camera. As “Joker” emerges from a turgid second act for an operatic grand finale, the film grows drunk on its own unexpected grace. There are moments of shocking violence, but mostly Philips is swept away by Arthur’s newfound power. There’s a fundamental difference between telling a story like this in the form of a dingy, misanthropic art film like “Taxi Driver” and telling it in the universal language of a superhero movie that’s going to open in multiplexes the world over. In this context, that story can’t help but feel aspirational. And Phillips is the first person to be seduced by its pull — to be helplessly pulled along by an innate desire to see Joker at the height of his power. “Joker” is a movie about how fucked up people can exist in a fucked up world — a movie that insists to the bitter end that one does not negate the other. Arthur isn’t deranged because Gotham is a garbage town, and Gotham isn’t a garbage town because people like Arthur are deranged. Rich or poor, bad guys are the only ones who think like that. And yet, for decades on end, Batman and the Joker have continued to invent each other because we’re all stuck on an endless seesaw between heroes and villains, order and chaos. As the news anchor puts it: The only answer for super rats is super cats. But Phillips, stuck between reinventing the superhero movie from the ground up and throwing a cheap disguise on the same dumb origin story we’ve already seen 1,000 times, needs his Joker to be both the light and the dark, the yin and yang, the only sane man in a world gone mad. He needs to have his cake, and to smear it all over his face in a big red smile too. The result is an immaculately crafted piece of mass entertainment that wants to be all things to all people, less a Rorschach test than a cinematic equivalent of Schrödinger’s Cat that leaves us feeling like the movie, and the current state of studio filmmaking itself, might actually be dead and alive at the same time. By the time “The End” comes in its cute, old-timey font, “Joker” is neither a game-changer nor just “another day in Chuckletown.” It’s both. It’s good enough to be dangerous, and bad enough to demand better. It’s going to turn the world upside down and make us all hysterical in the process. For better or worse, it’s exactly the movie the Joker would want. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Sep 3, 2019"," What makes the Joker such a threatening villain? Until now, he’s been a psychopathic enigma, wreaking havoc across Gotham and taunting Batman with his maniacal cackle. But Todd Phillip’s Joker attempts to dive into the psyche of the iconic villain, fishing around in murky waters for over 2 hours in the hope of revealing an explanation for such evil. While the Wayne family do make an appearance in the film, Joker plays as more of a spin-off solo tale rather than part of the current DC Extended Universe (Jared Leto appeared as the Joker in 2016’s Suicide Squad, and is slated to appear in two more films in the same role) While not directly referencing other superhero movies, much like Christopher Nolan’s Oscar winning Batman trilogy, Joker draws on decades of source material; Arthur’s storyline takes some influence from Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s critically acclaimed 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, in which The Joker is a failed stand-up comedian. Much of Joker actually draws from 70s and 80s American cinema instead of the recent span of superhero movies, taking influence from Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy in both its main character and in its depiction of a city in decay. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck who, fresh out of a psychiatric hospital and working as a clown, is determined to become a stand-up comedian, despite the fact that even his own mother doesn’t think he’s funny. As he’s slowly abandoned by his support system, he’s left to spiral out of control and be consumed by the chaos mounting on the dark streets of Gotham. Phoenix has lost a considerable amount of weight to play the Joker, and it’s an incredibly physical performance that may remind some of his role as a hulking contract killer in Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here. He dances, twists and contorts his battered body into angular, jutting shapes, his mental state manifesting itself in his movements. Joker is told mostly from Arthur’s perspective, and he proves to be a highly unreliable narrator as he dreams up scenarios in his head, the reveries playing out in the film as if they’re really happening. Nodding to The King Of Comedy, a twinkling eyed Robert DeNiro makes an appearance as Murray, the comedy talk show host that Arthur fantasises about meeting and being validated by. The film begins in a pretty dark place – Arthur is mugged by a gang of teens – and it only gets more and more miserable as it goes on, with no relief in sight. There are some jokes, but they feel in bad taste, largely aimed at marginalised characters. Gotham City is impressively grimy and helps build an ominous atmosphere, but there’s nothing hopeful to hold on to here: just cynicism, and when a serial murderer is the only character available to sympathise with, it feels like Phillips is pushing the audience towards trying to understand a character not deserving of being understood. Joker tries to question the exploitation of mental illness for entertainment, and the consequences of society abandoning its weakest members. But the film is in turn, exploiting mental illness and using it as an excuse for Arthur’s nefarious actions. This feels tone-deaf in a time where mental illness is being wrongly linked to mass violence in the US. The film is aware enough to draw from great films about toxic masculinity and loneliness, but not enough to critique Arthur’s behaviour instead of painting him as a helpless loner driven to violence by forces out of his control.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 3, 2019"," Todd Phillips’s dark origin story for Batman’s nemesis soars past its troubling ideological confusion on a cascade of Scorsese references and a killer performance from Joaquin Phoenix.  When Arthur Fleck laughs, it’s as if the laughter is being ripped from his lungs. It seems to rattle through his whole body, and his eyes look pained, as if he might be sobbing instead. It’s a condition, according to a little card that he must carry for medical purposes, a sort of Tourettes Syndrome, and the peal of mirthless hysterics comes abruptly and uncontrollably. It happens on the bus, where it alarms children, and on stage during Arthur’s hopelessly bad attempts at stand-up comedy. What might seem absurd on paper – the classic comic book villain’s maniacal laughter explained in this manner – works inexplicably well in situ. Arthur is played by Joaquin Phoenix in another one of those performances that would look far worse had anyone else tried it. He depicts our Gotham villain-to-be as a lonely, mentally ill man living with his elderly mother in an increasingly dank, dangerous city circa 1981. The hyperreal, grimy production design is wreathed in sallow yellow and murky green, and Arthur keeps away the nightmarish loneliness of the city around him by dreaming of a life as a beloved comedian. Initially, Arthur seems like a gentle soul, clearly incapable of social interaction and oblivious to cues, but his particular strain of weirdness is alarming enough to attract bullies. He is twice beaten up by people on the street, laughed at by strangers and ostracised in his day job as a party clown. A colleague gives him a gun for self-protection, and this is – pointedly, I think – the moment when a bedroom-dwelling weirdo is transformed into something far more sinister. His whip-thin torso twists like a corkscrew as he dances through his living room, doing an old-school show-biz shuffle with a .38 in hand. He’s backsliding, and his transformation into the Joker has begun. This is madness, as Phoenix plays it, that is both suffocatingly disturbing and surprisingly sympathetic, even as he grows increasingly bent on destruction. Todd Phillips has stolen wholesale chunks from the work of Martin Scorsese, especially Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1984). The former inflects the whole cityscape and the visual elements of the film, for example in the shots of Arthur watching his droning TV set with a loaded gun in hand. He even has a journal, much like the real-life vigilante Arthur Bremer, the man Travis Bickle was modelled on. I’m sure the character’s first name is no accident. Quoting so liberally from these two masterpieces doesn’t exactly flatter their imitator, but perhaps the best way to deal with that is to own up to it: this is likely why Arthur’s idol, TV host and talk show comic Murray Franklin, is played by Robert De Niro, picking up the Jerry Lewis role in King of Comedy with suitably glossy self-importance. Joker not only imitates these movies but seems to be an exercise in imagining Scorsese’s maladjusted men in a place where they find some level of satisfaction. Arthur is a monster, and we know it; but he’s also a subversive agent of chaos striking out against Thomas Wayne, an unfeeling millionaire running for mayor of Gotham. There’s a plot strand around the lack of social safety net that has taken away Arthur’s ability to obtain psych meds. This all feels very in keeping with a liberal worldview. The trouble is that its lionising of the loner-hero is also just as easily associated with the rhetoric of the Trump supporter; common folk who are sick of perceived elites, using violence as a means to empower themselves. This might be the greatest issue with Joker, that the ideological mish-mashing feels confusing; right-on in one moment and uncomfortable in the next. Narratively, there are real moments of shock, degradation and exhilaration in the film, and certainly this is true of its performance from Phoenix, who is magnetic. Ideas-wise, it’s only slightly less superficial than so many other comic book movies, but on pure entertainment factor, it’s a thrill to watch.",POSITIVE
"Sep 3, 2019",Phoenix and Phillips together have crafted something extraordinarily special. An exhilarating character study on the parameters of loneliness with a chilling assessment of the choking and deliberating effects of a morbid society.,POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2019"," The Joker would seem like catnip for any actor willing to throw himself down the rabbit hole because, as far as movie audiences are concerned, he only has one defining characteristic: he’s nuts. It’s a pretty large playground to frolic in filled with opportunities for an actor to let their id run free. Jack Nicholson’s take was more in line with Cesar Romero’s campy and cackling TV version, which, given that it was for director Tim Burton, seemed darkly comical at the time. Now it’s just comical in a ridiculous way that’s hard to take seriously. Heath Ledger, by dint of playing the role in a Christopher Nolan film, made the character a weaponized Nihilist, the worst-case scenario of a Seattle grunge wastrel who went insane after watching too many post-apocalyptic movies with his bedroom door closed while sniffing glue. The performance blew our doors off; the fidgety demeanor, the darting eyes and the way his tongue would fly around his mouth as if licking his lips for another chance to remind us that the world will end in fire. It permanently readjusted our expectation of what character could be. It seemed destined to become, in these troubled and confusing times, the definitive reading of the character and maybe it still is. But in director Todd Phillips’ relentlessly grim, stand alone film, Joker, Joaquin Phoenix does something not even Ledger could do and it’s startling to watch: he takes all the joy and humor out of the Joker. This Joker is not campy nor is he cool. He is a black hole of psychological damage and dangerous instability. Ledger made it safe for the Joker to not be funny. Phillips and Phoenix, as much as can be hoped for when a big studio crosses its fingers and messes with valuable IP, has done something even more surprising: they made him truly sick. In this telling, of course, Arthur Fleck is Travis Bickle. Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver is the touchstone for Phillips, something he has admitted, and while that might be one reason to dismiss the film outright it’s actually a major reason the film works. Its debt to the Scorsese classic is evident but Joker creates its own world of dank, hopeless urban alienation and tells its own tale of class-based chaos and its newfound champion. It visually traffics in yesterday but its concerns feel like today, if not right this second. Mark Friedberg’s production design is both a nightmare vision and realistic depiction of urban decay. The grit, the heat and the “super rats” of a big city in decline becomes the fetid, barren soil from which Arthur, already a mentally unstable collection of inappropriate responses and anti-social behavior, can grow.  What allows him to become Joker is not one defining event that pushes him off a cliff but rather a succession of indignities that nudge him ever so slowly into the abyss. And it begins in the first few minutes as Arthur, sign-spinning on the street in his inglorious job as a rent-a-clown, gets roughed up by some punks. In these early moments, the sad clown laying prone in an alley after a serious beatdown, we actually feel sorry for him. “I just don’t want to feel so bad any more,” he says to a city-employed shrink, someone who barely cares about him and doesn’t (in Arthur’s view) even listen to him. And when city cutbacks takes this key lifeline away from him, it’s representative of a system that, to society’s detriment, doesn’t care about its mentally ill. After that, there’s precious little left to keep Arthur from sinking right to the bottom and becoming a full-blown nut-job. Arthur’s only remaining tether to reality is his odd but loving relationship with his mother, Penny (Francis Conroy). A sickly and weird bird who one can imagine being the mother of a future psychopath, Penny spends most of her day watching television. Often she’s waiting for a new TV interview featuring her former boss Thomas Wayne. Penny holds out the pathetic hope this soon-to-be Gotham City mayoral candidate will help Penny and Arthur out of their dire financial straits. Mostly though, bonkers mom and her screw-loose son enjoy watching Live with Murray Franklin, a late night talk show whose eponymous host Arthur fantasizes about as being the father he never had. As a notoriously bad talk show guest in real life, Robert De Niro may seem like a risky choice to play a late night host. But the casting is clever for obvious reasons: De Niro was not only the title Taxi Driver but he was also deranged fan, Rupert Pupkin, who’ll do anything for a spot on the late night talk show hosted by Jerry Lewis in Scorsese’s 1983 The King of Comedy. De Niro, who has almost completely destroyed his legacy with his long running series of lousy choices (Rocky and Bullwinkle, anyone?), is perfectly cast here even if he’ll never make anyone forget Johnny Carson. Co-writers Phillips and Scott Silver make a wise choice from the get-go: Joker is strictly a character piece. He’s not planning a bank robbery nor is he trying to defeat the hero. He has no goal. This is the story of one man’s descent into madness on a rocket that reaches escape velocity when Arthur, on the subway and carrying a pistol given to him by a colleague, guns down three Wall Street douchebags who were taunting him. This triple murder introduces a class warfare layer to the film, as newspaper headlines blare, “Kill the Rich: A New Movement?” and Arthur begins to see a part for himself in the growing citywide discontent. This is where Todd Phillips (the Hangover films, may we remind you) shows a surprising level of maturity as a writer and a director. That Joker would become a symbol of the riotous discontent of the working man against the ruling elite might seem “so very now” but its class warfare component really isn’t a political statement: it’s the ultimate extension of what Arthur Fleck always wanted but, in a world that on a good day merely ignores him, failed to achieve: to be noticed (cue the wackadoodle “incel” comparisons). As we learn more about Arthur’s upbringing, one that teasingly introduces a connection to the Wayne family, there are those who will argue that Arthur is ultimately just another product of a bad childhood and how boring is that? But don’t mistake that as taking the easy way out. Phillips finds avenues to explore that make the cliché feel part of a deep dive into the elements that might turn such a kid into a raving, murderous sociopath. As a study of man’s psychotic meltdown, Joker is way more interesting than other more sober-minded takes on the subject and not just because a DC comic film isn’t beholden to reality. But it all comes down to Phoenix. The 3-time (about to be 4-time) Oscar nominee is all-in, losing enough weight to reveal his ribs and angular shoulder blades. His cackle comes from so far deep in his belly that it’s indistinguishable from a cry. It’s a laugh less cartoonishly maniacal than it is a shriek from his soul, an ear-splitting screech so unexpected that when it erupts he hands those around him a laminated card explaining that he has a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably.  Phoenix show us what happens when a lifetime of disappointments, held in check by seven medications, is finally unleashed, a wound with the scab ripped off and ready to spread like flesh-eating bacteria. When he emerges, fully formed, in his brick red sportcoat, orange vest and green shirt (that outfit alone will earn costume designer Mark Bridges an Oscar nomination), he is not just one of pop culture’s great villains emerging newly reconsidered by one of America’s great actors. At that moment, the one where Arthur Fleck becomes a howling, murderous walking personification of loneliness and mental illness gone nuclear, he is truly dressed for success.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2019"," What if a comic book movie wasn’t a superhero movie? What if it was stripped of all fantasy and derring-do and recast in grim reality and the style of vintage Martin Scorsese? No heroes, no fight sequences, no damsels in distress. Now that sounds truly fantastical. Yet here it is. Todd Phillips’ Joker is not a reboot but a reinvention of a movie genre, elevated above all by a frighteningly good performance from Joaquin Phoenix. This Gotham City is a grimy landscape of garbage-strewn streets, rats and rampant hoodlums that resembles Taxi Driver-era New York and is shot in the same sickly light. But you gotta laugh, right? Well, you do if you’re Arthur Fleck. He is physically compelled to do so by a neurological condition that causes him to guffaw hysterically — and usually out of context. For him, laughter is not the best medicine; he is in desperate need of the mood stabilisers dispensed by his social worker. But then she has her funding cut, signalling a sociopolitical commentary that will gradually bubble up and infuse the primary story. In the meantime, where can he go, this semi-professional street clown and skinny momma’s boy, after he loses his job? Into stand-up comedy, of course — a milieu where damaged depressives can blend in and make a living out of their dysfunction. And from there — or so he hopes — on to the TV talk show fronted by Robert De Niro’s cornball host. By this point the film has already set off alarm bells of recognition for anyone who knows Scorsese’s The King of Comedy, but the casting of De Niro in the Jerry Lewis role from that film is a neat inversion. For this is a voraciously postmodern movie. It’s not just Scorsese; there are numerous other 1970s reference points. Example: the opening in which Fleck chases thugs down the city blocks in full clown costume recalls Popeye Doyle giving chase in a Santa outfit in The French Connection. The soundtrack too is canny: you recoil at the sound of a Gary Glitter tune before realising that he too was a heavily made-up entertainer who became a personification of evil. But what, you may wonder, about The Caped Crusader? This is not his movie. We get a few brief glimpses of Bruce Wayne, a few more of his father, an overbearing and arrogant magnate who may remind you of a certain New York real estate billionaire. The political subtext that emerges is more than evident and surprisingly angry for a mainstream blockbuster — just another way in which this film breaks the mould. Where on earth did all of this come from, Todd Phillips? It certainly wasn’t there in frat boy comedies Road Trip, Old School or The Hangover. Above all, Phoenix is electrifying and alarmingly convincing. Having played another, bulkier type of Taxi Driver-like loner in Lynne Ramsay’s 2017 You Were Never Really Here, he looks like he hasn’t eaten or slept since. It’s such a sustained feat of wide-eyed intensity and physical contortion that the mind boggles. Yes, he deserves all the awards but he’s almost too good for them. Not only does he outdo Jack Nicholson’s Joker, he is on a par here with the actor of Cuckoo’s Nest and The Shining. For this is above all a psychological picture, a portrait of descent into madness and madness into dissent. Forget the Dark Knight films, so widely lauded for their “darkness”. Joker is dark in a horribly plausible way, and it’s more nuanced than good vs evil — in fact it has a touching sympathy for its devil that springs from actuality and does not allow it to be empty escapism. Looming over the film is the spectre of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado cinema shooting, which left 12 dead and took place during a showing of The Dark Knight. Joker, surely, is a direct reaction to that, an impassioned cry for better care of the mentally ill. The film makes that explicit — almost too explicit — in Fleck’s final monologue. Like the best of the New Hollywood classics it references, this is a film that exhilarates and unsettles while having something to say about today. It is a graphic illustration of how damaged loners, if left untreated, can become dangerous to themselves and others. And not a bat in sight.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2019"," “I used to think my life was a tragedy but now I realise it’s a f***ing comedy,” says Arthur Fleck, the anti-hero played by Joaquin Phoenix in Todd Phillips’ sublime Joker, which received its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival at the weekend. As most will know, the Joker is the arch enemy of DC Comics’ Batman, but this origin story is far removed from the Caped Crusader stories before it. Rather, Philips draws from the touchstones of 1970s Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, for a story about a disturbed loner with deep-rooted psychological problems. While it’s not entirely clear when the film is set, at one point we see a cinema marquee advertising Brian De Palma’s Blow Out, which would suggest 1981; there’s also a shop front advertising video games, so the timeline is somewhat fluid. What matters is that this is a grimy vision of Gotham, where the garbage men are on strike and gangs of kids will beat you to the ground. Fleck is a professional clown with dreams of becoming a stand-up comic; there are clear nods to another great Scorsese movie, The King of Comedy, with Robert De Niro here playing Murray Franklin, a chat-show host Fleck fantasises about meeting. Cursed with a condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate moments, Fleck lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and is all but invisible to those around him. He’d love to date his neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz), if only he had the courage to ask her. Gradually, events conspire to reshape Fleck, as cracks begins to appear in his already fragile psyche. Phillips and his co-writer, Scott Silver, do an admirable job of depicting a restless, decaying city, and offer a compelling portrait of mental illness and the way society ignores those most in need, with Fleck a symbol of the latter. Some of the most touching scenes see him deep in conversation with his social services adviser. Naturally, Joker touches on the Batman mythology, although in some ways this is the least interesting aspect of the film – certainly when you’ve got Phoenix going full tilt. Arguably, he’s ventured into this territory before, in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, but his transformation here is utterly compelling to watch. It’s one of the most wrenching performances of the year.",POSITIVE

"Sep 1, 2019"," ""Welcome to Fear City"", rezaba el panfleto político creado por la policía de Nueva York para amenazar al alcalde de la ciudad y entregárselo a los turistas a mediados de los años 70. La crisis civil y la ola de crímenes decrecieron, pero el concepto permaneció en la historia. Lo han tratado películas como 'Taxi Driver' o 'Malas Calles', pero también cómics como 'Sin City' o 'Watchmen'. El de la ciudad corrupta y degenerada es un concepto muy potente que hace resonar en nosotros algún tipo de verdad. Por supuesto, no hay ningún universo que más haya explotado esta visión sobre Nueva York que el de Gotham, así que sería lógico que esta idea apareciese en algún grado por la nueva película de Todd Phillips. Pero de ahí saltamos a la siguiente cuestión, la que está inexorablemente unida a la constante contradicción de la figura del Joker. Contar su origen es explicarle, y explicarle es el primer paso para sanarle. Entonces, ¿es el comediante en verdad un producto de sus circunstancias, del ecosistema urbano y social que vive; se trata más bien de un auténtico e irreconciliable agente del caos; o es, en el fondo, la criatura más cuerda del universo? Aunque el guión introduce en ocasiones pequeños juegos malabares vacilando con todas las opciones, Joker termina por casarse con la primera. Así, la de Joker es la historia de la Fear City. La del pánico moral que supuestamente nos aflige y que también están explorando sagas recientes como 'La Purga', de la que algunos periodistas nos hemos acordado durante el pase de prensa de esta mañana en Venecia. Se ve que es un tema que ahora mismo está tocando alguna fibra sensible.  'Joker' no es en absoluto el desastre que algunos de sus tráilers anticipaban. Tampoco estamos ante una fantasía del arte y ensayo, sigue siendo una superproducción altamente controlada en la que se siente que se han aparcado ciertos elementos que faciliten la supervivencia de la franquicia y de su campaña de marketing. La trama y el montaje están perfectamente ensamblados de forma que ni a los espectadores con déficit de atención se les escapen los mensajes de la película. Pero es un buen entretenimiento en el que, como mínimo, se han hecho esfuerzos por combinar ideas rupturistas con un fan service para con los espectadores del cine de superhéroes (o de la visión estereotipada de estos espectadores que podrían tener los hombres de los despachos). La presencia de alguien tan apasionado con la actuación como Joaquin Phoenix ayuda, indudablemente, pero también es verdad que hay momentos en que la cámara se pavonea de forma muy poco elegante de su transformación física y psicológica, como si fuese un “celebrities” chanante del intérprete. De lo que no escapa la cinta, ni quiere, es de la atmósfera grave del Batman de Nolan, de ese mal llamado cine de superhéroes “adulto”, razón por la que, sospechamos, sus responsables han buscado que el origen del villano sea plausible en el mundo real, lo que a su vez, sospechamos, condiciona que esa explicación más sencilla de nuestro Joker sea la de un sistema socioeconómico en plena putrefacción. Volviendo con el principio, una pregunta que podríamos hacernos es si ese Joker por el que se ha decantado la película es el que nos gusta, si no resonaría con más fuerza el potente mito del payaso loco con un enfoque sobre sus raíces más ambiguo. Durante una de las escenas más tensas de la película el propio Arthur Fleck ya completamente metamorfoseado en Joker lo dice así a cámara. Él no quiere casarse con la masa enfurecida contra el poder que monta barricadas y mata a policías en las calles que él mismo ha provocado. No es ningún justiciero anti 1%. Pero tampoco es un simple enfermo mental, como dictan desde el otro lado. Él sería, en buena parte, un continente vacío en el que cada uno de nosotros proyecta los deseos semióticos que queremos ver. Esto se dice en voz alta. Para acto seguido dar rienda suelta a un carrusel de imágenes-mito que glorifican el “4 the lulz”.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2019"," What is there yet to be done with a character like the Joker? Bruce Wayne’s bête noire has been around almost as long as the Caped Crusader himself, which is to say: a really long time. The character first appeared in Batman #1 in 1940 as war was raging in Europe and one of the biggest films of the year was by another great clown. Director Todd Phillips might not exactly have had that in mind when he sat down to write Joker–even if his new movie is rife with nods to Chaplin and American cinematic lore. Phillips will, however, have considered the performances of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and, yes, Jared Leto as he thought of ways to turn the great super-villain into an antihero for the 99% bros (and maybe the redpill bros). With thanks to a typically dedicated, tectonic-plate-shifting Joaquin Phoenix performance, he basically pulls it off. Phillips’s career has gone from Old School to The Hangover to The Hangover III. Not exactly an eclectic mix by anyone’s standards, so the hiring of Scott Silver, whose back catalogue of tough Hollywood working-class stories includes 8 Mile and The Fighter, seems a shrewd move. Martin Scorsese was once attached as a producer, and Phillips and Silvers borrow liberally from the great director’s movies–mainly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy–to give us a grimy and very Scorsese vision of Gotham, one that appears to be an ersatz 1981 New York–or, as J.C. Chandor once alluded to, the city’s most violent year on record. We spot Blow Out and Zorro, The Gay Blade playing at the local theater. The streets are filled with trash from that year’s infamous binmen strike. Much for our burgeoning Travis Bickle to wash away, it would seem. Phoenix begins the film as Arthur Fleck, a down-and-out street clown who takes a beating in the opening minutes while on the job. Fleck lives with a sickly mother fro whom he cares at the expense of his sanity and social life. (If the movies have thought us anything, it is that this kind of living situation is best avoided.) Ms. Fleck (Frances Conroy) used to work for Thomas Wayne (canon?) and harbors a delusion that the powerful man will one day save them from their relative squalor. In a knowing and delightful homage to The King of Comedy, Fleck fantasizes about going on a Late Night show in which the host, Murray Franklin, is played by Robert De Niro. He also dreams of becoming a standup and takes a liking to a neighbor (Zazie Beetz) who he invites to see him perform at the comedy club. Beetz is just one of a fine little group of supporting characters and bit-part performers–these include the ever-welcome faces of Brian Tyree Henry and Marc Maron. It is also nice to see De Niro having a blast onscreen for a change, it really has been a while. Hildur Guðnadóttir, the Icelandic cello supremo responsible for scoring Sicario and Arrival, brings the appropriate levels of bombast. Frequent Phillips collaborator Lawrence Sher shoots it with aplomb. None of which would be worth a damn without Phoenix’s committed performance–about equal parts Freddie Quell, Joe from You Were Never Really Here, Fred Astaire, and Rupert Pupkin, all crossed-over intensity, flailing limbs, and physical comedy. Or: more Ledger than Leto, and worth the price of admission alone. For all its merits, however, Joker relies on too much exposition as it attempts to shape a digestible origin story. The plot device, for instance, used to explain Fleck’s impromptu bursts of laughter is at best unimaginative, at worst just plain clunky. Phillips also makes hard work of the character’s transition into murderous maniac, despite one apparent bombshell that we will not even dream of laying a finger on. What exactly this film is taking aim at is also up for debate. Fleck’s beefs are with the wealthy, the bullies, the ones who “made it,” the ones who forget society’s downtrodden, and so on. (Thankfully he mostly leaves the women who won’t talk to him alone.) When looking back at The Dark Knight–and in particular the scene when Ledger’s Joker sets fire to the mountain of cash–in his 2012 book Film After Film, the great J. Hoberman noted that, given the timing of that film’s release during the financial crisis, what really made the Joker scary in 2008 was that he didn’t care about money. Phillips’ Joker can posture about nihilism all it likes; what makes his film not scary is that it cares about a lot. Irish-born, Berlin-based, Rory O'Connor has been covering the European film festival circuit since 2012. A regular contributor to The Film Stage, his work has also appeared in Frieze, The Playlist, and CineVue.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2019"," An iconic comic-book villain gets an appropriately epic origin story in Joker, which allows Joaquin Phoenix’s raw talent its grandest stage yet. In a significant departure from comedies like The Hangover, director and co-writer Todd Phillips achieves two potentially contradictory goals simultaneously: he delivers a fan-servicing blockbuster that highlights what is eternally captivating about the character, while at the same time offering a sobering critique of the sadistic nihilism that has long been the Joker’s modus operandi. In the process, Joker both deconstructs and burnishes the legend of Batman’s demented nemesis. After its Venice competition premiere, this Warner Bros. release will hit UK and US theatres October 4. A violent, bleak comic-book movie for grownups probably won’t have the same success as other recent DC properties like Wonder Woman ($822 million worldwide) or Aquaman ($1.1 billion). But rave reviews for Phoenix’s unnerving portrayal should entice viewers who are tired of superhero films but might be open to something a little more character-driven and psychologically complex. Joker takes us to Gotham City in the early 1980s, when crime is rampant and poverty high. Arthur (Phoenix) is a clinically depressed party clown who has spent time in mental institutions and fancies himself a budding stand-up comedian. But after learning some shocking information from his elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy) about his past, he begins to lose his already-tenuous hold on reality, discovering that he enjoys killing. In the last 30 years, there has been no shortage of big-and-small-screen Jokers, with Heath Ledger winning a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal in 2008’s The Dark Knight. But what gives Phoenix an advantage is that he can build the character from scratch, showing us the anguished man who will become the super-villain. To that end, the Oscar-nominated actor constructs Arthur as a variation on the other pained, emotionally blocked men he has played so well in films like The Master and You Were Never Really Here. And as Joker starts to find its rhythm, Phoenix brings new dimensions to what might seem like a familiar role for him. It’s not hard to deduce what classic films Phillips and long-time cinematographer Lawrence Sher borrowed for inspiration: The urban alienation of Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy are clear thematic and visual touchstones. (Cheekily, Joker co-stars Robert De Niro as a Johnny Carson-esque talk show host who Arthur worships. The man who once played Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin is, this time, in the Jerry Lewis role.) The clever cinematic referencing has its limitations, telegraphing Arthur’s pathology and making it fairly predictable where this sad story will lead. But even so, Phoenix is such a jagged edge that we get wrapped up in Arthur’s profound emotional torment. Joker is far from the first film to suggest a link between mental illness and murderous behaviour, but neither Phoenix nor Phillips revel in Arthur’s descent into madness and bloodshed. There are viciously brutal deaths in Joker, but the movie recoils in shock at Arthur’s actions, taking no pleasure in the character’s desperate need for catharsis. Even when Arthur’s killing of Gotham’s richest inspires others to rise up against the one-per-cent, leading to riots, the movie doesn’t cheer on this mindset or try to capitalise on a fashionable anti-elite fervour within our society. Instead, Joker tries to map out Arthur’s frustration and impotence so that we understand why he goes berserk — but also why that doesn’t make him a magnetic antihero. Some of the supporting players are less-defined, which is a shame since Zazie Beetz is wasted as Arthur’s potential love interest. De Niro is strong as a past-his-prime celebrity who fails to recognise the danger Arthur represents. But the film belongs to Phoenix, who gives us a Joker who, at first, is a troubled but also helpless young man struggling to find connection in a world disinterested in him. Noticeably gaunt for the role, Phoenix never lets us forget that a monster will soon emerge, but he’s such a haunting figure that we lament when that transformation occurs. And although the actor skilfully illuminates Arthur’s pre-Joker disintegration, he also proves to be a pretty terrific Joker during the film’s final stretches. Superhero fans will inevitably have their favourite version of this unforgettable villain, but it’s probably not too controversial to propose that Phoenix’s take is the most human — and, as a result, the most tragic.

"Aug 31, 2019"," Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto and Cesar Romero in the ’60s Batman series are among the many actors who have taken a shot playing the iconic DC Comics supervillain. Heath Ledger took it in a different direction in The Dark Knight and won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar, and now Joaquin Phoenix gets his turn as the character in the stand-alone origin movie Joker in a bravura piece of filmmaking that speaks to the world we are actually living in today in ways that few movies do. If you thought you knew Joker before this Joker, think again. Phoenix is all in and then some, a performance so dazzling risky and original you might as well start engraving his name on the Oscar right now. No joke, this is a movie — premiering today at the Venice Film Festival — unlike any other from the DC universe, and you will find it impossible to shake off. At least I did. In some ways this is a movie that is uncomfortable to watch, and though other films from comic book origins have gone to deep places that reflect the time in which they were made while staying true to their own origins, this one dealing with a very dark and unforgiving Gotham City in the 1980s could have been set in the present as it dives into a world of madness in the character of Arthur Fleck as he eventually morphs into Joker. In cinematic terms, he might be something of a cross between Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, the roles played by Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy.  But director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) and co-writer Scott Silver have more on their mind, and along the way — with Phoenix’s extraordinary performance — say much about how a killer is born. And though Joker becomes a vicious one, it is clear just what created him, and that includes a society that simply does not care about people like him. Like no recent film I can recall, this one says much about our treatment of the mentally ill, a condition blamed by many of our current leaders as the reason a loner with a gun goes on a shooting rampage.. There is one particularly frightening scene in which the Social Services therapist (Sharon Robinson) Arthur sees regularly informs him they are shutting down due to lack of government funds. “They don’t care about people like you, they don’t care about people like me,” she tells him. Arthur is a guy, clearly disturbed, who suffers from a weird chronic laugh, lives with a mother who has her own mental illness, grew up without a father and works as a party clown in a down-and-out dive. He is bullied, laughed at, beaten up, but still has dreams of being a famous stand-up comic, though his material is pretty dreadful. Nevertheless, he catches the eye of Johnny Carson-like talk host Murray Franklin (De Niro, in an ironic, perfectly pitched turn), who sees a viral video of his pathetic act and invites him on his show — not to laugh with him but rather at him, much the same way Carson once had Tiny Tim on as a guest. A violent encounter on the New York subway, revenge against unkind colleagues and complete clown anarchy in the streets of Gotham converge in this journey into the mind of Arthur and his transformation into Joker. The supporting cast couldn’t be better, and that includes De Niro and Frances Conroy as Arthur’s mother, along with many others along the way. This movie will have you reeling – and thinking. In a country of seemingly weekly mass murders at the hands of someone with a gun, this comic book origin tale of Joker is a must-see. Producers are Phillips, Bradley Cooper and Emma Tillinger Koskoff. Warner Bros releases it October 4. Check out my video review at the link above with scenes from the film.

It's the laugh that gets you first: Joaquin Phoenix’s half cackle, half rasp has all the soothing aural balm of a vulture in a blender. It’ll be rattling around in your ears long after the old-school ‘The End’ card flashes up on this unrelenting, grimly funny and brilliantly visceral reinvention of the DC supervillain. This is a truly nightmarish vision of late-era capitalism – arguably the best social horror film since ‘Get Out’ – and Phoenix is magnetic in it. He runs Heath Ledger cigarette paper-close as the finest screen Joker. Like everything in this drum-tight movie, the title’s lack of pronoun is no accident: it’s not the fully formed Joker being introduced here, but Arthur Fleck, a man whose ambition to tell jokes for a living is at odds with the living he scraps as a clown-for-hire on Gotham’s grimy streets. Judging by the movies playing – ‘Excalibur’ and ‘Blow Out’ – it’s 1981, but it feels more like the ’70s of ‘Death Wish’. He lives with his frail mum (Frances Conroy) in a broken-down tenement, eking out a little joy watching a TV chat show hosted with oily relish by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). He’s on seven types of medication and has a neurological condition that causes him to laugh – okay, cackle – uncontrollably. In these domestic early scenes, Phoenix establishes Arthur as a man who sees himself less as an underdog than a mutt waiting to be put down. ‘I just don’t want to feel so bad any more,’ he says. And no wonder: it’s a seriously bleak world he inhabits, a cityscape leached of colour and joy, where even ‘super rats’ can’t get through all the trash that’s piling up. Director Todd Phillips (‘Old School’) does a great job of giving a sense of a place wound too tight. People have retreated into themselves and small kindnesses have been ditched. Arthur’s own awkward efforts to connect are only met with hostility. ‘Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?’ he asks his social worker. Tellingly, she agrees. If ‘Joker’ often feels like the product of a binge of early Scorsese movies – ‘The King of Comedy’ and ‘Taxi Driver’, in particular – this character isn’t just a makeup-smeared facsimile of Robert De Niro’s traumatised Vietnam veteran. He’s the product of a society that feels painfully current. He needs help, but there’s no help out there for him. When Arthur does finally snap, it comes in a tensely mounted subway scene – involving three bankers – that’s cleverly strobed by passing tunnels. It’s short, bloody and has incendiary consequences – an accidental spark for an Occupy-style movement across the city. Like the Guy Fawkes mask in ‘V for Vendetta’, Arthur’s clown makeup is adopted as the face of the protest, and as he graduates into his Joker persona he becomes a figurehead for the angry mob. But is this a tired city rising up in protest, or a criminal army? Gotham’s fat cat Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) has more than a hint of Donald Trump, but surely the Joker is nothing if not an accidental populist himself? Expect the Twitterstorms to rage and the hot takes to be legion. But if the film’s politics get a little murky, ‘Joker’ never operates in a world of black and white certainties. And it never feels like a conventional comic book origin story, either. Its psychological detail is sketched in increments; information drip-fed rather than splurged. Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver’s (‘8 Mile’) screenplay works hard to keep the audience off-balance, delivering one stellar rug-pull that establishes it as a film that exists – at least in part – in the head of its protagonist.   ‘Joker’ smartly manoeuvres the story around the DC universe too. The connective tissue here is Wayne Sr. He’s an old employer of Fleck’s mum and an arrogant blowhard. ‘Batman’ diehards may freak at this depiction of Bruce’s dad as the nasty face of capitalism – he’s a world away from Linus Roache’s gentle patriarch in ‘Batman Begins’ – but in truth, ‘Joker’ doesn’t try to upturn too many tables in the DC universe. Who knows? He may still need to do battle with Robert Pattinson’s Batman. On this evidence, it’d be brutal.

"Aug 31, 2019"," When Martin Scorsese directed “Taxi Driver” in 1976 and “The King of Comedy” in 1982, he was commenting directly on the contemporary world and on the damaged individuals trying to survive in it. When director Todd Phillips chose to set “Joker” in a 1981 that very much resembles those films (it’s Gotham City as “Fun City”) and with a character that seems to be an amalgam of Robert De Niro’s Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin from those two classics, he seems to be doing so because he’s such a Scorsese fan. After all, if you’re going to make a film about working-class people being crushed by the wealthy, and about a sociopath who inspires violent followers after committing crimes and going on television, 2019 is just sitting here. Viewers will no doubt disagree about whether or not “Joker” should have been a period piece, but there’s no question that it’s an exquisitely crafted one. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”) and supervising art director Laura Ballinger (“The Greatest Showman”) obviously studied not just those two Scorsese movies but also “The French Connection,” “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,” “Shaft” and any number of films where New York is depicted as a hellscape of graffiti and garbage (Gotham City’s sanitation workers are on strike), where wet streets reflect the sleazy neon of porno-theater marquees. DC Comics fans will no doubt want to know how canonical the film is, and without getting too far into spoilers, the answer is: More than it initially lets on. And if Phillips is borrowing from countless movies here, he also lifts an entire section of Frank Miller’s “The Dark Knight Returns” for good measure. Is this an origin story? Oh, is it ever. And does Phillips (who co-wrote with Scott Silver, “The Fighter”) come up with anything more interesting in Joker’s backstory than “because mental illness and child abuse”? He does not. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a clown and would-be stand-up comic who lives in a grungy apartment with his invalid mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Arthur has been institutionalized, and now has weekly meetings with a city-assigned psychiatrist (until, of course, the city cuts the budget). After a group of kids mug him while he’s on the clock, a fellow clown gives Arthur a gun; when it comes tumbling out of his baggy pants during a performance at a children’s hospital, he loses the gig. His life goes from bad to worse: He murders three stockbrokers on the subway and inadvertently inspires mobs of harlequin-painted protesters after mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen, “True Detective”) refers to the city’s have-nots as “clowns” in a TV interview. But this act of violence makes Arthur feel seen for the first time. And after popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, because who else?) plays clips of Arthur’s terrible stand-up routine just to mock him, Arthur comes to a breaking point. If you strip the Joker and his nearly 80-year history as a cultural icon out of this film, as well as all the 1970s movie homages, there’s not a whole lot left except for Joaquin Phoenix’s performance, and it’s the kind of turn that’s destined to be divisive. If you like an actor who disappears into a role and effects what appears to be organic human behavior on the screen, this is not your jam. Phoenix puts the “perform” in “performance”; he’s never not twitching or laughing (it’s part of Arthur’s psychiatric condition) or hyperventilating or dancing. Some will love it and some will look askance, but he’s definitely doing the kind of work that fits the tone of the film. The broadness of Phoenix’s work allows the rest of the ensemble — particularly Conroy, Zazie Beetz as a single-mom neighbor, and MVP character actors like Bill Camp, Shea Whigham and Brian Tyree Henry — to dial it down and give effectively human-size performances. The number of times in the film when we’re clearly meant to recognize another movie or a bit of Batman lore seems to be of a piece with Phillips’ general distrust of the audience; there’s a great reveal that pops up unexpectedly, but like a magician who thinks you’re not paying attention, Phillips and editor Jeff Groth (“War Dogs”) go back and walk you through it, step by step, just in case anyone in the back might have missed it. The politics of “Joker” are similarly wobbly; web pundits on all sides of the spectrum will no doubt fish out this idea or that line of dialogue to declaim what “Joker” is “really” about, which ultimately means it’s not really about much of anything at all. It will be tempting for some to declare this the first art film based on a DC or Marvel property, but while it certainly represents a bit of a departure and something of a risk, “Joker” is ultimately grim-and-gritty comic book nihilism jacked up to the nth degree, wrapped up in a convincing but ultimately hollow simulacra of better, smarter movies.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," So this is the world we live in now. A world where comic book-based movies can play In Competition at the Venice Film Festival and have critics whooping and gasping in their seats. A world where erstwhile supervillains are reimagined as a cross between Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin, and Tickle Me Elmo and made the protagonists of stories in which they only ever used to be the anti-matter to the hero’s grace and goodness (remember grace and goodness? I don’t, I’ve just watched “Joker“). A world where a role first played on screen by Cesar Romero in a creaky ’60s TV show provides one of the best actors of his generation with a defining showcase, for the second time in just over a decade. And where “Old School” and “The Hangover” director Todd Phillips can turn in a film so disturbing it feels almost dangerous: whatever about its hard-R rating, they should maybe think about background checks and a mandatory three-day waiting period at theaters. This is the world post-“Joker” and with nothing but shaky-breathed respect for the filmmaking and storytelling achievement it represents, God, and I cannot stress this enough, help us all. This Gotham looks a lot like New York City in the late-1970s/early-1980s, and this Joker, aka Arthur Fleck, looks a lot like Joaquin Phoenix, or what’s left of him after weight loss so dramatic his clavicles have gone rogue and seem to be trying to escape through his skin. Arthur is a rentable party clown, whom we first meet enduring a vicious mugging while dressed in his full clown outfit. He lives with his frail mom Penny (Frances Conroy) in a dingy apartment and nurses a stalkerish crush on his single-mom neighbor (Zazie Beetz). He also has Pseudobulbar Affect, a condition which causes him to erupt into spasms of uncontrollable, painful-sounding laughter, and is on seven different types of medication, plus regular social worker therapist sessions, to manage his amorphous, never-named mental illness. Naturally, given this background, he cherishes dreams of being a stand-up comedian. His hero, in that regard, is talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert de Niro, here playing the Jerry Lewis‘ “King of Comedy” role to Phoenix’s Pupkin). Penny, on the other hand, admires local bigwig and mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, for whom she used to work and to whom she frequently writes in the hopes he’ll help her and Arthur (whom she nicknames “Happy”) get out from under their squalid lives. Outside, Gotham is in a state of rising social unrest. 10,000 tons of garbage accrues on the streets every day and unkillable super-rats are rumored to roam the gutters. Someday a real rain’s going to come and oh wait, wrong movie. Or not really. Phillips’ film is a little too slavishly indebted to its influences, which range from the specific, like Beetz making the “Taxi Driver” finger-gun shoot-me gesture, to the more generally aesthetic, as in the use of jaunty recordings of old songs to counterpoint the brutality and grimness of the imagery, whenever Hildur Guðnadóttir’s excellent, swirling, morose, foreboding score is not reinforcing it. And tonally, the film occupies such a relentlessly dour register that it becomes a little too easy to work out which bits might, in fact, not be real and be the products of Arthur’s disordered psyche instead: Basically, any time something nice happens, or someone is kind. But if the unwavering unwholesomeness of the mood is set a little too steadily, that’s only to give a baseline for Phoenix’s extraordinarily unsettling performance, which changes and jerks and heaves and zags when all laws of psychology and physics suggest it should zig. Perhaps that’s the reason he’s just “Joker” without a definite article — there is nothing defined about him. Sometimes he dances, sometimes he spasms, and sometimes it difficult to tell which is which, but Arthur is terrifying because he represents absolute unpredictability. He has no goal except to be liked and when that proves impossible, he has nothing at all except his illness — not even a desire to watch the world burn. Comparisons with Heath Ledger’s Joker are inevitable, but the two interpretations are very different, with Ledger’s Joker always possessing a steely core of cunning, almost a sophistication running through his psychosis. But there is no grandeur in Phoenix’s Arthur, not even megalomania. He is pathetic and irritating and small, and when he becomes big, it is by accident, when this empty, ruined vessel is mistaken for an icon by the rioting and mutinous population of Gotham. The ’70s/’80s cues notwithstanding, the hatred of the 1%, the street protests, and anti-authoritarian sentiment, and the far-too-central role that media and celebrity play in our perceptions of social success, all feel horrifyingly present-tense. And here is what is even more frightening than Phoenix’ hacking cackle, or the moments of gruesome bloodiness, or the portrait of a society teetering on the brink of breakdown: “Joker,” based on recognizable IP, and now given the seal of critical and possible awards-consideration approval too, is so aesthetically impressive, effective, and persuasive of its own reality that you see clearly how easily it could be (mis)interpreted and co-opted by the very 4Chan/Incel/”mentally ill loner” element it purports to darkly satirize.",POSITIVE

"Aug 31, 2019"," For the first time since launching the ""DCEU"" (an interconnected series of films linking the DC Comics heroes together in a shared universe on the big screen), Warner Bros. and DC Comics movies and looking to introduce and isolated film which could be the first of many in the form of Joker. While it is unlike other films in the shared big screen universe by existing in its own space, it is also different in every other imaginable way -- from all comic book movies before it. Joker is a thrilling, haunting character study which happens to become a mysterious origin story for the best known villain in comic book history. Hailing from his best known work with The Hangover movies, director Todd Phillips shows that he isn't checking in for the laughs -- unless they come from the deranged performance by his lead actor Joaquin Phoenix. Phillips focused more on the central character here, an abandoned and mentally ill Arthur Fleck, than on any larger DC Comics connections which fans of comic book movies have been trained to expect. It's not completely free of ties to a larger world but it has no desire to set any stage for future installments, spinoffs, sequels, or expansions -- which is almost a shame given how great of a launch it is for a compelling character. Joker starts off slowly, meticulously allowing tremendous cinematography and a mesmerizing performance from Phoenix lead the charge. During this slow burn audiences will wonder where the movie could possibly be going but patience will be rewarding. As the movie and its titular character descend into madness simultaneously, the dark, twisted thriller takes off and never looks book. In fact, it's as if Joker takes a look at the darkest paths available and figures out creative ways to incorporate them into the same film. Some of those paths are so dark audiences won't possibly be able to see them coming and will find themselves in an uncomfortable emotional location along the journey. Once Arthur's tragic story is established, Joker offers up terrifying levels of tension. In fact, it's scarier than most horror films of the year with its gritty, scary levels of realism. Furthermore, ties to real world epidemics facing the audience observing this work of fiction will act as disturbing reminders as a questionable message (if there is any singular message to be taken) is delivered. This movie is certainly not intended for younger audiences and will leave this a lesser tolerance for tense situations and violence feeling very uneasy. Intimate violence and a terrifying character drive Joker to an intense conclusion which will stick with audiences in the hours and days after watching it. There has never been a movie like this in the genre. The conversation has long been whether or not a comic book movie can top The Dark Knight as the renowned ""best"" in genre. Like The Dark Knight, Joker transcends being simply a film based on any super heroes or villains. It becomes a piece of art loaded with raw beats and stirs up internal and external conversations for its audience. While none of the characters play roles comparable in size to Phoenix's Arthur, familiar faces from around Hollywood pop in including Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beets, Brian Tyree Henry, and Brett Cullen. Some have more screen tine than others but none of the supporting character seem to bear a tremendous burden of individual relevance over the other. Each serve the story in drastically different ways, fueling Arthur's journey, and lending satisfying performances alongside the star. Joker is loaded with mystery on top of its numerous twists. By the time it ends, viewers will be left with several questions about the experience, some of which might be scarily directed at themselves. Phoenix's Arthur laughs his way through terrible scenarios. For this, the actor demands an Oscar nomination it might not be the only nod this DC Comics movie earns. The cinematography, score, and direction create something unlike anything before it - -and it's terrifying, thrilling, and moving. Whether or not Joker is a social commentary on issues such as poverty or mental illness, a new and mysterious take on the best known DC Comics villain, or just another unforgettable piece of cinema which producer Martin Scorsese is attached to, you'll need to see to believe it and, even then, you still might not believe it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Get ready to rethink what's possible in comic book movies. Again. In a little over a month, Warner Bros. releases the latest DC Comics adaptation Joker — an origin story of Batman's arch nemesis — and if you thought The Dark Knight and Logan pushed the boundaries of adult storytelling and Oscar quality for these types of films, Joker is about to up the ante. First, let's address the financial outlook. Budgeted at $55 million and with a relatively modest marketing budget, Joker only needs roughly $190+/- million in worldwide receipts to reach black ink. And it won't have any trouble racing far past that figure. This is a film about one of our most popular pop culture villains, with a high-profile lead performer and trailers eliciting tremendous buzz. Early talk of Joaquin Phoenix as a potential Best Actor contender at the Oscars is sure to increase Joker's must-see status. And the October 4th release date means there are no notable wide releases opening against it, nor any holdovers that will still be recent enough to act as contenders for the same target audiences to any significant degree. A week later Gemini Man opens, and the week after that brings Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and Zombieland 2: Double Tap, meaning Joker has the first full week to itself and then only one movie competing for some of the same audience on weekend #2. Two weeks is plenty of time to rack up the box office it needs to be well into the profit zone and ride a wave of likely strong reviews and positive audience word-of-mouth — especially among viewers who made superhero movies like The Dark Knight and Logan blockbuster hits — to box office gold. Adult fare, even R-rated, can score big theatrical results in October, especially if they have room to get their legs under them and no major competition when they open. Last year's Venom (itself a more violent type of superhero movie) holds the record for biggest October bow with $80 million. Halloween (an R-rated slasher film) took $76 million last year for second place on the month's all-time charts, followed by 2013's Gravity with $55.7 million and the R-rated The Martian from 2015 with $54 million. Of those, Halloween had the lowest final multiplier, at 2.09x. Venom enjoyed a nice 2.6x final multiplier, while the other two scored massive 4+x final multipliers. (Note: these figures are all for domestic box office.) If we adjust Gravity and The Martian for inflation, then they give us a basement of roughly $60 million, while Venom and Halloween suggest a ceiling in the range of $78 million. I think that's a reasonable starting set of potential outcomes to consider for Joker, before we start further adjusting for factors like branding, competition in the marketplace, and current buzz. If Joker opened at $60 million and played on the lowest end of final multipliers, it would finish with approximately $120+ million in North America. The more outrageously high result of 4+x final multiplier would give it $240+ million domestically. The midrange multiplier of 2.6x results in a possible grand total of $156 million stateside. Assuming a pure 50/50 split between domestic and international box office, the above figures would translate into worldwide totals of $240 million on the low end, $480 million on the high end, and $312 million for the midrange outcome. Again, these are just preliminary figures, based on the parameters established by the top four grossing October releases from the past 6 years — I'll make adjustments in a moment. Any of those outcomes spells success for Joker, since anything north of about $190+/- million is profit territory. The average outcome from these various examples would be $344 million, a very strong result for a $55 million budgeted R-rated release. Now, time to make adjustments. This isn't just any ol' R-rated October release, after all. It's Joker, as in Batman's famous arch enemy, as in instant brand recognition and one of the most popular and successful villains in screen history. The Joker's three modern live-action big-screen appearances (not counting the 1966 movie Batman based on the TV show) were 1989's Batman, 2008's The Dark Knight, and 2016's Suicide Squad, which took $411.5 million, $1 billion, and $746.8 million in total global receipts, respectively, and with Rotten Tomato scores of 71% ,94%, and 27%, respectively. What this means is the Joker has been in multiple blockbusters over several decades, in very different portrayals, and with variety of critical receptions. So a Joker-branded movie reminding audiences and critics of The Dark Knight's more serious, Oscar-worthy portrayal, with likely good critical reception, and positioned in a calendar spot designed to maximize its opening weekend potential, should deliver a result at the higher end of possible outcomes. My prediction is a domestic opening of $80+ million, at least $225+ million as the final domestic tally, and at least $250+ million from foreign markets. This would result in a worldwide cume of $475+ million. Oscar buzz will boost all of those figures higher, as will critical acclaim (as opposed to just majority-positive reviews) and an audience score of A-, A, or A+. I'll update my box office predictions once we are closer to opening weekend, and then again after we've seen those first weekend figures. I suspect it has a good chance of performing north of $500 million if reviews and audience scores line up right, and I think they will, but I'd like to see initial tracking and the opening receipts before I commit to those numbers, simply because this year's hit-or-miss results even for branded content makes me mindful that the October frame and R rating could mean it winds up playing closer to pre-2018 years, especially if reviews are mixed or audience scores turn out lower. But I doubt any of those potential negatives will manifest. Why? Because Joker is an awesome accomplishment sure to please fans of the character and of the superhero genre, as well as average viewers just looking for a terrific film for adult audiences. Before I dive into my full review, let me quickly debunk the silly myth that Joker is not based on the comic book character and/or takes no inspiration from the comics. Director Todd Phillips simply noted his film wasn't directly adapting any particular comic story, and somehow his meaning was repeatedly mischaracterized and conflated with claims the movie ignored the source material entirely. I assure you, that ridiculous claim is as bogus as it should've obviously seemed to everybody as soon as they heard it. Yes, the film takes inspiration from the source material, and yes it specifically has scenes directly inspired by certain comic book stories and influences — the third chapter of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns provides inspiration for one scene fans will instantly recognize, for example. So, forget that ridiculous rumor. Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible — a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime. Some will consider me a heretic for saying such a thing, but it's simply the truth. Phoenix channels something otherworldly here, a man aware that a psychotic monster is violently clawing its way out of him and he struggles to contain it because he thinks that's what he has to do — until he decides he doesn't, because the monster within him is just him. And he likes it. Twisting and contorting himself like a broken marionette — and sometimes like a crab or strange insect crawling from a cocoon — Phoenix lets the inner derangement manifest in every movement, every glance. There is malevolence seeping from his very pores. At first it is a bit harder to detect, because Phoenix so masterfully depicts the ways in which the Joker wrestles with himself to disguise his demented tendencies. But gradually, painfully, he allows us to see more and more of it. And as we witness it, we realize it's not a transformation but rather a revelation of what was always barely contained beneath the surface. And we recall earlier moments, and we realize the evil was there too, but it scared him the way it scares us, so he concealed it. I don't even hesitate to say Phoenix is the instant frontrunner for Best Actor at the Academy Awards, and I have zero doubt he will be nominated for his performance. My expectation is that he will win, because it's the best performance I've seen from an actor all year, and it's hard to imagine another performance with such nuanced intensity and power. The Joker becomes a living, breathing human manifestation of evil, and the film serves to both demystify him and also make it clear that even what we ""see"" of his origin is subject to question — unreliable narrators being what they are, the Joker being the most unreliable of all narrators, and the fact of his literal humanness doing nothing to remove our awareness something purely cruel and monstrous resides within his soul. I've written a companion article to this review that you can read here, which goes deeper into the issue of the ""sympathetic"" portrayal of Joker and the controversy this has sparked by many film pundits and fans — most of whom haven't even seen the film yet, and most of whom also haven't even read the screenplay yet. Anyway, I'll avoid diving into that issue further here. But if you want to read detailed points about why the controversy is mostly a significant misreading of the film's themes, and why it's also bizarre in light of other film trends and critical reactions to certain other films, then go read my analysis of the issue here. Now, moving on... There was a danger in Phillips' decision to take inspiration from Martin Scorsese, and in particular to aspire to a marriage between Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, and Mean Streets — some of Scorsese's greatest and most dissected works. The result is frankly somewhat of a miracle, because succeeding at aspiration toward Scorsese's 1970s and early-1980s output is almost certainly doomed to disappoint... except Phillips succeeds. Scorsese no doubt could've made this film, but it would've been even more grounded in realism and would've featured a more morally torturous personal hell through which the Joker navigated his way toward becoming what he is. Phillips achieves something slightly different, though, and in doing so captures a truer and more compelling essence of what the Joker really is — he builds a dreamlike realism, letting us enter the nightmarish perceptions and deceptions of the Joker, turning views grimy street-level authenticity into an altered state of consciousness. It all seems very real, and at the same time surreal, like a muffled, drug-induced experience of hyper-reality. Imagine Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy mashed together, starring the Joker from The Dark Knight who has a psychotic monster violently clawing its way out of him, and imagine watching it while under the influence of a cocktail of powerful sedatives and raw-nerve hallucinogens. That's Joker. And I don't think it's the film we would have gotten if Scorsese himself wrote and directed it. Which is all a long way of saying Phillips both captures the flavor and artistic strength of an early Scorsese film, and also creates something decidedly different and unique that rises above and beyond those comparisons. The influence of those Scorsese films are certainly present and felt, don't get me wrong. But it's an absurd insult to Phillips and Phoenix, and to cowriter Scott Silver (whose screenwriting credits include the exceptional films The Fighter, 8 Mile, and The Finest Hours — and if you haven't seen any of these, I urge you to watch them) to call Joker just a ""remake"" or ""ripoff"" of The King of Comedy and/or Taxi Driver, as I've seen some people suggest online (none of whom had seen the film before offering up such claims, of course). Phillips' background with comedy — notably, Old School, Starsky & Hutch, and the Hangover trilogy — serves him well here, and highlights the point that the physicality of comedy provides terrific insight and experience applicable to action and drama filmmaking as well. Joker has its comedic moments, for sure, but it also has explosive moments of action and is overall primarily a psychological dramatic thriller. Likewise, Phoenix brilliantly keeps a clown shoe on each side of the divide between comedic slapstick and action-drama, to the point of rendering any such divide nonexistent. The mixture is deliciously volatile in Phillips' and Phoenix's hands, and helps maintain the perpetual uncertainty about what we're witnessing — is it real? is it delusion? is it some funhouse blend of both? The cinematography in Joker is spectacular, too. Lawrence Sher outdoes himself this time, and should earn an Oscar nomination for his transcendent work here. The screenplay — which, as already noted, was written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver — should also garner Academy attention for adapted screenplay consideration. I read the first draft of the script, and it was terrific, but the film evolved and had significant rewrites along the way (including during filming) that made it even better. Hildur Guðnadóttir's score is another compelling part of Joker, and might be among the top contenders at Oscar time as well. The supporting cast are superb as well. Zazie Beetz is excellent as Joker's neighbor and would-be object of his affection, in a role that will surprise you more than once. It's a deft performance requiring careful balance and subtlety, which Beetz effortlessly supplies. Frances Conroy is particularly impressive in an understated, sorrowful performance as Joker's mother. Robert De Niro is... well, he's De Niro, so of course he's great as always, but there's added flavor to his performance due to his lead role in The King of Comedy and the reversal of positions in Joker. But I must come back to Phoenix again, for it is his performance that everything else relies on and rests upon. It is a triumph of skill and commitment, a contender for the crown as his finest performance to date — the other contenders being Walk the Line, I'm Still Here, The Master, and You Were Never Really Here. This could (and I think will) be the film that earns the superhero genre its first lead actor Oscar (and Phoenix his third acting nomination from the Academy). Joker is a phenomenal film, destined to be pitted against Ledger's The Dark Knight performance for the title of definitive on-screen portrayal of the character. So fabulous is this version of the Joker, it is hard to imagine the upcoming Batman rebooted franchise offering yet another new version any time soon — which is why I hope Phoenix can be persuaded to reprise the role and somehow cross over into Matt Reeves' Batman movies in the next few years. If this is indeed the one and only film featuring Phoenix's Joker, though, we should be grateful to have it. Joker is one of the true masterpieces of the superhero cinema, and one of 2019's greatest achievements.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," If Joker wasn’t called “Joker,” you’d never know it was a DC movie. Though there are characters with the last name “Wayne” and it takes place in a city called “Gotham,” there’s little else that distinguishes Todd Phillips’ latest film as a comic book movie. It’s a solid, well-made film that, ultimately, has a bit of an identity crisis.  Joker isn’t quite sure what it wants to be. What it definitely is is a movie about a disturbed man named Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Arthur is a clown-for-hire who lives with his mother Penny (American Horror Story’s Frances Conroy) in a powder keg of a city that’s just waiting to explode. And, without really even realizing the impact his actions are having on the outside world, Arthur ends up lighting the fuse. Joker is a comic book origin story with very little comic book in it. The whole thing very purposefully feels like a love letter to cinema of the late ‘70s, early ‘80s rather than other dark DC superhero movies like Tim Burton’s Batman or Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Using that gritty aesthetic, Phillips is much more interested in dissecting what makes a comic book character real than making a real comic book character and, in that aim, he’s successful. Arthur is a fascinating and endlessly compelling person. He’s also terrifying and, for most of the film, sympathetic. In fact, that sympathy is where much of the film’s fear comes from. This is the Joker. We should not like this person. And yet, the movie tricks us into doing that time and time again. We frequently see things happening that aren’t actually happening. Information is given that isn’t quite accurate. Arthur’s point of view is mostly unreliable. And so the film swings you between sympathy and pity or humor and awkwardness, sometimes in a single shot. Not knowing what to believe and how to feel is one of the film’s most interesting and strongest assets.  Undoubtedly, the highlight of the film is Phoenix’s performance, which includes one of the best physical and mental transformations he’s done in his illustrious career. Phoenix takes Arthur everywhere, best represented by a condition where he laughs when he’s not supposed to. It makes for some terribly uncomfortable moments that personify him very acutely. We want to love Arthur. We want to cheer for him. Maybe we even do at times. But we cannot. The title of the movie tells you where this is going, and it’s nowhere good. Phillips, best known for comedies like Old School and The Hangover trilogy, is making his most complex movie yet with Joker. And though he co-wrote the movie with Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile) that lack of dramatic experience shows. Joker never seems to have a dominant message. The goal is clear, explain who the Joker is, but beyond that, the movie is chock full of so many themes at so many different times it’ll leave your head spinning. Some of the film is about the working-class rising up against the upper class. Some of it is about abuse and its impact on mental development. Other parts are about bullying, gun control, the news media, really, almost any and everything. If you choose to look at it in a certain way, Joker is a man who unknowingly incites violence and hatred and becomes a leader because of those warped ideas. Sound familiar? Despite being set almost 40 years in the past. Joker is such a timely, malleable movie that almost anything you want to read into it would be an equally valid interpretation. However, we never know what Phillips is trying to say among all these different messages. Which, appropriately, is both the best and worst thing about the film. You walk out of it bursting at the seams with discussion points. What was real?  Was that intended? Why did that happen? And yet, if a movie is about everything, it almost becomes about nothing. There’s no real cohesion to what it is, or isn’t, trying to say. No point or message prevalent above all the others. The subtext feels largely garbled and at odds, with only Arthur’s character arc to hold everything together. And even then, because he’s such a complex character, it’s a little all over the map. With Arthur’s journey to becoming Joker as the main narrative drive of the film, the supporting characters mostly take a back seat. Few, if any, have more than 10 minutes of screen time in the film. That goes for characters played by Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Marc Maron, Brian Tyree Henry, and others. For some, it’s even less than that. Their minor inclusions sometimes work to boost the film up but also can drag it down because we want to see more of their stories. It’s always about Arthur, and yet, Joker doesn’t really have a point of view on how we should feel about him at the end. Phillips doesn’t tip his hand one way or the other, leaving that sentiment almost entirely up to the audience, which in this day and age, is almost irresponsible. Most of the violence is saved until later in the film and its sporadic, yet intense, depiction is another way the director harkens back to the films of the past. Phillips uses using jarring sounds and quick editing, à la Martin Scorsese, to amplify the most violent moments. Yet, the intended shock value is slightly offset by the film’s insinuation that Arthur is, even partially, justified. Others characters are threatening him. They’re bullying him. What choice does he have but to retaliate with a vengeance? That underdog, pathetic, anti-hero perspective doesn’t have much balance the other way. Arthur gets positive reinforcement, first from the public, later in the form of self-discovery, through his violence. As a result, you get the dangerous sense that some could walk out of Joker cheering for his triumphs instead of feeling disgusted by them. There’s no road map to solidify a point of view. No easy strings to grasp on to say “This is bad” other than the external knowledge that “The Joker is a comic book villain.” I wish there was. Phillips isn’t asking easy questions with the movie, which makes it interesting, but the commercial, comic book hook mostly feels at odd with that level of ambition. Maybe Joker is the movie that opens up a wider audience to more complex films, but considering the pessimistic world Joker reflects on us, probably not. One way Phillips kind of comments on the violence is through filmmaking juxtaposition. Visually, Joker is sumptuous, thanks in large part to the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and costumes by Mark Bridges. Each gives the film a grounded realism as Arthur walks through a building or drives through a tunnel, as well as a hint of mania when he puts on that dark red suit or striking white face make-up. As the film goes on, each ends up feeling like they were crafted for the sole purpose of making the few instances of visceral violence that much more disturbing when they happen. Even the comic book connections in the film fall into this murky category, though. For a movie that’s so dead set on being its own standalone thing, it sure goes out of the way to leave fans with threads that could spin off into other movies. For some, that’ll be very exciting, but I felt it did Joker a disservice. The movie doesn’t feel like we should want to see what’s next. We shouldn’t want to see this character commanding an army and fighting Batman. He’s too human. Too broken. That scenario too fantastic and unrealistic for this world. And yet the movie tries to balance all of those things together, unfocusing several narrative threads that would have been stronger on their own. Then again, it’s important to remember the movie is called Joker. The Waynes are characters. Gotham City is the setting. And so, making a movie that has such a wild identity crisis could be exactly the point of the whole thing. Maybe it should be confusing. It shouldn’t have a point. Or maybe it should elicit emotional responses, for better or worse, and that’s it.  Historically, the Joker character has been impossible to pin down. So it’s oddly fitting that his movie is too. Is the movie powerful and provocative? Yes. A little frustrating and unclear? Also yes. Are all of those things appropriate to the character? Absolutely. Maybe making Joker feel so unlike our usual comic book films, so potentially polarizing, so gutturally shocking, is exactly the right way to make a Joker movie. It’s just like him. Confused, misunderstood, but probably very clear from his own warped point of view.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix provides a comic-book hero for the left behind with Joker, a brilliantly insurrectionist origins story that landed like a firecracker in the midst of this year’s Venice film festival. Playing the role of Cain to the sunny Abel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Todd Phillips’s blockbuster charts the formative years of Batman’s nemesis, rewinding to his time as a failed standup in grubby Gotham City, when he was lonesome and lost and out of joint with the world. Audaciously, it’s a film that invites us to love the monster. Eyes rolling, jaw working, Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, rattling with seven different medications and brandishing a laminated card that reads: “Forgive my laughter. I have a condition.” He longs to be a comedian, but goes to pieces on stage. He’d like to work as a party entertainer, but is fired when he drops a handgun in the children’s ward. Happily, this lowly worm is about to turn. By God, his tormentors are going to sit up and take notice. First they ignore him, then they laugh at him, and then they die. Phillips’s film – a longtime labour of love – was partly seeded by The Killing Joke, the 1988 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. But its real inspirations are Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese’s conjoined masterpieces, each spotlighting the tawdry underside of American celebrity. Joker frames Fleck against Gotham’s neon-drenched streets in a direct nod to Travis Bickle, while his flailing stabs at stardom echo the hapless Rupert Pupkin. Hardly bothering to hide its hand, the film even casts Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a cheesy talkshow host who says things like “But in all seriousness” and “Well, that was quite an entrance”. In his wildest dreams, Rupert Pupkin would be Murray Franklin today. Or possibly not, because what’s most radical about Joker is the way it views success from the other end of the telescope. The film flips the pyramid, making its home in the mondo bizarro. And by that upside-down logic Fleck is already on the path to righteousness. He’s become an angel of vengeance, a standard bearer for the underclass in a city where newspaper headlines scream “KILL THE RICH”. Of course, he’d still love to appear on Murray Franklin’s show – but this time he has an altogether different skit to perform. “I used to think my life was a tragedy,” he says. “But now I realise it’s a fucking comedy.” What a gloriously daring and explosive film Joker is. It’s a tale that’s almost as twisted as the man at its centre, bulging with ideas and pitching towards anarchy. Having brazenly plundered the films of Scorsese, Phillips fashions stolen ingredients into something new, so that what began as a gleeful cosplay session turns progressively more dangerous – and somehow more relevant, too. Gotham City is aflame and they’re rioting on the streets. And a rough beast is slouching towards the TV studio to be born.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the Clown Prince of Crime in Todd Phillips’ unique take on the Batman supervillain Joker, which also won the Golden Lion at this year’s Venice Film Festival. Joker is a film that didn’t feel necessary when announced. There has been a glut of superhero movies and there has also been a glut of postmodern takes on superhero movies. We’ve seen Bruce Wayne’s parents killed so many times it feels like we were eyewitnesses to the actual event rather than an audience. As for the Joker himself, Cesar Romero was formative, Jared Leto was forgettable, Jack Nicholson played the part like it was based on his life and Heath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar, discovering unsuspected depths to the deranged anti-hero. But Phoenix has plumbed depths so deep and given such a complex, brutal and physically transformative performance, it would be no surprise to see him take home a statuette or two come award season. In a career of highs, this is yet another one. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a down-at-heel clown for hire. He dons his outfit and swings a sign advertising a closing down sale until some young thugs steal it and beat him up. It’s only one of many mishaps to occur to Arthur. He lives with his elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy), a deluded woman who writes constant letters to Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), her former boss who she believes will help them. Together they watch late-night host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and Arthur fantasises about having his moment in the limelight with the man he idolises. Fleck has ambitions to be a standup comic but also suffers from depression and pseudobulbar affect – uncontrollable laughing fits dissociated from emotion. His joke book is full of pasted in porn and such gems as “I hope my death makes more cents than my life” in childlike scribble. To make things worse, Gotham City with its garbage strikes, its violence and its income inequality, is such a hostile environment it would have Theresa May dribbling with glee. What follows is nothing short of a portrait in disintegration. Phoenix is stunning: painfully thin, his body is often contorted and beaten, his face at times sorrowful and lost and at other naively hopeful. His laughter is not a manic cackle of joyful villainy, but at times a painful racking fit, at others a loud off-key imitation of human interaction. When he goes to a comedy club, he laughs at all the wrong lines. His obsession with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), a girl in his building, is his only ray of hope but this feels too good to be true. And so it goes. Despite his mother nicknaming him ‘Happy’, he quite credibly claims to not having ‘one second of happiness in my entire life’. When he finally breaks, his initial murders are greeted as an act of class warfare by sections of the dispossessed and the already tense city begins to reach boiling point. Set in the late-1970s/early-80s hinterland, Phillips pays obvious tribute to Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as well as including notes from The French Connection and Serpico. But just as Phoenix’s performance might wink towards Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, it and he are very much their own thing. This is not a pastiche but a very contemporary and audacious psychological study. Arthur is an incel, his anguish is based on mental illness and trauma he cannot control and his rising fury due to a world of indifference, cuts in social spending which see him cut loose and a savage absence of empathy generally. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver radically alter the presentation of the Wayne family, but Joker doesn’t happen in any DC Universe, or any other fantasy. It feels a painfully real subjective character study. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher has that rich colour and grit typical of the urban cinema of the 1970s. Almost every shot seems to stink of the city, a mix of excrement, diesel fumes, street food and disinfectant. One of the finest musicians working in cinema today, Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, provides another stunning score mixed with some period rock and pop, including a Gary Glitter cut which isn’t without controversy. What we have in Joker is one of the keenest anatomies of madness. We also have a political screed to our own crazy times when the cruelty of the rich and the anger of the marginalised dominate the public sphere. As the film goes on, it becomes increasingly a horror movie and the violence – although limited to a very few incidents – is portrayed as shockingly real. There are also moments of humour – as you’d expect from the director of The Hangover – but the “funny ha-ha” is definitely mixed in with funny peculiar so it’s impossible to say where one ends and the other begins. What it doesn’t feel like is a comic book movie. The Joker has become the American Hamlet, the role with which actors test their mettle and which changes to reflect the times. There are reservations that this already overlong review can’t accommodate – the depiction of mental illness, the role of people of colour which echo the Safdie brothers’ Good Time – but these are discussions that no doubt will accompany the inevitable back (and forth) lash. We shall be talking about this for some time. Phoenix has created a masterful performance for a film which itself feels like a cracked masterpiece. Not only does the Joker shine on the big screen – the character created by DC Comics also took the gaming world by storm as the main antagonist in the Injustice saga. Even casino fans can re-enact the deeds of this charismatic villain thanks to The Dark Knight online slot, which can be played at the new slot sites reviewed here. This progressive slot features Christian Bale’s grieving Batman and Heath Ledger’s eccentric Joker as main symbols, bringing the dusky atmosphere which permeated the trilogy to the screen of your mobile device.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," What do you get when you take a poor, mentally unstable loner and you treat him like trash? The answer given in Todd Phillips’s ingenious new feature is Batman’s arch nemesis, the Joker. Phillips gives us a portrait of the future super villain as a troubled young man, while Joaquin Phoenix plays him in a way that makes him seem both sympathetic and very creepy. As first encountered here, Arthur Fleck is like a cross between Travis Bickle, the vigilante loner in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and Rupert Pupkin, the would-be comedian in Scorsese’s King of Comedy. The presence in the cast of Robert De Niro (as a chat show host very like the Jerry Lewis character in the latter film) underlines the fact Joker is as much inspired by Scorsese as by the DC comic book universe. Arthur is a painfully awkward figure, living with his very frail mother (Frances Conroy) in a decrepit apartment and eking out an existence as a party clown. Gotham City has lost its way. It isn’t specified when the film is set but it appears to be the 1970s. The cinemas are showing porno films. The rubbish isn’t being collected. Rats are on the streets. Crime is rife. The gulf between the rich, represented by the would-be new mayor Thomas Wayne, and the rest of society is enormous. Arthur can’t stand up for himself. He is on medication. When young thugs pick on him and beat him up in a back alley, he is powerless to stop them.  He is suffering from some mysterious medical condition which causes him to erupt into manic laughter at the most inopportune moments. He isn’t very amusing either. “Don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?” his mother asks him at one stage, a question he declines to answer. Arthur is touchingly devoted to his mother. She tells him stories about the rich and powerful Wayne, for whom she once worked. Wayne, though, is presented here as an aloof and arrogant millionaire who cares little for the downtrodden people of Gotham. The tone of the film is even darker and more Gothic than that of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. Phoenix’s Arthur may be vulnerable, but the more he is bullied the more grievances he stores up. “You’ve got to protect yourself. Otherwise you’re going to get f***ed,” a fellow clown tells him. The advice sets in motion the transformation into the malevolent figure with the rictus grin we know from all those other Caped Crusader movies. Not that Batman is ever referred to directly here. Phoenix’s Joker is a heavier, more brooding and introspective figure than that of Heath Ledger in Nolan’s The Dark Knight. He doesn’t have Ledger’s quicksilver energy. He moves more slowly. However, when his malevolence is finally unleashed, he is just as effective a lord of chaos. Action scenes are in relatively short supply. This isn’t a superhero movie and it takes some time for Arthur to get his chops as a villain. However, Phillips includes one brilliantly staged set piece on the Gotham subway, involving Joker, hundreds of protesters dressed as clowns, and two hapless police officers caught in the throng. As viewers, we can’t help but identify with Arthur. Everybody picks on him. We suffer with him in the excruciating scenes when his comedy routines fall flat or when he embarrasses himself by misinterpreting the words and actions of others. It is a natural instinct to want him to succeed, and is therefore exhilarating when he finally stops stumbling and stands up for himself. Director Phillips’ attitude towards his main character is deeply ambivalent. On the one hand, Arthur is a murderous psychopath who can’t tell jokes and has a horrible, braying laugh. On the other, he is depicted here as a folk hero, wreaking havoc against a society which has ignored the poor and marginalised for too long. “They don’t give a shit about you… and they don’t give a shit about me either,” his long-suffering social worker tells him.  At times, the storytelling becomes very contorted as the filmmakers strive to make a nuanced character-based drama about a figure we are used to seeing presented as a one-dimensional baddie. There has been talk of a “DC Black” label, a series of movies, of which this is the first, focusing on the dark half of the superhero universe. If Joker develops into a franchise, the tensions are bound to increase. It’s very hard to make films about super villains which don’t either glamourise them or lapse into comic book cliche. This feature, though, is powerful and original, with much of the same kick as the Scorsese movies to which it pays such obvious homage.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Todd Phillips’ supervillain origin story, which made its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, sees the Joker square off against a Trumpian politician—and ignite class warfare. VENICE, Italy—There were a number of lingering questions going into Joker, the latest reimagining of the DC supervillain. How would Todd Phillips, the dude behind The Hangover movies, fare as director? Will the third rendering of the terrorist-clown in eleven years be overkill? And just how dark is this thing going to be?  Arthur is, more than anything, a child desperately searching for identity and a sense of belonging. “I just hope my death makes more cents [sic] than my life,” he’s scribbled in his journal, a collection of deranged musings on his everyday trials and humiliations.  His bouts of uncontrollable, screeching laughter—delivered at the most inopportune of times—underline his emotional puerility. He is subject to an unrelenting stream of abuse, from the neighborhood kids who jump him on the job to his condescending boss branding him a “weirdo.” He is also deeply mentally ill, and without therapy or medication, his outbursts turn violent.  Joker owes more to ‘70s-era Scorsese than its period detail and Stygian lighting, of course. Arthur combines the PTSD-fueled anarchist rage of Travis Bickle (whom De Niro modeled after an underground New York comedian) with the star-chasing delusions of Rupert Pupkin, and Phoenix is more than up to the task, his world-beaten face transmogrifying from gaiety to menace in an instant. Much has been made of how the 44-year-old recast his body for the role, dropping 52 pounds to depict this disturbed shell of a man, all raised shoulders and sunken chest. But more than that, he and Phillips have presented us with a compelling portrait of “God’s lonely man” whose simmering rage turns to a boil. And Phillips, utilizing clever tracking shots, tight close-ups and lost-in-the-crowd framing to convey Arthur’s existential angst, has made us forget about those agonizing Hangover sequels.  Unfortunately, the film errs in its on-the-nose depiction of politics and class warfare. After Arthur murders a trio of Wall Street bankers on the subway, he becomes a hero to Gotham’s 99 percent, igniting a “Kill the Rich” campaign that sees the have-nots adopt his clown mask as a symbol of social rebellion, a la Guy Fawkes. The whole ordeal makes Bane’s Stock Exchange-takeover seem subtle by comparison. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Joker is surely the darkest, harshest comic book film yet made. There has never been a settled origins story for the Joker – the most common account has him falling into a tank of chemical waste while trying to escape Batman and being driven insane by the resulting clown-like disfigurement. Nobody who sees this new film will ever need any other version. Its director, Todd Phillips, is best known for the three Hangover films, which pushed into new zones of pain and damage to find laughs. Joker, though a film that's full of deranged laughter, is not funny at all – it's more akin to a horror story. With co-writer Scott Silver, he has taken inspiration from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both studies in psychosis. To a surprising extent, Joker is a homage to, or mash-up of, these classics. Joaquin Phoenix gives an absolutely convulsing performance, maybe the most powerful of his career, as the Joker, Arthur Fleck. To play the role, he shed an extraordinary 52lbs, making his muscular body painfully emaciated, his already aquiline features even more cutting. An Oscar nom is on its way already. Arthur lives in a grungy tenement block, in dark, dirty, waste-strewn Gotham City, with his nutty mother Penny (Frances Conroy). She calls him ""Happy"" and has always told him to smile and put on a happy face and spread joy and light. Arthur never been happy one minute of his life, any more than he has ever been funny. If he laughs hysterically, it is always at the most inappropriate times, even when he is actually watching comedy. Taking seven different meds, he sees a therapist who doesn't listen, even when he tells her: ""All I have are negative thoughts"". In his scrawled journal, he writes ""I hope my death makes more cents than my life"". He works, though, as a heavily made up, fully costumed children's clown and he is trying to build a career as a stand-up comedian too, fantasizing about going up on stage with the TV talkshow host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), both his and his mother's favourite. When he's beaten up on the streets by kids, one of his fellow clowns gives him a gun – and Arthur begins to morph into Travis Bickle, posing in his pants, talking to himself, pretend-shooting himself too. Then, while performing in a children's hospital – ""If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet!"" – the gun falls out on the floor in front of everybody and he gets the sack. Travelling home still in costume on the super-grungy Gotham subway, three drunken yuppies ridicule and assault him, sarcastically singing ""send in the clowns"", and Arthur snaps. Gotham, already in chaos, is electrified by the killer clown. The would-be mayor of the city, Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), inflames tensions. ""Those of us who have made something of our lives will always look at those who haven't as clowns,"" he says – and rioting protestors begin to adopt clown masks as an identity. Oddly, Arthur's mother has always insisted that Wayne, father of the future Batman, whom she once worked for, is ""family""... Joaquin Phoenix was pretty terrifying as the deranged killer, also living at home with his mother, in Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here. Here he is just extraordinary, always dancing and posing, often topless, working that oddly lumpy, peculiarly hard to outline body, so wasted that his muscles and bones are bulging right there beneath the skin. His face seems a similarly both very strongly defined and yet unnervingly plastic, sometimes fiercely concentrated, sometimes completely distorted in a mad grin. It's a total physical inhabitation and one of the most alarming portraits of psychosis ever put on the screen, quite deliberately out De Niro-ing the young Robert De Niro. It's unthinkable anybody else could have played this part now. Sure, the cinematography is wildly expressive too, the music thumping, the colours hypnotically vivid in this deliberately dark Gotham (the film opens a new strand called DC Black, separate from the already sufficiently murky DC Extended Universe). But it is Joaquin Phoenix who completely owns Joker. No joke, that.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," Skills on display include but are not limited to leering, jeering, airhorn-style blasts of laughter timed for maximum audience discomfort, funky-chicken style dance moves, the occasional blank, dead stare and assorted moony expressions indicating soulful lonerism. But don’t for a minute think Phoenix isn’t funny, too. They say you never forget Clowning 101, and Phoenix hasn’t: He hops around like an unhinged Emmett Kelly, twisting his physique into weird and unsettling shapes. His body has a rubbery angularity, like a chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola. In Joker — playing in competition here at the Venice Film Festival — Phoenix is acting so hard you can feel the desperation throbbing in his veins. He leaves you wanting to start him a GoFundMe, so he won’t have to pour so much sweat into his job again. But the aggressive terribleness of his performance isn’t completely his fault. (He has often been, and generally remains, a superb actor. Just not here.) Director Todd Phillips — who made frat-boy comedies like Road Trip and Old School before graduating to dude-bro comedies like The Hangover movies — bears at least some of the blame, and the aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy of Joker overall is his alone to answer for. Phillips may want us to think he’s giving us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture, but really, he’s just offering a prime example of it. Joker is a stand-alone origin story that dovetails with, but does not strictly follow, DC Universe Batman lore. Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck — he’ll later become one of Batman’s nemeses, the Joker, in case you didn’t already know that — is an odd, lonely guy who lives at home with the mother (played by a wan Frances Conroy) he love-hates. Arthur works for a sad rent-a-clown joint, and nothing ever goes right. This is clear from the moment we meet him: he’s tense and nervous and he can’t relax. The movie is set in a Gotham City that’s a lazy approximation of gritty 1970s-era New York, complete with garbage strikes and “super-rats” overrunning the city. On the job in clown costume, Arthur gets beaten up by a mob of nasty punks — and then almost gets fired because they stole and broke the “going out of business sign” he was twirling for a client. More bad stuff happens, day in, day out. He gets angrier and more isolated by the minute. No one is ever kind to Arthur; he’s the world’s saddest punching bag. When the city’s social services close down, he can no longer receive counseling there, or get his meds. (He carries around a little laminated card that he holds out helpfully whenever he laughs inappropriately, which is pretty much all the time. It reads, “Forgive my laughter, I have a brain injury.”) The one bright spot of his day, or night, is watching a Johnny Carson-style talk-show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), on television. He dreams of being a stand-up comic and someday being on the show. His wish will come true, but life will have beaten the poor lad down interminably before then. As you can probably guess, all of Arthur’s travails are leading up to a series of “See what you made me do?” brutalities, most of which happen while he’s dressed up in his clown suit. Violence makes him feel more in control, less pathetic. Killing — usually with a gun, but scissors or a good old-fashioned suffocation will do just fine — empowers him. But it’s not as if we don’t know how this pathology works: In America, there’s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week. And yet we’re supposed to feel some sympathy for Arthur, the troubled lamb; he just hasn’t had enough love. Before long, he becomes a vigilante folk hero — his first signature act is to kill a trio of annoying Wall Street spuds while riding the subway, which inspires the masses to don clown masks and march enthusiastically around the city with “Kill the Rich!” placards. Arthur also tries to work out a personal beef with rich asshat and aspiring city mayor Thomas Wayne, father of you-know-who. Because, it turns out, Arthur has some daddy issues too. Who would have guessed? Joker — which was written by Phillips and Scott Silver — doesn’t have a plot; it’s more like a bunch of reaction GIFs strung together. When Arthur gets fired from his clown job, he struts by the time-clock, deadpans, “Oh no, I forgot to punch out” and then, wait for it, socks it so hard it dangles from the wall. Make a note of the moment, because you’ll be seeing it a lot in your Twitter and Facebook feeds. The movie’s cracks — and it’s practically all cracks — are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it’s imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, “Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody’s civil anymore.” Who doesn’t feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur’s observation is one of those truisms that’s so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing. Meanwhile, the movie lionizes and glamorizes Arthur even as it shakes its head, faux-sorrowfully, over his violent behavior. There’s an aimless subplot involving a neighbor in Arthur’s apartment building, played by Zazie Beetz, in an underdeveloped role. (Beetz also appears in another movie here at the festival, Benedict Andrews’s Seberg, where she’s given much more to do.) Arthur has a crush on her, and though he does her no harm, there’s still something creepily entitled about his attentiveness to her. He could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels. Arthur is a mess, but we’re also supposed to think he’s kind of great — a misunderstood savant. Dressed up for his big TV moment in a turquoise paisley shirt, marigold vest and dapper cranberry suit (admittedly a marvelous feat of costume design), Arthur struts down an outdoor stairway like a rock’n’roll hero. It’s the most energizing moment in the movie, but what is it winding us up for? Arthur inspires chaos and anarchy, but the movie makes it look like he’s starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can’t get a date become killer heroes. There’s a sick joke in there somewhere. Unfortunately, it’s on us.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," As Gotham begins to burn (the civil unrest starts with a garbage strike), Fleck, who has been taken as a vigilante by much of the city’s 99%, doesn’t quite know what to make of his underground cult stardom. (The city is beset by rioters in clown makeup and clown masks; because this movie is rather suddenly behind the curve in “clowns-are-scary” awareness—only Pennywise gets a special dispensation these days—these sequences look like “The Revolt of the Juggalos” or something equally laughable.) His mom (Frances Conroy, the poor woman) has been writing letters to her former employer, the magnate Thomas Wayne, and Arthur opens one of the missives and reads them, learning something disturbing.  Glenn Kenny was the chief film critic of Premiere magazine for almost half of its existence.

"Aug 31, 2019"," A notice hangs on the headboard of a public staircase that reads, “Don’t forget to smile”. As he saunters underneath it, Joaquin Phoenix’s violently depressive deadbeat rent-a-clown, Arthur Fleck, pulls out a black marker pen from his pocket and scrubs out the words “forget to”. This, in a grotesquely rotten nutshell, is the flash-fried turkey that is Todd Phillips’ Joker, a film which shoots for the moon in its attempt to deliver a lapel-shaking statement on the malign tenor of Our Times, yet ends up settling for feeble posturing, asinine pop psychology and political analysis charged with all the cynicism of a mollycoddled teen dropout in fake Oakleys and a home customised Linkin Park tee. The story takes place during a garbage strike in Gotham City circa 1970. Super rats roam the streets with impunity. The only sound you can hear is that of the mental health services slamming down their shutters for the last time due to slashed budgets. All of this is a recipe for disaster when it comes to a hangdog loonbag like Arthur. One of the many laughably bad script decisions here is to gift our anti-hero with a crudely invented mental disorder which causes him, in moments of high anxiety, to start cackling like a maniac. The cognitive dissonance of having a man laughing heartily at inopportune or awkward moments is the film’s one and only motif, and Phillips hammers it for all it’s worth. Which, it turns out, is not a lot. It is the tale of a man who lives with his mother in a dingy apartment and openly harbours the ambition of becoming a stand-up comedian. He is cracked and clearly troubled, but the film handily takes place in a world were empathy has died and capitalist dirtbags crush the vulnerable under the heel of their designer loafers. Business magnate Thomas Wayne makes a faux pas on TV when he refers to the underclass rabble as “clowns” who are unable to get their act together. And lo, a movement is born, and they’re tooled up, on the streets (there are no chatrooms in the 1970s) and baying for the blood of fat cats. The first big problem is that the film cannot decide whether it wants to keep its powder dry in terms of its relationship to the wider world of superhero lore. It opens on a classic 1970s Warner Bros logo in a misguided attempt to connect itself to one of cinema’s golden eras – making it appear even worse by comparison. It tries desperately hard to come across as edgy, but coldly refuses to swerve from the hard-painted lanes of templated Hollywood filmmaking. It ends up resembling nothing more than a Suicide Squad spin-off movie. Yet its ambitions are certainly more lofty. It craves that viewers draw a connection to Martin Scorsese’s 1982 masterpiece The King of Comedy and, to a slightly lesser extent, 1976’s Taxi Driver. And its toadying relationship to those films may ultimately be its undoing, in that it sits clawing at the trouser hem of some of those towering examples of modern film art. It misappropriates, misreads and maybe even misremembers key themes and cack-handedly mangles mischievous ambiguities into a ham-fisted character shading. Robert De Niro turns up to consecrate the bond, the big twist being he is unspeakably awful in the supporting role of a flashy late night TV host. Elsewhere, the film is interested far less in forming a credible psychological profile of Fleck than it is taking wavy-armed pot shots at a society that would cultivate such a twisted soul. This is evident in the fact that Fleck unsubtly alludes to the idea in virtually every scene prior to the moment when he literally bellows it into the camera. It’s strange to watch a film about a character who claims repeatedly that he doesn’t believe in anything, but then its makers refuse to work with that precarious mindset to actually include something, anything in the film that doesn’t feel recycled from elsewhere, or is at the slavish service of a plotline of near-offensive predictability. As is customary these days, a dialogue around the film’s intentions and meanings may erupt in the public sphere (the film almost addresses the idea directly), but this dialogue would be unwarranted and undeserved, as the language used to make its case is so flimsy. There’s a one-size-fits-all political allegory at its core, and there is nothing impressive about a work of art where any half-assed interpretation sticks firmly. There is no ambiguity here. In terms of Phoenix, it’s hard to tell whether this is a poor performance, or if he just has precious little to work with in material which never has him push beyond a cosy safety zone. Fond memories of Freddie Quell and Doc Sportello, from Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master and Inherent Vice respectively, work to make the schtick he’s rolling out here seem so affected and empty. Many scenes involve him contorting his bare torso (he is literally “twisted”), allowing the camera a leery view of his protruding ribcage or hunchback-like shoulder blades. It comes across as if Phillips is desperate to emphasise that he’s a serious artist with a serious leading man who is going full method on this sucker, but constantly loses sight of actually sculpting a semi-interesting or even lightly coherent character. It’s a sign of Joker’s across-the-board superficiality which runs marrow deep.

"Aug 31, 2019"," Dir: Todd Phillips. Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Frances Conroy, Zazie Beetz, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Marc Maron. Cert 15, 118 mins. A part of me found Todd Phillips’s radical rethinking of the Batman villain Joker thrillingly uncompromising and hair-raisingly timely. Another thinks it should be locked in a strongbox then dropped in the ocean and never released. Make no mistake, this is a film that is going to stir up trouble – in the consciences of everyone who watches it, and almost certainly in the outside world as well. The dizzy, punch-drunk atmosphere after the film's first screening at the Venice Film Festival mirrored the mood when Fight Club premiered here 20 years earlier, and critics tried to work out if the film was a sly critique of meathead fascism or a feature-length recruiting advert for it. To be clear, I don’t believe for a second that Phillips and his Oscar-winning star, Joaquin Phoenix, actually think that their version of the classic Batman bad guy is in fact a hero to be glorified and emulated. But I worry that someone out there will.  Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, an unstable, narcissistic 30-something loner who lives with his elderly mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in a version of Gotham City that is to all intents and purposes Manhattan in the early 1980s. Even Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), billionaire father of Bruce, is reimagined as a puffed-up, Trump-like plutocrat.  Arthur works as a party clown at a shabby downtown talent agency, but dreams of making it as a stand-up comedian, and collects his material in a “joke diary” in a barely legible scrawl, interspersed with explicit magazine clippings. At times of stress, he is seized by an uncontrollable urge to laugh: comic-book catchphrase recast as psychosomatic tic. “Is it just me, or are things getting crazier out there?” Arthur asks his therapist after one such involuntary bout of hysteria, and it’s true that the world outside looks like an early Martin Scorsese film. Two specifically, in fact: Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, which aren’t touchstones for Joker so much as its bedrock. (In a smarter-than-you’d-think self-referential turn, Robert De Niro plays Arthur’s favourite talk show host, Murray Franklin, in a pair of Jerry Lewis-style Aviator glasses.) Yet if Arthur is essentially written as Travis Bickle crossed with Rupert Pupkin, Phoenix uses his pipe-cleaner physique (the actor reportedly lost more than three stone for the role) to draw out the character’s inherent clownishness. His improvised soft-shoe-shuffle dance routines are carried off with Chaplin-esque elegance, while his ludicrous, flat-footed sprint recalls a Keystone Cops chase. Not that you’ll be laughing much yourself. Superhero blockbuster this is not: a playful fireman’s-pole-based homage to the old Batman television series is one of a very few lighthearted moments in an otherwise oppressively downbeat and reality-grounded urban thriller in the vintage Warner Bros mode. Besides Scorsese, Phillips’s film draws heavily from the real-life tale of Bernhard Goetz – New York’s so-called “Subway Vigilante” who in 1984 shot four black teenagers on public transport on the grounds that he thought he was about to be mugged, and become a dubious folk hero in some quarters for supposedly taking a stand against the city’s slide into lawlessness. After a fateful confrontation with some obnoxious Wall Street traders, Arthur effectively becomes Gotham’s own Goetz, and his clown make-up, reproduced on newspaper front pages in a terrifying eyewitness sketch, becomes a symbol of underclass resistance. Suddenly, this invisible pavement-crack dweller feels like he’s been seen – and the clown masks that slowly begin to appear at protests are all the encouragement he needs.  Note that this all takes place long before Batman arrives on the scene, though if you thought Joker would miss the opportunity to re-dramatise a certain done-to-death formative moment of his in a dark alley behind a cinema, you thought wrong. Just as Heath Ledger’s take on the character in 2008’s The Dark Knight was rooted in the 9/11-shaken times – as a source of terror he was unpredictable and inexplicable, emerging from goodness-knows-where – it seems apt that the Joker of 2019 should be the guy who was there all along. For anyone with an eye on the news, Arthur is a horribly familiar case study: quiet, bullied, overlooked, loves his mum, keeps himself to himself, then writes his manifesto and takes his grievances murderously viral. And artistic intentions aside, there is something inescapably and chillingly glamorous in watching Arthur’s Joker persona emerge, like a poison-striped parasite devouring its host. I admit I was glued to Phoenix, loved wallowing in the neon murk, and left the screen in semi-dazed awe of Phillips – who was previously best known as the director of the Hangover comedies – for having the nerve to take what is still essentially a studio film spun off from superhero franchise as far as he has. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," 1981.in Gotham City. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. There’s a garbage strike, rats rampaging in the piled-up trash, parts of the city are no better than slums and Arthur Fleck, troubled professional clown and wannabe stand-up comedian, sits in front of a mirror, slowly painting his face. He attempts to smile and resorts to holding the corners of his mouth up in a grin that stretches from ear to ear. A single tear rolls down his cheek unnoticed, pulling his make-up with it. So begins Joker. There’s not a costume or burst of CGI in sight. Just a man. A sad clown. Arthur is one of life’s victims, one of life’s “freaks”. He’s beaten-up, mocked, abused. He’s all too familiar with the taste of blood in his mouth. But he’s not just a loner or misunderstood; he can’t engage with the world at all. Everyday existence is simply impossible as the rules and codes that structure a society – even one as broken and busted as Gotham – remain unknowable to him. He stands outside of the world instead, partly due to a condition which causes uncontrollable laughter (often in the worst situations), his eyes thick with pain and sadness as another laughing fit overcomes him and the world retreats yet further. “I just don’t want to feel so bad anymore,” whispers Arthur, who’s also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won’t be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That’s too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It’s a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn’t visible; who doesn’t even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn’t guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn’t forget, the story of how a villain was made. But what writer/director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter) have written into life is the Joker as a character. What they and the film is interested in is the mental, moral, emotional, physical make-up of the man who became the Joker. As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it’s a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise — the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it’s captivating, even overwhelming in moments. Comparing him to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson feels like a nonsense: this is a Joker we’ve never seen — in many respects it isn’t the Joker, it’s Arthur. This is a deliberate consequence of stepping away from the source material. Phillips has said that though elements were drawn from 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke (in which the Joker is an unsuccessful stand-up), the film doesn’t follow the comic books. A bold move for a universe with such an ardent fan base, but it’s the film’s greatest asset. Not only does it, and the character, sit completely apart from the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe, but it stands apart from comic book movies entirely (even The Dark Knight, as grounded as it was). It’s a character and a movie that’s liberated, entirely. Free to be whatever and whomever it choose. While this is Phoenix’s film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur’s mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin. Phillips has made no secret of his love for The King Of Comedy and it’s a sprinkle of magic to see Rupert Pupkin become Murray Franklin. Mention must be made of Joker’s cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir — mournful, dark and fractured — and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right. Oppressive and oppressed, with a glimmer of light that never truly gets in. It throbs at the very heart of the film, waiting for what is destined to come. And the two things entwine perfectly as Arthur dances between the light and the shadows, each bone visible and sharp as the strings swell and scratch.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," For so many tragic reasons, the American imagination has of late been preoccupied with the motivations of disaffected white men who’ve turned violent—a nation (or part of one) trying to diagnose and explain them, one mass killing after another. Whether that violence is born of mental illness, isolation, the culminated rage of masculine identity, or all those bound together in some hideous knot, we seem certain that there is some salvable cause. That’s a complexity of causality that many Americans don’t extend to non-white men who commit heinous crimes; there, the thinking seems to be, the evil is far more easily identifiable. But those angry loners—the ones who shoot up schools and concerts and churches, who gun down the women and men they covet and envy, who let loose some spirit of anarchic animus upon the world—there’s almost a woebegone mythos placed on them in the search for answers. I thought a lot about that while watching Joker, the new origin story from director Todd Phillips, which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival on Saturday. In the film, written by Phillips and Scott Silver, we watch the terrible burgeoning of just such a man and are, in some grim way, asked to sympathize with him. Because that man, called Arthur for much of the film, is to become perhaps the most famous of all comic book villains (certainly Batman’s main bedeviling nemesis), that sense of willing understanding is more easily conjured up. Phillips knows this, smuggling a heap of dark social commentary inside the gritty comic book reboot package. The problem of the film for me is that this technique both works and maybe really doesn’t. There is undeniable style and propulsive charge to Joker, a film that looms and leers with nasty inexorability. It’s exhilarating in the most prurient of ways, a snuff film about the death of order, about the rot of a governing ethos. But from a step back, outside in the baking Venetian heat, it also may be irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes. Is Joker celebratory or horrified? Or is there simply no difference, the way there wasn’t in Natural Born Killers or myriad other “America, man” movies about the freeing allure of depravity? The honest answer is, I don’t know. Not after one viewing, anyway. What I can tell you is that the reaction to the film from my packed audience of Italians and other international filmgoers sounded like roaring acclaim. Perhaps it’s a bit easier to accept and digest all this horror in a country where such men seem rarer—or I’m being an over-worried pill, and it’s just a bold, startling movie. At the center of all this creeping ruin is Joaquin Phoenix, hunched and emaciated, laughing and laughing and laughing (and dancing) away. Phoenix puts a pained spin on the famed Joker howl, the film explaining that it’s some kind of Tourettic reaction to stress that he can’t control. An interesting alteration, but also one of the many elements of the movie that could be seen as stigmatizing neuroatypicality, coding it as a symbol of off-ness and malevolence. Still, we are meant to feel for Phoenix’s Arthur, a low-rent professional clown and pathetically aspiring comedian who lives with his ailing mother (Frances Conroy) in a weary corner of Gotham City. Arthur is so screamingly lonely, so hungry for some sense of purpose and belonging; who can’t relate to that in some way? Outside Arthur’s addled interior world, the city is crumbling, wealth inequality creating a roiling underclass desperate to reclaim the pride and dignity of being. Again, relatable. But as Arthur descends into the fury of his mind (government austerity has cut off his supply of medication), murder becomes his only release, a gun his only friend and sense of agency—of assertive strength, really. Because lurking behind Arthur’s longing for attention and approval is, of course, a more consuming wish; with great love comes great power. It’s unclear exactly what Phillips wants us to draw from all this. Maybe it’s a warning about something we already know all too well. But maybe, with all the arch period music (the movie seems located somewhere in the 1970s) and Phoenix theatrics, a small part of us is supposed to agree. Which should scare us, I think. But then again, my audience’s enthusiastic reaction also suggested something like catharsis. None of these questions would be as urgent and unsettling were it not for Phoenix’s wholly committed performance. I’ve not always gotten along with Phoenix’s mannered, muscle-strained approach to his craft, but here he makes a compelling case for going full-tilt. He somehow doesn’t condescend to Arthur’s condition, even if the movie around him sometimes does. There’s a softness cutting through the affect, a sorrow of soul that gives Joker a pale, tragic glow. The movie is, for a good stretch, a troubling and arresting character study, one done with nervy conviction. Eventually, though, Phillips has to more tightly attach this downward spiral to the larger Gotham mythology, which is where the provocative ambivalence of the film gives way to veneration. The climax is a gnarly triumph for the man who has now turned into the Joker, a baptism of blood and fire which brings to mind the political protests that have swept the world this decade, and the far more discrete, unknowable incident of Christine Chubbuck’s death. (There’s some Bernie Goetz in there, too.) The Joker claims to have no personal politics, but he certainly is political. Phillips may be making a point here about the perils of revolutionary populism, about the risk of courting anarchy. Then again, it’s Gotham’s most famous family, the richest and most omnipotent of the bunch, who are also painted as villains. (One of them, anyway.) So isn’t the Joker, then, a hero of the people? Mad and menacing, but also righteous? Seek Joker out so you can answer that question for yourself. Do let me know what you come up with. In the meantime, I’m left wondering just how serious this film is meant to be.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," If you are a journalist covering the Venice International Film Festival, you go into the experience accepting a few basic ground rules. You will drink bellinis and swat away mosquitoes. You will stand in long but generally fast-moving lines in sometimes unendurable heat. And you will be freed, at least temporarily, from the obligations of watching and writing about comic-book movies. I say this not to show any disdain for comic-book movies, but only to point out the well-established seasonal logic by which the film industry typically operates. The summer — the designated stomping ground for superheroes and super-villains — has finally passed, making way for the fall and its traditional bounty of ascetic art films, spit-shined prestige pictures and other subspecies of cinema that have no place in the Marvel and DC Comics universes. That changed Saturday, when Venice hosted the much-anticipated world premiere of “Joker,” the fastidiously grim new movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s greatest and most defiantly unhinged nemesis. Its high-profile fall premieres (it will screen next at the Toronto International Film Festival before its release Oct. 4 through Warner Bros.) are clearly meant to signal its artistic ambition and seriousness of intent, to reassure you that what you are about to experience will be anything but business as usual. That may be the only respect in which this movie could possibly be thought of as reassuring. Directed with striking intensity and concentration by Todd Phillips (“The Hangover” movies, “War Dogs”), “Joker” is a dark, brooding and psychologically plausible origin story, a vision of cartoon sociopathy made flesh. It unfolds in a gritty Gotham City circa 1981, where Batman is nowhere to be seen and the air is thick with the stench of garbage and social unrest. The city is hard and ugly and mean as hell, a place at war with itself. And its most embattled citizen may well be Arthur Fleck, a heavily medicated sad sack who, when he’s not getting beat up on his job as a sign-waving street clown, aspires to become a standup comedian. Mainly, though, Arthur inhabits a realm of broken dreams, deep-seated traumas and increasingly warped, violent fantasies. Which is another way of saying that he is the latest troubled soul to be played by Phoenix, who delivers the kind of meticulously detailed psychotic breakdown that he does better than just about any American actor now working. It’s a raw, festering wound of a performance that flirts with virtuosity and redundancy alike; when you see Arthur in the dingy apartment he shares with his mother (Frances Conroy), you may be reminded less of Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero than of Phoenix’s superb work in “You Were Never Really Here.” That title might also suit Arthur Fleck, who initially stumbles through life almost entirely unseen — but not unheard. Arthur is regularly seized by paroxysms of uncontrollable laughter, the product of a rare medical condition that makes him even more of a pariah than he is already. Phoenix wrings a lot of variations on that laugh: Sometimes it’s forced and aggressive, like a hacking cough, and sometimes it’s high and lilting, the effect of which is somehow even more unnerving. But his laughter also has a painfully poignant undertow: It’s as if Arthur, who longs to make the people around him laugh, were involuntarily compensating for his failure to do so. Along the way, Phillips, drawing loose inspiration from the 1988 graphic novel “Batman: The Killing Joke,” takes his time nudging various pieces of the Batman mythology into position: a mention of Arkham Asylum here, a glimpse of the billionaire Thomas Wayne there. (He is played, with lofty patrician indifference, by Brett Cullen.) But the director also clearly has an eye on America circa 2019; among other things, “Joker” morphs into a panorama of urban decay and human chaos: It’s got class warfare, unspoken racial animus and a protagonist who could be either an indictment or a mascot of the incel movement. The movie allows these rich ideas and associations to swirl around Phoenix, who just keeps laughing and seething and dancing and laughing and falling apart and laughing some more. Phillips holds the camera tight on his star, sometimes following him down long hallways from behind and often shooting him in slow-motion, while a cellist saws away mournfully in the background. He lets us feel the physicality of Phoenix’s performance, the way his rib bones seem to protrude like daggers from his emaciated frame (the actor shed 52 pounds for the role). He makes sure we note the incremental shifts in the Joker’s clown makeup, complete with blue tear streaks and blood-red rictus grin. A dark realist thriller in comic-book drag — or to put it another way, a Hollywood entertainment willing to take its time as it builds tension and brims with ideas — is nothing to scoff at. Still, there are times when your admiration for the filmmaking may blur into the movie’s own obvious admiration for itself. The mounting violence is intensely unpleasant, shocking if not particularly surprising; in scene after scene, the buildup is so agonizingly drawn out that you’re unsure whether the movie is depicting or embracing its protagonist’s cruelty. Perhaps the distinction matters less than we like to think. “Joker” is hardly the first movie inspired by comic-book characters to make a bid for high seriousness. “Black Panther” nabbed a slew of Academy Awards earlier this year, and Heath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for his own indelibly terrifying performance as the Joker in “The Dark Knight.” It will be fascinating to see what that 2008 movie’s detractors, some of whom found it too sadistic and ponderous by half, make of the even darker and more despairing “Joker.” Certainly, there will be much more to say about this bleak, troubling and damnably accomplished movie before and after it reaches theaters, but for now, it’s already clear that this clown didn’t come to play.

"Aug 31, 2019"," Joker isn’t just an awesome comic book movie, it’s an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline.

"Aug 31, 2019"," More character study than comic book movie, and anchored by an Oscar-worthy Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is a bravura blockbuster that proves you don’t need superpowered scraps to dazzle. Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. There’s a case to be made that the Joker didn’t need a definitive on-screen origin story, but two hours in the company of Joaquin Phoenix’s clown prince is guaranteed to put a (nervous) smile on your face. Going to deeper, darker and more disturbing places than any comic book movie to date, Joker isn’t just a captivating character study, it’s a superhero – or should that be supervillain? – movie like no other. That last point is impossible to overstate. Joker is so radically different from contemporary comic book cinema – structurally, tonally and morally – that it has more in common with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy than it does with The Avengers or The Dark Knight. On multiple levels, it’s the most challenging, subversive and nihilistic comic book movie ever made. Needless to say, pint-sized Bat-fans should steer clear. We’re introduced to Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) applying make-up in preparation for his day job as a clown-for-hire, his face contorted into a horrific half-smile, half-cry grimace – the result of a neurological condition that causes involuntary, pathological laughter. Arthur’s state-sponsored treatment is providing little relief, and that’s before the practice is shuttered. Living in a shabby apartment block with his infirm mum, and getting nowhere as a stand-up comedian, Arthur is treated with contempt or outright hostility by nearly everyone he encounters for being the way he is. But his life only truly starts to spiral after a violent encounter on a subway car kickstarts a terrifying transformation. Mirroring Arthur’s descent is Gotham’s own decay. It’s 1981. Rubbish is piling up on street corners, ‘super rats’ are having their fill and Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is running for mayor. Far from the altruistic entrepreneur of Bat-dads past, Cullen’s Wayne is a loathsome one-percenter who unapologetically declares Gotham’s citizens ‘clowns’ on TV. At a time when the obscene economic divide between rich and poor grows greater by the second, Joker has its finger on the political and social pulse in unexpectedly daring ways. Simply put, Gotham is a powder keg and the Joker is perfectly placed to light the fuse. It should come as little surprise that Phoenix is staggeringly good here. That he’s found a fresh take on a character as well worn as the Joker is one thing – that it feels just as definitive, in its own way, as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger’s indelible interpretations is another altogether. Physically and psychologically, it’s a horrifyingly funny performance. Losing 52lbs for the part, Phoenix twists his skeletal frame into unsettling configurations, while he runs in a broadly comic way that looks like he has oversized shoes stuck to his soles at all times. Some may feel a tinge of disappointment that Phoenix’s harlequin of hate isn’t the fully formed, gleefully cruel, criminal mastermind of the comics – this is an origin story, after all – but there are several distinctly Joker-esque sequences we won’t spoil here. And Phoenix has found a Joker laugh that’s up there with the best – a glass-shattering, half-forced cackle which you assume Arthur workshopped as a contrast to the horrible hysterics he’s forced to endure on a regular basis. In one of the film’s more unusual, but inspired, choices, Arthur erupts into serene solo dance routines after moments of extreme trauma – a kind of calm after the storm – sequences shot so exquisitely by DoP Lawrence Sher that he makes Arthur gyrating in a grotty men’s bog look idyllic. Crucially, where Jokers past have been defined by their humour and sadistic insanity, Arthur’s defining characteristic is that he’s mentally ill. Phoenix engenders such powerful empathy for Fleck that some of the horrifying setbacks he faces, including a mental health care system that profoundly fails him, are genuinely upsetting. Somehow, this deep sympathy persists even as Arthur starts to cross unconscionable lines. By the film’s charged, devilishly brilliant final act, you feel Fleck’s rage at the injustice of the world so overwhelmingly that while his actions can’t be justified, they’re clearly understood. That Joker was directed and co-written by Todd Phillips – best known for the Hangover trilogy – makes this all the more remarkable. Phillips and the Ace of Knaves have turned out to be the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material; practically every choice is on the money. The early ’80s aesthetic is so convincing it almost feels like a film made by a Scorsese contemporary. The presence of near-omnipotent background noise – ringing phones, barking dogs, droning TVs – slowly sends you up the wall, reflecting Arthur’s own mental state. Chernobyl composer Hildur Guðnadóttir’s doom-laden score is sublime. And the precise deployment of numerous rug-pulling revelations only works because Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver are storytellers willing to kill DC’s golden geese. If there’s a shortcoming it’s that, in taking inspiration so transparently from Scorsese’s late ’70s/early ’80s output, Joker is a film that exists squarely in Marty’s shadow. But it gets away with such brazen thievery by openly acknowledging it. In a knowing inversion of his role in The King Of Comedy, Robert De Niro plays a beloved late night host whose show Arthur dreams of appearing on, for example. Several supporting roles are also a little thin, Zazie Beetz as a neighbour who takes a shine to Arthur being the clearest example. But this is the Joker show from first to last frame, and Phoenix brings the house down. Sure, he’s not performing magic tricks with pencils, or bringing Gotham to its knees with laughing gas, but this Joker is every bit as valid and fascinating as the ones before him, and works better for not being tied to a larger universe. If the result of the DCEU’s failure to hit on a successful, consistent tone in its films is radical standalones of this quality, it may be the once-struggling studio’s smartest move yet.

"Aug 31, 2019"," “All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy,” wrote Alan Moore in the iconic Batman: The Killing Joke. “That’s how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.” Those words clearly weighed on filmmaker Todd Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver as they tackled one of the most seemingly Sisyphean tasks in modern superhero cinema: making an origin story about the Joker. Simply titled  Joker, the film shows what happens when “one bad day” is actually “one bad lifetime,” and what happens when a world seemingly devoid of empathy pushes people too far. Set in the fictional Gotham City in the late ‘70s/early ‘80s, Joker is a slick, heady pastiche of The King of Comedy, Network, Dog Day Afternoon, and 80 years of DC Comics stories distilled into a supremely stylish and affecting package. While I had my doubts about the movie after whatever it was Jared Leto did in  Suicide Squad, Joker is a compelling character study that is propelled to greatness on the lithe, bony shoulders of Joaquin Phoenix, who delivers a powerhouse performance as the perpetually browbeaten wannabe comedian Arthur Fleck. (The fact that his name can be shortened to A. Fleck is just a hilarious bonus.) What I did not expect was for Joker to be a shockingly relevant (oftentimes on-the-nose) rumination on privilege, wealth disparity, and mental health stigmatization that also gives a fresh twist one of the most unreliable narrators in modern fiction. Joker follows the life and times of Arthur Fleck, a good-natured but emotionally stunted man who ekes out a living working as a clown to support himself and his ailing mother while he pursues his dream of being a stand-up comedian. Suffering from a neurological condition known as  pseudobulbar affect, Arthur is prone to fits of uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate moments. It is a condition which, more often than not, gets Arthur into trouble, earns him scowls and sideways glances, and contributes to a crushing sense of loneliness that characterizes his life. “The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t,” Arthur scrawls in his notebook, which serves as both a social worker-mandated chronicle of his mental well-being and a process document for his stand-up act. Filling with manic scribblings, half-thoughts, and torn-out pictures of naked women, it feels like both a cry for help and the kind of cursed manifesto one might find in the wake of a tragedy. The world of Joker’s Gotham City is a dilapidated, hostile place where uncomfortable proximity breeds friction, frayed nerves, and tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. Wracked by economic malaise, much like New York City leading up to the 1977 blackout, Gotham is a powder keg in search of a match. Every day the situation is exacerbated by wealth inequality and privilege—personified by Thomas Wayne (played to sneering perfection by Brett Cullen) and his Wall Street cronies—and the relentless scythe of politicians cutting funding for social services that the city’s economically disadvantaged rely upon for essential services. In Arthur’s case, it leaves him without the support structure of a social worker and no reliable means to get the medications that he desperately needs. Arthur seems terminally unable to catch a break and the pervasive ugliness of Gotham City pushes him to his brink one night. When Arthur’s affliction leads to an unexpected altercation on a subway, that “one bad day” arrives at last and there is no turning back from it. Through a sudden, jarring, grisly act of violence, Arthur lights the proverbial match that sets Gotham ablaze and unlocks something inside of himself, which leads to his eventual metamorphosis into the titular Joker, a nickname given to him by an unexpected source. It’s like watching a Rube-Goldberg device powered by human misery slowly transform a lonely man into an unlikely symbol of chaos and resistance. While the newly christened Joker’s big Network moment approaches  “We live in a society” meme territory at times, his message does have some merit to it: the world is in desperate need of some empathy. Let there be no doubt about it: Joaquin Phoenix is throwing his hat in the ring for the title of “ The Greatest Joker of All Time,” and he is a serious contender. With a uniquely unsettling physicality and a quiet intensity, Phoenix creates a portrait of a man desperate to belong, wracked with delusions and insecurities that keep his dreams perpetually out of arm’s reach. Phoenix’s work is made easier by an all-star cast for him to bounce off of, including Robert De Niro as the late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, Zazie Beetz as Arthur’s kindly neighbor Sophie, Frances Conroy as Arthur’s addled mother Penny, and Glenn Fleshler as a conniving coworker, just to name a few. Despite its muted color palette, Joker is a world full of colorful characters, many of whom will stick with you long after the credits roll.  With Joker, Todd Phillips has proven that he is much more than “The Hangover guy” and created one of the most unexpected and rewarding comic book movies since Logan. But simply calling Joker a “comic book movie” does it a disservice; it is a story that feels like it could be about any number of disaffected people who are marginalized by the ruthless world in which we live. If you aren’t convinced of the merits of universal healthcare after this, then you might just be a bad person. While the film sometimes tells rather than shows, even going so far as to have Arthur plainly state its thesis at one point, the finished product is so satisfying that it feels like a minor quibble. If you don’t leave your preconceptions at the door for Joker, then the last laugh will truly be on you.

"Aug 31, 2019"," 
	Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing as a mentally ill geek who becomes the killer-clown Joker in Todd Phillips' neo-'Taxi Driver' knockout: the rare comic-book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world. Audiences, as we know, can’t get enough of a great bad guy — the kind we love to hate. The worse he acts, the more we stare. Of course, the fact that we relish a villain doesn’t mean that we’re on his side; getting off on the catchy, scary spectacle of bad behavior isn’t the same as identifying with it. But in “Joker,” Todd Phillips’ hypnotically perverse, ghoulishly grippingly urban-nightmare comic fantasia, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), the mentally ill loser-freak who will, down the line, become Batman’s nemesis, stands before us not as a grand villain but as a pathetic specimen of raw human damage. Even as we’re drinking in his screw-loose antics with shock and dismay, there’s no denying that we feel something for him — a twinge of sympathy, or at least understanding. Early on, Arthur, in full clown regalia, is standing in front of a store on a jam-packed avenue, where he’s been hired to carry an “Everything Must Go” sign. A bunch of kids steal the sign and then kick the holy crap out of him. The beating fulfills a certain masochistic karma Arthur carries around, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that we feel sorry for him. “Joker” tells the story of Arthur’s descent (and, in a way, his rise), but it’s clear from the outset that he’s a basket case, a kind of maestro of his own misery. He would like, on some level, to connect, but he can’t. He’s too far out there, like Norman Bates; he’s a self-conscious, postmodern head case ­— a person who spends every moment trying to twist himself into a normal shape, but he knows the effort is doomed, so he turns it all into a “joke” that only he gets. Arthur’s response to almost everything is to laugh, and he’s got a collection of contrived guffaws — a high-pitched delirious giggle, a “hearty” yock, a stylized cackle that’s all but indistinguishable from a sob. In each case, the laughter is an act that parades itself as fakery. What it expresses isn’t glee; it expresses the fact that Arthur feels nothing, that he’s dead inside. He’s a bitter, mocking nowhere man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. For all two hours of “Joker,” Arthur, a two-bit professional clown and aspiring stand-up comic who lives with his batty mother (Frances Conroy) in a peeling-paint apartment, is front and center — in the movie, and in our psychological viewfinder. He’s at the dark heart of every scene, the way Travis Bickle was in “Taxi Driver,” and “Joker,” set in 1981 in a Gotham City that looks, with uncanny exactitude, like the squalid, graffiti-strewn, trash-heaped New York City of the early ’80s (you can feel the rot), is a movie made in direct homage to “Taxi Driver,” though there are other films it will make you think of. As the story of a putz trying to succeed as a stand-up comedian, it evokes Scorsese and De Niro’s satirical riff on “Taxi Driver,” “The King of Comedy.” There are also elements lifted from “Death Wish,” “Network,” “V for Vendetta,” “The Empire Strikes Back,” “The Shining” and “The Purge.” More than that, though, the whole movie, in spirit, is a kind of origin-story riff on Heath Ledger’s performance in “The Dark Knight”: the comic-book villain as Method psycho, a troublemaker so intense in his cuckoo hostility that even as you’re gawking at his violence, you still feel his pain. Phoenix’s performance is astonishing. He appears to have lost weight for the role, so that his ribs and shoulder blades protrude, and the leanness burns his face down to its expressive essence: black eyebrows, sallow cheeks sunk in gloom, a mouth so rubbery it seems to be snarking at the very notion of expression, all set off by a greasy mop of hair. Phoenix is playing a geek with an unhinged mind, yet he’s so controlled that he’s mesmerizing. He stays true to the desperate logic of Arthur’s unhappiness. You’re always aware of how much the mood and design of “Joker” owe to “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy.” For a filmmaker gifted enough to stand on his own, Phillips is too beholden to his idols. Yet within that scheme, he creates a dazzlingly disturbed psycho morality play, one that speaks to the age of incels and mass shooters and no-hope politics, of the kind of hate that emerges from crushed dreams. Arthur and his mother sit around after hours, watching the late-night talk-show host Murray Franklin (played, by De Niro, as a piece of old-school Carson vaudeville), and as much as we think Arthur should move out and leave his mommy behind, we hardly know the half of it. When he gets fired (for revealing a handgun during a clown gig at a children’s hospital ward), there’s a suspense built into everything that happens, and it spins around the question: How will someone this weak and inept, this trapped in the nuttiness of his self-delusion, evolve into a figure of dark power? At night, on the subway, Arthur, still wearing his clown suit, is taunted and attacked by three young Wall Street players. So he pulls out his gun like Charles Bronson and shoots them dead. The case becomes tabloid fodder (“Killer Clown on the Loose”), and the sensation of it is that the denizens of Gotham think he’s a hero. That sounds like a standard comic-book-movie ploy, but the twisted commitment of Phoenix’s performance lets us feel how the violence cleanses Arthur; doing tai chi in a bathroom after the murders, he’s reborn. And we believe in his thirst for escape, because Phillips, working with the cinematographer Lawrence Sher (who evokes “Taxi Driver’s” gray-green documentary seaminess), creates an urban inferno so lifelike that it threatens to make the film-noir Gotham of “The Dark Knight” look like a video game. Of course, a rebellion against the ruling elite — which is what Arthur’s vigilante action comes to symbolize — is more plausible now than it was a decade ago. “Joker” is a comic-book tale rendered with sinister topical fervor. When Arthur, on the elevator, connects with Sophie (Zazie Beetz), his neighbor, the two take turns miming Travis Bickle’s finger-gun-against-the-head suicide gesture, which becomes the film’s key motif. It’s a way of saying: This is what America has come to — a place where people feel like blowing their brains out. The relationship between Arthur and Sophie doesn’t track if you think about it too much, but it’s a riff on one that didn’t totally track either — the link, however fleeting, between Travis and Cybill Shepherd’s Betsy in “Taxi Driver.” Arthur, in a funny way, hides his brains (they’re revealed only when he passes through the looking glass of villainy). He’s got a piece missing. But what fills the space is violence. Many have asked, and with good reason: Do we need another Joker movie? Yet what we do need — badly — are comic-book films that have a verité gravitas, that unfold in the real world, so that there’s something more dramatic at stake than whether the film in question is going to rack up a billion-and-a-half dollars worldwide. “Joker” manages the nimble feat of telling the Joker’s origin story as if it were unprecedented. We feel a tingle when Bruce Wayne comes into the picture; he’s there less as a force than an omen. And we feel a deeply deranged thrill when Arthur, having come out the other side of his rage, emerges wearing smeary make-up, green hair, an orange vest and a rust-colored suit. When he dances on the long concrete stairway near his home, like a demonic Michael Jackson, with Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2” bopping on the soundtrack, it’s a moment of transcendent insanity, because he’s not trying to be “the Joker.” He’s just improvising, going with the flow of his madness. And when he gets his fluky big shot to go on TV, we think we know what’s going to happen (that he’s destined to be humiliated), but what we see, instead, is a monster reborn with a smile. And lo and behold, we’re on his side. Because the movie does something that flirts with danger — it gives evil a clown-mask makeover, turning it into the sickest possible form of cool.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," It’s a rare occurrence when you watch a film and realize that you’ve spoken out loud about it before it’s over. I apologize to the person sitting next to me, but I think he totally understood. There was a moment while watching Joker when the screen went black and a breathless “wow” came out of my mouth before I realized it. Joaquin Phoenix is astounding as Arthur Fleck/Joker. Yes, that’s a big word, but it’s the first thing that came to mind after my inadvertent exclamation. Before I go into the Joker review, though, I do want to address one thing. Fans freaked out when a misquote from director Todd Phillips came out saying he wasn’t basing this on the comics. It is based on the comics. It’s just not based on a single comic story. You can breathe now.  Though the narrative doesn’t rely heavily on a specific plotline, it’s tied in enough to the character we know and love to hate that comic fans aren’t likely to have any issues here. I won’t say more because you definitely don’t want to get spoiled. This is a character study, though, so what we see of the larger world of Gotham is less important than what we see of Arthur and his journey into madness/who he really is. Another issue fans were having was the fact that the Joker really doesn’t have an origin story. He certainly tells some to us, but we can’t trust him. He’s an unreliable narrator, as it were. The same is true here. Yes, we get a story, but since this tale is from the Joker’s point of view, we can’t completely trust what we’re seeing. That’s not a reach on my part. It’s very clear in the film that we can’t. It’s also very clear why that is. It’s a master class in directing from Phillips, letting us study a character in such an in-depth way, all the while knowing that that character can only tell us so much. You’ll understand more about why this being an origin story works by the end of the film. The film is set in Gotham in the gritty and grungy late ’70s and early ’80s. You sometimes forget how aesthetically ugly a time that was, and it serves the story well. The gulf between the haves and have-nots is getting wider; there is a garbage strike, and the people in power call those without it “clowns.” Sound familiar?  There is going to be a lot of talk about how what we see in the film reflects the world we live in right now and how monsters come to be. It’s one of the reasons this is so hard to watch. In a way, we’re looking at that guy with a devastating mental illness who we didn’t say hi to that one time and wonder if that was the catalyst for his later actions. It speaks to a deep fear many of us have in a time of uncertainty about what causes people to snap. It also has something to say about what happens when funding for those suffering from mental illness is cut.  This is a story about a character that we love, who is sometimes written in a funny way that takes a bit of the bite out of who he’d be if he was a real person. The lovable Joker we’ve seen in other films is gone and replaced by someone suffering from something painfully real. That’s what makes it so uncomfortable. We can see what might have been if things had been different if people had been kinder if the world had been a different place. We also see how dangerous and inspiring criminals who fight back against the system can be when things are dark in the world and what damage and violence that inspiration can cause. The setting and the dire situation in Gotham are other characters in the film, and Phillips beautifully nails the feel of character studies from the time period. You’re also going to feel The King of Comedy vibe here and see its influence, including a switch in character with Robert De Niro’s Murray Franklin. I don’t want to say more than that, but he’s perfect, which will surprise exactly no one. t’s a deft way to handle it that reminds me of how the TV series Westworld handled what could have been an awful scene to watch with implication rather than showing it outright. It’s what you don’t see that makes you uncomfortable sometimes. That’s the case with the violence as well. Yes, this film definitely deserves the R rating, and there are moments of intense violence, but the dread is really the thing that will make you squirm, rather than gore. Phoenix absolutely transforms himself into Arthur Fleck. The physical moment of the character alone could convey what was going on with him, even if there had been no dialogue. Early on in the film, we see a moment of Arthur laughing, as we find out that uncontrollable laughter is part of the physical/mental condition he has. It looks painful. His eyes flick through emotions like joy and desperation to feel that joy, pain, sadness, despair, fear, and vulnerability in the few moments that awful laugh takes. (Awful for him, but chilling for us.) It immediately tells us who this person is and what he struggles with, makes us sympathize with him and how he’s been treated, and makes us fear him. That laugh is an unintentional mask that keeps the world from really knowing exactly who they’re dealing with on a superficial level, but if any of them took any time to look into his eyes, it would stop them in their tracks. Phoenix’s physicality is far more reliable than what Arthur actually says and acts as an indicator of who he is and what’s happening. He’s awkward and twisted (particularly his arms and the position of his head) when he’s trying to be “normal.” The little dances he does, as he tries to act sexy or confident, are the sort that makes you embarrassed for someone at a party. As he becomes who he really is, the movements are powerful. The dance is very different. His face goes from, forgive me, sad clown to relaxed and confident. Arthur is telling his own story here, so the audience feels relief to see him this way, all the while horrified by his actions.  The excellent score by Hildur Guðnadóttir reflects his journey from a sad sack to a powerful villain as well, not only in the volume but in the music choices. It’s as if Arthur’s inner soundtrack is showing us the level of belief in himself and the rightness of his decisions as they grow. I’ll say it right now: Phoenix will be nominated for his work here, and rightly so. I’m struggling to find something to critique here. As I’ve spoken about the film to myself and my colleagues, I’ve come up with nothing. I’m sure I won’t be the only one. This standalone film was a brave choice by Warner Bros., and it’s very likely going to pay off. Again, this is a difficult film to watch, and it’s going to take time to process, but ultimately, I think this is going to be a definitive part of the Joker canon.  I can’t finish without comparing this performance to Heath Ledger’s in The Dark Knight, of course. I believe that both performances are brilliant, and this takes nothing away from the work Ledger did. These are different versions of the Joker, and both can exist side by side as incredible interpretations. Joker opens in theaters on October 4, 2019. Click here for all our Joker coverage.

"Aug 31, 2019"," The clown prince of crime is alive and mentally unwell in Gotham City in Todd Phillips‘ grippingly atmospheric supervillain origin story, Joker. While a never-better Joaquin Phoenix paints on the famed maniacal smile with his own blood at one memorable climactic moment of messianic rebirth, what’s most noteworthy about this gritty entry in the DC canon and the lead actor’s sensational performance is the pathos he brings to a pathetically disenfranchised character — just like countless others in a metropolis in which the social chasm separating the haves from the have-nots has become a pit of incendiary rage. This is very much tethered to the superhero universe and intersects in ways both familiar and not with canonical Batman lore. But Joker could also be a film for audiences who don’t much care about the usual Hollywood comic-strip assembly line. The smart screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver anchors the story in a fiercely divided city with echoes of a contemporary, morally bankrupt America, albeit in the dire economic straits of a decade ago, or the next crisis that’s just around the corner, depending on which financial forecasts you believe. Built around a credible spiral from lonely outsider to deranged killer, it’s as much a neo-noir psychological character study grounded in urban alienation and styled after Taxi Driver as a rise-of-the-supervillain portrait. It’s arguably the best Batman-adjacent movie since The Dark Knight, and Warner Bros. should see mighty box office numbers to reflect that. The must-see factor of Phoenix’s riveting performance alone — it’s both unsettling and weirdly affecting — will be significant. The film is also an obvious homage to another Martin Scorsese title, The King of Comedy, with Robert De Niro playing the host of Live With Murray Franklin, a network late-night show that Phoenix’s party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, dreams of appearing on. Arthur tunes in to the show religiously with his sickly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in their dingy tenement apartment, drifting early on into a fantasy in which he’s plucked out of the studio audience to be embraced on-camera by Murray, stepping in for the father he has never known. Arthur even studies guests on the show and rehearses his entrance and couch banter at home, Rupert Pupkin-style, though it’s clear from the outset that his disillusionment with Murray will turn ugly. Some brisk scene-setting via opening news reports announces a city-wide emergency as an ongoing strike has left trash piling up, attracting a plague of “super-rats,” while fire-sale signs line the depressed retail streets. Arthur is first seen trying on a smile and then a frown, a tear streaking his white clown makeup before he heads out for work carrying an “Everything Must Go” discount sign for a struggling business. He’s jumped by a bunch of teen hoodlums who steal his sign and give him a beating in an alley. “Is it just me or is the city getting crazier?” he asks his social worker (Sharon Washington), while requesting additional meds on top of the seven he’s already taking. She agrees these are tough times, people are out of work and struggling. One key symptom of Arthur’s mental illness is a kind of ha-ha Tourette’s — a medical condition that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably, usually at awkward moments. He carries a card by way of explanation, reading “Forgive My Laughter.” This has contributed to his reputation as a freak at work and pretty much confined his social circle to his mother. She nicknamed him “Happy” from a young age and told him he was “put here to spread joy and laughter.” But Arthur most of the time feels barely alive. When Randall (Glenn Fleshler), a colleague at the clown-for-hire service where he works, slips him a handgun to protect himself, Arthur starts showing a little more spark. This manifests in the first of several mesmerizing sequences of shirtless dance (this one to “Slap That Bass,” from the Fred Astaire movie Shall We Dance), in which Phoenix’s sinewy body contorts in twisted rapture. The actor’s dramatic weight loss for the role gives him an emaciated, reptilian look. Later those moves will become more elegant — almost balletic — as he celebrates his first kills in a grimy subway restroom, and most memorably, as he struts down a stone staircase in full Joker finery to Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll (Part 2).” The music choices throughout are invigorating and slyly ironic, including a double dose of Sinatra (“That’s Life” and “Send in the Clowns”) and some vintage Cream (“White Room”) as Arthur surveys the mayhem he’s unleashed. Some of the best moments of Phoenix’s highly physical performance are the transformative interludes in which the increasingly unhinged Arthur applies his clown makeup and later dyes his hair, becoming the Joker. The protagonist’s simmering psychosis is echoed in the unrest rippling through the city, given gritty, grubby textures and deep, rich hues by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. The look of Mark Friedberg’s production design is very much pre-Giuliani New York, with porn theater marquees advertising titles like Strip Search and Ace in the Hole (not the Billy Wilder film), and the blend of authentic NYC locations with sets is seamless. All this is rendered even darker by the disquietingly melancholy mood of Hildur Gudnadóttir’s brooding orchestral score, which cranks up into thunderous drama as the chaos escalates. Stitching their original supervillain genesis story neatly into the classic Batman world, Phillips and Silver have prominent moneybags Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) announcing a run for mayor, with a promise to set the fractured city back on the right path. Penny Fleck worked for the Wayne family for many years, but her letters appealing for help, especially as she worries more and more about the stability of her son, have gone unanswered. When Arthur reads one of them, he learns a different history than the one his mother has shared, leading to a pair of uneasy encounters — one with a brusquely dismissive Thomas Wayne at a gala screening of Chaplin’s Modern Times, and a creepily portentous introduction through the iron gates of Wayne Manor to the mayoral candidate’s young son Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), in which an unidentified Alfred (Douglas Hodge) intervenes. The murder of Bruce’s parents sticks to the version depicted in the Christopher Nolan movies and elsewhere, but the Joker’s evolution feels freshly minted, partially driven by a now far more personal resentment of the Wayne family. Given that the world created here is clearly modeled on New York in the not-too-distant past, it will be interesting to see how audiences respond to the alarming depiction of a city under siege. The growing wave of vigilante violence includes a mob assault of two detectives (Shea Whigham and Bill Camp), left in critical condition. And the choice of a trio of cocky young Wall Street jerks as the murder victims that trigger a chain reaction seems a deliberate provocation, especially once tabloid headlines start blaring: “Kill the Rich: A New Movement?” The more graphic violence is confined to just a small handful of key junctures, though it definitely gets visceral and bloody. But the movie’s chief fascination is the tempestuous soup in Arthur’s head, as he steadily disconnects from reality and lurches into an alternate dimension. One example of this is his projection of a relationship with the cool single mom down the hall (Zazie Beetz), whose neighborly elevator chit-chat and eye-rolling acknowledgement of the lunacy gripping Gotham make Arthur believe she’s on his wavelength. What’s so compelling about the title role, both as written and in Phoenix’s full-throttle, raw performance, is that we’re encouraged to feel sympathy for the Joker even as he’s clearly turning into a homicidal maniac. An innocent part of him really does just want to follow his mother’s guidance and make people smile. But the city pulls funding for its welfare programs, forcing him to go off his meds; a video clip of him laughing uncontrollably while doing a spot at a stand-up club gets mocked by his idol Murray on national TV; even his doting mother is perceived to have failed him when he filches her medical records and finds what’s either a disturbing cover-up or fuel for paranoia. The trajectory of innocence to evil is a tragic one. But watching Arthur exult as the crime wave crescendos is a chilling spectacle illustrating what all the ridicule, abuse and marginalization he’s been subjected to have wrought. Phillips is a long way from the Hangover trilogy, working confidently in a more ambitious vein akin to what he did as a producer with Bradley Cooper (who’s also on board here) to reimagine A Star Is Born for contemporary audiences. With editor Jeff Groth, he keeps the pacing steady and satisfying over two hours, fueling the suspense and modulating the peaks and climactic builds with assurance. De Niro appears to get a kick out of playing a smarmy character in a film that references two of his iconic screen roles, making Murray a slick showbiz pro but also a morally questionable figure ready to exploit Arthur’s fragility for good TV. And Beetz demonstrates more of the relaxed appeal that makes her such a winning presence on TV’s Atlanta. (Her crony from the Donald Glover show, Brian Tyree Henry, makes a brief appearance as an asylum records clerk.) But this is Phoenix’s film, and he inhabits it with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that’s no laughing matter. Not to discredit the imaginative vision of the writer-director, his co-scripter and invaluable tech and design teams, but Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," In the wake of the blockbuster success achieved by Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, Hollywood fell in love with a three word phrase: “Dark and Gritty.” Working to determine what it was about the film that made it such a hit, many in the industry concluded that it was the more serious tone and tormented protagonist that audiences loved, and it wound up propagating a new tentpole philosophy. It directly influenced not just the future of DC Comics adaptations, but also titles like Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man and Dean Israelite’s Power Rangers, taking what were once bright and colorful characters, and splashing them with real world cynicism. “Dark and Gritty,” however, was a misreading of what made The Dark Knight special. It’s not that Nolan’s feature was more serious than the typical comic book blockbuster of the time, but rather that it didn’t allow itself to be simply qualified as a “superhero movie.” It helped re-contextualize what a big screen story about a masked vigilante could be. It took all of the classic elements that have been in the source material for decades, and applied a cinematic language in a way that audiences had never seen before – with Michael Mann’s heist hit Heat being a particularly important reference point. The marriage created an entirely new and exhilarating experience. Fortunately, this wasn’t an analysis that was totally lost on the entirety of the filmmaking world, as it too, albeit less broadly, was influential in the following years. While “Dark and Gritty” became buzzword jargon that fueled a number of underwhelming releases, in the decade-plus since The Dark Knight we have also seen phenomenal works like Joe and Anthony Russo’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which borrowed from 1970s conspiracy thrillers like Sydney Pollack's Three Days of the Condor), and James Mangold’s Logan (which targeted the neo-western energy of Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven). These are releases that stand out as not just extensions of their respective brands, but legitimately impressive cinematic achievements. It’s from this same school that we now have Todd Phillips’ Joker – and once again both comic book fans and cinephiles are delivered something exceptional. This time around it’s the world of Batman’s most famous antagonist being matched with the atmospheric intensity of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, and while the approach and subject matter come part and parcel with a natural and profound unpleasantness, they also provides a foundation for a compelling and rattling character study that presents the titular villain in a light unlike anything seen from a past incarnation. Though it trades in ambiguity, with its lead providing an entirely unreliable perspective, and the story regularly asking you to question the presented reality, Joker offers its own take on what an origin story for the Clown Prince Of Crime might be. It’s entirely unconcerned with any pre-existing canon, and posits its own narrative with the introduction of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). His world is a grungy, filthy Gotham City reminiscent of late 1970s/early 1980s New York, he works at a clown-for-hire agency, and lives in a horrific apartment building with his touched, frail mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). Though Arthur has aspirations of becoming a stand-up comedian, he is hampered by a number of mental issues, including an emotional disturbance that causes uncontrollable fits of laughter. He’s a misfit who tries hard, and is regularly beaten down by the world around him, both metaphorically and literally. But he is also a narcissistic personality who fantasizes constantly about the spotlight and gaining the attention of the world – particularly on the stage of his favorite late night show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). When he finds himself at the end of his rope, everything changes through the events of one night, as a violent assault morphs into a triple homicide. It’s a crime that has the unintended consequence of sparking a class warfare powder keg in Gotham, and while nobody has a clue that Arthur is responsible, he quietly revels in the attention. As the city spirals out of control, aspiring mayor and billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) calling for civility as protesters dressed as clowns swarm government buildings, so does Arthur as he tries to define his new identity. It is because the protagonist trajectory in Joker runs entirely contrary to tradition that the movie is so unnerving and disturbing – but, frankly, that just means it’s doing what it’s supposed to do telling a story about this notorious character. We may feel some sympathy for Arthur at the start of this story as he is mugged and beaten on the street, only then to be demeaned by his boss for it, but that compassion disappears as his distorted priorities become more apparent, and his moral code slips further and further out of whack. Movies in general, let alone those adapted from stories about superheroes and supervillains, aren’t typically built with the intention of generating hateful disgust toward their eponymous leads, but the emotional way it’s orchestrated through this narrative is downright impressive, and casts thought-provoking new light on a character we all think we know intimately. The X factor, of course, is Batman – who Joker ultimately reveals as a kind of storytelling safety net. When the Caped Crusader is around there is a part of all of us that can enjoy the chaotic nihilism of the demented clown because we know that there is a hero that will eventually capture him and lock him up in Arkham Asylum. But Todd Phillips’ movie isn’t set during that part of the classic timeline. Thomas Wayne is still alive and well, and Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson) hasn’t even hit double digits yet. There is nobody around that can stop the Joker, and that environment reveals him for what he truly is: a terrifying, horrific nightmare of a human being. It’s a radical interpretation that requires a transformative, thoroughly committed performance, and it’s remarkable to see Joaquin Phoenix take this role and play it as though he were the first actor to ever take it on (and in a way, he is). Arthur is both manic and often inappropriately externalizes his emotions, but Phoenix takes what might have been a turn filled with over-swings, and makes it all feel disturbingly natural. It’s a tightrope walk, as it’s a portrayal that’s always teetering on the edge of going to big, but the actor never ceases to give each moment just the right amount of gas. Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin wouldn’t be the same without Robert De Niro, and this Joker wouldn’t be the same without Joaquin Phoenix. It’s a compelling character reinvention, but Todd Phillips also deserves recognition for his reinvention of the story’s classic setting, with his vision of Gotham standing in sharp relief of the same city portrayed by Christopher Nolan or Tim Burton. Leaning into the Scorsese influences, the movie makes danger feels ever-present on these streets, everyone is on edge and aggressive, and you can practically smell the must that seeps from the asphalt. It’s an unwelcoming and oppressive environment that not just enraptures the audience in its atmosphere, but also lets you understand the madness and depression of the characters that can't escape it. Joker is bound to be the subject of controversy upon its release, but it’s a controversy that it invites by leaving a great deal open for interpretation. Everybody is going to have their own moment where they view Arthur going one step past ""the line."" Everybody is going to have their own take on what’s real, and what’s fantasy. Everybody is going to have their own particular political read. And then all of those opinions are going to flip when the movie is screened a second time. You’ll definitely feel like you’ll need a shower after seeing it, but once you’ve dried off and changed clothes, you’ll want to do nothing else but parse and dissect it.
