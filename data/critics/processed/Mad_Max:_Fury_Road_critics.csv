"Oct 6, 2023"," Mad Max: Fury Road wasn’t the biggest hit film of the summer of 2015 (that honor belongs to Jurassic World) but it is easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of that year. Decades in the making, there’s nothing else like this out there. Directed by George Miller (who made the first three Mad Max movies, most famously The Road Warrior), this installment falls somewhere between the original Mad Max and Thunderdome and stars Tom Hardy as Max, the character originally played by Mel Gibson and reimagined as a loner haunted by the memory of the daughter he failed to save. Fury Road sweeps you up in its stunning stunt work and action set pieces and the sheer momentum of its drive while sneaking in observations on power and patriarchy and control and even sneaking in an unexpected hero: Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. A warrior big rig driver with a prosthetic arm, she flees the despot Immortan Joe with the “property” he most values, his concubines (sex slaves by any other name). Furiosa vows to bring the women (who looks like runway models in desert chic rags) to “the green place,” the promised land of freedom of her youth, while every vehicle in running order takes off in hot pursuit through the badlands of the ruined world. Max, literally dragged into the chase, ends up joining the escape team out of opportunity, reluctantly at first, and then inspired by the passion and hope that drives Furiosa. The first half of the film is a seemingly non-stop chase, though Miller is so adept at conducting the rise and fall of the action that you forget it often stops to cool the engines before revving back up. The second half is a race, with Max and Furiosa taking the fight back to Citadel to offer an alternative to Joe’s warrior religion, designed to keep his soldiers not merely loyal but eager for glory in battle, and a bloodline that has slid to the decidedly deformed and subhuman end of the spectrum. The film is best experienced on the big screen, where its size and scale can be appreciated, so even home viewings should be on as big a screen as possible in a situation that minimizes distractions. You want to give yourself the opportunity to be pulled into the momentum of this film and drawn into the vividly imagined tribal world with its rituals and totems and scavenged cars mixed and matched into weaponized vehicles. Details matter here. You don’t get exposition, you get illustration and then put the puzzle pieces together to understand how this world works. That’s another reason I love this film so much. What appears to be a simple chase film lets you discover an entire culture by the time its over. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux, the boy solder who becomes an unexpected ally, Hugh Keays-Byrne is the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, and Abbey Lee  are the young “brides” who are forged into warriors through the course of their odyssey. It won six Academy Awards, including best editing, production design, and other “technical” awards, and four BAFTA awards, and was picked as the best film of 2015 by the Los Angeles Film Critics, Boston Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, and dozens of other organizations and film critics.

"Aug 3, 2023"," Thirty-six years ago, George Miller’s Mad Max roared into theaters with its own brand of sadistic brutality and blind vengeance while utterly captivating generations of action buffs. Through two additional and increasingly bizarre sequels, Miller and his Mad Max franchise inspired a global following of die-hard fans. Rarely does a sequel capture the magic of its predecessor (The Godfather: Part II is the foremost exception that proves the rule), and a “reboot” doing so is almost entirely unheard of. Mad Max: Fury Road shows no mercy in its destruction of such a concept and countless other filmmaking conventions. Somewhat formulaic in its presentation of Mad Max staples, Miller’s Fury Road utilizes these franchise hallmarks as a means of transporting the audience right back into the post-apocalyptic world it abandoned in 1985. Newsreel footage of nuclear tests behind an introductory narration (similar to Harold Baigent’s in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior) set the tone for a movie placed squarely in the heart of a barren, radioactive hellscape. Max Rocktansky, the iconic hero now portrayed by the capable Tom Hardy, is still on the run from bands of War Boys and the ghosts of his past, consumed by a creeping insanity and a distain for all living things. A pursuit is brought to a close when Max’s trusty Interceptor V8 breathes its last; our hero delivered into the bowels of Immortan Joe’s Citadel (an incredible return for Hugh Keays-Byrne). The narrative leaves Max to his fate in order to follow Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) behind the wheel of her monstrous “war machine” on a run to collect gasoline. Discovering Furiosa has deceived him, Immortan Joe calls upon his war parties to retrieve his stolen property at all costs, and the lucky Max accompanies the marauding hoard as a “blood bag” for the battle-weakened War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). A film divided into several breathtaking acts, Mad Max: Fury Road relentlessly endeavors for “pure action.” Each segment becomes an escalating series of audacious stunts and blood-pumping orchestration on a grand scale. Miller concerns himself not with the trivialities of world building, but with the individual character motivations as they pertain to the story. Strong female characters as essential to the plot, as their male counterparts proliferate and are an appreciated addition to a genre long ignorant of women. Each character has their individual arc (along with a ridiculous full name), and each weaves seamlessly into the overall narrative. Superfluity is washed away to pay homage to the all powerful adrenaline rush. A prior understanding of the three previous Mad Max entries is not required to enjoy the fourth installment, only a love for action splendor, and a desire for more. As outstanding as the direction and script may be, Fury Road‘s monumental vision does not rely on Miller’s talents alone. Striking cinematography from John Seale stresses the bitter extremes of life in Max’s fantastic world, while sun-drenched reds and yellows dominate the daytime palate in dramatic opposition to the cool, vibrant blues that prevail after the sun goes down. Tight, inventive editing from Margaret Sixel and Jason Ballantine capture the immediacy of the endless desert chases without disorientating the audience, and perhaps the most valuable contributions to Miller’s vision are from Junkie XL’s thumping score, matched with some of the most invariably perfect stunts in recent memory. Going so far as to give pieces of the composition a physical presence in the film (a large tympani and flame-spewing electric guitar speaker mobile), the writers are acutely aware of how influential music can be on the audience. Elevating the vehicular carnage from a beautiful motocross circus to a life or death struggle between good and evil, Junkie XL’s score infuses untold alarm into every action set piece. Inconceivable work from Keir Beck (Stunt/Rigging Coordinator), Marius Botha (Stunt Department Coordinator), Guy Norris (Supervising Stunt Coordinator) and Anna Wood (Stunt Department Coordinator) give Fury Road an entrancing realness through action sequences that are above and beyond anything ever before. Miller’s refreshing sense of gender equality contrasts an apocalyptic world in stark opposition by promoting an immensely powerful cinematic and real world message. Surpassing expectations and delivering a heaping dose of electrifying visuals, Mad Max: Fury Road is what all blockbuster action movies should strive to be.

"Apr 19, 2023"," If you've run out of new movies to watch during an evening in lockdown, there's an easy solution. Simply look back at the last decade in movies and pluck out any gems you may have missed (you might surprise yourself). And we can help you with this undertaking -- an assembly of CNET staffers voted on the best movies of the 2010s, a time in cinema that provided big, bright and colorful spectacles, as well as smaller-scale indies that open windows into the lives of others and change us for the better.  We start at the top with a movie that did not win the Best Picture Oscar like many thought it would in 2016. But listen, George Miller's fourth in the Mad Max series careens on as one of the best action movies of all time. Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson as the enigmatic Max, alongside the clear standout and heart of the film: Charlize Theron as the one-armed Imperator Furiosa. In Miller's visionary post-apocalyptic Oz, they attempt to save ""the wives,"" women selected for breeding, from the tyrannical Immortan Joe. The entire movie takes place over one absolutely bonkers chase sequence. Its cinematic stats are jaw-dropping: Miller used 3,500 storyboards and took 480 hours of raw footage. He overcame a decade of roadblocks -- recasting, location changes and creative resets (he explored the possibility of a 3D live-action version) -- before achieving high-octane imaginative insanity.  There was no question what movie would win the Best Animated Feature category at the 2018 Oscars. Into the Spider-Verse stole our hearts by boldly ignoring the fact we've had three cinematic Peter Parkers and introducing five more. They stem from 
  Marvel's
 multiverse, wisely made less complicated by producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who focus on the Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) graffiti artist, hip hop-appreciating version of Spidey. Morales teams up with the versions from other universes -- including a bizarre and completely hilarious cartoon pig known as Peter Porker -- to fight supervillain Kingpin. Over 140 animators combined computer animation with a hand-drawn style to mimic a comic book look. Inventive visuals, fresh storytelling and embracing the comic books' wackiness helped make the first non-white Spider-Man one of the best.  Boyhood is, logistically speaking, a bit of a miracle. In order to tell a story about growing up, Richard Linklater sporadically filmed a young Ellar Coltrane every year for 12 years, from ages 6 to 18. His character, Mason, lived between his divorced parents (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) in Texas. The project flirted with potential film-ending pitfalls: For one, what if a teenage Coltrane strayed from acting? But Linklater delivered his best ever film. It won BAFTAs, Golden Globes and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Arquette in 2014. Yet some still feel a little salty about Boyhood's award season. Boyhood lost the Best Picture Oscar to Birdman, a less warm, familiarly wholesome tale, more a technical and existential tour de force. On this occasion, the people have spoken.  Get Out is the modern horror movie. It's the perfect coming together of horror, comedy and satire on racism. The setup to the punch line -- or in horror's case, the jump scare -- takes exact timing. As one half of comedy duo Key & Peele, Jordan Peele is extremely well-equipped to achieve both. His directorial debut has a scarily loaded setup: a young black man (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's (Alison Williams) middle-class liberal parents. Their comments about how fine they are with their daughter's boyfriend are comedy gold... with a delayed squirm. Peele's exciting new voice brought horror, laughs and deeply unsettling self-reflection.  On paper, Lady Bird reads like a conventional coming-of-age story. It covers the usual milestones: losing virginity, going to prom, graduation. But in between those lines is a raw, specific relationship between 17-year-old Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), who insists everyone calls her Lady Bird, and her hard working and barely appreciated mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf). First-time solo director Greta Gerwig writes a love letter to her hometown, Sacramento, infusing it with brilliantly layered comedy. ""I wish I could live through something,"" Lady Bird says with the narcissism of a 17-year-old. She's self-titled, as in, she says Lady Bird is the name ""given to me by me."" The warmth, hilarity and at times confronting revelations of teenagehood flood through Gerwig's singular lens.  Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone bring the kind of acting calibre you expect to this Yorgos Lanthimos misadventure. The Greek director well and truly established his distinctive weird, experimental style with The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. He loves to cross a line and does so multiple times in The Favourite, a period piece turned cat-and-mouse psychological thriller featuring characters named Wanking Man and Nude Pomegranate Tory. Underneath the politics and the corsets, you'll even find a melancholy love story.  Watching Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is almost like flipping through a beautifully-shot album of 1970s Mexico. Cuaron tells a semi-autobiographical story about a middle class family through the lens of a young housekeeper. It's a story about people living, brought to life by Cuaron's deft magic.  Marvel movies proved they could keep on evolving with Ryan Coogler's Black Panther. The 2018 film bucked the superhero formula with its Afro-futurist setting, family saga and James Bond gadgetry. The bold claws of an auteur are all over this comic book blockbuster.  The walls meticulously close in on the programmer, his boss and the iRobot they interact with in Alex Garland's Ex Machina. The tense, thoughtful sci-fi set in a remote cutting-edge cabin raises big questions and upgraded Alicia Vikander to even greater star status.  The Master was not the deep-dive into Scientology's origins many might have expected. Paul Thomas Anderson sews together the fictional life of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), leader of a religious movement known as ""The Cause,"" and his tension with the yin to his yang, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). The 2012 character drama, dealing with a world recovering from World War II, is a poetic epic.  Spike Jonze's 2013 romance between a lonely man and his Siri-like AI is even more frighteningly relevant today. Samantha (Scarlet Johansson) is the soothing, intimate voice in Theodore Twombly's (Joaquin Phoenix) ear, but the bounds of her programming soon go beyond sprucely organizing his life. Jonze's future is both vividly-realized and always rooted in the complexities of the human heart.  Barry Jenkins' three-part story about a physically and emotionally abused black man has been described as genre-defying. From childhood to adulthood, three actors (Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders and Alex Hibbert) play Chiron with soulful naturalness. In covering difficult subject matter, from the drug underworld to sexual identity, Moonlight runs deep. The 2016 Best Picture Oscar winner is gorgeous to look at and accompanied by an exquisite soundtrack.  David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin friended each other to make a powerfully nerdy, talky movie about 
  Mark Zuckerberg
 and the inception of 
  Facebook
. Equally absorbing are its themes of friendship and loyalty in a playground of petty politics. A superb Jesse Eisenberg as the insensitive, conflicted genius was a revelatory match for Fincher's technical talent.  Ryan Gosling's strong, silent Hollywood stunt driver moonlights as a getaway driver. So Drive is basically the coolest movie ever. Its dreamlike, electronic soundtrack -- perfect for travel at night -- layers meaningful messages into a violent fairy tale about an unconventional hero.  Guillermo del Toro's 2017 Best Picture Oscar winner is a more than unconventional horror-romance between a mute woman and a dead-eyed fish-man. It balances a harsh 1960s setting with fairy tale magic painted into its big, beautifully-detailed sets. Only del Toro could pull this madness off.  The sheer size of this blockbuster, with its sky-high budget, A-listers and ravenous fandom, make Anthony and Joe Russo's film all the more impressive. To culminate 20 Marvel films in a two-part showstopper is experimental madness on its own. But to end (spoiler) the first of those parts with almost all your heroes losing... who says all superhero films are predictable?  This is Christopher Nolan's insane, original concept: a professional thief, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, steals information by infiltrating the subconscious. Sorry, Mr. Nolan, how are you going to do this? The answer is incredibly engrossingly. Somehow Nolan made a film about dreams both substantial and visceral, with a thrilling dose of physics-defying action.  Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) uses one mind-boggling continuous shot to literally follow a deluded movie star in the lead up to his latest role on a Broadway show. As you can imagine, sanity, narcissism and basically everything to do with the human condition bleeds through this showbiz satire. The 2014 Best Picture Oscar winner was a creative tour de force for Alejandro González Iñárritu and some comeback for Michael Keaton.  Spotlight shines a light on the real-life investigative team of journalists called ""Spotlight"" from the Boston Globe. In the early 2000s, they helped expose the child abuse committed by Catholic priests in the Boston area. The 2015 Best Picture Oscar winner wound gripping tension into the unglamorous legwork of journalists, played by a perfectly-balanced ensemble including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams.  The third in Pixar's Toy Story series seemingly wrapped up the stories of Woody, Buzz and their owner, Andy, in the most poignant, heartbreaking way possible -- until a fourth film followed 10 years later. Still, Toy Story 3 stands as the example of how to blend family wholesomeness with plaything torture horror. One of the best kids movies for grownups out there.  When your grandma dies, cult-related ordeal after ordeal doesn't tend to ensue. But in Hereditary, it does! That's not to mention the slowly sickening insecurity Annie Graham (a better than ever Toni Collette) feels in her relationship with her children. Ari Aster's directorial debut constructs its shock-horror moments with the delicate hand of someone building a miniature house. He treats his characters with the same attention to detail, and when it all comes crashing, the impact is traumatic. One of the horror genre's greats.  A mockumentary about idiotic vampires who share a flat in Wellington, New Zealand, is the kind of content we came to expect from director-writer-actor Taika Waititi. After delivering the best ever vampire comedy as well as the brilliant Hunt for the Wilderpeople, he was ingeniously snapped up by Marvel to direct Thor: Ragnarok.  Steve McQueen doesn't let up in telling the incredible, brutal true story of Solomon Northup, a gifted violinist who had the rug pulled out from under him when he was sold into slavery. His 12 years of hardship is detailed here in a story that delves into the darkest recesses of Louisiana in the 1840s. More than just a prestige, period film, it's a difficult but necessary viewing experience.  What is essentially a thriller about jazz introduced the world to the rare talents of Damien Chazelle, who would go on to make La La Land and First Man. Whiplash pit Andrew (Miles Teller), an ambitious drumming student, against the abusive Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). This tense, exhaustive journey into the perils of percussion deserves a standing ovation.  Alex Garland's followup to Ex Machina takes us into a mysterious, body horror-inducing quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals. With five female leads including Natalie Portman, this intelligent story featuring a bear scene as memorable as The Revenant's is unique in more ways than one.  Based on André Aciman's novel, this deeply affecting romance between 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer) is, unsurprisingly, beautiful to look at. From the 1980s idyllic Italian countryside to the slow-burn romance, Luca Guadagnino directs a mesmerizingly dreamy summer experience.  Robert Eggers' directorial debut is an exercise in restraint. That's his most terrifying asset and it pays off when the religious family at the heart of The Witch descends into madness. In 1630s New England, a bleak, far-back world where you deserve an award for understanding the accents, supernatural horrors brew to terrifying ends. You'll never look at the outskirts of a wood in the same way.  The movie before Taika Waititi took on Thor: Ragnarok follows the oddball mismatch of troublesome Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) and the grizzled Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). Through a series of sad, absurd and touching events, they find themselves the subjects of a national manhunt. The balance between humanity and comedy is what Taika Waititi does best.  J.J. Abrams relaunched one of the biggest franchises of all time by affectionately pairing familiar parts with fresh new faces and even cuter helpful droids. Starring Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, this welcome shot of fun space adventure took us back into the operatic war between dark versus light.  A turning point in the DC Extended Universe came when Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman climbed out of the trenches. The World War I-set origin story introduced the world to Gal Gadot in a role she was born to play. Her shining beacon of hope fills this earnest, good old-fashioned tale of heroine versus Greek god of war. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 23, 2023"," Many on-set, behind the scenes videos alternate extremely mundane footage of the business of getting coverage with actors rotely reciting how amazing and wonderful everybody involved in this production is. Not so this casually intense assemblage of work on Mad Max: Fury Road, which begins with a car flipping over. What follows is not quite as routinely life-threatening, but it’s still incredibly physical filmmaking. $150 million, it seems, will buy you the budget to stand in the desert, sling a camera around on a very flexible boom, and have some guys swing around on poles.",POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2022"," Has it really been 30 years since Mel Gibson last drove across George Miller’s dystopian desert wasteland in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”? My how time flies. Between 1979 and 1985 visionary filmmaker Miller gave us three films: the intriguing but lethargic “Mad Max”, the fabulous cult classic “The Road Warrior”, and the fun but commercial “Beyond Thunderdome”. While the second film was the real standout, I have always had a natural soft spot for the entire franchise. So of course I would be enthusiastic when it was announced that a fourth installment was finally seeing the light of day. For years Miller has toyed with the idea of bringing Max back to the big screen but there were always obstacles that hindered him. Mel Gibson was set to reprise his role and at several points the project seemed good to go. Several years have passed, Tom Hardy replaces the aged Gibson, and “Fury Road” is a reality. What’s truly amazing is that this is the wildest, craziest, and most visually arresting installment yet and all from the mind of its now 70-year old creator. The first three films had a combined budget of less than $20 million. For “Fury Road” Miller was given $150 million and you will instantly see the benefits. The visuals are an essential component to this film. This is an unapologetic, full-throttle thrill ride, and a textbook lesson on how to make an action movie. Make no mistake, the action in “Fury Road”  is intense and relentless. The vehicular carnage is unlike anything most people have seen before. The story is a bit lightweight and clearly intended to serve the plot’s madness. This all may be enough to scare away some people. For me, it was the film’s unflinching, fuel-injected focus that made it the best movie experience I’ve had this year so far. The film opens with a gruff Hardy saying “My name is Max. My world is fire and blood”. His world is an energy-starved, post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where he is haunted by his past and driven only by survival. Within the first few minutes, the nomadic Max is captured by the army of a savage and wickedly grotesque tyrant named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Max’s capture leads him to cross paths with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who attempts to smuggle Joe’s five enslaved childbearing wives to safety. This invokes the wrath of the maniacal leader who brings his entire army after them. And guess what, Max is caught right in the middle. I can’t think of a more fitting actor to take on the role of Mad Max than Tom Hardy. His dialogue is sparse and he mainly tells his story through grunts, expressions, and outright physicality. And he does it all to sheer perfection. It’s a very unorthodox role. He’s not asked to say much and he spends a good third of the movie with his face partially obscured by a metal contraption. But he masterfully sells us this tough, surly, and untrusting Max character. But the real surprise was watching Charlize Theron match his toughness punch for punch and bullet for bullet. She is so good here. But of course the true star and the main attraction is George Miller and his insanely energetic action and presentation. “Fury Road” is a visual delight – a movie filled with “wow” moments, unbelievable stunts, and mind-blowing vehicle action sequences. Miller shoots his action with a chaotic precision and cinematic fluidity. Many modern action directors should take notes. But equally impressive are the stunning amount of practical effects used. When mixed with the top-notch CGI, it makes this one amazing looking film. And going along with the stellar visuals is Junkie XL’s vibrant and invigorating score. Some of us had given up on Mad Max ever returning to the big screen. After 30 years it was a reasonable conclusion. But after seeing “Fury Road” I can boldly say it was worth the wait. George Miller has given us an installment that stands right there with (and probably an inch or two above) his phenomenal “The Road Warrior”. This is pure action cinema – a beautiful mixture of old-school style and modern movie technology. And after this taste of Miller’s vision, I can only hope he has more Mad Max movies plan for the future. My favorite film of the year so far. This is how an action film ought to work. I am not disappointed in Hardy, I just don’t think he jumps off the screen the way Mel did, and as the character is almost a secondary foil in the conflict here. that made Max less the focus than I thought  he would be. The sequences and visualizations are terrific. I know Hollywood is ageist (at least against anyone not named Marty or Clint) but this shows why visionaries are more important than fresh faces. Sometimes you have to invent a world and inhabit it to be able to get it right. My favorite too. I left on such a high. Good straightforward story that sets up some of the coolest action sequences I have seen in a while. I really liked Hardy but I do get what you’re saying about him. Also loved this and gave it the same score. To be honest I think I might head to the cinema again to watch this one….amazing experience. Great work here Keith! I am so amped to see this and your review gets me even more excited. Lots of good reviews. I hope it doesn’t disappoint! I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected to. It’s exciting and extremely rare to see a big budget summer blockbuster with such a personal vision (and executed so well) brought the big screen. Definitely my favorite of the year so far. Same here! Honestly, I expected to like it a lot but I didn’t expect to love it the way I did. This was good, crazy fun. I left the theater on such a high. Excellent review! It goes without saying that action cinema this singular in scale and scope is rare, and Miller’s conviction in bringing this fourth installment of his brainchild to life has yielded quite the exceptional result. Thanks so much. I agree with you. There is a lot of conviction behind Miller and his vision for this film. And man what a ride. I went and saw it today.  Absolutely nuts.  I loved every minute of it.  It’s probably my favorite action movie of the year.  I certainly think it’s better than Ultron in every single way.  It’s a shame they don’t make movies like this very often, and certainly not the way that George Miller does it.  But I will be seeing it again, that’s for sure.  The soundtrack is amazing too.  With Tom Hardy signed on for three more movies, I can’t wait to see where they go from here. Yes!!!! So fun. I think Miller is such a visionary and his eye for action is superb. This thing was crazy and I loved how he never dialed back the madness. Can’t wait to watch it again. Oh, I’m definitely going to see it again as well.  I also loved the fact that they didn’t use the shaky-cam technique unless it was inside the vehicles.  As far as action movies go, Mad Max: Fury Road has set the bar very high this year.  I don’t see anything else that’s going to top it in terms of sheer adrenaline. You bring up a great point that I meant to mention in the review. The lack of the annoying shaky-cam was so refreshing. I get annoyed at the technique. So many directors should take note. Unashamed relentless action and I are it up!!! There is such a wild style on display and I just couldn’t get enough. Bravo George Miller! never ending action in this movie. really u can get tired while watching but i didnt see very well our max u know. Mel Gibson is better crazy, i think he’s in life crazy. Tom Hardy is just silent cool guy. I love that! I was so proud the Academy recognized the movie the way it did. There was a time when it would have never gotten the consideration it deserved.  I have to say it’s now one of my favorite movies.  So much to love about it.  The details are meticulous and inventive.  The “kid” who decides to help them is one of my favorite characters.  Can’t remember his name.",POSITIVE
"Jun 21, 2022"," A marvelous degree of craziness and discipline was required to make Mad Max: Fury Road, Australian director George Miller’s reimagining of, or perhaps a belated sequel to, his original Ozploitation trilogy. Three decades after taking down Blaster in Thunderdome, Mad Max returns for the fourth, most inventive and bombastic entry in this series of post-apocalyptic vehicle wars, a completely bonkers and titillating piece of entertainment that has no recent equal. Indeed, the Fast and Furious series looks populated by slogging pacifists in comparison. Tom Hardy now occupies Mel Gibson’s well-worn leather duds as the titular Max Rockatansky, a former cop turned reluctant road warrior on Miller’s unforgiving, barren, but beautifully conceived highways of carnage. This desolate world comes fuelled by adrenaline, soiled with gruesome ultra-violence, and propelled by unbelievably outrageous high-speed chases, unlike anything you’ve ever seen. After defining the post-apocalyptic subgenre in 1979 with the original Mad Max, and its two sequels, Miller, now in his seventies, shows no signs of slowing based on this decadent display of practical effects, impressive pyrotechnics, and exhilarating showmanship. In recent years, Miller’s name has been associated with more child-friendly material, such as Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet (2006), Happy Feet Two (2011), and some development on Warner Bros.’ abandoned 2008 production of a “Justice League” superhero film. But in the years after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Miller fed rumors of another Mad Max sequel. News of countless setbacks, false starts, delays, budgetary quarrels, and casting rumors have filled Hollywood insider trades for more than a decade—going back to when Gibson was still set to reprise the role that made him a star. As time went on and Gibson got older, as early as 2009, Miller recast the role with Hardy, hired Charlize Theron as Hardy’s costar, and began scouting locations. Filming didn’t begin until 2012, and lasted upwards of 120 days in Namibia, plus reshoots the following year, with a reported budget of $150 million, a far deal greater than the paltry budgets used to make the original three. And despite Fury Road looking and feeling more expensive, more over-the-top, and more kick-ass than its predecessors, it still feels like a part of the same universe Miller created all those years ago. To be sure, Mad Max: Fury Road is a far more complex experience visually than the rather trim Mad Max, yet its narrative heft feels more grandiose and adult than the family-friendly outing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Unavoidably and quite complementarily, the film earns its close association to the second and best in the series, The Road Warrior (1981), which, like this latest entry, occupies its runtime with what amounts to a single, film-long chase sequence. However conceptually simple Fury Road’s actionized chase scenario may seem on the surface, Miller and his cowriters (Nico Lathouris and comic author Brendan McCarthy) layer the material with heavy themes of redemption, revolution, and buried memories. Each of Miller’s Mad Max films have had their own unique pitch and themes: the first concerned tragedy and revenge, the stripping-down of Max’s humanity; the second displayed a glimmer of hope in our anti-hero within his otherwise thankless world; and the third found him regaining his human sympathy by rescuing a group of children. Mad Max: Fury Road finds the anti-hero more animal-like, a mad dog survivor realized by Hardy with paranoid eyes and convulsive jolts into his tragic past. “My world is reduced to a single instinct: survive,” he says in the opening narration, which recalls a more personalized version of the prologue in The Road Warrior. Max moves with a kinetic ferocity, almost on autopilot, especially early on when Hardy’s considerable physical presence is enhanced by Miller running the film speed at a higher rate, as if Max has been electrified. During the fracas, Max, who remains nameless for much of the picture, receives flashes from his past, and images of his daughter’s death haunt him at key moments. He seems to have buried these images so deep that he no longer understands their meaning, to the extent that he even looks confused by their appearance in his mind. “As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me, or everyone else,” he observes. Only as the story progresses, and Max finds someone to fight alongside, do those images become clearer. Although, refreshingly, Miller never explains their origin through clumsy expositional dialogue or a flashback; Max’s understanding comes by way of a calmer, more gathered expression behind Hardy’s piercing blue eyes. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. In the distant post-apocalypse of Miller’s vision, human beings are the new precious commodity. Forget fuel and ammunition; Gas Town and the Bullet Farm have that covered. Only sand-swept roads and dunes flourish in the Wasteland, leaving humans with no chance unless they suffer under the Citadel—a pair of buttes standing alone in the desert, inhabited by the cultish ruler on high, the fearsome Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the marauding Toecutter, presumably no relation, in the original Mad Max). His body serves as a metaphor for the entire landscape, scorched and harsh, patched together by body plates, pieces of old hardware, breathing tubes, and a toothy mask. What a horrific kingdom he has made, where he controls his slaves by regulating the water supply, and where his beautiful wives are branded as property and locked in a vault. Elsewhere in the Citadel, he keeps rotund mothers strapped to pumps to deliver valuable breastmilk for trade, and their human babies, his sires, provide the capital for an army of devoted subjects. Should an unlucky Wasteland survivor find himself captured by the ruler’s personal army of War Boys, he’d be tattooed with his blood type and organ status, and hanged upside-down as a human blood bag for Immortan Joe’s weak or dying devotees. One such “blood bag” is Max himself, interned in the first scene and hung to fuel Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Immortan Joe’s shaved, branded, white-painted, and skeleton-faced fanatical soldiers. Following his leader’s abstract religion, Nux has been promised glory and another life in Valhalla should he faithfully serve Immortan Joe (and spray his mouth silver before the moment of death). Enter the noblewoman-badass Imperator Furiosa (Theron), who’s entrusted to drive a War Rig on a fuel run, but instead detours with Immortan Joe’s escaped wives to liberate them from captivity. Miller’s flair for wild names carries on with the wives: Splendid, Capable, Cheedo the Fragile, and Toast the Knowing. These wives look like a gaggle of super-models and first appear in a wet fantasy scene. However, they’re gradually empowered throughout the chase. In response, Nux straps a metal-masked Max onto the front grille of his car and, along with a small army of souped-up vehicles, pursues glory to recoup Immortan Joe’s “property”. For the next two hours, the ensuing chase sequence, driven by Miller’s breakneck pace, offers only a few fleeting seconds of reprieve from the mayhem. And oh, what mayhem—what glorious, delightfully orchestrated mayhem. Supposedly, ninety percent of the effects and stunts were achieved without CGI, and based on the result, it looks to be true. A staggering level of pyrotechnics and car wrecks appear to have been achieved with practical effects and stuntmen, something of a rarity in today’s market of computer-generated aerobatics in Fast and Furious. Ever the tactile tactician, Miller captures every angle imaginable and at varying film speeds thanks to the feverish work of cinematographer John Seale, whose frame vibrates with the speed of his car-mounted cameras. Still, never is there a moment where the clarity of the situation or shot-by-shot logic is questioned; rather, the impossibly fast-paced momentum proceeds with a shocking and almost unheard-of degree of precision, all of it given an incredible dose of aural energy thanks to Dutch musician Junkie XL’s score. Throughout, Miller’s editor and wife, Margaret Sixelour, allows us to briefly appreciate Colin Gibson’s intricate production design and Jenny Beavan’s imaginative costumes. With every new shot, there are more details to savor that require repeated viewings to fully appreciate: the slave ship whose sole purpose is to provide the chase with drums and riffing from a heavy metal, flame-spewing guitar; the pole-riding daredevils who swing from one vehicle to another, performed by members of Cirque du Soleil; the grotesque growths, piercings, and body markings displayed by post-apocalyptical mutants; and the believable robotic forearm attached to Furiosa. In fact, Furiosa may just steal the film from under Max’s nose after their characters meet and join forces on the road. A ferocious driver and brutal fighter, Furiosa represents a rare thing in the Mad Max franchise: a strong female character. She doesn’t trust Max at first, having experienced first-hand the savagery of men in the post-apocalypse. Theron’s troubled, glassy eyes contain all the emotional charge needed in this vicious film, and they remind us of Renee Falconetti’s sorrowful expressions in The Passion of Joan of Ark (1928). Her quest to transport the child-bearing female captors to salvation is immediately empathetic, while Max’s hardened exterior seems as pitiless as the world he inhabits. Hardy, meanwhile, is perfect in his role; it’s impossible to imagine another modern actor recreating Mad Max so effectively. He’s capable of rendering both Max’s animalistic and nobler scenes with careful calibration of his face. “You know hope is a mistake,” he tells Furiosa in one of their few audible exchanges. Dialogue is a luxury in a film like this, and Miller has said he intended the film to be such a visual experience that it could play in foreign countries without subtitles. Fortunately, actors of Hardy and Theron’s caliber need only brief glances to communicate a wealth of understanding between the two characters during the film’s never-ending pursuit.",POSITIVE

"Feb 11, 2022"," In fact, there hasn’t been a movie to come along like this in quite some time. The fourth post-apocalyptic Max Rockatansky film from multi-talented director George Miller, “Mad Max: Fury Road” showcases a level of craft and kinetic energy that feels transported from a simpler time in blockbuster filmmaking. Instead of installing a franchise building block, introducing 500 plot lines for future films or encumbering the pace with heavy exposition, “Fury Road” charges right at you from the start and refuses to let up. It’s a relentless adventure saddled with enough original action and gripping chase sequences to wrap around as many dystopian deserts you can find. Miller last forayed into the action genre with his third Max film, 1985’s “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” so this is the first time the auteur has had the visual treasure chest of the 21st century with which to work. Having spent plenty of time with practical effects in his heyday, Miller fuses the rust and dust of personally-crafted sets and effects with the otherworldly possibilities of computer generated visuals to create some of the more striking sequences put on screen in a while. He also helped write the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. “Fury Road” takes a page from Screenwriting 101 and lets the movie do the talking, not the characters. Instead of a 15-minute introduction into how this apocalyptic world became to be, the film jumps right into Max’s now. A loner bothered by a dark past, Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by an army of pale soldiers and is taken to the Citadel, a refuge for survivors governed by King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). The impressively-designed Joe is a hulking creation, complete with beaming red-and-yellow eyes, pro-wrestler’s hair and physique and a mask that looks like a cross between Bane’s from “The Dark Knight Rises” and the intimidation art that goes on the headgear of a hockey goalie. Max’s capture eventually crosses over into a plot to save Joe’s many “wives” from bondage – an effort led by government high-up Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Hauling a large tanker across an unforgiving desert on the infamous Fury Road, Furiosa botches a gas trip and breaks for freedom with her passengers. But, Joes’ army – an assortment of his brainwashed followers driving terrifying mix-and-match Hot Wheels – isn’t too far behind. So, with Max placed as a hood ornament on one of the soldier’s (the eager Nux, played by Nicolas Hoult) cars , the race begins, leading into two hours of dusty-pedal-to-the-rusty-metal insanity. The chase scenes in the film are one-of-a-kind – special scenes that haven’t been done before and likely won’t be replicated in the future. Miller keeps them snapping along with great precision, mixing in thrill after thrill and close call after close call. The real-and-unreal effects and soaring stunt work help make the zooming chases, at times, feel almost iconic. Junkie XL adds in an operatic score that backs the action in a way that feels legitimately epic. One sequence in particular – a chase through a Technicolor sandstorm of tornados, lighting and blinding gusts – has to be seen on the biggest screens possible (as does the rest of this movie, for that matter). It’s a scene of premiere VFX work and perhaps the most impressive visual scene to ever hit a movie screen in years. John Seale’s gorgeous cinematography gets a bulk of the credit for the film’s visual presentation. Seale plays around with the color scheme in certain situations to great effect and brings forth a sharp presentation for the entire film. Hardy and Theron make for solid leads, with the physically-demanding role requirements met by each with ease. As the film progresses, both Max and Furiosa begin to develop a silent friendship, which must become possible through various glances in strenuous situations. Both actors do a splendid job of being able to get affection across in the midst of all the chaos. Hoult also makes a solid mark as the spiny Nux. With “Mad Max: Fury Road,” Miller is able to make a nearly-flawless popcorn film with ingredients that most studios would shy away from. This is weird, lived-in material that puts a great deal of trust in its audience to read between the lines into how the mechanics of this world work. The payments are as rich as they are rewarding. No other studio film this year will feature a guitar-playing battle musician with flames shooting out of the instrument’s head, a baby-man with a beard and a two-headed lizard that slithers across the barren dirt. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is a slobbernocking achievement that also happens to be a singular experience, best seen on the most gargantuan screen possible with friends, soda, candy and a jaw that can be dropped at will.",POSITIVE
"Oct 9, 2021"," It’s been over thirty years since the last film in the Mad Max series, and man, did it come back in a big way. There is no other way to describe Mad Max: Fury Road as anything other than over-the-top high-octane fun. If you can watch it in IMAX 3D, if you can watch it in a Dolby Atmos theater, do it. Fury Road is every inch the combination of post-apocalyptic exaggeration mixed with some hilarious insights into human nature. If there was ever a film detailing the often foolish choices of man, it’s Fury Road. The story is a simple one, but while that might inhibit most films, for something as boisterously loud and active as Fury Road it only serves as the frame to the sensory overload. [Warner Bros.]Sustained on nothing more than revenge, redemption, and gasoline, Fury Road brings Tom Hardy’s Mad Max and Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa together as two avenging angels in a world that has thrown morals and human dignity into the wind. For a film that includes a consistent heavy metal guitarist on a jury rigged mountain of speakers that drives around as the hilarious but totally unnecessary mood music, Fury Road manages to still deliver a punch through the storytelling that stands somewhere between environmental political commentary and straight up hard-lined feminism. But, trust me, almost all of that takes a back seat to the absolutely breathtaking visual palette of Fury Road. Splashed in tones of yellow, orange, and red, and later deep midnight blue, it’s a gorgeous piece of art. From the yellow-gold sandstorms that swallow the outback to the neon flares that explode like fireworks in the sky, it is unforgiving in painting the world with explosive color. [Warner Bros.]If the visuals don’t keep you on the edge of your seat then the roar of the engines sure will, not to mention that killer soundtrack. Visual effects dominate your eyes while the sound of roaring engines, firing bullets, and pounding drums will fill your ears. There are no pulled punches here, and it works out perfectly. You’ll be cheering and howling with Furiosa and Max in no time, there is no other alternative. Final Thoughts: The definition of a wholly unapologetically action-packed film, Mad Max: Fury Road breathes new life into an old series and throws you right back into a world that is hyperbolic and addictive all at once.",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2021"," In an era where nearly all action movies are filmed entirely on green screens and edited into incoherence with a cast of poorly written characters, Mad Max: Fury Road is a strong, defiant blast. Fury Road hits the gas early and never lets up. Miller seems to have conceived this whole crazy thing, looked at how it could have been done easily, then threw away that idea for something even more jaw-dropping. There's an element of danger that makes you feel like everyone was put at risk for the sake of a stunt. Shooting in the unforgiving Namib Desert instead of a comfortable studio, there's a grittiness that simply can't be faked. And like last year's John Wick, there's an elegance to all the face-punching and gunfire. Some of Fury Road's spectacle is a little too much (we didn't need a musician riding atop a truck with flames shooting out of his guitar). But I'm glad Miller went for it. Too many blockbusters play it safe, not trusting their audience to accept the outrageous or the thought-provoking. He even finds time for some gallows humor and religious satire. The summer has just begun, but it's hard to see another movie equalling this one's grand ambition, deep ideas and awe-inspiring action. Believe the hype.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2021","In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters?... [Also] how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2021"," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos. Go see what it looks like when we’re driving the smoking tractor-trailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free.

Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result.",POSITIVE

Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos.

Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2021"," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either.

I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2021"," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos. Go see what it looks like when we’re driving the smoking tractor-trailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free. Gabrielle Rivera is an awesomely queer Bronx bred, writer, spoken word artist and director.
Her short stories and poems have been published in various anthologies such as the Lambda Award winning Portland Queer: Tales from the Rose City and The Best of Panic! En Vivo from the East Village.
Her short film ""Spanish Girls are Beautiful"" follows a group of young Latina and Caucasian girls who like girls as they hook up, smoke up and try to figure sh*t out.
She also freelances for Autostraddle.com while working in the film and television industry.
Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2021"," EnlargePeter OpaskarArs Technica turns 21 at the end of this year, but film coverage on site can't exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet. Quietly, we've been reviewing movies on the Internet for 11 years now—a baker's dozen years if reviews of 3D experiences count—starting with this Max Payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism. But beginning in 2014, we made film a regular topic on site. And these days we annually bounce from SXSW to Fantastic Fest with plenty of regional film events in between. Now, this ain't Variety, and we do not write about everything (though we have covered Beauty and The Beast and The Jungle Book somehow). But Ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section. We failed at Vulcan salutes with Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds. We caught the premiere of a Academy Award-nominated movie at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Somehow, we even helped save a Star Wars-adjacent movie from obscurity (earning an IMDb credit and inspiring a full-length remake in the process).

So with the end of the decade rapidly approaching, we felt it was OK to indulge our film list-making impulses. This is not necessarily a Best Films of the decade list—undeniably great things like Lady Bird, Moonlight, The Master, Bridesmaids, et al. are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science, technology, and genre fare. It is not a list of the Most Important films, either, as this decade of streaming's rise, female directors taking the reins, continued globalization of cinema, and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinema-centric press. But the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the Orbital HQ years later, and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward. It's probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry, audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema, too. It turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama (though we all underrated First Man, folks). If you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may have been the in-theater experience of the decade. The vastness of space has never been more vivid, even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists. The Matt Damon-led The Martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting, continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science. No one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016, but Arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense, gripping sci-fi story. And Hidden Figures puts the familiar period-piece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate. Add any number of other fine space movies to this lot—Interstellar, Ad Astra, etc.—but this quartet revived a cinematic subset Ars will always have a fondness for. The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes. By no means did it start here (the Nolan Batman trilogy began in the 2000s, as did the MCU with Iron Man in 2008), but it became an expanded universe, cinematic event these last 10 years. The first Avengers hit in 2012, and box offices haven't looked back since. Picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible. Your preferences of memorable Spider-Man (Into the Spider-Verse), Iron-Man (Iron Man 2), Captain America (Winter Soldier), or other regulation superhero flicks (Ragnarok ever-so-slightly over the original Deadpool?) may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward. The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular (Avengers: End Game over the original Guardians by a hair). But the caped crusades we'll remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree. Black Panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity. Logan took a hero long familiar to film-goers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a Western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process. And while Wonder Woman may be the most straightforward super-hero-y of the three, it showed a female-led comic book conquest was worth doing, especially when it leveraged well-executed period-piece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry. For the future of the then-beleaguered DC Comics entertainment arm, Wonder Woman also proved everything didn't have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience (all the fun being had in HBO's Watchmen seems to indicate DC took the hint). And, OK, it's not a traditional superhero movie, but we couldn't make an of-the-decade film list and exclude Mad Max: Fury Road entirely. Like more traditional caped-crusader flicks, this is an existing IP with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original. It starts with a very super villain-y evil plot (our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the bad-team War Boys; another hero has to help a group of women known as the Five Wives escape forced procreations). The film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character. Finally, perhaps most like the trio above, this newest Mad Max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar post-apocalyptic world. Max Rockatansky may be back (invigorated by Tom Hardy), but the star of the show is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the post-apocalyptic female hero sci-fi action fans deserve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2021"," It almost goes without saying, and yet we should say it more often, that being a cinephile is a bit of an ironic designation. Anyone who loves cinema (or even television, which is just as cinematic) is a cinephile! That being said, there are still plenty of films whose names are thrown around under illustrious categories such as 'canon' and 'classic'. We're going to take a look at films within and beyond these, to create the beginnings of our very own, alternate canon: Clout Films. This is not to say, in any way, that these aren't fantastic films. What separates them from other fantastic films is that, today, they have – or should have – just as much clout as anything from your usual canon– your Gone With The Winds,  Sunset Boulevards, and Citizen Kanes. A lot of these films have also been included in alternate canons but are far too often expected to just stay there. The ultimate triviality of this 'clout' is what makes it so potent in influencing conversations about film, and what calls us to redefine it.  A moving, gentle film that any fan of cinema or filmmaker will surely fall in love with. The film is a documentary, directed by Singapore born filmmaker Sandi Tan, about an independent film she made when she was just 19. The less you know about this film, the better, but do be prepared for the story to go to unexpected places. The film is nostalgic, vulnerable, and personal, and in being so, makes you attach yourself to it like almost nothing else.  Gary Gray's 1996 crime film, featuring Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Jada Pinkett Smith, used the heist genre to tell complex, inner-city stories of Black women. The friends-turned-bank-robbers are compelling, detailed characters, and the film's freshness carries it past any missteps.  This black-and-white, fantasy drama film from Iceland happens to be the debut of genre-bending, experimental pop music artist, Björk, and whilst that is enough of a hook for many, especially considering her wonderful performance, the last thing this film should be remembered as is trivia. Written and directed by Nietzchka Keene, based on the fairy tale ""The Juniper Tree"" collected by the Brothers Grimm, this small production tells the story of two sisters, in a medieval setting, who are forced to escape their home.  Brilliantly animated, highly acclaimed, and an innovative adaptation, Persepolis, a coming-of-age story, set against the Iranion revolution, is a gripping, feminist tale. Co-director Marjane Satrapi, author of the graphic novel the film is based on, chooses to style her autobiographical narrative as if the source material itself had come to life, leaving us with a breathtaking piece of cinema.  Seijun Suzuki, prominent B-film director, channels all his quirks and influences with cool effectiveness into this gem of a yakuza film. The story follows a reformed hitman who is forced to wander around Japan to escape being killed by various gangs. A unique and significant voice in the history of cinema that deserves much more love. One might not expect an adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma to be just so… pop. Clueless is exuberant, funny, loving, and delights in the possibilities of its title. The film is very much a time capsule of a very particular 1990s America, and writer-director, Amy Heckerling, makes a rom-com that's hard not to like. What makes the film truly special is its commitment to characters that it both ridicules and celebrates, ultimately embodying a confidence that very few other films have. A landmark in the queer film canon, Cheryl Dunye's rom-com drama is a heavily self-reflexive, lively, and dizzyingly charismatic. Along with being the film's writer, director, and editor, Dunye also plays the protagonist – named Cheryl – and owns every moment on screen.  It's a special film, and you won't regret giving it a watch. A poignant children's film, which injected American animation with a surge of energy, style, and confidence, The LEGO Movie took the most surprising stances, and went in the most surprising direction. Charming characters, voiced by a talented, cast of fan favourites like Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Alison Brie, Will Arnett, Chris Offerman, Liam Nesson and Morgan Freeman, are just a bonus (albeit, a big one). Chaitanya Tamhane's directorial feature debut (which he wrote too), proved to be a silent, observational, and devastating film. The multilingual, legal drama dances between the real and the absurd, using the spaces between them to interrogate law and life in India. This 'National Award for Best Feature Film' winner is a gem which will undoubtedly be seen as a classic in the future. Djibril Diop Mambéty's fantasy-drama is beautiful, magical, and prophetic. It depicts a 1970s Senegal playing host to two lovers who plan to leave Dakar for France. Do they ever make it? Touki Bouki, with its vivid imagery and fresh rhythm, is not just one of the most important African films but one of the most important films ever. Anand Gandhi's art film, told through three stories that explore the paradox of the same title as the film, interprets the question on several levels, relating it to humanity and the nature of being. It's a delicate, powerful film that belongs up there. George Miller, at age 71, returned to deliver another instalment of his iconic Mad Max franchise, and ended up doing something we've never seen before. The film, despite being a soft reboot, turned out to be one of the greatest action films of all time, with many trying to praise it by calling it an 'art' action film. And the film was not short of praise: it won 6 awards at the 88th Academy Awards. Despite all the buzz, everyone knew it would never win Best Picture. This remarkable film, led by an instantly iconic Charlize Theron, with Tom Hardy's titular character taking a backseat, almost sounds too simple on paper. You'll have to watch it to see how it took us to new heights of energetic, ambitious, emotionally resonant, intelligent, exhilarating, and political filmmaking. Situated in the broad Japanese New Wave movement, Toshio Matsumoto's nonlinear film about a young, trans woman, is an experimental look at queer culture in 1960s Tokyo. The striking originality of the film's voice, which dips into documentary as and when it feels like, produces an absolutely captivating experience. It might be hard to watch at times but if you can, you should. Though Possession has developed a massive cult following, and is a highly regarded horror film, Andrzej Żuławski's psychological drama about a wife who asks her husband for a divorce – an intentionally reductive description – is disturbing, enchanting, thrilling, and opens itself up to multiple readings. Whilst it doesn't have to be viewed as anything more than an engaging piece of work, many continue to view it as only a genre film (with the typical condescension towards 'genre' films attached). If you have a bug for horror, give it a go! Whilst this might have been a surprising pick a decade ago, recent critical reevaluation has shone a light on this classic, teen horror film, now viewing it as us fans always  have. The film, written by Academy Award winner Diablo Cody (Best Original Screenplay for Juno), directed by Karyn Kusama, starred Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, and one can't help but suspect that the general public was ready to dismiss it before it came out. It was marketed with the most heteronormative, male gaze possible, which Cody has spoken out about later. An example would be how the kissing scene between the leads was heavily pushed to appeal to adolescent boys. This scene actually embodied some of the best themes of the film: confusion between friendship and love, the relationship between desire and fear, and bold, feminist strides. All of this was wrapped up in a fun, tense, and poignant story. Often touted as the spiritual successor to the iconic, cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this film carved its own niche, cult following, largely thanks to writer-director-star John Mitchell. He plays Hedwig, a genderqueer East German rock singer, and their backing band, the Angry Inch. It's a lovable film with plenty of personality, humour, and heart. A masterpiece of Hindi cinema, Dibakar Banerjee's anthology film started the 2010s off with a bang. It's an original story, coming from an original voice. The subject matter itself – including 'honour killings', non-consensual recording and selling of sex tapes, and sting operations – makes the fact that this film even exists, a little bit of a miracle. Fun fact: this was also Rajkummar Rao's film debut. Anurag Kashyap cemented his name in the history of Hindi cinema with this 5 hour long, multi-generational, family, revenge saga. It breathes with the ferocity and depth of a classic like 'The Godfather', or a more recent film like 'Gangs of New York', but tells its own, very singular story. Darkly comic, brutal, and impactful, the film also features one of the greatest casts seen in a Hindi film: Manoj Bajpayee, Richa Chadha, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Reema Sen, Huma Qureshi, Rajkummar Rao and many, many more. Amongst the many Studio Ghibli classics, Isao Takahata's anime, fantasy film, based on a 10th century Japanese story, is the only one which stands shoulder to shoulder with Spirited Away. The film holds a timeless, magical quality, along with being thematically heavy and looking absolutely marvelous. Go in blank, let it unfold. To be perfectly honest, one could make the case for most of Charlie Kaufman's filmography – as either writer or director – being remembered as exceptional, and deserving of all the praise in the world. The visually unique, stop motion animation, Anomalisa, rooted firmly in the 'Kaufmanesque' genre, is about Michael Stone, a lonely (duh) customer service expert's one-night stay at a hotel. The film features just three voices: David Thewlis as Michael, Tom Noonan as the voice Michael hears out of everybody else in the film, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisa, whom Michael meets at the hotel, and is the only voice he hears as different to all the others.",POSITIVE

"Dec 4, 2020"," hile much of the minimalist plot bears resemblance to his earlier “Mad Max” films, George Miller’s “Fury Road” is less remake and more reinvention of his own postapocalyptic action movie genre. Blending elements of “The Road Warrior” and “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,” the visionary director dials up the sun-scorched atmosphere to a deafening degree – rusty behemoths collide with damaged flesh and punishingly hostile terrain while heavy metal guitar chords and booming drums bang out a rhythmic dirge. Both the pacing and intensity are relentless, with only snippets of humor thrust into the scanty dialogue, yet Miller knows exactly how much chaos to douse upon his wildly inventive action sequences without losing the quirky fun. The gorgeously demonic designs appear freshly unhinged, while still retaining an air of nostalgia, as the ever-escalating demolition of man, machine, and mise en scene prove endlessly entertaining in this lovingly demented ode to mayhem. Haunted by the ghosts of those he couldn’t save, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) wanders the savage wastelands of a world crumbling under the weight of misery, despair, and diabolical despots preying upon the weak. Captured and assigned as sustenance (a.k.a. a blood bag) for the unhealthy minions of vicious tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), Max spies an opportunity to escape his cruel fate when he encounters the resolute driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Fleeing from Joe’s “Citadel” city with the mad king’s precious cargo and a massive war rig tanker, Furiosa enlists Max’s help to traverse hundreds of miles of barren desert in a perilous mission of redemption. Expectedly, it all begins with a car chase. Then, it segues into a pursuit on foot, before giving way to yet another race of vehicles. It’s no secret that “Mad Max: Fury Road” is essentially a two-hour car chase, but credit is due to writer/director George Miller for taking his one idea and attacking it with such unwavering energy that the movie can survive on basically nothing else. The filmmaker certainly knows how to do fast and furious; if ever there were a film that deserved those words in its title, it’s this. And yet, though the project is named after Max, it’s really Theron’s Furiosa who owns the film, bringing a more sympathetic, humanistic character into the fold (especially considering that Rockatansky barely has any lines of dialogue). Miller, realizing that fans crave more of what he gave them in “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior,” reimagines many of the same elements, but with far more verve. Miraculously, he pays homage or grandly embellishes more often than he merely rips off his former concepts – which, of course, he would be entitled to do, since he practically invented the postapocalyptic wasteland setting and epic vehicular skirmishes with cannibalized, re-outfitted, hodgepodge conveyances. Motorcycles, big rigs, monster trucks, tanks, and more are gloriously welded and melded together into gargantuan juggernauts of metal and fuel. This eye-popping style carries over with equal eccentricity to the costuming, makeup, and prosthetics, manifesting some splendidly fitting grotesqueries and oddities and villains – as audiences have come to anticipate from Miller’s works. The denizens become ever stranger as the locations shift and the picture progresses. Like a twist on “Birdman’s” percussionist, who regularly appeared in shots with the actors as his beats permeated the soundtrack, Miller employs literal drummers and an electric guitarist (perched atop – or rather dangling from – one of the trucks) to supplement the background sounds with thunderous thumps and twanging riffs, respectively. It ramps up the momentum (if such a thing is possible) for the colossal action sequences that assault the viewer with such force that the 120-minute runtime feel like 30. So much stuff goes on in every frame (except, perhaps, for a plot) that it’s unachievable to take it all in the first time through. The stunts are likely the only piece of the film that could be better appreciated; unfortunately, thanks to the extreme advancements in computer graphics (it’s been over three decades since “The Road Warrior”), it’s no longer necessary to choreograph exacting realism from such scenes. Before, there was something undeniably awe-inspiring about the stuntmen getting thrown from cars and careening about in the dirt, since every moment involved actual humans. But now, CG bodies and vehicles frequently replace real and realistic stunts, allowing for gravity-defying and farfetched maneuvers that lose a bit of their impressiveness in their sheer outlandishness (though practical effects do make up a large percentage of the screen). Still, the calm before the storm of a finale is utterly exhilarating as high-octane recklessness and physical abandon replace sensibility and cinematic caution – it’s an absolute thrill ride.

"Oct 27, 2020"," Amazon Prime Video has developed a sizeable bank of movies over the years, and remains arguably the best streaming platform to offer a cross section of Indian cinema. But endless scrolling to find the gems can be tiresome. That's why we're bringing you our list of 60 of the best movies currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video India (as of October 2020). Let the bingeing begin. The Adam Driver-led riveting investigative thriller chronicles the Senate's investigation into the CIA's use of torture following the 9/11 attacks. The Report is both engrossing and infuriating, and serves as the perfect counter piece to Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty. Lijo Jose Pellissery's kinetic spectacle, based on S Hareesh's short story Maoist, explores masculinity like few films before it. At a basic level, the film is about retrieving a lost buffalo. But, that one-line summary doesn't do justice to the surreal energy and spectacular chaos of the film. People have been picking it apart for its 'meaning' ever since it released. We invite you to do the same. A gangster-esque saga set in the world of politics, Prithviraj Sukumaran's impressive directorial debut is the larger-than-life masala film done right. The Mohanlal-starrer is bursting with swag, has a genuinely gripping plot and is full of delicious twists and turns resulting in a strong political drama and delicious revenge saga in equal measure. Nag Ashwin's Mahanati is an ode to one of Telugu cinema's greatest actors—Savitri. Nag Ashwin's take on the Saviritri story successfully explores a complex woman and her turbulent journey, brought to life by an unforgettable performance from Keerthy Suresh. Todd Haynes' spellbinding book adaption is as visually dazzling as it is sensitive. Haynes takes you on a deeply affecting journey by following the adventures of two deaf children across different time periods while exploring their curious connection. The action epic that put Kannada cinema on the map like few before it, became the first Kannada film to cross the Rs. 100-crore mark at the box office. The ambitious gangster saga led by 'Rocking Star Yash' is a rousing underdog story which gives Indian cinema yet another larger-than-life franchise to look forward to. Kathryn Bigelow's expansive drama follows the decade-long international manhunt for Osama bin Laden, from the events of 9/11 to his eventual death at the hands of US Marines. In Konkona Sen Sharma's sparkling directorial debut, a shy and sensitive Indian student (Vikrant Massey) pays a heavy price for his gentleness, while on a road trip with his conceited relatives and family friends. Led by a hauntingly beautiful performance from Massey, A Death In The Gunj remains one of the strongest ensemble dramas of recent years. Tamil cinema has had its share of father-daughter based films but few are as affecting, complex and disturbing as this Mammootty starrer. The film dives into the psyche of a helpless father who's taken custody of his teenage daughter suffering from cerebral palsy. Peranbu is a piercing coming of age drama which also raises several pertinent questions about parenting, disability and sexuality. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's real-life love story serves as inspiration for the film that put romantic comedies back on the map. Bursting with heart and great one liners, The Big Sick is a witty and charming exploration of love and family while exploring clashing cultures with a much needed dose of empathy. Led by a career-topping performance from Ram Charan, set in the '80s, Rangasthalam tells the story of an innocent villager with a hearing impairment who gets mixed up in a political feud involving his elder brother. Director Sukumar impressively uses the big masala film to explore caste, class and oppression. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep star in a movie from writer-director Greta Gerwig's that does justice to their insane collective talent and the book on which the movie is based. That's it. That's all you need to know. When a boy from an impoverished and oppressed farming family kills a big shot, his father (Dhanush in fantastic form) fears retribution. He flees with the boy, the big shot's men in pursuit. Coming right after Vetri Maaran-Dhanush's gorgeous Vada Chennai, Asuran evokes mixed feelings. The screenplay is brilliantly cyclical and there's no denying the power of the mood and the material in a film you won't be able to shake off for days on end. A woman wakes up without clothes in a desolate building. You'd think you were in for a survival drama like Trapped. But Rathna Kumar 's Aadai plays with your head by making Kamini (a sensational Amala Paul) a fascinating and morally questionable figure, leading to one hell of a morality tale. When it comes to huge spectacle action, there is no greater living example than the chaotic achievement that is George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. Fury Road is just non-stop, carefully crafted carnage which somehow manages to be coherent, all while having used minimal CGI. Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it. In an industry inundated with stories where things always work out, Akshay Roy's Meri Pyaari Bindu gave Hindi cinema a rare look at heartbreak. It made a long overdue case for why some relationships don't always work out and how sometimes that is the happy ending. Ayushmann Khurrana stars as the writer who can't get over the one that got away, Parineeti Chopra as Bindu. A bleak drama from Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is a deeply personal film which examines the ways tragedy can wear away at a person's soul, and whether it is possible to come back from the brink. Despite the heart-breaking premise,  the film is filled with unexpected moments of humour and warmth. Winner of the National Award for best Hindi film, Rajkummar Rao stars as a fish-out-of-water government clerk who tries to run a free and fair election in the Naxal-controlled conflict-ridden jungles of India in a nuanced film that explores the painful shortcomings of Indian democracy. Gareth Evans' gloriously violent Indonesian film features a police officer trapped in an apartment building filled with an army of bad guys he has to fight his way through. It has relentless end-to-end killing with some of the most brutal fight scenes you've ever seen. But despite its singular bone breaking vision, it still manages to have a satisfying plot and some fantastically well-crafted scenes of tension amidst the blood bath. On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes – of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions – but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences. Not to mention one of the most badass female action heroes in Emily Blunt's Full Metal Bitch. Edge Of Tomorrow has Tom Cruise as a man forced to relive the same day over and over again in a spectacular action flick that you just want to revisit over and over again. War is the definitive Bollywood action film of its time which proved to the world that Hindi cinema can do the slick sophisticated blockbuster, and do it well. It's Tiger Shroff's best film and the only film that's really known how to capture his ability and channel it into something actually cinematic. Even at its most ridiculous it's never not fun and it perfectly nailed the novelty of the 'two hero film'. War is an unapologetic star vehicle at its best, bursting with style, attitude and just pure swag. It's hard to pick just one amongst Peter Jackson's Middle Earth epic. In terms of battle sequences alone,  it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, followed closely by the Battle for Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King. In one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told, Peter Jackson throws you onto the battlefield with your favourite characters. It's also straight up badass, because…Legolas. Just Legolas. The predictable but urgent Malayalam-language thriller has the sort of moral premise that allows it to transcend the trappings of ""lockdown storytelling"" and exist as an organic computer-screen movie – more on the lines of international hits like Searching and Unfriended. The revelations aren't shocking, but there's an arc to its characters – especially Fahadh Faasil's – that humanizes both the distance and intimacy of modern technology. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chupke Chupke is a laugh-out-loud comedy of errors about a man who is pretending to be a driver. Expect constant confusion and choreographed chaos of the best kind. The definitive coming-of-age drama, which marked the directorial debut of Farhan Akhtar, remains just as complex and intricate today as it did when it came out almost 20 years ago. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna play loyal friends that overcome various obstacles of life in a film that captures college life and the transition into adulthood like no film before it, and few since have. One of Indian cinema's most iconic comedy, the film takes a deep, dark look into the scandals of bureaucracy and politics. Two Mumbai-based photographers get caught up a builder's surreptitious dealings with the government along with a murder which ends with the comical revamp of the Mahabharata that will forever be etched in cinema history. Few movies can claim to have the level of national presence and dedicated following of Jab We Met. With Geet's lovable chattiness, Pritam's groovy soundtrack and so much more, Imtiaz Ali created his own canon for Bollywood rom-coms filled with humour and emotion of an unforgettable kind. Amitabh Bachchan's, ""I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English"" is forever etched in the hallmark of great Bollywood dialogues. This is a blockbuster comedy difficult to top. Bachchan maintains his comic timing, beating thugs with style, and with Bappi Lahiri's evergreen soundtrack, this action-comedy is one for the ages. The directorial debut of Nandita Das, set one month after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, explores the lives of the survivors and victims unabashedly – those that witnessed an entire city burn and crumble. This pithy and haunting film goes deep into the psychological and mental anguish the communal riots caused, and through that, makes a plea for peace and harmony. Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane brings his signature pop-culture-referencing insult-comedy style to this story of a boy whose birthday wish brings his teddy bear to life. Except 30 years later, it's not as cute anymore as the two man-children just lounge around doing drugs and being idiots. Ted gives us one of the greatest comedic characters – a lovable, foul-mouthed cuddly toy full of memorable one-liners who armed us with an arsenal of handy insults. Set against the backdrop of the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, individuals from various walks of life come together to contain its spread in this gripping Malayalam-language thriller. Parvathy Thiruvothu, Tovino Thomas, and Revathi star in a film that's never been more relevant and, despite its haunting subject matter, is ultimately a story of hope. One man's heart-pounding crusade to tear down the crooked system that created him, The Bourne Trilogy is a shining example of a single story told over three parts, (the less said about the 2016 attempt to reboot the series, the better). The sophisticated espionage series that reinvented onscreen action gave us a new, more rooted kind of spy thriller, far removed from the Bond school of blockbuster, but no less exhilarating. Rajkumar Santoshi's immensely quotable cult classic about a pair of hapless slugs who hatch hare-brained schemes to get rich (played by Aamir Khan and Salman Khan), remains every bit the whirlwind comedy it was when it came out decades ago. For everything else, there's Crime Master Gogo. In what remains one of the greatest and most influential gangster epics of all time, City Of God chronicles the lives of young gangsters in Brazil's sultry slums, giving us a sprawling saga of drugs, poverty, crime and utter swag. A shining example of the new wave of Telugu cinema, the well-crafted comedy thriller starring Naveen Polishetty is as hilarious as it is engrossing, masterfully navigating the delicate balance act of humour and a tense, high stakes plot surrounding a series of murders. Years before he was asked to reboot another iconic space saga, JJ Abrams was tasked with reimagining Star Trek, leading to a well-conceived and sorely underrated reimagining of the iconic franchise. Star Trek, masterfully paid homage to the old while paving the way for the new, whilst also making it accessible to those of us who weren't previously married to the Star Trek franchise. With a strong ensemble cast recreating beloved characters, Abrams gave us an origin story of the USS Enterprise and its colourful crew, led by the Chris Pine's charismatic James T Kirk. Shankar's pure, unhinged sci-fi spectacle, for all its slipups, has two things we rarely see in Indian cinema – dazzling imagination and sheer vision. The scale, the visuals, the many forms of Rajinikanth going head to head with Akshay Kumar make the film a must watch. Rahi Anil Barve's debut film must be celebrated not only for its ambition, gumption and scale, but also its fascinating exploration of the horror fantasy genre. While looking for a secret treasure in a village in 20th-century Maharashtra, a man and his son face the consequences of building a temple for a legendary demon who's not supposed to be worshipped. A minor confrontation between a cop and an ex-army man snowballs into an escalation of egos and powerplay. Directed and written by Sachy and anchored by two terrific performances from Biju Menon and Prithviraj Sukumaran, Ayyappanum Koshiyum is a fascinating exploration of masculinity and privilege, neatly packaged in a riveting thriller. Deliciously despicable and delectably sinister, Bornila Chatterjee's The Hungry is a gloriously well-made revenge drama lead by an electric ensemble of seasoned performers like Naseeruddin Shah, Tisca Chopra and Sayani Gupta. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie lead the ensemble cast of Quentin Tarantino's ""fairy tale tribute"" to the waning days of Hollywood's golden age, which follows an ageing actor (DiCaprio) and his long-time friend and stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate a changing industry. This nostalgic throwback to classic sci-fi thrillers follows a young switchboard operator and a radio DJ whose discovery of a mysterious audio frequency sets off a series of discoveries that lead them deep into the unknown. The Vast of Night is a film you won't forget, announcing its writers, director, and cast as new talents to watch out for. Set in the coastal of village of Chellanam near Ernakulam, Lijo Jose Pellissery's sixth film traces a series of unfortunate events that follows the death of Vavachan Mestri (Kainakary Thankaraj) a few moments after he tells his son Eeshi (Chemban Vinod Jose) about his dream funeral. Despite the sombre setting, the film takes the form of a dark comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments popping up every few minutes. Four brothers who share a love-hate relationship stand behind one of their own in matters of the heart in this Malayalam-language family drama that has fast become one of the most beloved Indian films of recent years. An idealistic young man from a poor, oppressed caste family strikes a friendship with a much wealthier female classmate at law school in this Tamil-language film, earning him the wrath of her relatives and the society at large. Directed by Mari Selvaraj and produced by Pa. Ranjith, Pariyerum Perumal is a scathing look at the caste system and the society that is blind to it. After Mulk and Article 15, Anubhav Sinha set his sights on domestic abuse in his most recent social drama Thappad. The film stars Taapsee Pannu as a devoted wife whose entire world is shaken after her seemingly loving husband (Pavail Gulati) slaps her in a fit of rage. What follows is her messy, turbulent quest for justice and divorce, all while her family, friends and lawyers try and make her 'see reason' and not overreact at what was 'just a slap'. Gully Boy followed a predictable underdog trajectory but Zoya Akhtar and co-writer Reema Kagti build on these layers of finely etched relationships, memorable characters and an unforgettable 18-track soundtrack. When Murad finally says, Apna Time Aayega, you believe, for a brief moment in time, that you can also overcome the odds.  And what could be better than that? Writer-director Sharat Katariya's delightfully sensitive romantic drama, set in the Haridwar of 1995, is about a boy with low self-esteem and no achievements (Ayushmann Khurrana) who is compelled by his family to marry a smart, feisty, educated girl (Bhumi Pednekar) despite his objections to her plus-sized physique. The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better. Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with. Based on the 2003 book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of misunderstood teenager Hiccup, who is overlooked and underestimated by his warrior father, who forms an unlikely friendship with a dragon. How To Train Your Dragon is the perfect mix of beautiful animation, delightful characters, and a fantastic adventure rooted in the idea of empathy. Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday is more of a feeling – singularly shocking, stirring, cataclysmic, yet journalistic and depressingly objective, and one of the great achievements in Indian cinema. The reflective effect of this movie about the 1993 bomb blasts (based on Hussain Zaidi's superbly researched novel) was so powerful that nothing less than a TADA verdict forced the courts to certify its ""legality"". Vishal Bhardwaj's first film in his Shakespeare trilogy was an adaptation of Macbeth beautifully transposed to the Mumbai underworld. Maqbool was a triumph of casting with unforgettable performances from its ensemble of stalwarts like Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri. Shoojit Sircar's October is a thing of heart-breaking beauty. A boy (Varun Dhawan) coasts through life aimlessly until random tragedy strikes, taking over his life in ways he doesn't quite understand leaving him forever changed. An unshakeable portrait of pain and trauma, Honey Boy is based on Shia Labeouf's adolescence as a child actor with an abusive father, which sees the actor play the role of his father. Director Alma Har'el brings a sense of delicacy to a painful story that leaves you better off for having watched it. Bong Joon Ho's history-making take on class warfare and family strife was carefully crafted suspense at its best resulting in a rare movie that is as layered as it is accessible. A delicious Bollywood-ish tale follows the love story of Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding). The twist being that Nick is actually the son of one of the richest families in the world. Let the lavish, gorgeous chaos ensue. Six uncomfortably hilarious fables of revenge play out in this Argentinian anthology from writer-director Damián Szifron which escalates relatable grudges into tales of apocalyptic revenge. One of the most impactful, immersive war movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's cinematic achievement takes us as close to the front line as possible offering a human take on the chaos of war. Shimit Amin's iconic sports drama remains every bit the achievement it was when it came out, giving us one of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog stories led by an unforgettable SRK as Kabir Khan.",POSITIVE
"Oct 21, 2020"," Every so often, and in increasingly rare numbers, a big budget Hollywood extravaganza comes along and negates the crushing conditioned cynicism built into our cinematic receptors. Walking into a franchise reboot of a series that hasn’t received fresh blood in nearly three decades, following a trilogy of films having starred an infamously fallen matinee idol, forecasts were dubious at best for George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road. Premiering out of competition at Cannes just prior to receiving its worldwide premiere, the seventy year old originator of the iconic series defied all expectations to create a beautiful and intense action film, standing as one of the best sequels to arrive in well over a decade. Stuffed with innovative visuals, bloody violence, insanely choreographed car chases and serving a rudimentary feminist allegory coursing through the usual arid bromide of commonly testosterone laced genre, the film is unforgettable testament to the heights such cinema can still attain. Max (Tom Hardy) becomes the unwilling prisoner of Immortan Joe’s (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a ruthless leader of one of mankind’s few surviving human populations following the apocalypse, hoarding water inside his mountainside kingdom. But one of Joe’s trusted leaders, the ferocious Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has just stolen a war tanker, and with it, Joe’s bevy of buxom breeder women he’s kept locked in a cave for pleasure and progeny. Thrust into the band of crusaders out to capture Furiosa and return the human loot, Max understands his only chance of survival is to band with Furiosa. Much has been made of the film’s significant presence as a ‘feminist’ action film, considering Miller reportedly consulted with Eve Ensler concerning the characterizations of women, it’s impressive editing from Miller’s wife, Margaret Sixel (who also worked on Miller’s features Babe: Pig in the City and Happy Feet), and, it’s showcasing of actor Charlize Theron, whose narrative dominates the film as she relegates its eponymous hero into the position usually reserved for a damsel in distress. As Imperator Furiosa, Theron successfully launches herself in the dusty footsteps of Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton, women action stars successfully crafted without adhering to fantastical notions dictated by the male gaze. The whole narrative thrust is the aggressive action a band of women takes in reclaiming their rights over their own bodies, creating a ripple effect of metaphoric interpretations for the continuation of mankind in the film’s post-apocalyptic universe. The cadre of sex-worker/breeders tend to be represent the film’s wobblier moments of characterization. Miller makes impressive use of pouty beauties like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Riley Keough, but Zoe Kravitz can’t quite manage to chew on her pulpy dialogue in quite the same fashion. Tom Hardy is a winning ascension to the throne of Max, here given the last name, officially, of Rockatansky, though those unfamiliar with the earlier trio of Mel Gibson films learn little of him except he’s lost his family to the cruel circumstances of a not-so-brave, dangerous new world. In essence, Mad Max: Fury Road is a bombastic, breathless, two hour chase sequence. Miller innovatively spins a furious environment filled with disgustingly realized villains, as the memorable leader, Immorten Joe, played by Hugh Keas-Byrne, who was also a villain in Mad Max. Given the budget and creative control to fashion his craft without studio interference, this is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate, zealous ideas that’s been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles. Warner Bros. presents their hot property in high definition, 2.4:1. The booming soundtrack, part of the film’s matchless experience, is in 5.1 Dolby Digital, though some of the immersive qualities are obviously not comparable to seeing the film theatrically (and as one of the more arguably appropriate releases using 3D technology). Miller coaxed DoP John Seale out of retirement (they worked together on the 1994 film Lorenzo’s Oil) to create a visually striking, continually bristling film. Thankfully, Warner Bros. also included minimal special features. Maximum Fury – Filming Fury Road:
This half hour segment features Miller and the cast discussing the making of the film. Miller discusses collapsing action and dialogue into one sequence, while production designer Colin Gibson reveals the film to have been drawn out in storyboard (which we see several of) before it was actually written. Mad Max – Fury on Four Wheels:
A twenty minute feature focuses specifically on the cars and engines used in the making of the film, many described as masterpieces, and all having one thing in common – they’re incredibly loud and powerful. The Road Warriors – Max and Furiosa:
This eleven minute bit revolves around Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron speaking of their experiences, how they approached their characters, working on set and collaborating with Miller, who raves about his lead actors. The Five Wives – So Shiny, So Chrome:
An eleven minute feature finds the actresses playing the five wives speaking of their characterizations and their relationship to the villainous Immorten Joe. Fury Road – Crash & Smash:
Four minutes of pre-production video tests are show with significant warning that none of the raw footage has been enhanced by CGI. Needless to say, it’s quite impressive. Though plenty are bound to dismiss its achievements on the heels of its critical wave of approval and overall box office success (it nearly reached four hundred million worldwide gross), George Miller has proven to be a continually exciting visionary auteur. Mad Max: Fury Road aims to overwhelm with his onslaught of beautiful images laced with treachery and brutality—and it succeeds.

"Jul 17, 2020"," Mad Max: Fury Road is set in a post apocalyptic future where humanity has lost hope and people fight for the basic necessities of life, under the rule of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).  Two rebels in the form of Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) lead the fightback for hope and order in a world turned mad. My friend asked me how I was going to write this up as a review.  I replied “I need a couple of days to let that sink in so I can form words!” Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly what it needed to be.  The pace is relentless – as soon as the film begins you’re projected into the high octane world of the wastelands. The plot is wafer thin with minimum dialogue, playing out like a silent movie surrounded by carnage.  In any other film, this would have been a massive criticism but this film gets away with it for good measure and reasons.  It lives in the moment, not dwelling on the backstory of how the world came to be or Max’s past.  It keeps things refreshingly simple. Everything about this film represents why I love going to the cinema.  It’s a feeling I haven’t lost since I was a child.  Visiting a cinema can be a magical experience where a film can transport you to another world where the impossible is possible.  Mad Max: Fury Road has that in abundance.  Visually it presents to you an old school nostalgia, a time where practical effects ruled over computer generated effects.  Before I open the debate, there is nothing wrong with computer generated effects.  Done correctly and it enhances the film.  Done badly and it will appear fake and cartoonish.  If I had to put a percentage on this film, 90% of Mad Max was done practically.  In today’s modern Hollywood where every film is interwoven and connected with shared universes, it’s unheard of and it plays in the film’s benefit. There are some crazy, mind-blowing stunts where you’ll wonder how it was achieved and it adds to the intense realism.  Every collision or crash on screen, you don’t doubt it, you believe it.  You feel it.  In a post apocalyptic world, forget Formula 1 and their DRS or Fast and Furious and their turbo/nitro charges.  In a Mad Max world, it’s just you, your guts, your guile and the machine you drive in.  It’s a driving film in its purest form.  If Fast and Furious 7 is like watching Top Gear on steroids, then Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching Top Gear on every conceivable drug known to mankind. The action is beautifully and bravely choreographed.  Just like Dredd or The Raid where the action is no holds barred, each action sequence performs like a domino effect dance where one thing leads to another and another, gradually building up to the spectacle such as the sand storm.  The whole thing is brutally chaotic and at times comedic but you can’t stop watching.  I’m glad the film had some fade to blacks moments or the audience would just stop breathing! Cars are a sign of power and the bigger it is, the more significant you are.  Nothing goes to waste as each vehicle is a metal rusting mash-up with another vehicle, creating a new beast altogether. The cars are also worshipped especially for the War Boys.  They proudly hold their steering wheels in the air as they head for battle.  They make a symbolic hand gesture to cement their commitment to their leader and their trip to Valhalla, a heaven where they can live forever after dying in glorious death. But the cult is feeble which Nux (Nicholas Hoult) questions during the course of the film.  The War Boys endlessly sacrifice themselves (kamikaze style) for a leader with his own corrupt game.  Because Nux doesn’t get the ending he desires, the principles of the faith start to crumble when it’s put under scrutiny. It’s a society that is broken with humanity on its last knees.  Immortan Joe and his War Boys are at the top of the pyramid and the rest are dependant on their services.  Joe hoards water and food in the Citadel to keep people desperate because the needs of humanity gives him the power to do what he wants, hence his line about resenting its absence if the people became addicted to water. But it’s also a world that is sick and toxic.  The War Boys are seen with nasal cannulas.  Immortan Joe’s face mask doubles up as a breathing mask.  His broken body is assembled together with body kit like Darth Vader.  Nux has cancerous tumours on his shoulders and has nicknames for them. Alliances also play their part, especially in the long chase and hunt for the escapees.  Joe has dealings with Gas Town (for petrol) and Bullet Town (ammunitions) to keep up their ongoing pace. But I don’t look at Mad Max: Fury Road having a feminist agenda.  I see it as a film about liberation, to break free of oppression and rule – a classic sci-fi ideology. Tom Hardy’s performance as Max is different from his predecessor, Mel Gibson.  Whether you’re familiar with the Mad Max story or not, this new interpretation and his struggles are more subtle and internal than spoken.  His performance is more physical.  When he’s captured against his will, he becomes a blood bag for the War Boys.  All Max wants to do is find peace in the new world but with a man with nothing to lose, he can succumb to the madness in order to survive.  This is perfectly illustrated in one brilliant scene where he simply walks off into the desert only to return moments later with a blanket full of guns and blood all over his face. But the outstanding performance goes to Charlize Theron as Furiosa.  She defies her master in order to escape his rule and takes his breeder wives along for the ride.  She seeks redemption and wants to return home.  In the quieter moments of the film, she provides the emotional heart especially when she discovers what happened to her home. Mad Max: Fury Road should be celebrated for its strong role reversal.  Furiosa is the lead in this film but there is a definite balance between Max and Furiosa and their shared empathy.  They are equals, looking for the same thing and that quality separates them from the animals.  Furiosa is not a sidekick or a damsel in distress.  She can take care of her own, without conforming to a stereotype. Theron delivers the most complete, well rounded and realistic character since Ripley was first introduced in Alien.  It also puts an end to the myth that female characters can’t hold their own in a big budget movie.  It’s a positive representation of women being survivors at the end of the world.  That’s definitely not a negative or a criticism or in some circles why the film should be boycotted – it’s a refreshing change from what we normally expect out of a summer blockbuster film. The film may be simple in its premise but it has enough intelligence without spoon feeding information.  The characters accept the world they live in and so does the audience. Films like Mad Max: Fury Road do not come along often.  Director George Miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe. If you can see it again, try an IMAX screening. Trust me, you won’t regret it! Favourite moments from the film? The flame throwing guitar man sticks out.",POSITIVE
"Jul 5, 2020","Wall-to-wall visceral action, insane practical stunts, highly stylized production, with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse.",POSITIVE
"Jul 3, 2020"," While talking to a friend recently I happened to mention how I was more excited about the new “Mad Max” than I was for a new “Star Wars.” He was surprised by that. I told him that while I will always be a huge “Star Wars” fan, I still have some residual disappointment over the prequels. Over the past 35 years, on the other hand, “Mad Max” has never let me down. Now that “Fury Road” has arrived, I have been lifted to a whole new level of excitement, adoration and respect. Post-apocalyptic road warrior Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has been captured by the War Boys, the white-skinned, radiation-sickened minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Immortan Joe is the warlord of an area of towering cliffs known as The Citadel, where he controls his people with small rations of what he calls Aqua Cola, clean water he pumps up from underground. Max being a universal blood donor makes him very valuable as a blood bag to help reinvigorate any War Boys who are feeling the effects of their sickness. On this day, Immortan Joe is sending an armored semi, called a War Rig, to the neighboring Gas Town and the Bullet Farm to trade water for the respective supplies their names suggest. The driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), has other plans for the Rig. She has helped Immortan Joe’s 5 breeder wives escape and is taking them to her old home, The Green Place. Immortan Joe gathers a posse of War Boys to chase after Furiosa. One of his drivers, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), is hooked up to the Max blood bag. Since he still needs the strength Max’s blood is providing, but he refuses to give up the driver seat to anyone else, he has Max strapped to the front of his vehicle as he launches full throttle down the Fury Road. “Fury Road” is the literal definition of controlled chaos. It’s an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses. This incarnation of Max is truly mad, seeing visions and hearing voices, most specifically of his dead child. His experiences on his own in the vast wasteland have shaped him into a crazy, yet cautious, man of few words but meaningful actions. He is definitely out for himself, but not so self-centered that he can’t recognize strength in others. To this end, Max really isn’t the main character; Furiosa is. Just like in “The Road Warrior,” Max is more of a device, something the other characters use to help them in their cause. Furiosa might have been able to achieve her goal without him, but her chances improve dramatically with Max along for the ride. George Miller has written and directed all of the “Mad Max” films. While it has been 30 years since the last entry, “Beyond Thunderdome,” Miller tackles “Fury Road” like it has only been two or three. You get the impression that over the past three decades he has written down every random Mad Max-style stunt piece that has come to his mind, and he has put every single one of them into this film. Under normal circumstances that could make a movie feel bloated, but not in Miller’s capable hands. Even more amazing than the stunts is the fact that there is very little CGI work. Every wild vehicle, usually amalgams of several different kinds, actually works and are really flying across the desert. It’s such a glorious sight. So glorious, in fact, that I highly recommend shelling out the extra dough and seeing this in 3D. I don’t normally do this, knowing that people have so many different opinions about the technology, but this is probably the first film in this new era of digital 3D that is worthy of the gimmick. Or, rather, the gimmick is worthy of the film. Miller uses 3D the way it was conceived to be used, with several gags that made me flinch as car chunks and bodies flew toward me. He even rewards us with a fun, traditional gag, a kind of throwback (throw-forward?) one, right at the climax. “Fury Road” isn’t all fury, though. There is a strong story under all the mayhem. Furiosa is a very deep and flawed character, maybe even a little more than Max. There’s a moment when her story is revealed that actually got me a touch choked up, which is more testament to the directing talents of George Miller. This is the man who also gave us “Babe,” after all. I can go on and on, but it would all basically boil down this one truth: “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen. Period.

"Jan 10, 2020","It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago.",POSITIVE
"Dec 3, 2019"," It grabs you from its frenetic opening scene, sinking its teeth into your neck, wrapping its pulsating tendrils around your heart, stealing your breath and gripping your balls in a vice-like grasp — if you have balls, that is. Mad Max: Fury Road is a cacophony of beautiful violence, a turbo-charged chase scene that plays out over two glorious hours, as close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater. Yes, I might sound like Peter Travers with this hyperbolic adulation, but I can’t help it. This new Mad Max film just might be the best action film we’ve ever seen. It will certainly be the one to beat in this summer season loaded with the usual suspects of sequels, reboots and destruction porn. How can I condemn destruction porn when Fury Road is more or less a non-stop orgy of explosions, car wrecks and hand-to-hand combat? That’s because, unlike the Marvel films currently polluting the multiplexes like Stepford Wives in their cookie-cutter plots and safe scripts where death is temporary and destruction without human cost, there is plenty at stake in Fury Road. Set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the first three Mad Max films, Fury Road features Tom Hardy stepping into the role made famous by Mel Gibson. But unlike Gibson’s character, Hardy’s Max actually seems legitimately insane. It’s a fact we learn right away, Jack, as he chews on a lizard and hallucinates about the people (presumably family members) he was unable to save. Unlike many reboots, which give a hot, young director a chance to fuck up a franchise, Fury Road was written and directed by George Miller, the man whose name is attached to the previous three Mad Max films. But if you look at Miller’s recent credits you get two Happy Feet films and a Babe sequel. WTF? Who knew Miller had such a virtuosic ballet of blood and ultra-violence left in him? But here’s the thing, Fury Road is more than an exciting, mindless bacchanal of gore and scorched earth. When we first meet Max, he is captured and brought to a horrific citadel ruled by the masked warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), where he is tortured, branded and enslaved. Max is largely kept out of the action during the first third of the film, bound in chains and used as a living blood transfusion for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Immortan Joe’s bald, white-skinned War Boys, a gang of twitchy psychos just waiting for their moment to go down in a blaze of glory. See, Immortan Joe is one evil dude who rules his kingdom by controlling the only water around. But things are about to change. With Max under lock and key, Miller introduces us to Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a one-armed road warrior tasked by Immortan Joe to make a supply run to another settlement. However, Furiosa has plans of her own, and soon after she goes rogue, Immortan Joe and his War Boys create a flotilla of trucks and cars, primed for battle and ready to blow the shit out of her ass. “Who killed the world?” someone asks at the beginning of the film. As Furiosa’s mission becomes clear, so does the answer to that question: men. The introduction of women characters is a stroke of genius here, one that pushes Fury Road into the position of best film in the Mad Max series. Unlike the men, broken or pushed into insanity by this new world order, Miller’s female characters express hope of a world reborn. The symbolism may be obvious, but it works. Fury Road wouldn’t have worked if it wasn’t so damned beautiful. Miller, along with writers Nick Lathouris and Brendan McCarthy (a comics artist), mapped out the entire film in storyboard and makes a glorious leap to the screen. Nothing looks fake, there is no shoddy-looking CGI filling in the spaces. This is a terrible world, a place of vast deserts, looming sandstorms and barren mountains. There is something striking in its awfulness. But unlike this broken world, you will leave Mad Max: Fury Road feeling invigorated, squirming with life. This is action filmmaking at its finest.",POSITIVE
"Oct 27, 2019"," You hear every little speck of sand shaking loose from his body from his head downward. Every sound is intensified tenfold until Hardy’s character stands tall and comes to his senses.  For those unfamiliar with ""Mad Max,"" ""Fury Road"" is the fourth installment in the George Miller franchise which started in 1979 with Mel Gibson. Without too many spoilers, in the original, Max Rockatansky was a patrol officer in a dystopian Australia, before he lost everything of value to him. His further adventures involve putting others lives ahead of his own. The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system — a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar. 
There’s a short leg of the film where everyone is cast in a soft blue gradient. It’s like watching the film under a filter, and it’s beautiful.  
                          
                        Staying true to the character, Hardy’s Max doesn’t say much — often speaking in grunts or with simple gestures — but he doesn’t need to. The smallest movement of his eyes or gestures do the talking. Most of the time, he’s a terrifying badass who eats lizards raw and can take down a pack of men single-handedly without blinking an eye.  
Both he and Theron’s Imperator Furiosa (one of many lavish names in the film) are a ragged tag-team of warriors who you can’t get enough of on screen. 
You know who I’m talking about if you’ve seen the trailers — the wild guitarist playing his own personal concert atop a spectacular Macy’s Day Parade-like vehicle. Every time he comes on screen, you can’t help but grin because it’s so utterly over the top that it’s just another welcome addition to the mixed bag of eccentric characters on display. One thing that may surprise you given the film's testosterone-heavy marketing in trailers is that it’s driven by a female-centric storyline. Going in with little expectations having only watched the first “Mad Max,” I was ready for an all-out bro-movie filled with car chases, brawls, and mindless fun. While you certainly get all of that, you get a bit more, too, and it’s refreshingly welcome.  
While the movie clocks in at two hours, it feels like it goes on for longer, and it’s one of the rare times you won’t think that’s a bad thing. Imagine a gorgeously wild and hellish “Wacky Races” meets “Twisted Metal” (replace the scary clown face from the popular game with Max’s Immortan Joe). Numerous parties engage in combat — some hanging from wiry poles that would make Cirque du Soleil members jealous.
                          
                        For the final 30 minutes or so, I surrendered myself to the film, dropping my pad and pen with which I usually jot down notes to claw nervously into my cheeks and the back of my neck, awaiting the uncertain fate of our film’s protagonists over a majestic desert car battle. ",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2019"," The Last Black Man in San Francisco: I thought this would be a story of gentrification; it’s sort of that, but mostly something stranger and more haunting. Jimmie Fails (played by an actor of the same name, who also co-wrote with his childhood friend Joe Talbot) is obsessed with the house he grew up in, which has passed into the hands of a white couple. With his best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) he visits the house and engages in guerrilla upkeep; when the white couple breaks up and moves out, they squat there as they try to figure out whether they can buy the house for real. The house is gorgeous, from its painted ceilings to its witch-hat tower room, and you’ll want these two guys to succeed in their Comrade Quixote quest–but at a certain point you may notice that this is all about the ownership of stuff. When the two friends begin to put their plan in motion the first thing we see is them walking down a flight of steps flanked by two columns of homeless people. The hunger Jimmie feels for specific, highly-symbolic land and furniture begins to feel clutching, unsettling, misplaced; and believe me, the film will pay off on that tremor of doubt. This is a film about two guys who have not succeeded by conventional standards. They don’t have wives or girlfriends; they don’t have kids; they don’t own the home they’re illegally sharing. (If you keep a running tally of the kinds of places poor people can live, this movie will leave you with a double-digit list: SRO, group home, abandoned house, your car; somebody else’s car….) They do have one another, and their friendship is portrayed with such sweetness. At one point the camera draws an extremely unsubtle parallel between these two best friends and a straight couple. This is the friendship of two artsy guys who feel alone in the world, without city or community, homeless except when they’re with each other. And the fact that the final shots of the film show one of the friends rowing a boat out on the unresting waves of the Pacific Ocean, and then rowing the boat offscreen so only the waves are left, may suggest that this world doesn’t let you keep what you salvage. There are many, many semisatirical moments in this highly theatrical film, like the tourist party bus blasting “Somebody to Love” as it rolls past the naked guy waiting at the bus stop. The portrayal of San Francisco’s cuckoo aspect helped me deal with the fact that the movie’s climax is an act of political theater/nonconsensual audience participation. Maybe that is just how people in SF express emotions? There’s a lot in this movie which spoke to me, especially in its unexpected twists and moments. I’m not sure I’ve seen another film where the relationships which compete with the central friendship are not romantic relationships, but relationships with your family of origin. I loved the quiet, nerdy-kid humility with which Mont says, when Jimmie catches him drawing portraits of the dudes who just insulted him, “I shouldn’t get to appreciate them ’cause they’re mean to me? That’s silly.” This is a movie about the search for a home–the inability to find it where you thought you’d left it; maybe the inability to find it at all. There’s a lot to say about the politics of gentrification, but in this film gentrification is a synecdoche for a universal condition of exile. Mad Max: Fury Road: On a very different note… this kicked. So okay, I’d avoided this when it came out because I made the mistake of being on social media, even a little, and found the whole *~*discourse*~* of “Is this a good film because it’s feminist??? Or is it a bad film because it’s feminist???” so dumb and depleting. Started to feel like the people who liked it only liked it because it wasn’t something they resent, not because it was something awesome. It’s something awesome. It’s all hot orange and brown, the glamor of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can’t go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it. The dialogue is often dumb in a way I don’t enjoy, but fortunately there’s little dialogue overall. One of my very favorite genres is “batshit pleasure-idiocy for the bad sweet tooth + genuine harrowing emotion,” and Fury Road is a classic of that vertiginous genre. You’ll feel things! You’ll respect these characters, you’ll love them and want their hard world not to break their spirits, and you’ll also get to cheer while they fight dudes on GIANT FREAKING BENDY POLES WITH FLAMETHROWERS. It’s so good. Lots of just very smart choices, in a movie which is also pure dumb pleasure. The mistrust and violence between our two heroes (MAX ROCKATANSKY and IMPERATOR FURIOSA, because this movie loves its audience with a swooning, surrendering love) is a smart choice. The fact that they meet an all-women’s community but it’s neither secret dystopia nor pacifist Earth Mother solution to their problems is a smart choice. The whole weird sad thing with Nux is a smart choice. The fact that the dictator’s army has a bard, and it’s A DUDE STRAPPED TO A WAR TRUCK WITH AN ELECTRIC GUITAR THAT SHOOTS FIRE, is… sure, okay, it is a smart choice. In general I pretty much loved all the people strapped to trucks. It’s such an immediate visual symbol for helplessness and complicity, and it makes the fights weird and unexpected. The heart of this movie is a scene in which Max gives freely what was taken from him by force; it’s a genuinely beautiful, hard-earned portrayal of sacrifice as an assertion of one’s humanity.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2019"," I don’t want to review Mad Max: Fury Road. I want to write love letters to it or draw it like one of those French girls. If I could find the right keystroke combination, this review would just be one long onomatopoetic recreation of the feral roar of approval bellowed from deep within my bosom as the credits rolled. They’ve called it a “game-changer,” a “masterpiece” and a “work of genius,” but none of those capture the totality of what writer/director George Miller has done here. It deserves some new term, some unique series of letters fused together by explosions underneath a desert sun. I don’t know? Maxcellent. There you go: It’s Maxcellent. It’s been asked “Is this a sequel to the other Mad Max movies? A prequel? A remake?” Shhh. Don’t you worry your pretty head about that none. You just keep your eyes on that extra fiery fire and characters with names like “Rictus Erectus” and “Toast the Knowing.” The film is set some time in the future when earth is almost uninhabitable, so given the Senate’s recent denial that climate change is a thing, at least 2016. Lone wolf Max (Tom Hardy) is grabbed by goons who serve Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a decrepit and bloated monster who rules over a group of survivors. The entirety of the plot is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) trying to escape with five of Joe’s sex slave brides and Max’s reluctant help. That’s it. Literally, there is no more plot. This isn’t to say that the film isn’t speaking volumes. Hell, it’s not even speaking: it’s shouting and screaming over a wailing guitar riff. The brides scrawl graffiti in the dungeon they escaped, reading “We are not things” and “Who killed the world? (riverbendgolfcomplex.com) ” The latter has a clear answer:  Dudes. Dudes killed the world. Unchecked masculinity killed civilization. Joe’s vile kingdom is the furthest point in testosterone-fueled evolution: Men are solely bred for war, women are disposable resources. Enter Furiosa. With one metal arm, no hair and so much bad-ass nobody else can have any, Furiosa is a human axe born to lop the head off the top of the patriarchy. She is powerful without surrendering her desired femininity and one of the greatest action heroes ever. Miller pulled off one of the boldest funding stunts, convincing the studio this was a Mad Max movie when Max is window dressing in a leather jacket, there simply to look cool. Fury Road is violence as opera; it is car chases as visual poetry. The stunning physical and practical effects trump any and all computer-generated tomfoolery. Your eyes literally can’t consume all that’s happening, flicking back and forth like nightmare-fueled REM sleep. Miller’s magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It’s evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to “dumb fun.” It’s a reminder that computers can never, will never, be able to out-adrenaline real stuntpeople doing real stunts. It’s brilliant. It’s glorious. It is Maxcellent.",POSITIVE
"Jul 16, 2019"," Studios like to market action films as “nonstop thrill rides” or “high-octane adventures,” but Mad Max: Fury Road transcends such rote praise. It’s like being fired out of the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun and piercing rusty debris along the way to a messy kill; a Pyrrhic victory at the end of an excruciating journey. “Exhilarating” is an understatement. No other film in recent memory has managed to deliver on the basic premise of big budget action with such execution or elan, but it’s more than just explosions and bloody vengeance. If you’ve never seen George Miller’s Mad Max films, they’re not a prerequisite here. All you need to know is that the world died, leaving sand, death, and pain in its wake. The one thing made implicit in this iteration of Miller’s post-apocalyptic wasteland is the distinct sense that, whatever the specifics of this particular Armageddon, the men are surely to blame. The entire landscape is littered with gangs and warlords sketched out like a decidedly masculine id brought to life by Moebius. Motherless Warboys, sickly and pale, ride into assured obsolescence for the glory of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), their snow-coiffed dude deity, all for the false promise of Valhalla. That the ruling class is built upon the hoarding of water, the rationing of breast milk, and an unhealthy obsession with American muscle cars should tell you everything you need to know about what’s left in the afterbirth of society’s demise. The film’s narrative is simple. Immortan Joe’s trusted Imperator, Furiosa, steals away with five of his slave wives in a daring exodus masqueraded as a routine gasoline run. Max, having already been captured by the warboys in the film’s prologue and enslaved as one of their “blood bags” (a source of nutrition for the malnourished soldiers), gets caught up in the fray like a leather-clad Toshiro Mifune, aiding the expatriates in their sojourn to a better life. The Mad Max world’s undeniably attractive Western iconography is flipped here in intriguing ways. Fury Road is the most brutal and explosive movie you’re likely to see anytime soon, but it’s almost gleefully divorced from the typical summer blockbuster and its action figure fantasy elements. The film is still dick deep in the desire to look, feel, and sound as cool as humanly possible, but there’s a brutality there, a world-weariness that purposefully poisons the aesthetics. Over the years, there’s been an unhealthy preoccupation with surviving the apocalypse and becoming the ideal, extreme version of yourself, but this is not that. It’s no wankfest of destruction for trashboys to fantasize themselves the star of. Yes, Tom Hardy’s Mad Max is the first character you see, his voiceover the first thing you hear, but this is not his film. It’s Charlize Theron’s. Sure, Hardy is a suitably smoldering badass, but he’s barely a hero. Furiosa is the real protagonist. It’s her freedom ride that forms the film’s single, prolonged car chase. Her intensity inspires lifelong concubines to escape their existence as property, even if it risks their survival. Her burning memories of a homeland paradise covered in green offers the only currency more rare than water or gasoline in this world: hope. Max is just riding shotgun for as long as the narrative will have him, a broken, terminally lost soul trying like hell to keep air pumping through his dusty lungs. Mad Max: Fury Road isn’t quite a silent movie, but it’s as light on dialogue as it is excess fat. The carnage meter never throttles below catastrophe, but there’s a classicism to the storytelling that feels like uncut myth. One might find it “comic book-y” solely based on legendary artist Brendan McCarthy’s involvement, or the screenplay just being a bunch of storyboards; but, at its purest, cinema should be tales told through images. Every character feels fully realized, even though not much time is set aside to explore each of them as individuals. Joe’s wives could stand to be more distinct, but they are never treated as extras or incidental. Max’s backstory is relegated to smash-cut mirages, while Furiosa’s is extrapolated from a few line deliveries. Perhaps in today’s climate someone might leave Fury Road hungering for a Netflix series or comic book spin-offs of the supporting cast’s respective backstories, but what’s so impressive is how much is implied just from the artfully curated snapshots glimpsed between trucks flipping over and oil rigs bursting into flame. There’s no time for flashbacks or rumination. Everything happens in the sky-burning now. In a weird twist, one of the Warboys, played by Nicolas Hoult, transforms into the beating heart of the picture. One of the wives makes the distinction that he and all of his psychopathic comrades are really just boys, all raised in a cave by a megalomaniac. From the moment he experiences even a shred of human compassion, his allegiances shift, and he gives up trying to die for some bullshit afterlife and tries to do right by his fellow (wo)man. It’s a moment that might elicit eyerolls but, coupled with other telltale signs of toxic masculinity as the palpable manifestation of world death, feels progressive for a film otherwise powered by blowing shit up in a desert. Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy. It’s the kind of movie you can just sense Josh Homme furiously masturbating to on the periphery of the frame, but, curiously, one I’d love to take my little sisters to. In a climate where we’re all arguing about Joss Whedon and “strong female characters,” George Miller has hidden a welcome alternative inside his bombastic comeback film. Deadshirt staff writer.

"Jun 3, 2019"," It’s a world gone mad in Mad Max: Fury Road, and director George Miller wastes no time establishing the no holds barred, kill or be killed state of living in his post-apocalyptic vision. A brief montage of sound clips outlining civilization’s downfall plays before Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) shows up, looking over a desert wasteland before fleeing in his car. He’s chased down and captured by a few “War Boys,” devout followers and henchmen of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe is the cultlike leader of The Citadel, a desert city where he controls the oil, water and food supply. He’s barely living, with most of his body made up of machinery designed to keep him alive, and he rules over his impoverished masses with no mercy. Just as Max is taken prisoner, Joe sends out his War Rig (a massive truck/war machine) to get gasoline from their supplier. The truck is driven by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), whose shaved head and black war paint immediately establish her as someone not to be messed with. She drives off, but at a certain point makes an unexpected detour. Joe and his minions soon realize that Furiosa has taken Joe’s five young wives (called “breeders,” for reasons that should be obvious), and his only chances at getting a male heir, with her, prompting Joe to chase her down with everything he’s got. And with that, Mad Max: Fury Road starts its nearly two hour long car chase, with Furiosa and her five companions driving across the desert in the hopes of escaping Joe’s fast-approaching army of cars and War Boys. Max winds up tagging along with Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a dying War Boy hoping he can go out in a blaze of glory. It’s hard not to see the onslaught of marketing for Mad Max: Fury Road and believe that the film will represent some sort of transgressive alternative to the usual homogeneous pile of tentpoles unleashed every summer. Fury Road only delivers on that promise to some degree; the production design offers plenty of neat things to gawk at, implying there’s plenty more to this world than what’s on screen, and the minimal exposition is a breath of fresh air. What’s disappointing is how much of Miller’s film feels familiar and formulaic. It’s the same old story, just dressed up in a spiky, oversaturated outfit. It’s not that Miller is just copying and pasting another film’s plot—I’m having a hard time thinking of any other movies where ghoulish men hunt down their leader’s pregnant sex slaves. The familiarity comes from the structure and story beats, which emulate what’s been done plenty of times before: character development and themes boiled down to one word statements (survival for Max, redemption for Furiosa), a romantic subplot with no bearing on anything, a second act tragedy putting our protagonists’ success in doubt, and a “crazy” last minute plan acting as a transition into the final act and climax. And when your film literally moves down a straight line through a flat, two-colour landscape, a lack of variety will drag things down considerably. Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing (both The Raid: Redemption and Dredd are great, recent examples of the KISS principle in action), but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes. It’s easy to know where and how things will end up, and for that reason it’s easy to detach from the onscreen spectacle. There’s a point in the climactic car chase where Furiosa comes face-to-face with Joe, and angrily says “Remember me?!” It’s played as a cool, kick-ass moment, but I found it a strange thing to say, considering this is the first time both characters actually share the screen together. There’s no weight or purpose to this moment, but it falls in line with the expectations and structure of an action film, so it has to be there. That safeness, that feeling of Miller eccentrically colouring within the lines, is Fury Road’s downfall. It’s a world gone mad, but this film is anything but.",NEUTRAL
"May 10, 2019"," Its brutal war-torn world, built on the liquid viscera of blood, milk and oil, is a dystopia; but the future that Max (Hardy) and Furiosa (Theron) are fighting for feels gloriously utopian. It’s not just the visuals – a fire and brimstone hellscape conjured by Miller and DoP John Seale – that feel shockingly new, but the film’s politics. Fury Road is righteously, emphatically feminist and it feels so, so good; this is what action filmmaking – hell, all filmmaking – has been missing for so long. Theron’s thunderous performance leads the charge, in this film that steals your breath and boils your blood. What the cast and crew have achieved is rare and precious. Cherish it.",POSITIVE
"Apr 26, 2019"," When I saw the trailer for Mad Max Fury Road I was positive it would be one I couldn’t see.  I don’t like violent films and it looked like a gory, violent mess.  However, I always go through my process I describe for evaluating movie content in How to Be Mormon and Like Movies. I look at reviews, the detailed content summaries on screenit.com and I ask friends who have seen the movie.  To my surprise I found it to have virtually no profanity and to not be as violent as I anticipated. It is an R but most of that is more battle like violence, some nudity and vehicular battles. Convinced it was within my comfort level I decided to go check it out . It’s a very tricky movie to review because it does what it is trying to do masterfully well. I don’t know how that can be debated.  Whether such a master work is your cup of tea is another question. It’s certainly not a movie I will be frequently rewatching but I did think it was good and engaged me more than I would have guessed. All in all it is a success and I can see why many people love it. I have not seen the original Mad Max movies because I always figured they were too violent so perhaps I will give them a watch.  This Mad Max doesn’t have much of  plot. It’s one action sequence after another.  It does not try to have symbolism or a puzzle like a Nolan film might have.  It doesn’t have a strong lead character like a Bond film.  The title is perhaps a misnomer because Mad Max has only a few lines of dialogue and is an ensemble player with Charlize Theron and others. Basically the plot that does exist starts out with setting.  It is a desert post-apocalyptic world that is ruled by a man named the Immortan Joe.  Max has been arrested and is forced to be a blood bag for a War Boy played by Nicholas Hoult.  Charlize Theron is Furiosa who abducts 5 of Joe’s wives called the breeders. The rest of the movie is Max, Furiosa and crew getting chased by Joe and having intense battles with each other.  Each of the cars is so imaginative with one even being a giant speaker system with a guy playing an electric guitar.  There are cars that have long poles for people to swing onto other cars.  There are rigs with gasoline and others covered in spikes. It keeps the action exciting because you don’t know how the cars work and how the fight will play out. For not speaking much Tom Hardy is good as Mad Max.  But the movie doesn’t give you a lot of time to contemplate his character.  I can’t even imagine how awful it must be to shoot a movie like this with all the dust and dirt but he is convincing as the stoic anti-hero. The CG is kept to a minimum and it at least appears to have a lot of practical effects. The stunt work is flawless.  I wonder how much Hardy and others did of their own stunts? Whatever the percentage is by professionals you definitely can’t tell.  It feels earthy and real which we haven’t seen in an action film in a long time. I loved how Mad Max handled its female characters.  It reminds me a little bit of Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow.  These are not cliched warrior women or damsels in distress.  Even the breeder women are relatively complex especially for this kind of movie.   Charlize Theron is amazing! She is tough but has heart and there is a moment that is completely devastating for her and she sells it. There are different kind of women- old women, young women, pregnant women and they all defy female tropes.  The last thing I expected in a movie like this is an awesome group of women and it definitely helped sell me on the film.
Hugh Keays-Byrne is good as the villain Immortan Joe but most of that credit has to go to his costume and mask. There is such attention to detail.  The amount of time that must have been spent to get teeth right, skin layered and dry, lips cracked, everything covered in dust is mind blowing.  The makeup on the war boys including Nicholas Hoult is very convincing.  They are brainwashed to believe if they are obedient servants to Joe they will achieve immortality at the gates of heaven. Mad Max Fury Road is not a movie that gives the audience much time to breathe.  There is very little dialogue and I did feel kind of exhausted by the end of it. But then again I feel like it was trying to do something completely different and new and from a comic book guy like George Miller it makes sense it is primarily a visual spectacle.  Still, it pushed me to my limit of apocalyptic car battle sequences (who knew I had such a limit? 😉 ).  I’m a little surprised it is so universally loved because I would think a few people might be bothered by the thin plot and lack of character development? I guess they just accept it for what it is- a new dazzling creative vision of what a war movie looks like.  After all do we complain that the villains in a WW2 movie aren’t fleshed out enough? Do we want more dialogue in our John Wayne war movie? No.  Same with this.  It is visually incredible and the action is immersive enough to carry the day. Like I said, the women put it over the hump for me to a strong recommendation.  It was such a pleasant surprise and I bet you could see the movie and not even notice most of the women.  They are just characters in the movie like anybody else.  It looks gorgeous.  The action sequences are stunning and I was entertained. As far as content it has some nudity from a distance and women are milked like cows in one brief shot.  Characters are stabbed, impaled, tortured and shot in the battle scenes.  Another you see briefly has his face ripped off from a mask. A lot of crashes, explosions and sand storms that are intense.  A woman has a c-section mostly off screen and an IV is seen being inserted.  I know it sounds crazy but its actually more tame than you might think.  No language.  Mostly it is a lot of cars and broad fighting like a battle than one on one violence like you might get in a horror movie. Also the music by a guy named Junkie XL was outstanding with a great combination of electric guitar, medal sounds and a traditional sweeping score. Oh well.  Can’t make everyone happy.  I liked that it really wasn’t a girl power movie. If it had been a bunch of cliched warrior women I would have hated that. At least to me they were just normal characters doing awesome things.  It’s not like there was some big moment where the movie wanted you to applaud the tough women.  The action scenes are fast and non-stop and it just happens to be that a lot of the fighters are women.  I’m amazed anyone would have a problem with that.  So lame.  I find it hard to believe men would really complain about the female characters… I think the super feminists make that up in order to conjure up an adversary or something. Feminism is great.. but like everything in the world.. in moderation.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 16, 2019","  	 	Having seen the gobsmackingly over-the-top trailers, I went into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" worrying that it would be review-proof.

""Fury Road"" jams the pedal to the metal and keeps its foot down for a breakneck 120 minutes of vehicular carnage, a jawdroppingly beautifully painted demolition derby streaked through with humour as dry as the desert in which it's set and hearts as black as the precious ""guzzle-ine"" that fuels it. Cracked lips and sandblasted faces leer from the ochre nightmare of a world fallen to rust, flame blossoms from speeding war rigs, twisted metal and bodies crash and tumble -- the mayhem is viscerally, exhilaratingly real, making the glossy CGI heroics of "" Avengers: Age of Ultron"" look like a Saturday morning cartoon.",POSITIVE
"Apr 8, 2019"," Chaos reigns in George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), his long-awaited return to the world of his post-apocalyptic Ozplotiation franchise after a thirty-year absence. The budget and the actors may have changed, but this is clearly the evolution of the filmmaker’s crazed vision, arguably reaching the petrol-soaked Valhalla that he’s been striving for since the modest thrills of 1979’s Mad Max. It’s an injection of equal parts adrenaline and gasoline that tosses narrative out of the window and turns the action up to eleven. A flame-spewing guitarist is at the tip of a juggernaut at the vanguard of a fleet of spiked, hellish vehicles that make up the rolling army of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, the original film’s Toecutter). He’s the aptly grotesque warlord who breathes through a skull face-mask and keeps imprisoned a coterie of nubile breeding wives in the hope of a healthy heir. His general Imperator Furiosa (the hugely impressive Charlize Theron) has turned cloak, however, commandeering one of his War Rigs and liberating his wives. Immortan Joe and his War Boys (including Nicholas Hoult’s Nux) give chase across the baking Namib Desert – replacing the arid expanse of the Aussie Outback – after the runaways who have fellow ex-prisoner Max (Tom Hardy) riding shotgun. Far from being the set-up, that is effectively the entire plot. For Fury Road is that rare thing, an incredibly lean and gloriously overblown actioner. The acrobatics lie not in storytelling or in theme, but in the lurching crunch and twisted steel of high-octane vehicular mayhem. And the flames, oh the flames. Every pursuing wagon or War Boy decked in tribal paint and cultish zeal that Furiosa and Max manage to stave off is sent flipping and burning into the sand in spectacular fashion. Nothing is too much, and whilst there is the danger that some will find the unremitting havoc tiresome, Miller’s endless innovation keeps things fresh despite the surrounding wasteland. Max’s position as bystander, foregrounding Theron’s kick-ass heroine, also feels like a cool breeze in the stifling landscape. It may not a unanimous home run – there are still lingering shots of Joe’s scantily-clad harem for eye candy – but it’s certainly hurtling in the right direction. With close-cropped hair and painted with oil, Theron is the beating heart of the film and Furiosa’s character provides the picture with its less literal momentum. Hardy plays Max with typical tough-guy impassivity, grunting his way through the vast majority of the proceedings. There are no witty one-liners – in fact, one could almost compare it to a silent film were it not so deafeningly loud. But that is ultimately what Fury Road is all about. Sound and fury at 100 mph, and it’s one hell of a ride.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2019","In Mad Max: Fury Road, the ""strong female characters"" are notable specifically for their aversion to violence.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2019"," Thirty years has now passed since we last saw Max Rockatansky on the road. The last time we saw him, the character was portrayed by Mel Gibson, whose performance in the original trilogy was well-received among fans and critics alike. George Miller had done an incredible job directing this action packed franchise. After three decades, George Miller decided to come back for the fourth installment and I’m very glad he did. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, Mad Max: Fury Road follows the dangerous adventures of Max Rockatanksy, a lone survivor on the edge of his sanity who only relies on himself. Early in the movie, Max gets captured by a group of survivors lead by the tyrant Immortan Joe, a man who has enslaved the same people who worship him. A series of events lead Max to pair up with Charlize Theron’s Furiosa, an amazing female character who might arguably be considered the main character of the movie. The two end up being chased in the desert by Immortan Joe’s army which takes us into the main storyline. Just as any fan of the franchise would expect, this movie is action-packed. As a matter of fact, it can be considered one giant, epic action sequence. What’s surprising is that Fury Road’s storyline never gets neglected. Most action movies, especially summer blockbusters, have a tendency to suffer from a lack of development in their storytelling. Among its many strong points, Mad Max: Fury Road manages to develop its characters as well as introduce different story arcs at a very fast pace. All of that while blowing up cars, blasting old school rock music and giving the audience some incredible one liners. Tom Hardy also gives an incredible performance, considering that Max Rockatansky is not a very talkative character and that most of his lines consist of a maximum of five or six words. Charlize Theron also manages to steal the show as Furiosa, a character so loved by the audience that the studio is currently in talks to get her own spin off movie on the road (no pun intented). Although an argument can be made that its charm resides in its violence, gore and vulgarity, I wouldn’t recommend Mad Max: Fury Road to the squeamish.",POSITIVE

"Jan 23, 2019"," The restart – saying reboot would be a disservice to the film’s creativity – of the 1979-1985 trilogy that featured a cinematic journey to the post-apocalyptic lunatic fringe is an expertly crafted action film that is taken to another level by the surprising depth of humanity, particularly from Charlize Theron. Tom Hardy, taking Mel Gibson’s former role, plays the title character who gets caught up in a chase between cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and one of his War Rig drivers Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) after she kidnaps his five wives – selected for their breeding. Furiosa is hoping to take the girls to safety in her homeland but must enlist the help of Max when Joe recruits his entire army to stop her and get his wives back. Director and co-writer George Miller, who did the previous three films, does a great job of making “Fury Road” a stand-alone entity in the franchise. One doesn’t need to see any of the previous three films to appreciate the craftsmanship in the creation of this world and the elaborate chase sequences that feature some spectacular stunts and well-choreographed battles. Mad Max might be on the marquee, but this is Furiosa’s movie thanks to Theron. With her head shaven and a stump for a left arm, Theron is in complete kick-ass mode here, an almost motherly approach to protecting the wives that gives the movie a heart and soul. It is perhaps the best female heroine in an action film since Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley in the “Aliens” franchise. Also this week is “Pitch Perfect 2” (B), the follow-up to the 2012 surprise hit that goes back to the well a lot — basically taking the strengths of the original and finding ways to do it again. It’s a risk that hasn’t worked in sequels to movies like “The Hangover,” but the calculated risk pays off here with enough laughs and music to satisfy fans of the original. “Pitch Perfect 2” picks up with the Barden Bellas (a female acappella group at a fictional Barden college) on top of the world – three-time defending national champions and touring throughout the U.S. When a performance for the president takes an unexpected turn, the group is pulled from competition, and the only way to be reinstated for future competitions is by winning the world championship. The story is really secondary to the characters and music, with the talented cast – including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow — all returning. Kendrick’s Beca is still charming – even if the plot forces a conflict that seems to serve as a roadblock just for the sake of conflict. I’m not really a fan of Wilson and was afraid her role would be expanded to an annoyance level here, but she works in small doses. There are several new faces – including Hailee Steinfeld as the group’s newest member – and a few fun cameos, but the biggest addition is Elizabeth Banks taking the helm behind the camera. Banks shows poise and confidence as a first-time director and accentuates its strengths. The musical numbers zip, and the one-liners come fast and furious, but Banks reels it all in to a satisfying concoction that fans of the original will surely enjoy. “Pitch Perfect 2” is rated PG-13 for innuendo and language and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 12 and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow.",POSITIVE

“My name is Max.”

Those are both the first and final words spoken by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth chapter in George Miller’s post-apocalyptic mythology. Max doesn’t say much in Fury Road, partly due to circumstances–a metal grate attached to his face, or intense car chase sequences not suitable for small talk–but mostly due to his character: he is a man of great action and few words. His weary-but-sharp eyes reveal much of the complicated soul inside this weathered road warrior.
 Those are both the first and final words spoken by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth chapter in George Miller’s post-apocalyptic mythology. Max doesn’t say much in Fury Road, partly due to circumstances–a metal grate attached to his face, or intense car chase sequences not suitable for small talk–but mostly due to his character: he is a man of great action and few words. His weary-but-sharp eyes reveal much of the complicated soul inside this weathered road warrior. Max is quickly caught up in circumstances beyond his control, captured by a marauding gang from the Citadel, a desert butte-turned-fortress ruled by the depraved Immortan Joe, a disturbing villain who has set himself up as a deity ruling over the War Boys–his gang–and the suffering crowds below his elevated stronghold. When one of Joe’s best warriors/drivers, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), takes off with a war rig and his harem of wives used for breeding, it sets off the chase sequence which makes up the bulk of the film. Essentially, Fury Road is an extended chase sequence, with Furiosa and Co. on the run from Joe’s War Boys, various vehicular gangs, and the desert environment itself. Ever the loner, Max finds himself on the side of Furiosa and the liberated women in their search for a hope and redemption in a new, greener home.
 I don’t often make such expansive claims, but I’ll do so here: Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the top 10 action films I’ve ever seen, and even a significant, historic addition to the action pantheon, fitting nicely alongside Die Hard, Hard Boiled, and Terminator 2 as action films that will stand the test of time as influential and groundbreaking. The design, the art direction, the choreography, the cinematography, the story, the world-building–every aspect of Fury Road is exceptional and valuable. There’s not a single wasted scene, and this is the epitome of the motto “show, not tell.” Fury Road is incredibly cinematic, a visual smorgasbord both beautiful and harsh in its palette. The performances are outlandish where they need to be, but often are quietly affecting, especially Theron as Furiosa. She truly is the star of the film, a powerhouse of femininity and strength, and a perfect partner in survival with Max. Filmmaker George Miller can move quickly from elaborate overhead shots of the desert landscape, to intense and gritty action moments alongside the vehicles, to intimate close-ups of the human face, particularly the eyes. This visual rhythm makes Fury Road both intimate and sweeping in scope–it’s both ridiculously huge, and authentically accessible.
 The best word to describe Mad Max: Fury Road is exceptional: uncommon, atypical, remarkable, freakish, outstanding, unique, special. I still cannot believe a Hollywood studio would pay to make this, sending movie stars and inane vehicles into the desert to get blown up. To put it bluntly, Fury Road is batsh*t crazy in the best way possible. Example: one vehicle in Immortan Joe’s war party is essentially a stack of amps and speakers carrying four enormous drums and a blind maniac strapped by bungee cords who plays a flame-throwing electric guitar. If that sounds bizarre, yet intriguing…well, this is Mad Max, a steampunk-meets-Revelation action flick. Also, in a film genre where women are typically relegated to being sex objects or sidekicks–the recent Avengers: Age of Ultron hullabaloo is indicative of this propensity–Fury Road gives women agency, character, significance, and intelligence, all while retaining their femininity. Furiosa and Max are peers and partners; their relationship is no budding romance, but instead is marked by a growing care, empathy, and even friendship that compels Max to remain at Furiosa’s side through thick and thin. And he’s at her side, not the other way around.
 The Mad Max films are unique as post-apocalyptic action narratives, and I appreciate how Max is always the reluctant protagonist, a wounded person reeling more from his personal tragedy than the world gone to hell. In each Mad Max film, he’s caught up in circumstances where it initially has little or no agency to cause significant change, but eventually accepts his role in the narrative as someone able to heal and save others, even if he cannot save himself. He’s never looking for trouble or on some mission; he’s just wandering this world of fire and blood, angry and dejected, until some larger communal struggle pulls him into its center and he becomes a hesitant-but-eventually-willing savior. The Mad Max films remind us we can never survive and wholly live entirely in isolation. Max always ends up in some sort of community and embraced. True life beyond mere survival can only be experienced in the context of relationship. Yet despite the significant of community, Max also reminds us that the wilderness-both literal and spiritual–is often a lonely place. These deserts of personal pain are normative, and even healthy to navigate alone. Max is a man who has experienced great personal pain and trauma; he is the walking wounded. Max’s journey towards healing becomes an ongoing dialogue between solitude and communal life. As he embraces community to liberate and redeem those who are lost, he, too, finds healing and redemption.
 I don’t think it’s an accident that Max is a “blood bag” to those who are dying in Fury Road, a universal donor whose very existence in this world of death can bring about restoration and new life. Fury Road is a sort of “reversed exodus” story, the movement of a small band of liberated people who end up returning to their place of captivity in order to start afresh. They discover the home they seek is right where they started, but only when that home is freed from tyranny and depravity. For Max and Furiosa, the only way to truly go home is through the long journey into the wilderness, akin to Walter Brueggeman’s spirituality of the Psalms and its movement from orientation to disorientation to new orientation. Then the cycle continues, spiraling into greater depths as individuals and communities experience both great loss and hope. Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrilling picture of this spiritual cycle, as well as the best action film of the year (perhaps the decade).

"Nov 12, 2018"," George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road is spectacular – a cacophony of automotive carnage unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen. Miller delivers a blistering piece of action cinema – you can almost smell the grease and oil seeping through the sun drenched, sandy vistas. The director builds on the post apocalyptic world of his previous Mad Max movies, upping the scope and making the desolate wasteland an even deadlier place to live. Tom Hardy slips into Mel Gibson’s battered leathers as Max Rockatansky, the former cop haunted by the death of his family who now roams the cursed earth looking for solace. Max is hunted, captured and hung up to be the ‘blood bank’ for Immortan Joe’s (Hugh Keays-Byrne) War Boys. Joe is a twisted despot who rules his Citadel with oppression and fear, using his own religion to keep his people in check. He goes on the warpath when his trusted Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives off to freedom with Joe’s five enslaved wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee Kershaw and Courtney Eaton). Max and Furiosa collide and form an alliance that will see them search for redemption along the Fury Road. There’s a primal essence to Fury Road that makes it stand out from the many plastic coated, CGI filled blockbusters of the 21st Century. George Miller might be looking to the future in Fury Road’s dystopian narrative but he’s infusing the whole thing with film-making techniques from the past. The magnificent stunt work and the glorious vehicular action must to be seen to be believed. Miller might be 70 years old but his understanding of composing action sequences is second to none. It’s even more impressive when you take into account that the majority of it was done without the use of computer effects. You can sense the danger in every frame – this mise en scene is filled with mayhem. Glorious mayhem. Performances are often disregarded in action movies but Fury Road features a winning pair in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy’s Max is bruised and battered from the get-go – he’s the engine that gets the film s moving but Theron is literally it’s driving force, infusing Furiosa with an energy and urgency which pushes Hardy’s Max into the passenger seat. Their dialogue is kept to a minimum but they’re able to deliver so much simply with their eyes. Hugh Keays-Byrne delivers a hugely memorable screen villain in Immortan Joe. He’s the type of bug screen bad guy that you don’t get anymore. He’s not two toned or complex – he’s just evil and he’s willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants. Nichola Hout’s offers support as Nux, an ADD-fuelled follower of Joe who gets caught up in Furiosa’s long drive to freedom. Mad Max: Fury Road is unlike any other Hollywood blockbuster and George Miller achieves the impossible by making an big budget action film that fails to play it safe in any way. Miller’s film is epic in scope and ambition and he has managed to deliver a film that may have pushed the limits of cinema to breaking point.",POSITIVE
"Nov 9, 2018",A welcome return by George Miller to the kind of anarchic action he hasn't directed in the three decades since Thunderdome.,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2018"," In what is possibly the biggest gap between instalments of a franchise, it’s been thirty years since Mad Max last rode across the wasteland in Beyond Thunderdome, but whilst original star Mel Gibson may now have retired the role, director of the original trilogy George Miller is still holding on at the grand age of 70. Miller has actually been planning Fury Road for over a decade now, with various false starts over the years and, even after getting the ball rolling (shooting began in 2012), some reshoots and a long post-production process have further delayed its release. But now Max is finally back, and goddamn was it bloody worth the wait.  Mad Max: Fury Road has more of a premise than a cohesive narrative, and what’s there is mainly to set up a series of action sequences. On first examination, this seems like a really bad idea but, much like the ragged machines the people of the wasteland drive, it works beyond all reasonable expectations. Once the wheels literally get rolling and things start going boom, everything clicks into place and the patchwork nature of the story becomes incredibly cohesive and durable. The pacing is expertly handled, weaving from set piece to set piece with just enough breathing space in-between the carnage. Though dialogue is sparse, Fury Road’s flawless handling of visual storytelling gets across everything you need with just raw emotions and reactions; you don’t need to be told what’s happening is crazy, it’s plainly obvious. The film hits every note possible, creating a film that is thrilling, funny, thought provoking, and even heart wrenching. No joke, I was close to tears near the end of this film, and any film that manages that is clearly doing its job at maximum efficiency. Though Gibson’s portrayal of Max will probably still be the de facto face of the character for generations to come, Tom Hardy’s interpretation certainly lives up to the legend. Much like his predecessor, Hardy’s Max is a man of few words and defines himself instead with his tough but fair attitude. His tragic back-story is only hinted at, the only real point where knowledge of the previous films may be helpful, but that only adds to the mystique of the character. But in many ways, the film doesn’t actually belong to Max himself. That honour falls to Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, and she knocks it out of the park. Furiosa’s past is equally vague and her dialogue clipped, but again we get more than enough just from Theron’s pitch-perfect performance. She commands the screen with nothing more than a determined glare and a badass prosthetic arm, and for stretches of the film you’ll forget that Max is even there…and that’s not a bad thing. Furiosa’s posse of runaway breeders (yes, that’s what they’re called in the movie) are just defined enough by distinct looks, personality and crazy names (one of them is called The Splendid Angharad. ‘Nuff said.), and the gang of gun-toting grannies they meet up with later are equally fun characters. In the midst of all the explosions and testosterone, Fury Road has a surprisingly strong feminist message. At its core, it’s a story about a group of women who are tired of being treated as objects and decide to fight back against their oppressors, and Max just happens to be along for the ride. Nicholas Hoult’s Nux adds a surprising amount of heart to the film, mainly because he goes through the biggest arc over the course of the story. Starting out as a devout worshipper of antagonist Immortan Joe (Keays-Bryne), his development from there is surprisingly touching and you’ll be rooting for the skull-faced nutter by the end. Immortan Joe himself is as ridiculous a villain as you’d expect from a Mad Max film; though not quite as memorable as the likes of Lord Humungous or Master Blaster, he is a vile and threatening foe with a cool look and an awesome voice, and that’s all you really need. As mentioned before, most of the attention has been paid on the spectacle of the film and it’s a risk that pays off with interest. There is not a single frame in Fury Road that is dull, no matter the situation. When cars aren’t flipping and guns aren’t firing, there’s always something to look at: the beautifully pristine desert landscape, the intricacies of the production and costume design, the gorgeous use of colour, or even just an interesting camera move or angle. DOP John Seale’s work here is just phenomenal, a true gem in his already long and stellar career, and it certainly puts the camerawork on almost all blockbusters to shame. Along with the cinematography, the editing is excellently attuned, cutting to increase impact but also allowing shots to hold when needed, as well as great use of both slow motion and sped-up footage. The score by Junkie XL is a monster befitting of this movie, combining metal, rock, electronic and orchestral music to craft a soundscape that accentuates the action unfolding onscreen, rounding out this impeccably crafted piece of movie magic. Mad Max: Fury Road is an adrenaline shot of filmmaking from start to finish. Its unorthodox approach to storytelling eschews traditional structure and pacing to craft a tale in a new and exciting way, relying on pure imagery to convey its bombastic narrative. The characters are drawn with broad but striking strokes, and you’ll be strongly connected to them despite most of them barely uttering a word. The action sequences are some of the best in recent cinema history, avoiding all the clichés and failures of the genre to create a rollercoaster experience both in terms of thrills and emotion. It’s like an insane 80’s B-movie, but one made with thought, effort, and enough of a budget to match its deranged aspirations. After it was all over, all I wanted to do was turn back around and experience it again. I cannot recommend this movie enough, so get out to your local cinema and support this movie with your hard-earned cash. It doesn’t just deserve your time. It demands it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2018"," Like a sublime dieselpunk opera scored for blood, fire, guns and accompanied by an orchestra of insanely tricked-out vehicles, Mad Max: Fury Road roars to life in a breathless, relentless two hours of sheer lunatic joy. It isn’t just the best action film of the summer. It isn’t just the best action film of 2015. It may be the best action film of the decade.  Tom Hardy fills the worn, leather boots of Max Rockatansky this time, filling in for a too-old and definitely-too-crazy Mel Gibson. Max finds himself swept up in the mission of Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a lieutenant to wasteland warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Furiosa has gone rogue, taking with her Joe’s Wives, whose health and fertility are assets more valuable than the clean water source that Joe lords over. Her goal is a pseudo-legendary Green Place, a land untouched by the nuclear apocalypse that turned the world into an endless desert.  What on its surface looks to be a two-hour car chase sequence is, in actuality, the most efficient, masterful and critical-hit kind of narrative. The dialogue is sparse, and what’s there is as lean and bare as the landscape. The true narrative of the film is found in the visuals, in the space between words, and the actions of the characters. Even during quiet moments, there is a palpable tension. It’s a perfect reflection of a world where, as Max’s opening voiceover narrates, there is only the instinct to survive. The man behind the world of Mad Max, director/co-writer George Miller, presents a meticulously-detailed world of which Fury Road is only a small part. While ostensibly a reboot of the original Max trilogy, it also doesn’t directly contradict anything from those films, and it fits very well in the exponential progression of its predecessors. Each film builds on the structure of the one before it in a natural growth, and the latest entry is no exception. Miller is as confident and assured here as he has ever been, and it’s clear this is his vision and his alone.  Narrative and world-building is all well and good, but a Mad Max film lives and dies on its diesel-burning set pieces, and Fury Road has those in abundance. From vehicles covered in iron spikes to Joe’s towering war drum caravan (psychotic guitarist whose instrument belches flame included), this is every bit a gear-head’s post-apocalyptic fever dream. The vehicle design in and of itself is something close to genius. Like the other components of the film, nothing here is extraneous, and not a single punch is pulled nor gratuitous. Nearly all of the effects are practical, with CGI only coming in to enhance the already spectacular stunts. It puts nearly every superhero film to shame. Thor may be fighting cosmic enemies, but he’s doing it in the green screen comfort of an air-conditioned studio. There’s something primal and hypnotic to the chase scenes, a brutal grace with a flow and a language all its own that could never be replicated by a computer. Even more striking, and many times more impactful, is the feminine power in the film’s story. In a cinematic landscape where Wonder Woman can’t escape development hell and Black Widow can’t get an even share of a billion-dollar franchise, the female-heavy cast of Fury Road seems downright revolutionary. Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is, of course, a total badass. That was made clear right away in the first trailers. But the Wives are no wilting flowers, either, and eventually Furiosa’s brigade is joined by a group of women warriors led appropriately enough by a character named Valkyrie. This story actually belongs to Furiosa and the Wives; Max just happens to be in it. In fact, aside from Max and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of Joe’s War Boys, there are almost no truly sympathetic male characters in the cast. Which isn’t to say that Max isn’t welcome company, mind you. Tom Hardy is a perfect Max, so well-suited for the role that he actually makes Mel Gibson seem miscast. He seems like a more serious Max than Gibson ever was, and he doesn’t seem to wink at the camera nearly as much. Hardy is very much in tune with the deadpan black comedic subtext of Miller’s campaign. Max is introduced to us as he chomps down on a two-headed lizard, which is humorous and horrifying in equal measures. Best of all, Hardy comes without any…shall we say…real-world baggage that would distract from the role. For all intents and purposes, he IS Max.  And, like Hardy, there is nothing in this film that is out of tune. Every part comes together seamlessly, even furiously, to create an action symphony so perfect that it only comes around once every few years. Like the propulsive, orchestra-and-electronic score by Junkie XL, this is a film that is both raw and refined, heavy and exhilarating. Miller has created nothing less than a masterpiece of enthralling cinematic mayhem.",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2018"," The film is set several years after a series of catastrophic worldwide events caused the downfall of civilization in the year 2060 AD.  A desert community (named the Citadel) is run by tyrannical leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toe-Cutter of the first Mad Max film) because he controls the entire civilization’s water supply. One of his Imperator’s, named Furiosa (Charlize Theron, at her most bad-ass), breaks off from a routine guzzoline (the film’s version of gasoline) run with Joe’s Five Wives stowed away in an attempt to escape his clutches. Along the way, they cross paths with Max (Tom Hardy), a former highway patrolman who is now being used as a universal blood bag for Joe’s army, nicknamed the War Boys. In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that I have not seen any of the other Mad Max films, so this review comes from a complete Mad Max virgin. Once I realized Fury Road would be unrelated to the previous films in the franchise, I wanted to go in with a completely blank slate and zero expectations. For a review of the film from an experiences Mad Max fan, check out our very own Jonathan Barkan’s equally glowing review. Mad Max: Fury Road is unlike any film I have ever seen. Essentially an extended chase sequence, there are set pieces in the film that legitimately had my mouth hanging wide open. Miller was present at the screening I was at and stated that roughly 90% of the effects in the film are practical (he also said that eight cameras were destroyed during filming). With the exception of one heinous meant-for-3D use of CGI in one of the the final scenes of the film, it shows. What Miller was able to capture on screen is nothing short of a miracle, and truly shows off his talents as a director. Credit must also go to John Seale, whose cinematography is mesmerizing. While I was unable to see the film in IMAX 3D, I can say that a regular 2D showing is sufficient and doesn’t detract from the intended experience. Also great is that the film does not pander to its audience. The film kicks into high gear from the opening frame, with no time for exposition.  There is no opening scroll informing the audience what happened to the world and the state civilization is in now. There are no characters unrealistically explaining what is going on to other characters (since everyone on screen already knows). We are dropped right into the middle of this dystopian society and hit the ground running. Speaking of dialogue, it would be interesting to see the script for this one, as there is little dialogue in the film. The acting is uniformly great from everyone involved. Hardy is perfectly serviceable as our stoic hero, but the show really belongs to Theron. No one ever doubted her abilities as an actress, but she taps into a carnal brutality here that is captivating. The whole film is a marvel to behold, but the final act of the film manages to best everything that came before it in a spectacular sequence involving the War Boys swinging on poles (a tease of this was glimpsed in the final trailer for the film). Even though it has a 2-hour running time, Fury Road feels much shorter. This is one of the highest compliments any film can receive. I didn’t want it to end and I can’t wait to go back to see it again once it gets released this weekend. Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie I have seen so far this year, and I doubt anything else coming out will be able to top it. I won’t be able to praise it enough, so do yourself a favor and get yourself to the theater this weekend and see it. You won’t regret it! Officially announced by Blumhouse and Lionsgate earlier this month, a reboot of The Blair Witch Project is currently in the works, which will be the third follow-up to the original found footage horror classic that changed the game back in 1999. In the wake of the announcement, the original creators and stars have each issued joint statements this weekend. The Blair Witch Project was created by filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez – along with Haxan Films creative partners Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello – back in the 1990s, with stars Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard heading out into the woods of Maryland to conjure up horror magic together. The actors largely improvised their performances and even used their real names in the movie, with the film’s clever viral marketing campaign leading many to believe that they weren’t actually actors in a movie, but rather real people who truly went missing out in the woods. All this to say, Donahue, Williams and Leonard are collectively a huge part of why The Blair Witch Project became a pop culture phenomenon, and all these years later they’re looking for some recognition from Lionsgate, the current rights holders of the iconic property. As Joshua Leonard first explained in a Facebook post on April 11, “I’m so proud of our little punk-rock movie, and I LOVE the fans who keep the flames burning. But at this point, it’s 25 years of disrespect from the folks who’ve pocketed the lion’s share (pun intended) of the profits from OUR work, and that feels both icky and classless.” 1. Retroactive + future residual payments to Heather, Michael and Josh for acting services rendered in the original BWP, equivalent to the sum that would’ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made. 2. Meaningful consultation on any future Blair Witch reboot, sequel, prequel, toy, game, ride, escape room, etc… , in which one could reasonably assume that Heather, Michael & Josh’s names and/or likenesses will be associated for promotional purposes in the public sphere. Note: Our film has now been rebooted twice, both times were a disappointment from a fan/box office/critical perspective. Neither of these films were made with significant creative input from the original team. As the insiders who created the Blair Witch and have been listening to what fans love & want for 25 years, we’re your single greatest, yet thus-far unutilized secret-weapon! 3. “The Blair Witch Grant”: A 60k grant (the budget of our original movie), paid out yearly by Lionsgate, to an unknown/aspiring genre filmmaker to assist in making their first feature film. This is a GRANT, not a development fund, hence Lionsgate will not own any of the underlying rights to the project. “As we near the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, our pride in the storyworld we created and the film we produced is reaffirmed by the recent announcement of a reboot by horror icons Jason Blum and James Wan. “While we, the original filmmakers, respect Lionsgate’s right to monetize the intellectual property as it sees fit, we must highlight the significant contributions of the original cast — Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. As the literal faces of what has become a franchise, their likenesses, voices, and real names are inseparably tied to The Blair Witch Project. Their unique contributions not only defined the film’s authenticity but continue to resonate with audiences around the world. If you’d like to support the cause, sharing and amplifying is the way to go. You’ll find the original post for Heather, Michael and Josh’s statement below, which can be shared to your feed.",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2018"," To say that George Miller has stepped up his game since he left us at Thunderdome would be far too mild a statement to open with. Mad Max: Fury Road is not just superior to everything in this franchise, as well as everything else Miller has ever directed. It’s among the most exhausting, thrilling, visceral action films ever made. Powerful, villainous white guys have ruined the planet by way of their greed for oil and their warmongering, and now they are sustaining their power by taking control of women’s reproductive systems. So, you know, pretty far-fetched. But Max doesn’t belong to any of these festering wounds called societies. He’s feral. Again. No telling how long it’s been since Max saved the kids from Aunty Entity, but he’s lost himself again, wandering the desert hunted by man and haunted by those he couldn’t save. Again Miller puts Max in a position to redeem himself by helping the vulnerable and pure survive this apocalyptic future. Mercifully, there are no children and no mullets this go-round. Unsurprisingly, the great Tom Hardy delivers a perfect, guttural performance as the road warrior. As his reluctant partner in survival, Charlize Theron is the perfect mix of compassion and badassedness. Hardy’s a fascinating, mysterious presence, but Theron owns this film. Like the first two films in this series, Fury Road wastes little time on dialogue or plotting. Rather, it is basically one long, magnificent car chase. Miller adorns every scene with the most astonishing, peculiar imagery and the vehicular action is like nothing you’ve ever seen. Miller’s magnificent action sequences keep the film from ever hitting the dragging monotony of his first two efforts in the series. While the characters remain as paper thin as they have been in every episode, the vast superiority of this cast from top to bottom guarantees that the marauding band’s excess and abandon are handled with genuine skill. Fury Road amounts to a film about survival, redemption and the power of the universal blood donor. Clever, spare scripting makes room for indulgent set pieces that astonish and amaze. There’s real craftsmanship involved here – in the practical effects, the pacing, the disturbing imagery, and the performances that hold it all together – that marks not just a creative force at the top of his game, but a high water mark for summer blockbusters.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 27, 2018"," After more than a decade of writing about movies, the Oscars, somehow, still raise a fire in me. I know I will be disappointed. I know there will be one or two wins that seem perfect, one or two speeches that surprise, just like I know that most of the lauded films will be about white men enduring something. I know the Oscars matter, on a business and cultural level, no matter what the Coen brothers — who’ve conveniently already earned a few — say. Winning is power and power is money, and money lets people decide which stories get told. This year’s stories are good stories but, by and large, they’re familiar, and made by familiar names. The most familiar story — the one about a young person falling in love and finding her way — is, in an odd twist, perhaps the most subversive of the lot for the way it respects that young woman’s ordinary existence. Life can be complicated enough when it’s just life — bear attacks, interplanetary stranding or not. It’s maybe funny to call The Martian a confinement film — dude’s got a whole planet to himself! — but Mark Watney (Matt Damon) lives inside a bubble, a rover or a spacesuit, without a lick of outdoor air. Entertaining and visually appealing though it is, The Martian lacks one key element: characters. Mark can be dry, funny and sarcastic, but everyone else gets single-note personalities: noble (Sean Bean); socially inept (the math guys); efficient (Chiwetel Ejiofor); tense (Kristen Wiig). As a story of survival, it works, but it’s hollow. Room is the opposite, as much a story of what comes after as a story of the terrible captivity of Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). A movie that improves on the novel on which it’s based is a rare bird — and Room is all the more rare, as Emma Donoghue wrote both. She chiseled her own novel into a film that understands “Will they escape?” is only half the question. Then what? How do you spend years confined and then go back to a world of cell phones, computers, cable news, open spaces, soccer balls? The Martian doesn’t ask about the aftermath. It doesn’t ask much of anything at all. Frankly, The Force Awakens should’ve taken the sci-fi slot, but it’s less concerned with science than it is with myth — and its mythology isn’t the kind the Academy cares for. What is The Revenant if not mythologizing? The astonishing man on a noble vengeance quest, pushed to extremes, part of a brutal world. While I disliked Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman, I can appreciate it if I squint and tilt my head until all the characters look like part of Riggan’s psyche. There’s no trick that makes The Revenant work like that. It’s an endurance test with beautiful cinematography and, to be fair, a notable nod to the terrible treatment of native people. We’re hardly lacking in movies about determined white men fighting their way through to something (see also: The Martian, There Will Be Blood, Gladiator). How have the filmmakers — and DiCaprio — so cleverly shifted the narrative around this film to make it mean something? It means that cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is a genius to have gotten some of those shots. It means that no one saw Valhalla Rising, another movie about men suffering, though with a change of weather and more hallucinogens. 
	On the flip side of everything — of climate, of gender, of theme — are the sweltering sands of Mad Max: Fury Road, a movie just as inventively filmed and edited, just as beautiful, and with so much more to say — about power, destruction, misogyny, freedom, fear and the world we live in. It’s by no means a perfect film, but it’s an action movie with a heart and a mind, built to do much more than just make you feel as if you’ve endured a visual pummeling.  The Big Short will leave you feeling mentally pummeled, and probably rather depressed. Smart, wry, cleverly playful in its anger, Adam McKay’s film about the corrupt banking system owes some of its palpable sense of rage to Ryan Gosling’s bitter voiceovers, and the delightful, peculiar moments at which the movie breaks the fourth wall. McKay and his cowriter, Charles Randolph (working from Michael Lewis’ nonfiction book), know that this is a lot of esoteric bullshit to take in, so at times the narrative stops, with celebrities explaining the finer points of mortgage bonds. Dizzying, biting, full of great performances, The Big Short is probably too smart to win an Oscar. And those two words — sturdy and sly — bring me to the last two best picture nominees, the ones with less high-gloss shine and media spin. Bridge of Spies is dramatic, to be sure, but Steven Spielberg can make this kind of movie while sleepwalking: smooth, smart, unsubtle in its interest in reminding us of the kind of people we can be. (It’s also here to remind us that Mark Rylance is brilliant and underused in film.) Bridge of Spies is unquestionably timely, concerned with how people can be more than their jobs, more than their families (well, white men can, anyway) and that a nation is only as good as its people. The grown-up, almost old-fashioned style of Spielberg’s latest shows a sure hand, but I miss the innovative Spielberg, the one who created aliens and adventures and freaking giant dinosaurs. This is the cinematic equivalent of the dad who grew up and got conservative — not socially, but in bearing and demeanor. 
Brooklyn is conservative on the surface, but when you scratch that period-piece façade, you find something rare in this batch of nominees: a beautiful, gently funny (bless every actress in those boarding house scenes) movie that takes the interior life of a young woman entirely seriously. As Eilis Lacey, Saoirse Ronan carries this film so splendidly that in any year that was not so utterly Brie Larson’s, it would be a crime not to give her every award; you can practically see her eyes changing colors with her moods. Brooklyn is also about America, and the mythology of coming here shares the screen with the lure of what you’ve left behind, the possibility of other lives that still tempt you, even if the shoes don’t fit. Director John Crowley has a sense of timing that gives every one of Brooklyn’s scenes a thoughtfulness; even a tiny role like that of Eilis’ department-store boss has layers of sympathy. Nothing melodramatic and terrible happens to Eilis, just life in all its 1950s colors and shapes. That such a moving film came out of such traditional shapes is magic in and of itself: This woman’s choices should be her own, then, now, always. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2018"," It’s been 30 years since George Miller’s last outing on the road with Mad Max. It can be hard to come back to a series so embedded in the cult film phenomena and have a leading man so iconic that dad’s the world over are crying battle cries of ‘NO ONE CAN EVER BE MEL GIBSON!!’ But somehow, Miller has managed to create one of the best straight-up action films of at least, the past decade. In the world of Mad Max, and in his own words, the only goal is to ‘survive’. Not stated in any particular time frame other than ‘sometime later’, violence is the way to survival, as shown in pretty much any dystopian movie, ever. The earth’s inhabitant’s have adapted, societies have been formed and the structure of yester-year has been forgotten, of course there is going to be anarchy and destruction; the entire basis of the original Mad Max trilogy. In this world, you cannot exist without violence and destruction; people born into this world find joy in the chaos, particularly the War Boys whose cries of ‘IMMORTAN’ and ‘WITNESS ME’ shrill through the cinema. We revel in their elation and gladly jump aboard the War Rig’s down the Fury Road. Cinema will always divulge the obscene and violent (that personally I can’t get enough of) and I don’t believe that will change soon, but when a film is directly commenting on patriarchy and social structure, how can we complain?! Outside of the chase scenes, the ideas behind Fury Road are rooted in patriarchy. Despite the earth’s current state, a leader has emerged to exploit and use the people of the Citadel; Immortan Joe. Immortan Joe believes himself to be some form of deity, the man to save the people; he exploits different social groups for his own gain and controls access to water, food, milk and the gene pool, which has led to extreme deformities in his people. His ‘War Boys’ serve him, and deal with the action and the War Pups turn the cogs of the water wheel. The War Boys believe he has come to save them, that if they do his bidding he will grant them access to Valhalla (from Norse mythology), they are bred and rewarded for war, so I can forgive them for taking enjoyment in such acts. Immortan Joe is also a class A misogynist, he dabbles in sex slavery and keeps the most beautiful women in one room so he can use and abuse them and gain a male heir. In the case of ‘wife’ Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), she even experiences a kind of Stockholm syndrome; attempting on numerous occasions to get back to Immortan where she believes she is safest. The reason dystopian movies are so great is because you can examine society in this way, you can break down these imaginary societies’ groups, see their motives and see the way they exploit different (if extreme), narratives, which can always been brought back to our current real-life society. Considering these traumatic events the five wives go through, there has also been much speculation about whether or not the film is ‘feminist’. For me, it’s a difficult task to solidly declare something ‘feminist’ or ‘not feminist’ because what might be empowering to one woman; may be downright offensive to another. My main criticism of the film as a whole was the lack of POC across the board and a few slurs (twice?). But what I’ve always admired, and will continue to praise, is someone who tries. Rome wasn’t built in a day and the film industry is not going to be bursting with varied characters of all ages, races, sexualities, genders and backgrounds in a day either. If we continue to praise and support movies that show some attempt and understanding then ‘up’ can be the only way, my friends. As someone very much in love with the ‘gun wielding chicks’ trope but also very tired of the Hunger Games led trope of ‘this woman is saving her world because she is special, and the reason she is special is because she’s a woman and that’s SO unlikely’, Fury Road stood out to me in a film series usually so heavily drowned in testosterone. What was so interesting to me was that, George Miller could have set the plot as Max escaping from the Citadel and for some reason takes the brides with him too, but no, Miller chose a woman character to carry out the task. Imperator Furiosa may be my favourite female character in a LONG time, Charlize Theron is phenomenal as the one-armed War Rig driver (representation of disabled bodies, yes?!), her determination, clear passion and teary eyes all through the first half are forever embedded in my mind and her anguish at the ‘Green Place’ is up there in the most iconic shots in the film. Furiosa’s authority is never questioned by Max, her abilities as a woman are never doubted, and her abilities as a disabled woman are never doubted. Like anyone encountering another human in this barren wasteland, Max’s only hostility is upon their meeting when he’s trying to save his own life; the fact that even a lone ranger such as Max can respect women in a society where people kill, rape and blow each other up for kicks is quite a feat for your standard flashy blockbuster. To the disappointment of many male fans and the elation of many female ones, the entire plot of Fury Road focuses around Furiosa’s transportation of Immortan’s Five Wives to the ‘Green Place’. Whilst a film discussing a woman single handily (literally) ending a sex slave trade in a never ending chase scene is completely thrilling, the brides themselves were pretty one-dimensional, a shame because the slight hints of their personality we did see were really interesting. Toast (Zoe Kravitz) clearly favoured herself as the next Furiosa, keen to handle weapons and get amongst the action, Capable (Riley Keough) showed great compassion for Nux, The Dag (Abbey Lee) was very spiritual but the most striking image in the entire 120 minutes for me was Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) throwing her pregnant body out of a car in a high speed chase to protect Furiosa, these women are not just pretty faces, they have individual personalities and what Miller managed to communicate in what he described as a ‘silent’ movie (relying little on dialogue and mainly on implying) was more than adequate. The criticism of the wives’ beauty from viewers is rooted in misogyny; they are not too ‘model-like’ to be in this dystopia. Immortan chose these women specifically for their beauty, a man still practising the euro-centric beauty standards we hold currently. They were locked away and kept slim for breeding purposes; he clearly believes that keeping these women separate will eliminate the deformities in the gene pool. The first shot we see of the wives is also up for comment, what some say is a male-gaze doused magazine spread, I personally find to be an exclamation of freedom. The girls hose down in a desert, almost like a mirage. We see a close-up of the girls removing chastity belts, emblazoned with Immortan’s skull emblem, a sign of his property. With the breaking of the belts, the girls’ attitudes change, Abbey Lee Kershaw kicks hers away in a ‘fuck you’ to her previous life.  I also enjoyed the older female, their hardened faces and deep wrinkles telling a thousand stories, they had quick wit and a fast mouth, revelling in the thought of a new battle to face, these women have survived for so long, their thinking almost mimics that of the War Boys; killing for fun. The attitudes of Fury Road seek solace in women’s liberation and don’t shun or mock it. Miller wanted to make a straight up action film, utilising the bigger budget and technologies 2015 has to offer, it’s excusable to me that the backstories run a little dry. The Mad Max franchise has been this way since its beginning, iconic characters are created and loved with just so much as a name; The Coma Doof warrior has already been solidified as a fan-favourite character from this film, and we know so little about him, his electrifying flamethrower metal sound-tracking the film and a distinct warning call for Immortan and the War Boys’ arrival. The thumping drums and booms amp up the film on a whole other level, something I haven’t felt since Interstellar. The way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another War Party was a sonic experience I need to see more of, and would happily sit and read an entire novella on every last character I seen on screen. This is what Miller has given us, a world so rich in detail and drenched with love that we can’t possibly comprehend the entire scale of the thing; I can only hope that Miller takes the critical success of Fury Road and adapts the same approach for his next few films. I can’t wait to see more of the rich comic book type cinematography even Zack Snyder would be envious of, and Tom Hardy’s ridiculously perfect pout. With an overall consensus of ‘THIS IS THE BEST THING I’VE EVER SEEN’ I hope the rest of the action movie world are quaking in their boots from the madness. Chloe Leeson is 19 and from the north of England (the proper north). She believes Harmony Korine is the future and is pretty sure she coined the term ‘selfie central’. She doesn’t like Pina Coladas or getting caught in the rain but she does like Ezra Miller & Dane DeHaan a whole lot. Her favourite films are The Beach, Lords of Dogtown and Into the Wild. But DON’T talk to her about Paranormal Activity. She rants @kawaiigoff.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2018"," There’s plenty of motion, stunts, explosions, visual effects and wonderfully weird post-apocalyptic images, characters and design to keep most reasonably minded filmgoers happy as they munch on their popcorn, sip on their drinks and think about their grocery list. The original Mad Max trilogy – and the first two films especially – are rightly regarded as standard setting, game-changing classics. Yet while it bears the brand name and tries very hard, Fury Road can’t quite honour the legacy of its forebears. It’s fine B-grade mulch, but it’s certainly no masterpiece. The new adventure finds Max (played by the ubiquitous, and somewhat miscast Tom Hardy rather than the original’s Mel Gibson) a loner with a suped-up car in a wasteland filled with motorised marauders. His only purpose is to survive. At first he is captured by the manic minions of King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, aka Toecutter from the first film, but not playing the same character) before joining forces with renegade truck driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron). A post-apocalyptic feminist warrior with a marvellously rendered artificial arm, she’s done the dirty on Joe, the evil overlord of the region, by stealing his five young slave wives and speeding them off across the desert to a new land and a new life. Max helps them traverse the sands, with their enemies in hot pursuit. When vehicles aren’t kicking up dust trails and crashing against each other at high speed, the soundtrack throbs anxiously as Max and Furiosa negotiate their next move, ever-wary of the giant vehicles in the distant heat haze heading their way. Especially impressive are the bizarre vehicle designs, which look like beautiful mechanical mutations, or artworks on wheels. One item even looks like a distant relative of the spiked VW from Peter Weir’s 1974 film The Cars That Ate Paris. Given how distinctive and inventive the action scenes in the original films were, it is disappointing that so much of the mechanical bump-and-grind here lacks any real spark or originality. Men fly about on poles, gunfire is exchanged, people scream and the mandatory fireballs send vehicles twirling into mid-air – an exhausted action-movie cliche that really needs to be retired. And for all his supposed genius, original director George Miller has slavishly adopted the standard editing rhythm of the standard 21st century tentpole movie, with a cut every second or so. Even Michael Bay holds shots longer. So what is the film trying to do? In a way, the answer is in the film’s prolonged chases, which serve as a metaphor for the film itself. Whereas the original trilogy set the pace in the early 1980s and influenced everything from The Terminator to Waterworld, Fury Road is more a case of Mad Max trying to catch up and prove itself worthy. The brand once set the bar. Now it is trying to reach the bar set by others. And as moderately exciting and frame-filling as its explosive set-pieces are, they don’t quite make it. There’s nothing in Fury Road, for instance, that matches the brilliance of the chases in Matrix Reloaded, To Live and Die in LA or even Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof. Since the fourth one in 2009, the F&F series has established itself as the dominant brand for automotive mayhem through its house style of elaborate stunts and preposterous, digitally-assisted action. Sworn to continually top the previous film, they are full of kinetic images and ideas we’ve never seen before. Fury Road can’t make that boast. The very cleverly edited trailer certainly builds that expectation, but the prangs and demolition on show are, at the end of the day, pretty standard. There’s certainly nothing that tops what we saw in the finale of Mad Max 2, which still stands as the franchise’s golden hour. Like so many blockbusters, Mad Max Fury Road is essentially a two-act story stretched out to feature-length running time. With an unmotivated Max, the film feels dramatically hollow as it is only other people who compel him to act. He’s a cypher in the Wasteland with no real purpose. He only has a few scant lines of dry dialogue, but nothing as punchy as his classic line from Mad Max 2: “You wanna get outta here? You talk to me.” For the record, it’s not a reboot because it has flashbacks to the original films. Plus, as we all know too well by now, to reboot a franchise you need to have an origin story. This film simply drops us into the familiar post-apocalyptic world we left Max in at the end of Thunderdome. Might Fury Road have been better as a proper reboot? Perhaps. Was it a mistake to make a Mad Max film without Mel Gibson, who created the role? Perhaps. After all, you’d never make a Dirty Harry movie without Clint Eastwood. Gibson was involved with earlier plans for the fourth film, but after too many delays and the passage of time he eventually counted himself out. Just a thought, but how cool would it have been to have him play Max at age 60, still humping around the Wasteland, still fighting the scum, still angry. It would have given the enterprise the mythological heft and powerful sense of continuity that Fury Road lacks. It’s understandable how some audiences – presumably younger ones that did not grow up with the original films – might be a little suspicious of a franchise that tries firing up after being dormant so long. That was certainly the case with Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace. But as with that film, it’s likely that the anticipation, the legacy and the affection for the original films will earn Fury Road a lot of free passes from forgiving filmgoers – provided, of course, that there is more to come. And, of course, there is. Miller is planning more Mad Max films. He even has two screenplays completed, apparently. Let’s just hope he give Max a lot more to do the next time around than follow somebody else’s lead.
 With its tongue pressed firmly in its cheek, A Royal Night Out is a prettily decorated, politely outrageous piece of cinematic confectionery, a carefully balanced, souffle-light slice of historical fiction that has a great deal of fun playing with the truth by dropping two real-life princesses into a fictitious teen romp. The gossamer of fact upon which this merrily mounted lark is based is that on the evening of 8 May 1945 – aka VE Day, the end of the war in Europe – the young, radiantly beautiful future Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) and her high-spirited, if not-quite-so-beautiful, never-to-be-Queen sister Margaret (Bel Powley) talked their parents Queen Elizabeth (Emily Watson) and King George VI (Rupert Everett) into letting them out of Buckingham Palace – where they’ve been cloistered – and into the celebrating throng. Accompanied by two of the British army’s most incompetent officers, the girls are soon off the leash and on their own, drinking, dancing and mixing it with real people. It’s an eventful evening of character-building adventure: Elizabeth is on a mission to gauge the true mood of the people and to see how the King’s radio speech has gone down. Hooking up with an angry soldier Jack (Jack Reynor) who is absent without leave, Elizabeth also goes through a reality check as she has her beliefs challenged and witnesses the scale of loss London has suffered. There is much running, yelling, drinking and falling over, chiefly in the seedier parts of town, but while director Julian Jarrold – a period film specialist with Becoming Jane, Brideshead Revisited, The Girl, All the King’s Men and Great Expectations – effectively works up a wild-party vibe, he knows not to cross certain lines. After all, he’s toying with the reputation of real Royals. The film is plently of fun – seen with a cinema full of senior filmgoers, every comic beat hit its mark – and while it’s not intended to do so, A Royal Night Out will no doubt deeply irritate those republicans who would rather not see the royals celebrated. The 70th anniversary of VE Day has just ticked over; the Queen is more popular than ever; Prince William and Princess Kate have just had a kid – a girl, Charlotte, no less – and the new generation of young, attractive, media savvy Royals appear to be bringing a new generation of supporters into the royalist fold. The director swears all this is very happy coincidence. No doubt it is, but it’s also very telling that, this deep into the 21st century, a film about the teenage shenanigans of two princesses would have any appeal at all. And along with The King’s Speech and The Queen, A Royal Night Out could well be part of the start of a process of mythologising and humanising the cinematic image of the Queen. After all, it’s happened with every other monarch, and this one has certainly done enough to warrant the enduring attention of filmmakers. On the news that they’re going to have a baby, an estranged couple, Eve (Camille Keenan) and Charlie (Dustin Clare), walk about the earthquake-shattered city of Christchurch trying to piece together their relationship, hoping the other will compromise enough. Deftly directed by Kiwi Michelle Joy Lloyd, Sunday is a modest, neatly etched character study of two people in transition. Clearly inspired by the conversational style of Richard Linklater’s Sunrise trilogy, the film could have done with a few more ill-mannered arguments before hitting home with its touching finale.

Sunday has made a small but significant step into the history books by being the first film in Australia to be released simultaneously in cinemas and on a wide range of digital platforms. With this must come a new way of reviewing films with this release pattern. As a value-for-money person, this reviewer always considers the general cost of admission to a cinema and the associated bother when reviewing a new release, as they are always in cinemas. This does change when reviewing things for the home market, as the costs are lower while the convenience is greater. Therefore, something that might not be worth seeing in cinemas might nonetheless make for a better, more economical experience as a home release. And the experience of watching something at home is markedly different, with ambient noise, distractions and the ability to watch things on screens of varying sizes. In the case of Sunday, is this low-budget two-hander worth seeing in the cinema for about $20 a ticket? No. But seeing it for a few dollars via a digital platform, most definitely.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2018"," You don’t realize just how crappy most action movies are, until you see something like Mad Max: Fury Road — a movie in which there are no “action scenes” because the action pretty much never stops. And the film’s constant sense of violent motion is in the service of incredible imagery and transcendant moments. Lots of directors have tried to do what George Miller pulls off so astonishingly in Fury Road — the feeling that shit never stops blowing up, the intensity, and above all the sense that the heightened reality of comics and video games is finally appearing in live-action films. I’m thinking of Zack Snyder, Michael Bay, Robert Rodriguez and a few others.  But Mad Max: Fury Road is still in a class by itself. There are so many moments in this movie where I found myself saying, “Wow, I can’t believe I’m seeing this” — either because the visuals were so insane or so extreme, or just because there was intense beauty filling the frame. These moments, cumulatively, turn what could have been a run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic fight-chase-fight movie into something actually poignant and emotionally engaging — because your mind is flooded with so much insane imagery, you get opened up to the actually quite good performances by Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and others. In Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the same post-apocalyptic world that you’ll remember from The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, more or less. Everything has fallen apart, and there’s been some kind of ecological collapse — and in a modern twist, there’s not enough water, either. Max Rockatansky (Hardy) gets ensnared with a group of white-painted skull-faced assholes called the War Boys, led by the terrifying Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). And soon, Max is caught in the middle of a custody dispute between Immortan Joe and the insane shaved-headed Imperator Furiosa (Theron). Cue a lot of shit blowing up, crazy “war rig” trucks, people swinging through the air on big fishing rods dangling off of cars going 100 mph, and stunts that would make the Fast and Furious movies feel slow and sedated. I cannot emphasize enough that this movie almost never stops going — a huge amount of the film’s running length takes place on board moving vehicles. (In fact, this movie reminded me of nothing so much as Snow-Piercer, both in its focus on battles aboard a moving vehicle in an extreme environment, and in its heightened-reality, absurdist take on an apocalyptic world.) We’ve been judging action scenes by too low a standard: Can you tell what’s going on? Is the camera too shaky, or too blurry, or is the CG so cheap that you’re just seeing smudges? Are there quick cuts that keep you from following the moves? Or a bewildering mixture of too-tight close-ups and too-far wide shots? That’s like judging a gymnastics meet by the number of gymnasts who show up with broken ankles. Mad Max: Fury Road has action that’s easy to follow, but also incredibly overwhelming in the sheer insanity and complexity of what’s going on at any given moment. We’re talking about, basically, a two-hour truck joust. Miller uses techniques that I’ve seen overused elsewhere — like the “hard zoom” into the face of someone driving crazily — but here, they just add drama to an already oversaturated kinetic frame. The camera is constantly in motion as it tracks in on people crashing their vehicles and launching projectiles at each other.  Which brings me to the nut of what makes Fury Road such a unique theatrical experience. Miller uses the constant motion of the film to enhance its sense of scale (because duh, if you cover a lot of ground quickly, you reveal the true vastness of the landscape). Immortan Joe’s insane villain lair is huge, and so is his horde of unsafe drivers. And the land around them, most of all, is just massive — the untameable, unknowable desert plays a starring role in this movie, at least as much as the vehicles do. And the hugeness and terribleness of that bleak landscape makes the larger-than-life characters feel weirdly at home, even as it informs the movie’s key themes of trying to fill that dead void with something. After three previous Mad Max films, Miller understands that the post-apocalyptic story isn’t so much about the collapse of society’s institutions, but about what replaces them — and he’s fascinated by the twisted attempts to create a functioning society in the ruins of our own.  In a lot of ways, the Mad Max franchise belongs to the same subgenre as the Judge Dredd comics — it’s about a world that’s been laid waste, but also about the absurdity of surviving in that world. The heightened reality and bizarreness of both worlds is about holding up a mirror to show us how artificial and bizarre our own identities are, and then creating a new, extreme context where only ridiculous and psychotic selves make any sense.  What’s new in Fury Road is an obsession with fertility — one character carries around “heirloom” seeds, that stubbornly refuse to grow in this dead world. Immortan Joe counsels people dying in the desert not to become “addicted” to water. Immortan Joe’s most prized “possessions” are his breeders, four women whose existence is only aimed at carrying Immortan Joe’s babies. And the War Boys have an ideology built around death and birth — if they die in Immortan Joe’s service, they will be reborn. Even the perennial Mad Max concern with fuel is somewhat reinvented, because now it’s also about water, and the ability to create green. Agriculture is a collective enterprise, in which the individual has to become part of the collective, and so is human fertility, to some extent. So Fury Road is all about the rights of the individual in the face of the obsession with fertility — and in the end, this does become an overtly feminist issue. Imperator Furiosa and the “breeders” are fighting for their freedom, but also searching for an alternative vision of society that doesn’t see them as nothing but objects — without going into too much spoilery detail. Theron is the emotional linchpin of the movie, channeling so much intensity and grim humor, that she literally drives the story forward. Furiosa is one of the great action heroes, up there with Max himself, and Theron manages to put a lot of nuance and generosity into her. She carries most of the weight of the movie’s themes about self-determination, cult psychology and fertility, and it’s largely thanks to her world-weary performance that the movie can get overtly feminist without ever seeming preachy.  What makes Max unique in this world is that he has no ideology. Every other character in Fury Road voices an idea about how the world works, or what it all means — but Max’s opening voiceover says that he’s been reduced to just one thing: the desire to survive, at all costs. He believes in nothing, but he’s haunted by visions of the people whom he cared about in the past, whom he failed to save. Max spends most of the film listening to other people describe their complicated worldviews, with a mute shrug. He’s such a nihilist, he can’t even articulate his nihilism. Mad Max: Fury Road is like a really great rock concert, where you hold up your lighter until you burn your fingertips and you scream yourself hoarse and afterwards you feel like you’ve had a personal, beautiful mindfuck. This is one of the few movies I’ve ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in. The over-the-top, stylized, absurdist aesthetic is pushed to its limit (and a lot of the film’s dialogue is frankly ridiculous), but the ultimate result is so extreme, and married to such beautiful imagery, that it becomes a great work of art.",POSITIVE
"Apr 30, 2018"," A children’s movie about how great science is, The Martian has a pragmatic message for budding astronauts: you solve one problem, then another, and see if you survive. The film’s obsession with years-long plans imparts a Soviet feel to the space program depicted, but its sunny optimism keeps the movie all-American. Not once do we believe The Martian will end with a shot of Matt Damon’s skeleton half-buried in sand. Maybe the film is so bright because the days are thirty-nine minutes longer on Mars than on Earth, the same thirty-nine minutes that should have been cut from this Friday-less Robinson Crusoe. Kristen Wiig, however, is on hand to show that girls aren’t into The Lord of the Rings. Ridley Scott’s backlot Mars offers a parable for New Yorkers considering the move to LA. Once you relocate, you’re stranded, and the chances of getting home are remote. Yes, you’ll have a vegetable garden you can sit near and watch the beautiful sunsets, but you’ll be alone, 50 million miles from your loved ones. You’ll conduct your social life via text and Skype, make trips to the desert in your electric car. You’ll continue to shave every day on the off chance you get a meeting. The movies can put a positive spin on anything. Seeing the world anew, or for the first time, becomes an allegory of motherhood and childhood in Room, which puts its protagonist (Brie Larson) in a situation not unlike Matt Damon’s in The Martian, but earthbound, and worse. If The Martian is a friendly version of dark Ridley Scott sci-fi, Room domesticates repugnant horror with spiritual uplift. Held hostage in a shed with the 5-year-old she’s had with her rapist captor, “Ma” becomes a stand-in for every young mother isolated by child care, chained by domestic servitude, and abused at night by a man who’s out all day in a world she may never see again. This dismal parody of heterosexual coupling reinforces the idea that it’s time to have families in some new way. A tour de force of subtlety and restraint, 45 Years is the perfect movie to see alone if you’ve just broken up with someone and want confirmation it was a good idea. No need to waste decades in coupledom if all it amounts to is an unnoticed gesture of frustrated defiance. The film saves that moment for its last shot, which isn’t quite the indictment it’s meant to be. That’s because the film stacks the deck against Tom Courtenay’s character, a retiree recovering from a heart attack. Courtenay’s performance is a model of invisible acting, even when he’s doddering or fumbling an important speech at a party, but the film belongs to Charlotte Rampling, a star presence who can command the screen just by watching the passing landscape from a boat. The performances in The Big Short are carried by wigs, makeup, and bad suits, like in a silent comedy. Adam McKay, Will Ferrell’s director, cuts away from everyone’s big moments in their big scenes, almost walking away from them. Christian Bale, with a fake glass eye to go with his wig, moves the film along by himself for large chunks of it, often by air drumming, despite the large cast of Hollywood dudes giving it to hedge funders by playing them as self-deluded slickster oafs who will never be Ryan Gosling or Brad Pitt, no matter how many billions they sock away. The explanatory cameos by Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez, and Richard Thaler barely work, and the Margot Robbie one is a sarcastic wink-wink insult to the audience that almost sinks the whole movie while, at the same time, referring to The Wolf of Wall Street, a better film than this. Even though McKay gives the impression he is using recognizable forms of infotainment to educate us, the film doesn’t do that—it’s barely in the form of a movie. This disrespect is what makes The Big Short so satisfying. It jeers at and burlesques Wall Street for letting the crash happen, using Michael Lewis’s book to show there were people who knew it was going to happen. Its slapdash quality reinforces the idea that it needed to be made. A fairy tale of lean-in capitalism about a Cinderella without a prince, David O. Russell’s Joy recasts the crazy family of a Capra comedy with stellar toxicity. Joy’s (Jennifer Lawrence’s) undermining relatives are the selfish American clan par excellence, claiming to know everything about Joy’s business while undermining her future. Robert De Niro and Isabella Rossellini, playing evil-universe versions of themselves as Joy’s father and stepmother, delight in their performances as fickle scoffers. Joy is a natural inventor prone to epiphanies about household products—the film could be called A Beautiful Mop. Her ingenuity and tenacity save her from a life of drudgery, though by the end her victory seems hollow. The film, busy with fake TV soap operas and flashbacks, doesn’t imagine another life for her, except maybe settling down with a cable-TV executive (Bradley Cooper) who lectures her and is wrong half the time. The mitigating factors in her struggle are that she can turn a profit, employ her friends, and help younger women manufacture improved lint brushes. Set in the early 1990s, Joy suggests these were the consolations working-class Gen X could hope for. A series of epic walk-and-talks about the future retconned to be 100 percent correct because they’re about our present. For example, the Amazing Steve predicts that journalism will change because of computers. (He says that in 1998, the same year Aaron Sorkin found out.) By the end, when Super Steve tells his estranged daughter he will invent the iPod for her, the movie is indistinguishable from a TV commercial. They should have given Steve Jobs away for free without anyone asking for it, like that U2 album. That way people (users) might have watched it by accident. A nasty film about the drug war on the US-Mexico border that flirts with fascism and artiness, succumbing to the former. The film suggests that the best way for Donald Trump to convince the Mexican government to pay for building a wall would be to tell them it would keep out the CIA. Benicio del Toro, maybe the last actor from the Robert Mitchum mold, plays an Agency-backed hit man with blasé menace. Del Toro, like Mitchum, is a strange, often indifferent actor who apparently spins a wheel of fortune to choose his roles. Once he settles on one, he’s either good or bad in it depending on something no one can figure out, maybe if work starts on a Tuesday. It doesn’t matter who directs him. In films by auteurs like Paul Thomas Anderson and Arnaud Desplechin he can range from okay to not good, and then in an overblown thriller like this he shows up with something to prove. In some scenes he stares at Emily Blunt like he’s reminding her she is not an American and doesn’t work for the FBI, she’s just a movie star playing a cop. Tom Hooper knows that eyes are important in cinema, so he has directed the actors in The Danish Girl to search the corners of rooms with their glances like they can’t find their keys or a mouse just ran by. He makes them doll-like, ventriloquist’s dummies, and when they talk to each other they converse in need-speak, like they are explaining which line to get into at the DMV. The film begins in 1925, so Hooper has imparted a silent-movie feel to The Danish Girl. Everyone in this movie’s Europe has been hypnotized by Dr. Caligari or tortured like Joan of Arc. Eddie Redmayne, as Lili, plays along, his coyness telegraphing femininity. He puts a flower between his teeth like Chaplin and seems forever on the verge of picking up two forks and sticking them into dinner rolls to make them dance. Since the film is about painters, Hooper hired Jan Vermeer to be his cinematographer. Women’s captivity is the great theme of most of 2015’s Oscar-nominated films, and Ex Machina is the most basic and manipulative of these, the tale of a hapless john sent on a bizarre mission by a pimp to see if he can free his whore. The sordidness is made oblique because the characters are a programmer, a genius CEO, and a pixie android, and it’s set in a sterile underground lab. This Taxi Driver for nerds is heavy with the fear of superwomen empowered by data-driven emotional intelligence and synthetic physical perfection, and hence able to outflank male idiots savants. Ex Machina succeeds as a mindfuck stage play for three actors, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander, who were in a total of about a dozen films this year, all less weird and talky than this one. The unavoidable onslaught of virtual reality and artificial intelligence will make stories like this ever more relatable to lonely techies in search of mechanical love in robot form, but not to me. There’s not even room in my apartment for a vacuum cleaner. Nothing better could have been expected from the seventh film in the Rocky franchise than this flight from Hollywood back to Philadelphia. The savvy, intelligence, and heart of director Ryan Coogler’s screenplay equals his achievement in getting an assignment like this after making Fruitvale Station in Oakland at age 26. Boxing movies come with built-in emotional manipulation, and this one is no exception, establishing a family for Donnie (Michael B. Jordan) by bringing back a Rocky Balboa stricken with lymphoma. Stallone will go down in movie history as the only star of his generation willing to make way for Millennials and for black America like this. Michael B. Jordan’s Donnie, a pro-am boxer, rejects his status as the son of Rocky’s rival, Apollo Creed, and exiles himself to working-class Philadelphia, where he cajoles Rocky into training him. When he finally puts on his father’s red-white-and-blue trunks before the big fight, the moment is hokey but astute. He’s forced to imitate a father who didn’t raise him and who is not there to see what’s he made of himself. At the movie’s end, Rocky’s illness is left uncured and Donnie isn’t quite a champion, leaving the story ready for an eighth round. The last scene, on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, predicts the ending of Star Wars: The Force Awakens but undercuts its own myth. It’s clear that Ryan Coogler got cheated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Is there any doubt Creed was as well-directed and well-written as, say, Room? Coming a year after Selma’s Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo were ignored in the Oscar nominations, ignoring Coogler was especially troubling, proof of the problem #OscarsSoWhite exposed—that the Academy consciously ignores black artists. Jada Pinkett Smith’s viral video about her husband Will Smith’s lack of a nomination for Concussion was justified, even if Janet Hubert’s response video, reminding Smith that years ago he had refused to stand with other cast members of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air when they wanted a raise, exposed Smith as also a victim of karma. The Academy, after all, started out as a union-busting organization. He should have supported his fellow actors in contract negotiations. Yet Smith had played the Oscar game strictly according to the rules by starring in Concussion. It was a medical drama about a controversial subject written and directed by a conscientious filmmaker, in which Smith had to change his appearance and his accent—pure Oscar bait. If Sandra Bullock was nominated (and won) for The Blind Side, a sappy football drama, Smith deserved at least a nomination for a serious one. If Will Smith, who has been loyal to Hollywood’s way of doing things—loyal to a fault—can’t get a nomination, what chance did Ryan Coogler have? He made a good sports drama, a big film that made money and that critics liked. The Academy told him only Sylvester Stallone deserved recognition for it, the same way no one but four white screenwriters were recognized for Straight Outta Compton. The first half generates excitement as it explores teenage life in 1980s Compton and brings the group together. Then F. Gary Gray’s biopic switches gears and splits Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Ice Cube (O’Shea Jackson Jr.) into a tripartite version of a Hollywood serious-composer biopic like Rhapsody in Blue. When N.W.A breaks up the film becomes morose, bogged down in cameo parts, recriminations, and ugly management disputes—a history of beefs—before Eazy-E’s sudden illness and death from HIV/AIDS brings it to a close. Eazy-E’s tragedy, treated with the gravity it deserves, is not mitigated by Dre’s success as a businessman or Ice Cube’s prodigiousness. Cube’s dignity and conscience extend to the actor playing him, O’Shea Jackson Jr., his son in real life. Jackson the Younger is a carbon copy of his father who makes him seem even greater than the original; he’s somehow more Cube than Cube. Christopher Wallace Jr. set the precedent for this by playing Biggie as a child in 2009’s Notorious, a film that didn’t get mentioned much in relation to Straight Outta Compton, which was treated as the first biopic to admit rap’s centrality to American culture, maybe because it was from the West Coast. I used to be a movie theater projectionist and sometimes I have an anxiety dream that I’m back working in the booth. I must have been anxious about seeing The Hateful Eight, because the night before I saw it I had a booth dream. In the dream, different machines are in the booth with the two regular 35mm projectors: two 16mm projectors set up next to two 70mm projectors, the gauge Tarantino used for The Hateful Eight. These four new projectors crowding the booth—two of them small and two huge—are old models, battered and tarnished. I ask the theater manager why they’re there. He tells me the director of the movie we’re showing has made sections of the film in these three different gauges and the movie is to be projected that way. This director has also specified what make and model of projector each reel must be shown on, down to the year it was made. As I begin to thread the first reel, I see that the film is old and brittle and has turned pink from age. It has many torn sprockets. I examine it more closely and see it’s not a new movie at all, but a western from the early 1960s by the director Joseph M. Newman. The manager tells me to get going, but when I thread the projector I put a twist in the film, which I notice after I start the movie. I tell the manager it’s going to break, and he says, “Don’t worry. If it breaks we’ll show an old cartoon.” There were stories in the news about projectionists flying to distant cities to work in booths for The Hateful Eight, valiantly making sure the 70mm roadshow screenings went off without a hitch. When I saw it in 70mm in the East Village, I was happy there weren’t any promos for TV shows before it, or ads for soda, or any trailers at all—they couldn’t show them with a 70mm print. If Tarantino has done anything, he’s given us the experience of watching a new movie by itself, on film, without any extraneous crap beforehand to remind us that movies are part of a universe of media streaming elsewhere. Sitting in that theater watching The Hateful Eight put me in the hundred-year flow of people in big cities watching westerns in movie theaters, dreaming of places without skyscrapers and subways. The Hateful Eight is a reflective film in which the Hawksian Tarantino reevaluates the unfair comments he made about John Ford when Django came out. Maybe in rewatching some Ford movies featuring John Wayne in preparation for casting Kurt Russell in a role based on Wayne (and on the constructed authority Wayne brought to his characters—an authority that is questioned and then eliminated in The Hateful Eight), Tarantino realized he has more in common with Ford than he thought. Fordian reference abounds: Russell says “that’ll be the day” like John Wayne in The Searchers; Tim Roth’s character is named Mobray, after an actor in My Darling Clementine who, like Roth, plays a part in a saloon; the explanatory flashback subverts the narrative Liberty Valance–style. The film’s letter from Abraham Lincoln, Ford’s touchstone in American history, proves to be false and dangerous, but a beautiful story, held till the end. Jennifer Jason Leigh spits on that letter. She is the film’s destroyer, a poisoner who exists to upend all the stories men tell each other to justify their violence. A Kali figure of the cinema, Leigh’s Daisy Domergue, with matted hair and blood in her eyes, fights her captivity with a noose around her neck and the severed arm of Russell’s bounty hunter—the arm of the law—dangling from her chains. I saw The Hateful Eight while the occupation of the National Wildlife Refuge was happening in Oregon. Malheur, close to Hateful in French, was a western, too, with a plot like Tarantino’s. Holed up in the middle of nowhere in winter, a group of armed men telling each other bedtime stories about the Constitution threatened to make a bloody mess. Outside, the nation tore itself apart because a large segment of the population refused to give up old myths. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino’s most timely film. Swinging hard for the visionary and missing, Alejandro González Iñárittu’s Revenant combines Andrei Rublev with Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, unfurling winter panoramas in natural light and adding CGI animals. The heart of the film, the section in which Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets Hikuc (Arthur Redcloud) after the buffalo stampede, rises above Iñárittu’s gory conception for a moment, before ending in a hanging and a rape, because if we forget this film’s theme for a second we will be snapped back into it as punishment for daydreaming. The rest is a slog, Klondike Kat crossed with a Matthew Barney film, dominated by Tom Hardy’s distracting-entertaining Appalachian accent. One thing is certain: Iñárittu has finally solved the problem of how to film a realistic bear fight. The next cinematic problem he should tackle is screenwriting. Tinkertoys in a landscape that’s like a painting by Yves Tanguy, while in the foreground the Ed Roth car from the cover of The Birthday Party’s Junk Yard album drives by at 150 miles an hour. The most cartoonish film in a year of films like Warner Brothers cartoons is also one of the best. How? Mad Max: Fury Road is that one-in-a-thousand reboot that will greenlight even more reboots, none of which will justify its existence like this one. Charlize Theron as a one-armed truck driver in post-apocalyptic Australia wears black grease as sunscreen under a buzzcut, a look sufficiently removed from her usual perfume-ad glamour, which is displaced onto the women she is rescuing. Tom Hardy is better muttering than pontificating like he did in The Revenant. The entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters. George Miller has done well to stay away from Hollywood and to switch from making animated movies to live-action ones. Miller also remembered to make the film directly about things, not all subtext begging for explication. The scarcity of water, oil wars, the arms trade, and female emancipation jostle for space with the customized vehicles, coming in and out of focus with the blitz. But when it comes to political subtext, it must be acknowledged that Immortan Joe’s demise was predictable from his water distribution method. Pouring thousands of gallons of water on people’s heads from a great height is not the best way to keep them pacified. Better to sell it to them in plastic bottles for 99 cents each. Like J. J. Abrams’s Star Trek reboots, his new Star Wars seems crowdsourced and easy to forget, an app you just closed. Kylo Ren’s mask sticks in my mind because he doesn’t need it and wears it anyway. He’s not a disfigured monster like Darth Vader, he’s handsome Adam Driver dressing up as grandpa on Halloween, preprogrammed for redemption. He’s not evil, he’s just young. Spotlight joins the thin ranks of good contemporary Boston films (Mystic River, The Fighter) and does them one better by offering an explanation for the dark cloud that hangs over the place like the devil looms over the town in Murnau’s Faust. Set in 2001, during the time of The Boston Globe’s exposé of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church, Spotlight glorifies investigative journalism and newspaper publishing for a world without newsprint. The film is spare and didactic, an instructional film explaining a disappearing profession. The editors and reporters in the film are saints whose personal lives are secondary to their work, and the Boston they work in is institutionally corrupt—cops and the courts stand between them and the truth as much as the Church does. It captures an essential truth about Boston, that feeling of drabness mixed with hostility and peculiarity anyone that who has ever had to knock on a stranger’s door in that town has felt. The key scene in this regard is the one in which Rachel McAdams stands at the front door of a disgraced priest, who happily admits to his crimes while his sister barks and snipes, shooing McAdams off. I’m sure that woman puts an orange traffic cone in her parking space in May. Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston), the blacklisted screenwriter at the center of this earnest-frantic biopic, was pro-Soviet and a member of the CPUSA, his politics formed during the Depression. Called before HUAC in 1947, he served time in jail for refusing to name names and was denied work by the studios. After prison, he wrote films under pseudonyms, including Gun Crazy, and won Oscars for two of them. One was Roman Holiday—yes, Roman Holiday was written by a commie. He couldn’t publicly accept or acknowledge his awards until after Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger broke the blacklist in 1960 by giving him screen credit on Spartacus and Exodus.  As a true-life version of Hail, Caesar! that features many actors familiar from Coen Brothers movies, Trumbo hams up the blacklist. The director, Jay Roach, directed the Austin Powers and Fockers movies, and Trumbo gets over its awkwardness by focusing on the mechanics of screenwriting under duress, which Roach marvels at. Here is a screenwriter willing to risk everything, including his family, to write B movies for low pay under a pseudonym, without compromising his politics. After Austin Powers in Goldmember, that point of view makes sense. Actors play real Hollywood figures with varying degrees of success. Christian Berkel, who plays Otto Preminger, captures his essence, turning the combative auteur into a sly interloper popping up in Highland Park with mordant Viennese panache. Trumbo leaves the impression that the ’50s worked out for everybody in the end, except for poor Louis C. K., as a leftwing screenwriter who smoked too much. Also set in the baby-boomer heaven of the 1950s and early ’60s, Bridge of Spies presents the cold war as genteel and humane compared to the present war on terror. Tom Hanks, a high-powered lawyer but also a middle-class everyman, proves that making deals with our enemies is a better solution than building walls or dropping bombs. Retrofitting the cold war for the end of the Obama era, Bridge of Spies combines the negotiation of international agreements with a Trumpist approach: deals are best handled by private citizens who know better than government officials how to get what’s best for the country. Today, of course, it is this businessman figure who wants to build a border wall, a bellicose reversal of this film’s message. The Coen Brothers cowrote it, but Spielberg’s unwavering belief in American values prevents any cynicism from coming through. At the same time, the film is mature, aware that Hanks is aging and could die of pneumonia without his overcoat from Saks Fifth Avenue. The scene with Hanks and Mark Rylance, as a pensive Soviet spy, listening to a Shostakovich piano concerto on a radio in a prison cell was not something I expected to see in a Spielberg movie. Set in Manhattan and on the road in the winter of 1952, Carol fetishizes the mechanical equipment of surveillance—telephones, cameras, tape recorders. Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara), soon to be lovers, get into a dove-gray Packard to escape Carol’s family, but can’t avoid the prying men who follow them anyway. Men are confused and pushy in Carol, and almost as forcibly drunk and well-dressed as Cary Grant in the early scenes of North by Northwest. Ed Lachman’s cinematography, in Super 16mm, is by far the most ravishing and understated among these films, a subtle tribute to the medium best suited for the intimacy of furtive glances and hushed conversations. The film is a triumph of art direction and wardrobe, a seductive art object. When Carol tells her husband “we’re not ugly people, Harge,” she is telling the truth about a film that finds beauty in bad situations. Leaving County Wexford, a rule-bound place where shoe polish is not for sale on Sunday because it’s “not a Sunday item,” Eilis, a thoughtful girl played with extraordinary composure by Saoirse Ronan, sails for New York. She moves into a boarding house and gets a job at a department store in Brooklyn, across the East River from the department store in Carol where Therese worked in Todd Haynes’s version of New York in 1952. Eilis meets and falls in love with a handsome Italian American plumber (Emory Cohen, channeling ’50s method actors) who’s as calm and good-hearted as she is. Then she’s whisked back to Ireland for her sister’s funeral and coaxed to stay there by an equally kind young man played by red-haired Domhnall Gleeson, who’s in every movie. Eilis almost makes the decision not to go back to the Brooklyn of 1952, a choice unimaginable to the renters of Brooklyn in 2016, who would take the first boat to that Brooklyn if they could. For all their strenuous effort in vintage bar and restaurant design, they watch a livable Brooklyn drift farther off each day. For Eilis, Brooklyn meant freedom from the past.

"Apr 16, 2018"," Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunck, back in 1985, the ""Mad Max"" trilogy unceremoniously sputtered to an anticlimactic halt rather than going out on a furious, nitro-boosted blast. That tepid finale, ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" would become the post-apocalyptic Outback series' weak link, an unsatisfactory follow up to its crowning production. That film, ""The Road Warrior"" (1981), not only elevated Mel Gibson to bankable star status in Hollywood, it seamlessly spun together an odd olio of diverse genres without faltering into camp and boasted some of the greatest real-action car stunts recorded on film. What director George Miller and Gibson revved up was an instant cult classic, a box office smash (it covered its budget in the U.S. in one week) and a can-do mashup from Down Under that would become a model that many would try to copy, but few could emulate. With “Mad Max: Fury Road,” (released May 15) the series is back on track, and boldly so. It took decades to get here, but it’s well worth the wait, something well oiled in lineage and ready to sear into the minds of a new generation of thrill-injected converts. Something of a different texture, less polished and more gritty, ""Mad Max"" was conceived out of the OPEC oil crisis in the mid-'70s and the demented juices of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper. Poetically subversive, the film became a political incineration of glut and the virtuous notion of humanity as inherently good, as few stuck their necks out for their fellow man as civilization slowly imploded. One subtle key ingredient that helped make ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" remain so indelible over time was their pointedly baroque scores composed by Brian May (not to be confused with the renowned guitarist from Queen) that effortlessly flowed with the action, underscoring it and heightening moments of tension with emphatic fist-pumping punctuation. Their classic composition has stood the test of time. For ""Thunderdome,"" which co-starred pop icon Tina Turner as the malevolent overseer of a desert stranded bastion of humanity, Miller went with the diva and a score that sorely missed May’s deft touch. In resurrecting the franchise, Miller knew that re-partnering with Gibson would not be possible as Max was conceived, and gestated, as something akin to James Bond or Tarzan, an ageless warrior battling arch-villains on a landscape changed only by the shifting sands of the zeitgeist of the moment. Jettisoned too, in the new millennia recreation, is the whole oil grab notion, tilled under by today’s alternative energy efforts and climate change fears. Had “Max’s” seminal inception been in the now, one could almost imagine the Lord Humongous, battle axe in hand, lording over a vast desert wasteland covered by a sheet of solar panels harnessed to charge ghoulishly tricked-out electric V8s. In the new ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" the petrol, so precious in ""The Road Warrior,"" seems relatively abundant by comparison — and bullets too. Out in the desert sea, patrolled by clans of punked-out marauders, there's the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, a massive refinery that belches evil carbon clouds into the sky. What's scarce in the 2015 ""Max"" is water, green space and nubile women who can bear children. Those that can are stunning to behold in thin gauze that might drive some teenage boys wild as they're played by Victoria's Secret models or the progeny of rock ‘n’ roll royalty — Lenny Kravitz's daughter, Zoë and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough. We never get to go to the Bullet Farm or Gas Town. They remain distant images on the red horizon as Furiosa (Charlize Theron), charged with a shopping/raid mission by ""Fury Road's"" resident baddie, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, so unforgettable as the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max"" and downright outlandish here looking like a Morlock on steroids) a.k.a. Dad (probably because he holds the keys to all the babes' chastity belts), decides to go off course on a little joy ride. This doesn't bode well with Joe, the Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter) or any of the other bloodthirsty factions suddenly on the tail of Furiosa and her war tanker loaded with live flesh and hope. Where is the new Max in all this? Yes, Tom Hardy, the guy who was a sheer menace as Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and so thespian in ""Locke,"" makes a fine Max. He's the draw, but this is really Theron's film. Her Furiosa, an enhanced 2.0 version of the Woman Warrior from ""The Road Warrior,"" comes fully imbued with the resolve and maternal sensibilities of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the ""Alien"" franchise. Part cyborg and always thinking ahead, she drives the film while Keays-Byrne gobbles up chunks of the screen time too. That main guy, listed up in the title, he's just along for the ride — and what a ride it is. When we first meet Max, he's barely finished eating a two headed gecko — raw! — before being picked off by a detachment of Joe's albino tweekers and harnessed as a sack of blood, mainlined into the arteries of the chosen War Boys — fanatic and finely conditioned malevolents, who like many of today's indoctrinates of terror are willing to die for a ""greater cause"" without understanding the ramifications of the chess game being played above their heads. ""Fury Road"" is one long chase sequence that borrows much from ""The Road Warrior"" (the music box nostalgically symbolizing innocence, a faulty sawed-off shot gun and a resilient tanker fortified in barbwire and under siege from a limitless foe), but also puts its own stamp on the series without tipping it over. Miller who has made 10 features — four ""Maxes,"" two ""Happy Feet"" and a ""Babe"" — had been incubating the project for a decade and a half. His diligent care and commitment to the perfect shot and live-action stunt work — not CGI enhanced zaniness (though there is some) like the ""Fast and Furious"" films — is aesthetically evident and underscored by the furious, yet fluid editing. As far as chase scenes go, this is as close to William Friedkin making ""The French Connection"" or ""To Live and Die in L.A."" on the ""really did that"" scale as one might see in their lifetime these days. The thrill per second ratio is off the charts, not to mention a tribe of women called the Vuvalini and a monster rock show that follows Joe's every move. Some might be well within their purview to call ""Fury Road"" bombastic, but none in their right mind could ever call it dull. Whether Miller set out to make ""Fury Road"" as an eco-pro message (green space is nonexistent) or not, the articulation of oppression, especially when it comes to the indentured women assigned for breeding and feeding, is squarely there and timely. Hardy and Theron play off each other beautifully too. If there's any throttle back to ""Fury Road"" it's that the new Max lacks soul and purpose. Gibson's warrior of the wasteland was something you could sink your teeth into and feel. The man lost his wife and child and that's what pushed him over to the edge of moral ambiguity — think Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. It was visceral and real. Here, Hardy's Max is just a survivor haunted by the past in a way that feels half-hearted, blanched and doesn't fuel the character. It's inconsequential, however, as ""Fury Road"" is all about adrenaline and forward motion. There's never any let up from the get go. Before Max can utter his first words he's already been snatched, shackled (Bane-esque face plate and all) and mounted to the grill of a muscle car with an IV running to his blood needy host driving the jalopy of mayhem hot after Furiosa. In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously — reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. ""Fury Road"" is rife with activity and fertile with ideas. Rumor has it there's two follow ups in the works. If Miller's integrity is a staunch as it is here, they're sure to be smashes as well.

"Feb 1, 2018"," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Mad Max: Fury Road es una de las mejores películas de acción de los últimos años. Punto. No es necesario ser fanático de las cintas anteriores ni del subgénero de películas postapocalípticas para disfrutar de esta producción; sus increíbles efectos especiales, grandes actuaciones, y escenas de acción increíblemente tensas y emocionantes. «Furia en el camino» debería ser utilizada en escuelas de cine para mostrar cómo desarrollar acción y emoción, suspenso y adrenalina. La película simplemente me dejó sin aliento. George Miller (guionista y director no solo de esta entrega, si no también de la trilogía original protagonizada por Mel Gibson) esperó treinta años para dirigir una nueva entrega de la saga de Mad Max, pero después de haber visto el producto final, puedo decir que la espera definitivamente valió la pena. Después todo, le dio la oportunidad de usar mejores efectos especiales, construir escenas de acción más locas y salvajes, y usar a un actor protagonista más joven y menos controvertido, así como a una de las mejores actrices hollywoodenses contemporáneas. Pero lo más importante es lo que dicha espera representa: Miller esperó tanto tiempo porque quería tener una historia que contar, y no porque quería hacer una secuela simplemente para ganar dinero. La historia es simple, más no simplista. Siento que Miller escribió un primer guión y, para enfatizar las emociones más que la historia en sí, le “sacó la grasa”, reduciéndolo a los básico y lo esencial. Hay pocos diálogos, Max casi no habla (al menos durante los primeros dos tercios de metraje), y la trama simplemente se trata de llevar a los personajes del punto A al punto B (para luego regresar al A… igual no es demasiado complicado). Se trata de un acercamiento directo pero efectivo, dándole una sensación de sencillez a la cinta muy refrescante en una época en la que muchos blockbusters se sienten “hinchados” e innecesariamente complicados (te estoy mirando a ti, «Era de Ultrón»). Como deben imaginar, el protagonista es Max (Tom Hardy, más conocido por interpretar al villano Bane en El Caballero de la Noche Asciende), quien comienza el filme barbado y sucio en medio del desierto. Después de una breve persecución, es atrapado por los secuaces de Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes-Byrne), un señor de la guerra que gobierna una de las pocas ciudades que existen en este mundo postapocalíptico desolado y seco, en donde la gente se pelea por el agua y la gasolina. Su estancia en la ciudad, sin embargo, será breve, ya que unirá fuerzas con la valiente Imperator Furiosa (la gran Charlize Theron), una general de Joe que lo ha traicionado y se ha llevado a sus tres novias, interpretadas por Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers 3), Zoë Kravitz (X-Men: Primera Clase, Divergente), Riley Keough y Courtney Eaton. Juntos, emprenderán un viaje al “Lugar Verde”, una suerte de santuario en donde podrán vivir en paz. ¿El problema? Están siendo perseguidos por Joe y todo su séquito. Hacer una mala película de acción es muy fácil; si no, véase la mayoría de la filmografía de Michael Bay (especialmente sus últimas tres películas de «Transformers»). Hacer una buena película de acción, por otra parte, es muy difícil. No solo es necesario presentarles al público secuencias impresionantes llenas de explosiones, balaceras y violencia por doquier; también se tiene que desarrollar tensión y emoción, hacer que la audiencia se muerda las uñas y se les erice el pelo, y para ello se tiene que tener personajes bien definidos por los cuales uno se preocupe, no súperheroes invencibles y perfectos. No solo eso, también se tiene que filmar y editar la acción de manera clara, sin abusar de cámaras en mano o cortes rápidos. Y adivinen qué… Mad Max: Furia en el camino hace todo esto y mucho más. La película es una combinación de todo el caos que uno podría encontrar en las producciones del anteriormente mencionado Bay con la locura de las últimas películas de Rápidos y Furiosos y la intensidad de una cinta para mayores de 18 años a la antigua. Las escenas de acción, con la ayuda del ingenioso diseño de personajes y carros, son originales e inventivas, y jamás se sienten como ideas recicladas de filmes anteriores. Además, a pesar de que la acción es el foco de la historia, Miller logra presentarnos personajes creíbles y bien definidos, con motivaciones verosímiles y antecedentes presentados de manera breve pero clara (generalmente a través de flashbacks, al menos en el caso de Max). Lo astuto de la película es que jamás se va por las ramas; solo nos enseña lo que necesitamos saber de Max, solo nos presenta lo que necesitamos saber del mundo en el que se desarrolla. A muchos les podría parecer muy rápida o poco explícita, pero a mi me encantó. Las actuaciones son todas excelentes. Tom Hardy se transforma en Max desde la primera escena, jamás haciendo que extrañemos a Mel Gibson. Quizás se deba a que han pasado ya treinta años desde la entrega anterior, pero nunca sentí que Hardy fuera inferior a Gibson, o una copia barata del controvertido actor. Pero a pesar de que Hardy es muy bueno, a mi parecer la verdadera estrella de la cinta es Charlize Theron como Furiosa. Rapada, sucia y molesta, interpreta al personaje a la perfección, y resulta muy creíble como una lideresa fuerte pero con motivaciones muy emocionales. La escena en la que se arrodilla en medio del desierto y grita después de una horrible decepción me pareció particularmente desgarradora.  Las interpretaciones secundarias también son sólidas. Nicolas Hoult, irreconocible con un maquillaje blanco y lleno de cicatrices, da una actuación sorprendentemente sutil, convirtiendo a su personaje potencialmente estereotípico en algo un poco más interesante. Las novias son los personajes menos desarrollados, pero a la vez son presentadas como mujeres fuertes y con cierto grado de independencia (apropiada reacción después de haber vivido como objetos por tantos años), lo cual me gustó mucho. Y como el villano principal, Immortan Joe, Hugh Keayes-Byrne es muy bueno; con su gruesísima voz, look fuera de lo común y actitud despiadada, logra desarrollar a un antagonista extremadamente intimidante y memorable. Lo curioso de Mad Max: Furia en el Camino es que, a pesar de que el título lleva su nombre, la historia no trata necesariamente sobre Max. En realidad la trama se enfoca más en Furiosa, en su viaje y en su búsqueda de esperanza, y Max simplemente se une a ella. Esto no quiere decir que él no sea el protagonista; de hecho, me animaría a decir que ambos lo son, lo cual le da una dinámica interesante a la película. Mucho se ha dicho de que el filme es feminista, y después de haberlo visto, no estoy completamente seguro de ello. Lo único que puedo decir es que Miller nos presenta personajes femeninos fuertes e independientes, y que de algún modo critica a las sociedades que abusan de las mujeres y a la gente que cree que sirven únicamente para fines reproductivos (sí, hay gente así). Se trata de un contexto interesante para una historia de este tipo, un contexto con el cual uno se puede identificar, y el que cada uno ya tendría que interpretar a su manera para comprobar si verdaderamente es feminista o no. Puede que no lo parezca después de ver los trailers algo exagerados, pero «Mad Max: Furia en el camino» favorece los efectos especiales prácticos por sobre los digitales. Se nota que la mayor parte de la cinta fue grabada en los desiertos de Namibia, con carros de verdad, explosiones y choques reales, y dobles de riesgo. Esto, junto con la hermosa dirección de fotografía, la cual nos presenta escenas diurnas muy coloridas (llenas de naranjas y celestes) y escenas nocturnas azulezcas y muy estilizadas, le da una estética realista y sucia y grasienta a la película, estética de la cual muchas películas de acción contemporáneas carecen. No llegué a ver la película en 3D, pero por los comentarios que he escuchado, al parecer está bien implementado.  Por otra parte, la música, compuesta por Junkie XL, ayuda a desarrollar la palpable sensación de tensión y emoción que se siente a lo largo de la película. Me gustó que la música muchas veces sea diegética; el ejército de Immortan Joe tiene entre sus rangos a tamboristas y a un ciego que toca una guitarra eléctrica que lanza fuego (en serio, ¿en qué otra película encontrarías a un personaje así?), quienes contribuyen al soundtrack en algunas escenas. La música es muy buena a pesar de que, por momentos, se siente como una copia del estilo de Hans Zimmer.  Mad Max: Furia en el Camino combina las sensibilidades algo más tradicionales de George Miller (planos largos, acción filmada sin abusar de cámaras en mano, violencia brutal muy merecedora de su calificación para mayores de 18 años) con la espectacularidad de un blockbuster moderno (grandes efectos especiales, personajes grotescos y originales, una gran sensación de escala) para crear un gran espectáculo de acción y emoción, adrenalina y testosterona, un baile lleno de color y explosiones. Se trata, básicamente, de una gran persecución, pero una persecución grabada con estilo y con talento, poblada por personajes interesantes y bien desarrollados. Salí del cine temblando y con las manos sudorosas, y ese es el mejor cumplido que se le puede dar a una película de este tipo. ¡Que vengan más secuelas!",POSITIVE
"Dec 2, 2017"," Directed by George Miller.
Starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Nathan Jones, Megan Gale, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Josh Helman, Jennifer Hagan, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Courtney Easton. In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland. When George Miller said that Mad Max: Fury Road would be a two-hour long car chase, he wasn’t lying. There are maybe three or four moments serving as downtime between action sequences, allowing Miller to further the plot (which is actually quite fun and doesn’t bog down the exhilarating road rage) and develop his characters. The ratio of action to story is still intentionally one-sided, but what’s most remarkable is that not a second of Mad Max: Fury Road is wasted or feels superfluous. It’s a rollercoaster ride from the very start and is destined to be remembered not just as a successful resurrection of the Mad Max franchise (there hasn’t been an entry in 30 years) but one of the most unique blockbuster films in recent memory. In an age where CGI and computer effects dominate the presentation of these Hollywood epics, Mad Max: Fury Road takes a risky approach for the modern era by using practical effects. As a matter of fact, over 80% of the movie uses practical effects, and it shows. There’s an early scene where Immortan Joe (a tyrannical leader of a wasteland citadel played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) is being fitted with his war armor, and it’s impossible to not notice disgusting lumps, severely unhealthy skin conditions, and more. The scene only lasts about 10 seconds but is enough to showcase that some serious work went into the costume and makeup effects, and leave the impression that the rest of the movie is going to be one hell of a visual treat. Undoubtedly people are coming for the carmageddon chaos, but the design of Mad Max: Fury Road oozes a personality that is often missing from Hollywood blockbusters. It’s evident that George Miller is putting forth maximum effort into this production, painting an unrestrained canvas of crazy. For a wasteland the movie is filled with a wide array of colors, whether it be on clothing, armor, vehicles, and even flares. Instead of packing the movie with one type of enemy, there is a variety to them and their tactics; like dudes with flamethrowers attached to their guitars, or dudes with poles rigged to their vehicles that vault them all over the skies. The movie never sticks to our heroes battling one group for too long, constantly shaking it up so each battle is free from repetition. Thanks to this very distinct and often ludicrous approach to the world building and characters, by association the frantic and chaotic chase sequences, feel, well mad. Even though admittedly some of the action gets so wild it can become slightly incoherent (I still have no idea exactly how the villain met his demise), what is going on is ridiculously ambitious, coming across as a spectacle that needs to be witnessed. The violence is also shot from a healthy amount of angles (distance shots, close-ups, first-person shots, and even some beautiful shots off in the distance from the side) making the cinematography of Mad Max: Fury Road incredibly tight. No shortcuts or tricks were taken to make filming the carnage easy, resulting in something that is not only intense but marvelous to ogle. Normally I don’t advocate 3-D, but George Miller definitely makes good use of it here, to the point where it actually enhances the experience. There’s something about seeing pounds of dirt bounce up in your face and desert heat radiating off the screen that surprisingly works without interfering with the movie. There is also a money-shot towards the end when so much destruction is flying at your face you may hit the deck out of instinct. Normally 3-D just feels there or isn’t very noticeable, but here it becomes another part of a fantastic whole. It also helps that Tom Hardy makes for a pretty good Max that is able to capture his very guarded personality and mental struggles of coming to terms with the death of his family. There will be some diehard fans that will always prefer Mel Gibson, but it can’t be denied that Tom Hardy delivers in the role. The supporting cast is also easy to like and filled with quirky characters, like Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who will do anything to impress his comically over-the-top villainous leader Immortan Joe. Charlize Theron also gives a fine performance as Furiousa, the battle hardened rebel smuggling out Joe’s breeders in hopes of finding sanctuary for everyone back in her homeland. She sells the hell out of the role with her shaven head, and generally looks like a total badass amongst all of the mayhem. It also must be noted that during the brief instances of peace, all of our protagonists receive some minor character development, and are all brought together by a common theme of redemption. That’s not to say the story is high art, but when there are motives driving the characters in their action sequences everything comes much more alive and is easier to get lost in. Even the breeders being carried have their moments to shine, when they easily could have been relegated to the eye-candy that they initially appear to be. While I would say that Mad Max: Fury Road is readily accessible to those not familiar with the franchise, the self-contained story can get a little confusing at times. It’s not surprising because the original cut was over two hours, meaning that more of the exposition and plot details are axed, but it’s still frustrating when some minor things get a little lost in the shuffle. In the end it’s not too bothersome considering the amount of satisfaction you will get from the wild ride, but it still exists as a minor problem. Before closing this out it also needs to be mentioned that the sound design, mixing, and soundtrack for Mad Max: Fury Road are intense, upping the intensity of every single beat of action. There seems to be a running theme where trailers will use the best piece of music for the film in the trailer, but not actually have it in the movie. That isn’t the case here as the heart-pounding battle music from the trailer kicks in numerous times. The soundtrack also feels incredibly unique when you have heavy metal blaring from flamethrower guitars and drums pounding from battle-criers blasting in conjunction with the original music. Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road comes across as the antithesis to the modern blockbuster. It is a bloody violent R-rated action flick using the cinematic tricks of yesteryear to create something that can fit in wonderfully alongside what has now been accepted as the standard. Mad Max: Fury Road is that rare successful franchise resurrection; it is an 80s action film with the budget of a modern era film and cinematography so mind-blowing it feels as if it was filmed with technology from the future.",POSITIVE
"Oct 17, 2017"," 
As you’ve seen from the trailers, visually the film is astonishing. Sarah kept telling me she was worried about the “desert”-ness of it all and that’s not usually my jam either but the endless sand and tan just highlights the absurdity of everything that much more. Like, I will never understand why they need a tweaked out guitar player and barely tolerable music screeching from the speakers whenever they go on a car chase but if that happened on a freeway in Los Angeles, it wouldn’t be as awesomely ridiculous as it is when it’s happening on top of the bleakness of the Mad Max landscape. And besides, these visuals actually complement the tone of this world: in a depraved existence, everything has to be extra. Even bravery…so that when a boy soldier willingly sacrifices for his dictator, the act itself is not enough, he has to spray toxic silver paint on his mouth before he hurls his body out of the car, ready to be annihilated. This is obvious symbolism. But it doesn’t mean it’s not potent. 
As for the story… pretty simple: there’s a gross dude who controls the people. Charlize Theron’s Furiosa defies him. She needs a reluctant Mad Max to help out. Many people have already noted that Charlize is the movie’s soul. And it’s true. She’s the one who has all the dimensions. She’s the one who, literally, spends most of the time driving. She’s the only one you can’t replace. Which is interesting because it took them 30 years to find the new Max in Tom Hardy. And it’s Charlize who comes out of it owning the role –and the movie – so unequivocally that the conversation has become instead about how no one else could have done what she did. 
That said, if you’re a Tom Hardy fan… the money shot comes at the very, very end. The last shot. That’s the one you’ll be taking to bed.",POSITIVE

Thanks for reading The Tyee today — we hope this article added to your day in some way. Our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing in-depth reporting and taking time to get it right.
 
We're able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest, and publish it for free for all to read, because we have the support of Tyee Builders. Tyee Builders are readers who contribute a bit of money — at a level and frequency of their choice — to support our editorial budget.
 
This core of supporters — making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership — enables us to pay our writers, keep our articles free and open to all, and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read.
 
Instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars, we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region.
 
You made it all the way through the article – I hope that means you liked it (or if not ‘liked’ it, gleaned some useful information from it). Tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy, so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work.
 
Listen, I’ll get to the point – the article you just read was made possible because our non-profit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it. And we can only afford to do that because of our business model, which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called Tyee Builders.
 
The traditional business model for journalism in Canada has been completely disrupted, and we’re witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications, lay people off, and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy. And it doesn’t help that tech giant Meta has blocked Canadian news on their Facebook and Instagram platforms.
 
Between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit The Tyee contribute financially, but amazingly, that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget. And it means we can operate without a paywall, too. 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality, fact-based journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in B.C., Alberta, and across Canada. We think that’s pretty remarkable.
 It's a good sign when you bump into a couple of people you know who are just exiting the film that you are about to see. It's an even better sign when those people say, ""I wish I was you, seeing it again for the first time."" So it was with Mad Max: Fury Road. Director George Miller's robust reboot opened in wide release this previous week. Already the critics are frothing with praise and the plebs are lining up en masse. But is the hype all gunning engines and spinning wheels, or is there real power beneath the hood of this hot rod? For anyone who came of age during the original trilogy of Mad Max, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, a holy set list on constant repeat at video parties in the 1980s, Fury Road is a welcome addition. While the original conceit of the Mad Max universe is maintained, the new film surpasses its origins, and offers up a brand new post-Apocalyptic funhouse ride, with a surprisingly thoughtful subtext. In a world that has fallen into chaos and ruination, humans have descended to little more than a pack of wild dogs, savaging what is left of the place, and then turning on each other in snarling snapping frenzy. Resources -- gas, water and food -- are controlled by the powerful through ritualized violence and constant threat. Watching the film one occasionally has the sinking feeling that we're not all that far from removed from this fictional place. Water is doled out in measured doses, and the population is imprisoned by desperation and need. It looks a lot like current day California. But put those thoughts out of your mind for the moment, you're here for some escapism, correct? Do not fear, the film transports quite unlike any other action opus released this year. Indeed, there is nothing quite like a good old-fashioned science fiction dystopia to take away your worries about doing your taxes or going to the dentist. But for all its hammer and tongs approach, the film is curiously gentle in some ways. Scene changes are denoted by a fade to black and silence is used to great effect. Some of the most powerful moments take place in stillness when humanity's dire state is sketched out underneath an impassive heaven. God is long gone, and all that's left is brute survival. The centre of the film is anchored by two oddly calm performances. Tom Hardy, who spent another film messing about in cars in Locke, plays the titular Max. PTSD flashbacks have rendered him half-mad, and his introduction in the film plays like a gothic nightmare of dead little girls and disembodied voices. Pity poor Max, he is truly lost in the wilderness of his own mind, wandering and alone. In a base rumble, he sketches out the reality of the universe that he occupies: ""As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy -- me or everyone else."" The other pillar of the film is that of Imperator Furiosa, played by the statuesque Charlize Theron. With a metal arm and a coolly raging gaze, Furiosa is a driver and a soldier. She is more than Max's equal in strength and tenacity. Unlike her male counterpart, she has the courage of her convictions, and an indomitable reserve of hope embodied in her memories of childhood spent in ""the green place"" -- a lost paradise governed by women, filled with plants and life. Our initial introduction to both these characters is brusque and peremptory. Almost before we're ready, we enter the wasteland, hotly pursued by a posse of souped-up vehicular maniacs. The film largely resembles one of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth's Ratfink cartoons come to wild life. This aesthetic is carried throughout, not just in the design of the cars and trucks bristling with sharpened spikes like so many fast moving sea urchins, but also in the people themselves. Pinioned, pierced and festooned in face and body, cheeks and mouths, slit wide and then stapled shut, they too resemble assemblages of bits and parts, repurposed and collaged together for maximum threat and hostility. In his attention to detail, Miller brings the goods in ripe, often overflowing abundance. Rich, thick Rococo embellishment abounds, lavished on like heavy icing on an overstuffed cake. It is luxuriant, generous, and occasionally bonkers. There is so much on display that the eye often struggles to keep up. This is a film that will no doubt keep fan boys and girls marvelling over the care and time allocated towards creating a fully realized world. But the filmmaker doesn't let detail clog the story -- the thing moves like it was on fire. Caught and caged within the first 10 minutes of the story, Max's wild bid for freedom functions as full-on immersion in the world of the film. His prison is a stone citadel, overseen by a dictator named Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne in a nice nod to the original film). Joe is a grotesquery that puts Darth Vader to shame, with his powdered pustule-ridden body, kohl-ringed eyes and breathing apparatus that resembled an old-fashioned bellows. His control over the ragged populace is kept in place by an army of soldiers called the War Boys -- a collection of young white men bubbling with tumours, who derive their allegiance to their leader from the idea that death in battle will result in life everlasting in Valhalla. A young War Boy named Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) provides much of this back-story. At least I think that he does; the speed with which he describes his society is sometimes hard to understand, with everyone yelling on about valor, victory and glory in Australian accents. But the basic gist is that whoever controls the resources controls the power, and so it is here as well. Precious water (pumped from an underground aquifer) is measured out just enough to keep the people in check. Old Immortan puts the dick in dictator in other classic ways, maintaining his lineage on the backs of a harem of beautiful young women that he keeps stowed away in an underground vault. Like Mormon wives, the women are kept impregnated and under tight control, breeding stock for the continuation of male power. Let me take a brief moment here to marvel at the men's rights groups who are calling for a boycott of the film, based on the idea that it is a female-led story. One wag called it a ""Trojan Horse"" feminist film. Feel free to scratch your head a little bit about this. Who would you relate to here? If it's some old white dude with a monster truck, and a bevy of Aryan followers, you might want to renew your white power membership, along with your men's rights card. But back to the story at hand! The action kicks off when the wives stage a jailbreak, helped along by Furiosa and her awesome truck, the War Rig, a majestic creature, bedecked and festooned with weapons of every stripe and powered by mother's milk. I kid you not -- breast milk is at the heart of this massive beast of a vehicle. But before you get stuck pondering such curious inclusions, the plot picks you up by the scruff of the neck and drags you along. The chase is on, and really the chase never stops, it just keeps going, getting bigger, wilder, and more gonzo cuckoo, picking up speed, until it rockets into your gut and brain. But despite the velocity with which the action takes place, the film maintains an internal narrative drive that never falters. Namely that we want these women and their unborn children to escape the clutches of the monster that would rape and imprison them. As the runaway women streak across the desert, Joe and his army of followers strap Max to the front of a moving vehicle and take off after them. Other male tribes (from Gas Town and the Bullet Farm, respectively) come to Immortan Joe's aid. These groups are presided over by male leaders with Elephantiasis, prosthetic noses and various other conditions. The men aren't looking so good. This is in stark contrast to the women who are sheathed in diaphanous muslin, glossy with good health and pampering. Indeed our first extended look at these babes finds them watering themselves down in the desert like they were on a Vogue fashion shoot. This posse of Apocalyptic supermodels initially comes across as little more than pretty cattle, but these women have grit, and soon enough, they're fighting for their own emancipation and freedom. They start by cutting off their chastity belts and leaving them by the side of the road. The Underground Railroad theme of liberating folk from sexual slavery is implicit, but like much of the film, it is only one more note in the grand Wagnerian thunder. Simply add it to score, like the trumpet blasts that mark the entrance of the Valkyries, and let this rock opera roar. Götterdämmerung and away we go! Hacking, shooting, slicing and dicing in a cacophony of screaming engines and bodies flying through the air like bits of ragged confetti. It is a veritable feast of old-fashioned ultra violence. Add in lighting sandstorms, leap-frogging motorcyclists, flame-shooting guitarists or best yet, the ""Vuvalini,"" a band of old lady bikers who maintain gardens in their handbags and fight like ancient wrinkly ninjas. Any film that makes a gang of weathered old grandmas into a super heroic fighting force has my full support. Is this film hysterical? Certainly. It is good dumb fun? Yes, indeed. But there is something more than just another science fiction romp. As curious as it may seem, you care that these characters survive in the face of the insanely ridiculous odds that are ranged against them. Here is where the film sets itself apart from the rest of the pack. It is equitable and fair in a way that few other action films are. Both men and women are given the scope to carve out their characters in the fullest spectrum of light and dark. I had every intention of liking the film, but this sense of justice made me love it. Tom Hardy, an actor of some power, supports the action, using his physical heft and his voice, a velvety cat-tongued thing that scratches and purrs to great effect. Theron embodies her own brand of heroic with solidity and strength. Whether she is smearing grease over her close-cropped hair or saving Max from certain death with her robot arm, the pair is well-balanced, and you root for them to see themselves in each other. In this, the film is oddly romantic, albeit of the doomed and desperate variety. But as the men discover, the love of a strong woman can make you a better man, and an even better road warrior. In the film's penultimate scene, when Max finally tells Furiosa his real name, making low noises of alarm in his throat, it is an act of bravery that surpasses hanging upside down on a moving truck.

"Aug 10, 2017"," This summer’s “Tomorrowland” from Disney and director Brad Bird and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a “reboot” of the original Mad Max trilogy from the 1970s and ’80s from Australian director George Miller, go together better than you might think at first glance. Seeing them in tandem makes all the difference. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the typical post-apocalyptic dystopian flick with themes of hope and redemption and regeneration. The lead characters are courageous, violent fighters and hope is a mirage. In “Tomorrowland,” the apocalypse is pending. There is still time to change, to do something. The main characters have optimistic energy, vision, and willpower. The only violence I recall is a bunch of human-looking robots are destroyed in a shop fight. “Tomorrowland” stops the forward — and backward — thrust of the “Mad Max” gaggle of mashed up reconstituted vehicles dead in their desert tracks and seems to ask, in a total un-Disney way, “Aren’t you tired of all these mayhem and scorched earth survivalist movies? Do you really think these cataclysmic events are inevitable? What about doing something to prevent these portent events in the first place? How and who would do it? The politicians? Corporations? Think again.” “Mad Max: Fury Road” features Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa (Latin for “furious commander”), a woman seeking redemption, though from what we will have to wait for the sequel to learn. She seems to be following the leader of a huge group of nuclear holocaust survivalists, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), but in their trek across a barren landscape, she strikes her own course toward the Green Place where she was born. Hidden inside Furiosa’s tanker are several women, kind of like “sister wives” to the scarred leader, Joe. They are breeders for his “family.” A true despot, Joe realizes something is amiss and the caravan goes after her. He controls everything at his headquarters, The Citadel, especially water, to keep the sick, poor, and damaged survivors at bay. Joe’s survivalists have captured Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) as a source of blood for Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Max and Nux are bound so he can keep the supply of blood going and they take off in pursuit of Furiosa’s rig, too. To make a long story shorter, both Max and Nux join the women with Joe and his minions in hot pursuit. After making it through a narrow canyon passage, arranged ahead of time by Furiosa, they encounter a group of older women, a remnant, protecting the desert of what used to be the Green Place.  They decide to return together to Joe’s Citadel because it has water. The oldest woman carries a bag with seeds in it; one has taken root and a flash of green leaves is pushing through. Off the survivors go, promising a sequel as the credits start to roll. Nothing about this story is tame. It is filled with relentless non-stop action, violence with a hint of humor. The mutant blind rock singer-flame thrower Doof Warrior (iOTA), who is strapped to one of Joe’s lead vehicles with bungee cords, looks like a leftover member of the Motley Crue. It is so incongruous that all you can do is laugh. There is mention of hope and redemption and life-giving water here and there. A priest friend wrote on Facebook that “Mad Max: Fury Road” is “socially corrosive” from beginning to end. Actually I think this is what the movie is about: the consequences of uncaring, socially corrosive behavior will lead to worldwide disaster. The question is: what do you do about it? How do you restore the environment, order, and life itself? It will take a spectacular cinematic dystopian revolution — at least this is where “Mad Max” leaves us as a sequel (or sequels) is surely coming — but so what? We’ve seen it all before just packaged differently. Children are made to kill children in “The Hunger Games”; the “Divergent” franchise, to me, is basically the same story. We can perhaps look to “The Giver” and “Fahrenheit 451” as the source of the post-apocalyptic genre in fiction and movies like “The Omega Man” in 1971. Hollywood keeps pumping out these movies, many based on popular novels, for new generations to flock to theaters to see, only to leave and wait for the next one. (Television’s fascination with the vampire sub-genre tells the same story: the end is near and life after is going to be hell.) Yes, there are those spiritual and religious themes that we console ourselves with. But then what? Although largely panned by critics, ideologically I found “Tomorrowland” to be a breath of fresh air amid the dystopian dust created by peat-and-repeat movies. Both films are fantastical imaginings of future cataclysms to come, one dark and the other much lighter, but “Tomorrowland” risks being different from all the other films in the genre because it appoints, practically anoints, those who can change the course of history. Go backward to 1964. Young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) makes his way through the crowds at the New York World’s Fair to the inventor’s pavilion. He is carrying his invention, a jetpack made from a vacuum cleaner, to enter a contest. Will his invention help make the world a better place? But the man in charge, Nix (Hugh Laurie), dismisses it because it is just for fun with no real purpose, though he knows Frank is a very smart kid. Instead, he introduces Frank to Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who seems to be Nix’s daughter (a Disney version of Nux in “Mad Max”?) Frank is smitten and Athena takes him on a tour of a place that exists in another dimension: Tomorrowland (drawn from Disney theme park’s Tomorrowland, of course.) Fast forward into the future, but not too far, and we meet Casey Newton (played by Britt Robertson; note the connection to the name Newton) who is very bright and dismayed at the bad news all around her. The earth is a scary place. It is decaying and the government is shutting down NASA, where her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) is an engineer. Britt seeks out Frank (George Clooney), now a recluse, and when Athena appears again, they fight off some robots and try to save both Tomorrowland and the earth. “Tomorrowland” makes a strong statement about setting aside politics and big profit corporations because of their failure to care for the earth, indeed their record of over-consuming and destroying resources and wants to encourage us to use our imaginations to solve the world’s problems — to let loose the creative energy of artists and scientists to change the inevitable doom that pop culture continually regurgitates for us. The evening news, local or national, report on environmental stories often, if we are paying attention enough to notice and ask questions. Or if we can connect the dots from art and current events that Pope Francis lays out for us in his encyclical, “Laudato Si’, on Care for Our Common Home” perhaps we can join the dreamers, artists, scientists and people of good will to make the changes needed to nurture and preserve the earth for everyone’s benefit, not just the rich and powerful. So why are we compelled to watch disaster as entertainment but as some do, refuse to acknowledge the human element to climate change and the consequences of scorched earth human activity unfolding in front of us? “Mad Max: Fury Road” and films like it, are actually prophetic. “Tomorrowland” takes the bold step of telling us directly what we can do because as loud and explosive as these other films are, we don’t seem able to see, hear, or understand. Maybe this is why Hollywood keeps making them. Regardless, are we not entertained, as Maximus (Russell Crowe) yells to the crowd in Ridley Scott’s 2000 “Gladiator”?  As far as the American film industry and the world audience go, isn't this all that really matters? For mindful viewers and creative people of good will, I hope not.",POSITIVE
"Jun 27, 2017"," Perhaps most insane of all, it’s as close to a futuristic feminist manifesto as any movie I’ve ever seen (the possible exception being Volker Schlondorff’s under-appreciated “The Handmaid’s Tale.” The credit goes to George Miller, who invented the “Mad Max” franchise almost 40 years ago. That particular Max was played with surly charisma and matinee-idol good looks by Mel Gibson. Aside from a car-strewn vision of a post-apocalyptic future, the “Max’s” have almost nothing in common — no more, say, than Roger Moore and Daniel Craig as 007. The outline is vaguely the same, but everything else is different. The new movie hits the ground running. In a briefly subdued introduction, Max (Tom Hardy) munches on a two-headed lizard and mutters, “My world is made of fire and blood. It was hard to know who was crazier — me or everyone else.” Within minutes, the smart money is on everyone else.  Max runs afoul of a tribe of albino baldies who control the water in this dehydrated dystopia. Their leader is Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter in the original movies)  — a brute whose human parts are barely held together by Hieronymus Bosch-like prosthetics. These War Boys, as they’re known, are experts at using other humans as commodities.  A dozen or more women are hooked up to giant pumps that continuously extract their breast milk.  Max himself is trussed up as a human blood bag attached to Joe’s sickly son Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Having sketched out the bare essentials, Miller then sends us on a non-stop two-hour chase that’s made all the more stunning by the filmmaker’s decision to eschew CGI effects as much as possible. So yes, those are stuntmen engineering those incredible smash-ups, riding motorbikes down impossible inclines or dangling over their quarry like demented escapees from Cirque de Soleil. And that quarry is: a onetime loyalist named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, still gorgeous despite her shaved head and robotic arm). On a seemingly routine petrol run, she’s gone rogue, making off with Joe’s most precious possessions. They are a quintet of scantily clad lovelies known as Breeders who apparently survived the Apocalypse by hiding out in a Victoria’s Secret store. Furiosa has vague pre-War Boys memories of a green place where she and her mother lived peacefully before being kidnapped. She intends to bring the Breeders there and Max, who’s graduated from blood bag to hood ornament, ends up on her side. Miller’s original Mad Max trilogy laid out the blueprint for countless future-set films that followed.  Here, he outdoes himself, ramping up the landscapes as much as the action.  A mad dash through a crazy-quilt rock formation suggests “Stagecoach’s” Monument Valley re-imagined by a visionary lunatic. A journey through a foggy quagmire, seemingly inhabited by crone/crane mutants, is eerily disturbing. “Mad Max: Fury Road” has all its teeth, too.  And then some. Because amidst all the sound and fury, Miller still made room for a human element. SaportaReport, founded in February 2009, is a trusted voice in metro Atlanta.

"Jun 23, 2017"," No movie has approached the post-apocalyptic genre quite as definitively as George Miller’s Mad Max series. The Australian director’s vision of a desert wasteland where warlords battle for fuel has been so influential that it remains the gold standard for many fans, and with good reason — the Mad Max films rank among the most bizarre imaginings of life after the fall of civilization. The world of Mad Max is inventive, violent, and straight-up weird. It’s a place where gang leaders have cult followings, the noise of revving engines is ever constant, and characters have names like The Lord Humungus, Toecutter, and Toast the Knowing. No, I am not kidding. It’s also a world filmgoers haven’t seen since the release of the third film in the series, Beyond Thunderdome, in 1985. Finally, thirty years later, we have a new entry, Mad Max: Fury Road. It was worth the wait. Miller’s latest octane-fueled adventure is a movie with a lot on its mind in addition to the wild costumes, crazy vehicles, and mind-blowing effects. The new film brings world-weary hero Max Rockatansky (played by Tom Hardy, taking over from Mel Gibson) to the Citadel, an oasis of sorts ruled by the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Captured for use as a walking blood transfusion for Joe’s warriors, Max escapes with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the driver of one of Joe’s tanker truck War Rigs. Furiosa is also carrying a dangerous set of fellow escapees: five young women (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) whom Joe has been using as his personal sex slaves. The strongest parts of the Mad Max films have always been effects and production design, and it’s thrilling to see Miller working with a budget that fits the scope of his ambitions. Immortan Joe and his army are pale, cancer-ridden beings, kept alive by complex sets of tubes and tanks. The cars look like the results of a demolition derby in hell. One even serves as a wall of amps for a mutant guitarist whose instrument doubles as a flamethrower. Again, not kidding. What’s also impressive is Miller’s ability to tell a clear story in the midst of non-stop action. Fury Road is essentially a two-hour-laong car chase, but within it, the characters, their motivations and conflicts remain discernable and compelling. Keeping all of that straight in a world that feels so different from our own isn’t easy to pull off — Avengers: Age of Ultron could barely manage it without the societal breakdown. But this isn’t just a movie about brooding wanderers and spectacular car crashes. The women of Fury Road are the ones who get most of the attention, and who are undeniably the heroes of the film. They are tough, and know how to take care of themselves, but also represent their world’s best hope for change. The film frequently juxtaposes the difference between their compassionate, renewal-focused instincts, and Immortan Joe’s destructive excess. Mad Max: Fury Road is a giddily entertaining film that sneaks in a progressive stance on women’s rights. What’s more, it does so in a way that serves the story and doesn’t feel forced. George Miller has told a story that feels authentic to the world he’s created, but that also takes it in a new and fascinating direction. It’s fantastic to have Max Rockatansky back on the road, but it’s even better that his creator has done so with a greater purpose in mind. We value your feedback on the articles we post.

"Jun 1, 2017"," In some ways, Fury Road is everything I expected. It is often cacophonous in its engine roar and explosive, well, fury. It is loud, and intense. But these things aren't enough now, in the two-decades-plus aftermath of Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the steadily escalating summer tentpoles that have followed. I feel desensitized to the computer-generated and often sterile destruction that's defined the arena these kinds of movies have operated in. It's not that I don't enjoy them, but my capacity for surprise is difficult to stir. Mad Max: Fury Road is ostensibly a sequel to the original 1979 film and its two follow-ups, but it appears free of much in the way of obligations to fiction or canon. You don't need to have seen any of them to grok the premise of this new film — that human nature, along with a helping of post-peak oil and weapons of mass destruction, has poisoned the world, leaving an archetypal post-apocalypse in its wake. Food is scarce, water is scarcer, and gasoline and the jury-rigged vehicles that require it rule everything. The titular Max (Tom Hardy) is a nomad survivor living in the wasteland, but the film doesn't mince words or script pages before he's captured and made a human blood bag for the minions of warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Immortan Joe's most accomplished field commander, has betrayed him, stealing away his ""wives"" and fleeing with a massive war rig. Max and Furiosa's paths collide, and the two must work together to survive and escape Joe's nightmarish, gasoline-fueled army. If this sounds insane, that's because it is. Fury Road spends scant few minutes establishing a hellscape full of war boys, bullet farms and Aqua Cola, and then lets it all go. What follows is a nearly relentless onslaught of beautifully orchestrated chaos, an artfully controlled explosion that erupts in waves over the course of 120 minutes, an extended chase scene that spends only minutes here or there allowing you to catch your breath. Fury Road diverges from any film being released this summer that might realistically be considered a peer or a competitor by virtue of its physical presence. There's little in the way of computer-generated destruction to be found here, outside of one particular sequence. Instead, director George Miller has captured some of the most incredible practical stuntwork I've ever seen. Massive, kit-bashed vehicles smash against each other in a film that is essentially one long chase scene. Fury Road offers a stark, limited color palette filtered through endless dunes and sand that puts an emphasis on motion. Despite its consistently high level of carnage, Miller keeps a tight rein on everything, avoiding the confusion and mess that plague so many summer event movies. The chases and wrecks are artfully choreographed, the constant motion tending toward the balletic. Despite the near-total display of fire and rage on screen, there's a perceptible sense of restraint at work in Fury Road. It's an intense, violent movie, but Fury Road never feels gratuitous with the gore, instead trading blood and dismemberment for a wrenching sense of impact as bodies are thrown against or from the vehicles that dominate the proceedings. That sense of economy extends to Fury Road's script as well. Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris have whittled it down to the barest essentials. It's a remarkable display of economy, and despite some occasionally wooden dialogue that scratches at the edges of disbelief, the story is a model of efficiency. This is all the more impressive because of the subtly subversive heart of the film — that it frequently doesn't feel like Max's movie at all. While Max gets the voice-over to begin the film, and his perspective establishes Miller's demented vision of the carpocalypse, it's Furiosa who finds a character arc and a kind of hero's journey. Even as Max and Furiosa work together, there's a clear sense of purpose to Theron's performance that's missing in Hardy's PTSD-plagued portrayal. Max's violence feels unhinged, like a force of nature, but Furiosa is the only character in the film that ever really finds catharsis. That catharsis is contagious. Fury Road is a shark, constantly moving, stripped down to the most basic, powerful elements needed to achieve its goals. Despite its big-budget trappings and wide release, there's a real sense of independence and auteurship on display, an energy, ferocity and fearlessness that this kind of film so rarely sees. Occasionally, we get a summer movie that has a chance to change things, to change the conversation, movies like 28 Days Later or The Raid. Fury Road belongs in that conversation, and sits next to them as something made to knock everything else on its ass.",POSITIVE
"Apr 26, 2017"," Yes, I know that Cannes is reckoned a citadel of capital-C cinemah, and yes I know that it’s famous for premiering art movies from all over the world. So it may sound a bit odd when I tell you that one of the best films showing here—maybe even the best—is a Hollywood action movie that’s opening tomorrow in the U.S. But I’m just back from this morning screening of Mad Max: Fury Road by the veteran Australian director George Miller, and I can only say that it’s one of the purest pieces of filmmaking virtuosity you’ll see anywhere. Set in a post-apocalyptic world run by thuggish armies, it stars Tom Hardy and a superb Charlize Theron as two tough-but-honorable renegades trying to escape along with a group of young women who’ve been held as slaves. That’s the whole plot, which is basically an excuse for long chase-and-battle sequences in trucks, cars, tanks, and motorbikes across inhospitable landscapes tinged gold or blue. This buzzsaw of action scenes is so dazzlingly original that it makes your Dark Knight, Avengers, and Spider Man showdowns look trite, dull, and unimaginative. (Unlike them, Miller made this stuff up rather than taking it from comic books.) Normally, when this kind of populist crowd-pleaser plays at Cannes—like Pirates of the Caribbean or Indiana Jones—it’s showered with boos from an audience that thinks of it as the embodiment of evil. Here, viewers not only applauded at the end, but even during the movie each time a bravura sequence came to an end. One famous critic even declared it “the best movie ever made.” Even if you don’t normally like action pictures, Mad Max will astound you. It’s a shame it’s not in competition. I can almost imagine the jury—headed by the Coen Brothers, who know good directing—giving it the Palme d’Or. But only almost. This is Cannes, after all. And it is the enduring genius of Cannes that it is always the same—crowds thronging the Croisette to get a glimpse of the stars, enormous billboards plugging movies you’ll never hear of again, TV cameras pushing into your face after screenings to get your reaction—yet it somehow manages to make every year feel different. One small way is with the official satchel they give everyone who’s part of the festival. Its omnipresence makes it one of the year’s trademarks—sometimes unhappily so, when the design is some shiny white plastic that looks like go-go boots from the sixties. The 2015 version is a real keeper. It looks like a classic child’s schoolbag but in bright blue—as if it had been designed by Wes Anderson. Civilians can see or even buy it here. Take the visibility of women. Last year, the festival was voluminously thumped for the absence of female filmmakers—so voilà!—this year’s opening night film, Standing Tall, wasn’t merely made by French actress Emmanuelle Bercot, but the red carpet was pointedly dominated by women: Natalie Portman (who’s making her directorial debut), Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts, Lupita Nyong’o, Chinese stars Fan Bingbing and Angelababy. Ruling the stairway to the Palais was Catherine Deneuve who, 71 years old and still starring in films, may be the closest thing there is to the Queen of France. She’s essentially playing the soul of France itself in Bercot’s movie, which starts off looking like a gritty movie about a troubled young man—played by charismatic newcomer Rod Paradot, who resembles a young Leonardo DiCaprio—but winds up being hymn of praise to the benevolent French social system. Deneuve plays a judge who, no matter how often he acts crazy or violent – he’s a kid stuck on fury road—still tries to see his best side and labors to save him with help from a social worker played by the French Sean Penn, Benoît Magimel. Naturally, she does. Just as naturally, it was adored by the French audience. As for the rest of the world, we snickered at the Gallic amour-propre, while admitting that by the standards of the famously dreadful opening-night fare at Cannes—last May was the risible Grace of Monaco—it was pretty good. And people are saying that Paradot is a real discovery. A more important discovery is that film is globalizing even faster than you ever imagined. Just as Hollywood movies are now made with foreign audiences in mind—meaning more action and less dialogue—so directors from outside the U.S. are learning that it’s hard to sell a film abroad in their own language with homegrown stars. This year’s competition includes two movies from Italy, one from Greece, and one from Norway, and what all four of their hot filmmakers have in common is that they’re working in English with stars you know from Hollywood. Last night was the first of them, Tale of Tales, one of the rare movies nowadays that tries to capture the primal feeling of real fairy tales rather than do a wised-up riff on them. Working from a classic book of fairy tales, filmmaker Matteo Garrone interweaves three stories about royalty—one about an overbearing queen (Salma Hayek) who’ll do anything to have a baby, another about a womanizing king (Vincent Cassel) who unwittingly tries to seduce a crone, and yet another about a ruler (Toby Jones) so obsessed with fleas that he marries his daughter off to an ogre. While the movie has an unsettlingly cross-cultural vibe—it looks like the characters should be speaking Italian instead of English—Garrone has a wonderful visual sense and, by the film’s end, builds to some genuine and startling emotion. It’s not a knockout like Mad Max: Fury Road, but heck, it would be a lot to expect two great movies from a festival that, as I write this, isn’t even 24 hours old.

"Oct 24, 2016"," By now, you’ve probably heard an incredible amount of hype for Mad Max: Fury Road: that it’s a non-stop car chase, an unabashedly feminist thrill ride, the bane of misogynists, and a critic’s wet dream.  With only two negative reviews out of 177 raves, the film currently stands at a 99 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and pundits are already analyzing its chances for Oscar success after its Cannes premiere generated multiple rounds of spontaneous applause throughout the film. So far the common theme among audience reactions seems to be “my head exploded.” Much has been made of the brilliance of director George Miller’s decision to create such a high-concept action film, but the mechanics of how he’s done that are even more breathtaking than the fact he dared to do it at all. Miller has taken the physical tropes of action films and re-imagined each one of them.  Instead of being a linear trajectory, the standard high-speed chase becomes a complete cat-and-mouse at one point, when the pursuer abruptly becomes the pursued. Instead of having a single threat from overhead in the form of an aircraft, Miller engineers a jawdropping sequence involving tall, swaying rigs on moving cars to create the harrowing, chaotic effect of innumerable villains dropping out of the sky. The chase ultimately extends off the ground and becomes the equivalent of the kind of three-dimensional battle you’d expect from Star Wars. And instead of a standard “fight-on-top-of-a-train” scene, Miller deconstructs and uses every part of a moving semi, while the camera moves in, around, and under high-speed vehicles with a fluidity that makes the cars themselves feel as though they’ve become a physical landscape.  Logically, a film this dedicated to action should have skimped on characterization; instead, Fury Road uses its lack of development for each character as an advantage rather than a hindrance. We don’t know why Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is seeking redemption here in the desert, but the glimpses we get of the Wasteland’s starving society and Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the despot she’s been working for, leave us with plenty of guesses. We don’t know the backstories of each of Immortan Joe’s escaped wives, the sex slaves whose flight catalyzes the events of the film; but at the same time we do, because the story of violence against women is universal. Before they escape, Immortan Joe keeps them in a large sealed vault—literally a giant locked safe. After they escape, his sole concern is with recapturing the potential sons they carry inside of them, which he refers to as his “property.” The women themselves are utterly disposable at his hands—the urgency of their escape isn’t just about escaping sexual subjugation, but about regaining their agency from a man whom Miller clearly intends to be read as a literal embodiment of patriarchal rule over all women. We don’t know why Tom Hardy’s Max carries his own Greek chorus, credited as “the Accusing Dead,” with him in his head, but we see in every wince and flinch away from human contact—wonderfully conveyed by Hardy even though he’s forced to wear an iron muzzle for the first 40 minutes of the film—that his particular brand of “madness” arises from guilt and loss. When they finally help one another to find the redemption they’ve been seeking, the emotional resonance feels like a more powerful climax for the film than any high-charged explosion could be.  There is an incredible tenderness at the center of Fury Road—it’s two hours of action, yes, but it’s also two hours of characters protecting one another, believing in one another, and deciding to trust in one another because it’s the human thing to do. We expect this kind of trust to be earned over time in the standard blockbuster, but we don’t expect it to be given on principle because characters are trying desperately to retain what makes them human. It’s one of the most subtle elements of Miller’s show-don’t-tell structure, and it makes an incredibly powerful impact.  Like the original Mad Max trilogy, Miller’s dystopia is drenched in political commentary, but while the film’s feminism has recently taken center stage, its environmentalism is far more strident—not in the least because its message of a world ruined by hopeless dependence on oil comes just days after the U.S. authorized the beginning of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a hotly debated issue that’s been the center of four decades of controversy. “Do not grow addicted to water,” Immortan Joe tells his parched people, “lest you start to resent its absence.” Nothing will grow in once-lush spaces in the Wasteland because Immortan Joe has pumped the water away from its sources and poisoned the soil through fracking. Fury Road is so overtly moralistic on the subject of conservation that the urgency of the chase eventually seeps into a kind of metaphor for climate change, in which humanity is racing barely ahead of its own environmental destruction. Yet as with all Gaia-centric views of the world, environmentalism and feminism go hand in hand. The Wasteland’s fabled “green place” is home to the clan of “many mothers,” one of whom has patiently carried seeds with her for years in hopes that finally something will grow. Female solidarity is the only thing that can topple Mad Max‘s patriarchy, the endless reign of Joe and his warboys. “Our sons will not be warlords,” the escaped slaves write on the vault he locks them in—along with: “Who killed the world?” Theron’s Furiosa is the most fully realized female action hero since Ripley. Like Ripley, she carries herself with a deep wariness, letting her actions speak for her, and rarely giving into despair. But unlike Ripley, she has aims of doing more than just surviving; her choice to help free the slaves sets off a chain of events that can only end in death or regime change.  At one point during Mad Max there are 12 women on screen and they all have speaking roles & none of them are talking about a man. It shouldn’t be groundbreaking for this many women to have roles in an action movie in 2015, but it is. But Fury Road as with most of its themes, is less concerned with preaching a philosophy of feminism to you than with letting the ideals of feminism speak for themselves. In this narrative, women aren’t expendable, negligent plot devices; they’re characters with just as much agency over the plot as any of the men.  Just as important is Hardy’s choice to play Max as a subtle, quietly feminist hero. Max never objectifies the women he’s with, or views them as props for his own agenda. He helps when he’s asked to help, and when he finally speaks for any length of time, it’s not to take charge of a group that’s floundering without his help—it’s to make a suggestion, stand back, and then let the group decide. This view of what equality actually looks like in a film is rare enough; but it’s even rarer to see it in this kind of genre material. Fury Road passes the Bechdel Test, of course; it also passes the Mako Mori Test, on at least seven different counts. Mad Max: Fury Road leaves those mediocre measurements of gender representation—which the vast majority of Hollywood films never even attempt to pass—so far behind that it seems almost silly even to use them as yardsticks in the wake of the strength of Fury Road‘s narrative. Other films that have had this level of active female representation have been written off by critics, either as being “girly,” or as portraying those characters as weak; but Fury Road is every inch the high-testosterone, manly action movie of your dreams. And even when they show weakness, its female characters are still fully in charge of their own destinies. It’s incredible how much that adds to the film. Mad Max: Fury Road could easily have been a gorgeous but hollow spectacle, reliant on its jawdropping practical effects and stunt work but not much else. Instead, it’s a gorgeous, fully realized spectacle with an unapologetic insistence on allowing women to form a part of its core narrative—and it will have Hollywood rethinking its tired, male-centric narrative tropes for years to come.

"Jul 14, 2016"," Mad Max: Fury Road doesn’t exactly feel like a narrative feature film. There are no character arcs to speak of. The plot is about as barebones as can be: Get from point A to point B, and don’t die. Dialogue is minimal. Motivations are obvious and unchanging and largely unexplored, which isn’t a problem given the production’s interest in the basest of instincts—the eternal social struggle between freedom and slavery. Rather, Mad Max: Fury Road feels like an extended special effects show, a two-hour-long ""sizzle reel"" designed to get you hyped for something bigger and more explosive. Though anything ""bigger and more explosive"" might have rather dire consequences for the planet: Action flicks don’t get any bigger or more explosive than Mad Max: Fury Road. We open with the titular mad man, played by Tom Hardy, staring out over a ledge. Images of his dead family flash through his mind. They have been reduced to ghosts haunting him for his failure to protect them after the world fell. The planet has been rendered one huge desert, an endless expanse of wind-blown sand swirling about the plains. Survival is the only thing that matters now—and surviving means staying on the move, constantly running from scavengers and brigands. Captured after attempting to flee one such band of raiders, Max is taken to a citadel held by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his sons, ""war boys"" whose bodies are painted white and who live only to die for their father. Caged, branded, and tattooed with his blood type, things are looking bad for Max until Joe realizes that Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has absconded with five of the beauties he keeps locked up for breeding. In order to bring Furiosa back—no mean feat, given that she’s driving a ""war rig,"" a sort of semi on steroids that is armed to the death—Joe sends his war boys after her. One of the war boys, Nux, is getting a blood transfusion from Max but desperately wants to go on the raid. So he chains his blood bag Max to the front of the car and takes off after Furiosa. For a movie titled ""Mad Max,"" it feels like Max is barely in it. Oh, he’s in it. He’s in almost every scene. But he’s very frequently not doing a great deal: For the first third or so of the flick he’s wearing a mask and strapped to the front of a car, and I would be surprised if the number of words he utters tops 300. Granted, Mel Gibson’s Max wasn’t exactly loquacious. But Hardy’s is almost mute. Indeed, it occasionally feels as though the movie should be titled Imperator Furiosa, ft. Max Rockatansky. Not that there’s anything wrong with that: Theron’s a fantastic actress and does ""intense anger"" about as well as anyone working today. But this movie is her story, not Max’s. It’s about her quest to save five women from sex slavery and, in the course of doing so, rediscover the land from which she had been stolen almost 20 years before. Director George Miller makes excellent use of non-traditional actors in Fury Road. The five aforementioned beauties are played by a veritable rainbow of models: the straw-blonde Rosie Huntington-Whiteley; the white-haired Abbey Lee; the redheaded Riley Keough; the brunette Courtney Eaton; and the raven-haired Zoe Kravitz (Kravitz and Keough are the only members of the quintet with more than a handful of IMDB credits). On the male side of the ledger you have Nathan Jones, an enormous Australian strongman who suffered a spiral fracture whilst arm-wrestling the equally enormous Magnus Samuelsson. Miller employs these folks for a reason: They look cool. A coterie of leggy models wearing wispy fragments of clothing in the desert is a striking image, just as there’s something striking about a man-mountain, deltoids bulging, hoisting the engine of a car above his head even as the vehicle is doing 80 miles per hour on the desert flats. If you’re into watching a bunch of things that look cool killing each other for two hours on the big screen—and really, who isn’t into that?—then Fury Road will be to your liking. And if you’re not? Well, there’s always Pitch Perfect 2. One final note: Please don’t see this picture in 3D. The director himself prefers two dimensions. If you pay extra money to see this movie in 3D, you will not only deserve the eye-ache that you get, but you’ll also be rewarding an evil, immoral corporation that is trying to separate you from your money by forcing you to watch something you don’t want.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2016"," If you want a vision of the future, at least from George Miller's perspective, picture a boot stamping on a human face for about two hours. Those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorched-earth action extravaganza, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" — it's hard to remember the last time a summer tent-pole movie over-delivered in the ways this does. In resurrecting the Australian post-apocalyptic road-movie series that made his name — and launched Mel Gibson's career — over three decades ago, Miller has skipped the salad and gone straight for the steak. Never mind that his last live-action feature was ""Babe: Pig in the City"" in 1998, ""Fury Road"" is a master-class in cinematic onslaught. It's as if the director had taken the climactic tanker-chase sequence from ""Mad Max 2"" and strung it out into an entire film. It's exhilarating, but also exhausting. Working with cinematographer John Seale and editor Margaret Sixel (who is also Miller's wife), the 70-year-old director adopts an approach that could almost be called old-school, especially when compared to the weightless CGI that defines most big-budget action flicks nowadays. His set pieces — and this is a film that consists of little else — have a pleasing sense of gravity and physical heft to them, the product of bravura stunt work, judicious digital tweaking and lots of heavy metal colliding. There's real coherence in the way they're spliced together: The shots all connect, and only in the most frenzied moments does it become hard to parse what's going on. In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," As the film begins, Max has been captured by the War Boys, a breed of ghostly white, bald man-children—scarred and stapled and riddled with bulbous tumors—bred to be Immortan Joe’s fighters. Max, his face partly covered by a Bane-style iron mask (curious, since Hardy also played Bane), is to serve as a human blood supplier for the War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), until he manages to escape when Immortan Joe’s army goes after a rogue commander named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Furiosa is certainly the film’s best creation—a bald she-warrior with a metal arm, a giant smoke-belching war rig, and a righteous cause. She’s trying to bring Immortan Joe’s Five Wives to the childhood home that she barely remembers, a utopian land of female warriors.

"May 28, 2016"," The production company logos that open George Millerâs Mad Max: Fury Road are accompanied by the deep rumbling of a loudly revving engine â and good luck finding a more appropriate starter pistol for this movie, which is like a machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours. Millerâs last entry in the Max franchise, which has run the gamut from grubby low-budget exploitation movie to pricey studio blockbuster, was 1985âs Beyond Thunderdome, where (in something of an artistic suicide) he saved the seriesâ signature motif of tricked-out post-apocalyptic vehicles roaring across the desert plain for the final 20 minutes of the movie. No such restraint is shown here. Fury Road is for all intents and purposes a 120-minute chase, where the focal vehicle must keep moving, and thus, so must the movie. But thereâs more happening here than empty spectacle, which has drawn the ire of some of the Internetâs more odious commentators. Later for them. Socio-political ramifications aside, Fury Road is, plain and simple, a bracing, sublime, towering slab of cinema, a rare thriller that actually, yâknow, thrills. Fair warning: it takes some time to get going, as re-introductions and (often muddy) exposition are necessary. Tom Hardy steps into Mel Gibsonâs iconic role of Max Rockatansky, haunted by voices and nightmare visions, captured and kidnapped into a terrifying dystopia ruled by the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne â yes, the same Hugh Keays-Byrne who played The Toecutter in the original film, which is a lovely Easter egg for longtime fans). Max is kept alive merely as a âblood bagâ for Nux (an unrecognizable Nicholas Hoult), one of the many bees of Joeâs horror hive, sent across the desert on a supply mission. Leading that charge is Imperator Furiosa (a grease-browed Charlize Theron), who suddenly changes course and sets off the pursuit. These opening scenes are the rockiest; Miller struggles a bit with his tone, the storytelling is heavy on the gibberish, and the first chase, while technically dazzling, isnât all that involving. (The general murkiness of the early scenes is done no favors by the inevitable darkening of 3D projection; do yourself a favor and seek it out in 2D, the filmmakerâs preference.) For this viewer, the movie doesnât come alive until the action scene that follows: a rough-and-tumble bit of hand-to-hand combat between Max, Nux, Furiousa, and her precious cargo: the âFive Wivesâ of Big Bad Joe (played by ZoÃ« Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton). Itâs a sequence of intense ingenuity and constantly shifting power dynamics, and it brings the picture to life for one simple reason: first we were just looking at machines, but now weâre looking at people. And understanding those people makes the subsequent scenes of their machines matter more. Yet thatâs not all that makes Millerâs work as an action director so stunning, and what separates him from the monotonous bigger-louder-faster likes of Michael Bay or the Furious artiste of your choice. Itâs that he understands, and employs in his set pieces, such inchoate yet frequently absent principles as geography, rhythm, and tempo. Much has been made of the ferocity of the editing â 2700 cuts, per the filmmaker. But it doesnât feel as choppy and discombobulated as, say, a Transformers movie, because those films seem cut to disorient while creating the impression of speed and excitement, while Miller (and his editor, and wife, Margaret Sixel) situate the viewer within the sequence to create actual speed and excitement. And, even more revolutionarily, they vary that speed throughout the picture, shifting gears like the drivers of those big rigs, which goes a long way towards keeping viewers from feeling like theyâve been bashed in the head with a fucking hammer for 120-plus minutes. (It doesnât hurt that heâs also more inclined towards practical effects than computer-generated ones, which gives the action far more weight and heft than the collections of 1s and 0s that pass for stunts nowadays.) As Fury Road geared up for its magnificent climax, I was reminded of a Quentin Tarantino interview where he recalls seeing John Wooâs A Better Tomorrow II for the first time, with a friend who turned to him at about the same point and posited, âIf they donât get naked and boogie at the end of this movie, this has been for nothing.â Have no fear â Miller gets naked and boogies. That final chase is, quite simply, one for the books, a dazzling delirium of dust and fire and sheer kinetic force. Miller zips his camera, pulls out his sound, wails his punches, and bangs and fuses his shots up against each other like a welder. It is bonkers, and it is brilliant. And here we are, nearly 700 words in, and Iâve barely mentioned the people that populate this film â which says more about the elegance of the style than the purveyors of its substance. Hardy is, unsurprisingly, a perfect Max, easily sliding into the wandering gunslinger archetype (lest we forget, he was introduced in Thunderdome as âthe man with no nameâ), his two or three moments of fleeting humor and/or humanity shrewdly parsed out over the narrative. He is, as usual, a man who does more than he says; Miller regards him in much the same manner. (Thereâs a wonderful bit where he doesnât even bother to follow Max away from the group on a solo sidebar â he merely regards his condition as he leaves, and as he returns.) Heâs great, and the titleâs the title, but this is unquestionably Theronâs movie. She works with authority, fights like a badass, thinks on her feet, and generally wrecks shop, and if you can make it through the scene where she hoists a rifle onto Maxâs shoulder, takes careful aim at an approaching vehicle, and growls âDonât breatheâ and not burst into applause, well, youâre made of stronger stuff than I. But when she lets out her howl of rage and grief at what should be the culmination of a physical and emotional odyssey, it becomes clear that sheâs the character at the pictureâs center. Sheâs the one who takes the risk, and who takes the journey; thatâs the way these movies work. Max took his the first time out, and serves as an aide and/or inspiration in subsequent installments. Much of the advance word on the movie, even before its Menâs Rights Activist âboycott,â held that her character and story gave the film a decidedly feminist bent, but this isnât a case of half-hearted âfemale stuffâ or the current vogue of ââ¦but with ladiesâ repurposing. The Eve Ensler consulting hire actually makes sense in the context of the movie; this is a story of survivors of sexual violence, fighting back and reclaiming themselves. That they are first revealed in a vaguely eroticized bit with a water hose is a clever bait-and-switch on Millerâs part, and a sly acknowledgment of the way (as writer Matthew Monagle notes) exploitation filmmakers have, from the Corman era forward, smuggled progressive messages into their genre sheepâs clothing. And to that specific point, charge-leading MRA garbage person Aaron Clarey is right when he accuses Miller of using the Max franchise and action cinema in general as a âTrojan Horseâ for a feminist message, though heâs wrong about absolutely everything around that point (his insistence that the Australian-made Max films are âAmerican cultureâ and his declaration that ânobody barks orders at Mad Maxâ seem to imply that heâs never actually seen a Mad Max film, and his Chicken Littling about how âfeminism has infiltrated and co-opted Hollywoodâ seems to imply that heâs never actually seen a movie, period). Make no mistake: via this smashing, thrilling, crowd-pleasing studio summer blockbuster, a decidedly pro-woman, pro-victim, pro-empowerment message will reach an audience that might notâve gone looking for it. And that, friends, is even more delightful than a movie that pisses off a bunch of knuckle-dragging, retrograde, retroactive, mouth-breathing MRAs.",POSITIVE

	""Mad Max: Fury Road"", la nueva película de Mad Max del australiano George Miller tuvo su premiere mundial en un contexto de privilegio, en el marco de la 68 Festival de Cannes, con lo que se refrenda la adoración que el certamen francés siente por Hollywood. La película se exhibió fuera de competencia pero es de esos títulos que atraen multitudes, reflectores y mucha promoción que le viene bien a Cannes. La proyección concluyó con una ovación de los asistente al Gran Teatro Lumière, la sala más importante de la Croisette, lo que significó un recibimiento más que satisfactorio para la película que protagonizan Charlize Theron y Tom Hardy, quienes estuvieron presentes en la alfombra roja. 
	""Mad Max: Fury Road"" es un reboot de la saga que interpretó y que hizo famoso al actor Mel Gibson, allá en los inicios de los ochenta del siglo pasado. En ese sentido, retoma el espíritu y el ambiente de un mundo postapocalíptico (muy claramente en el segundo filme), un planeta arrasado y erosionado donde los supervivientes conforman tribus y hordas salvajes, feudos dominados por tiranos despiadados que pelean por el agua o la gasolina. 
	El filme abre con Max (Tom Hardy), un ex policía que se encuentra a la deriva después de perder a su familia y a su hija. Así, es capturado por las huestes del Inmortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) un deforme y aberrante tirano que controla a un pueblo segmentado en guerreros, obreros y lumpen. El Inmortal Joe abre y cierra a su conveniencia las compuertas del agua y así mantiene sometidos a sus súbditos. Max es torturado en las catapultas, mientras sale una misión dirigida por la guerrera emperatriz Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a traer combustible de otro pueblo a cambio de agua. Pero a medio camino, Furiosa se desvía para fugarse, pues lleva a bordo un cargamento secreto: las hermosas esposas de Inmortal Joe,. El villano y sus hombres comienzan su persecución por el desierto y Max es forzado a ir con
	ellos. 
	""Mad Max: Fury Road"" responde suficientemente a las expectativas pero no va más allá de ellas: es una larga persecución llena de emboscadas y combates con estrambóticos vehículos en marcha. La mayor apuesta se ofrece a partir de una puesta al día de su estética y narrativa, Resulta así una fábula futurista de mucha violencia y crueldad, pero con una carga de fantasía que la vuelve irreal. El director, apoyado en el fotógrafo John Seale, el escenógrafo Colin Gibson y el editor Margaret Sixel, utilizan la cámara rápida y el ralentí con eficacia, una paleta de colores dominada por el ocre, así como un maquillaje y vestuario vistoso, que crean una distorsión visual que lo aproxima al cómic. El otro componente importante son los efectos visuales, que conforman el corazón de la propuesta.",POSITIVE
"Apr 27, 2016"," Yes, Fury Road is, of course, yet another remake, reboot or re-imagining with veteran Australian director George Miller returning to the character which he first unleashed in his original gnarly 1979 B-picture, a film which also made a star of a young Mel Gibson. Seventy year-old Miller, whose biggest other hits as a director have been the Babe and Happy Feet movies, might seem to have long moved on to gentler, greener pastures. But his fourth Max is just as berserk as any of the others. It seems Miller has gone back to Road Warrior - the previous maddest of this Maxes - for the brutal tone of this. While cannibalizing bits of the earlier films and their mythology, Fury Road stands apart from them too. You don't need to have seen them to get a kick out of this. But it will also reward your affection for the old movies too. While the previous flicks had an identifiably Australian setting - they came juiced by Aussie petrolhead and bikie culture - this one, shot mostly in the eye-scorchingly epic deserts of Namibia, exists in a post-everything world of its own. And, despite Tina Turner's Thunderdome theme of old, Miller did need another hero. He's effectively got two. There's Tom Hardy as Max, a guy who is neither as pretty or as talkative as his predecessor but clearly more damaged. She starts out as the amputee bionic-armed road warrior in the service of Immortan Joe, the grotesque despot - though he does have Tina's hair - who rules over the Citadel, a rock city towering above the desert. Played behind the oxygen mask by Hugh Keays-Byrne who was villain The Toecutter in the first Max, Joe is a tyrant with a hydrant, rationing water to the dirt-dwelling rabble below. When Max is taken prisoner in the Citadel, he ends up as a blood donor to ailing war boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) whose genes are suffering a radiation hangover from whatever turned to the old world to dust. When Furiosa decides one of her fuel delivery trips will be an escape for her and Joe's harem, a muzzled Max ends up as a hood ornament cum drip stand on the front of a Nux's pursuing car. Eventually, Max winds up, still with enough plasma, aboard Furiosa's heavily-armed road train tanker carrying Joe's willowy young brides to their desert sunset fashion shoot ... ah, no some sort of sanctuary. That's just one of half a dozen or more spectacular vehicular battles rendered often in long takes with little visible digital effects enhancement. Miller who also brings back some of the early films' trademark overcranked speed-zooms. Visually, Fury Road is also a movie of stark beauty, especially in the few minutes of its 120 on screen it decides to sit still and take in the scenery. This is a car chase movie which brings its own band along. One of the chase vehicles carries a flame-throwing metal guitarist backed by a tribal mass percussion section. Max himself sure isn't a lot of laughs. Hardy only has a few lines, his back story filled in with nightmare flashbacks, one looking like it's lifted a frame of one of Max's former victims from the early films. But he's a commanding presence. No, Furiosa can't save those girls - ho ho - single-handed. But she's the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie.",POSITIVE

"Mar 15, 2016"," Your first thought watching Clouds Of Sils Maria is that you don't envy writer-director Olivier Assayas having to manoeuvre Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart about a filmshoot in the Alps. To be fair, there's a chemistry between the two famously mercurial leading ladies that makes perfect sense, while also suggesting Assayas may have something of a magic touch. It is a dominant factor in why this elegant, ponderous European film works on the levels that it does. Binoche is Maria Enders, an ageing screen goddess travelling with her vaguely emo PA Valentine (Stewart) to accept an award on behalf of the aged playwright who gave her her first break. He passes away en route, they discover, and soon afterwards an edgy young director asks her to appear in his new production of the same play - only this time as the tragic elder of the two central female protagonists. Maria and Valentine decamp to the Alpine home of the late writer to rehearse. Of course, that's only part of what goes on. There's lots of metadramatic undulations as Maria faces usurpation by the bratty starlet set to play opposite her (Chloë Grace Moretz). All the while, smudges appear as Maria and Valentine collide at varying temperatures. It's chatty and meanders a bit, but there's a hypnotic, unfixed ambience to Clouds of Sils Maria that is wholly compelling (and more than likely intentional on Assayas' part). Full of wit, wisdom and knowing glances it may be, but it's earthy and sensuous too. A mature, perceptive drama for grown-ups. A NEW British royal has just landed in this world but don't expect Princess Charlotte to get a viewing of this problematic comedy-drama about her great-grandmother and great-grandaunt itching for a night out on the tiles to celebrate VE Day in 1945. Playing Elizabeth is David Cronenberg favourite Sarah Gadon alongside Bel Powley's more unruly Margaret. They implore King George (Rupert Everett) and the Queen (Emily Watson) to let them on the loose but quickly shake their military escort and are dazzled by the lairy hubbub. Soon Liz is skipping through the braying streets of London in search of her sister who has run off with some pilot and is now in the back room of a brothel. (Yes, you read that correctly). Helping her negotiate such frightful things as buses and people is Jack Reynor's robust squaddie (helpfully called Jack). A Royal Night Out fancies itself as some kind of Richard Curtis pastiche whereby the beautiful caged princess gets swept off her plummy vowels by Jack's everyman (who of course has no idea what or who she is). The problem is that these are real people who are alive and well and sitting on thrones. So it's not really spoiling things to say that at the very logical moment when our two handsome young leads should lock lips in romance, the camera has to swing away awkwardly so as not to get anyone into any trouble. This gives the entire operation a hollow, ultimately conflicted feeling. It has its charms - a jazz-age fizz, Powley's gooning, a tasteful aesthetic - but it is too lightweight. Wicklowman Reynor, meanwhile, struggles with the London accent. It's been three years since Pitch Perfect proved a surprise box office hit. The story of the Barden Bellas, the a-cappella girl group fighting the boys for competition supremacy, surfed the Glee wave by adding a bit of knowing humour and proving far less derivative than expected. The sequel finds the young women nearing graduation and thinking somewhat vaguely of the future. It's a consideration made all the more important in the opening scenes when the Bellas, having reigned supreme for those three years, face the ignominy of failing in front of President Obama. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) suffers a wardrobe malfunction during a Wrecking Ball-style aerial number and the world gets a chance to see what type of waxing she favours. Stripped of their titles and overloaded with shame the only way that the Bellas can get reinstated is if they win the World Championships in Copenhagen. Their main rivals are German uber group Das Sound Machine, perfect specimens of somewhat fetishistic a-cappella greatness.Cue some arguments, sing-offs and lots of great singing. Beka (Anna Kendrick) is the only one seriously considering a future after college as she gets a secret internship in a recording studio. There's also a new recruit, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who is keen to sing her own compositions, and presumably take on the mantle when Kendrick, Wilson et al graduate. Kay Cannon's script is sharp in some places like the digs at casual misogyny. Conservative America's assumption that a bit of female anatomy is the worst thing ever is a case in point and the thoughtless insults delivered by the commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) are the most consistently funny parts of the film. The other humour is a bit more hit and miss and Rebel Wilson starts to grate after a while. Overall the script does feel a bit formulaic and contrived in parts, I especially didn't like the parts that were meant to be heartfelt, but perhaps I'm just a heartless ould boot. There are lots of cameos and a good few laughs and on the whole lots to enjoy for fans of Glee style musicals, and fans of the first film won't be disappointed. It also happens to be Elizabeth Banks' feature directorial debut and she does it well. The gods may have chucked all kinds of obstacles - from unfavourable exchange rates to actual wars - in the way of this belated fourth instalment of George Miller's gasoline-soaked western but it has been worth the wait. Such a wobbly genesis combined with a monstrous budget ($150m) and comparable storyline could have seen Mad Max: Fury Road go the way of Waterworld (shudder). The key here is that Miller himself is still at the helm, and he's had a long time - 30 years since Tina Turner cackled in Beyond Thunderdome - to think about just how he wants his legacy to remain intact. Controversial mainstay Mel Gibson is dropped from the role of the titular road warrior for Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception). Mad, tormented and murmuring sparsely in a Lee Marvin burr, Hardy does nicely as the brave loner reluctantly helping Charlize Theron's traitor guide five young women across the scorched nothingness of post-apocalyptic Oz. They are on the run from Immortan Joe (Hugh Keys-Byrne), a monstrous dictator, and his army of tooled-up and revved-up War Boys who rampage over the sands. The word electrifying is flung about too lightly in describing action cinema, but Fury Road is certifiable in this respect. There is barely any let-up over its two hours of grinding, white-knuckle gear changes, crashes and explosions. Max and his charges are hunted from one knife edge to the next, and talk is kept to a minimum. It could be tedious if it wasn't so downright stylish and smart. Miller now ranks alongside Gilliam, Lynch, Burton et al as one of cinema's more distinct visionaries thanks to this elseworld of warped, hideous survivors and bizarre contraptions. I confess that the prospect of two hours of a Ukrainian film with no words, just sign language and no subtitles did not fill me with great excitement. Yet Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy's writing/directorial debut is one of the most remarkable films of the year. Slaboshpyrskiy has said that his dream was to pay homage to the silent movie, and in this he does it in an extraordinary way. Unlike other productions which feature deaf characters in a hearing world this is total immersion in a world where everyone is deaf. Sergey (Grigoriy Fesenko) arrives in a large institution for deaf teenagers and must negotiate his place in a well-established hierarchy. There are rites of passage to accede to the most powerful levels of this hierarchy which is built largely on an after school hours schedule of crime and prostitution. At night, with the help of the woodwork teacher, the young men go out to mug people and drink. Two of the young women, Anna (Yana Novikova) and another unnamed (Rosa Babiy) are transported to have unprotected sex with lorry drivers with the ultimate aim of getting them to work in Italy. When Sergey falls in love with Anna the rules are broken and the balance tipped. There is a kind of Lord of The Flies vibe and much of it is graphic and unflinching. For one protracted scene, raw in terms of both visuals and emotion, I simply had to look away. A tough film but with many rewards.",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2016"," A sequel being released 30 years after its predecessor must be something of a record. But in fairness to George Miller he's been planning this film since 1988. In the original Mad Max, a transgressively violent dystopian thriller, Miller and Mel Gibson had made their names telling the story of Max Rockatansky, a motorcycle cop adrift in post-apocalyptic Australia. Released in 1980, the film was dismissed as tasteless schlock by critics but would soon become a cult classic, and it spawned two sequels, Mad Max 2 (1981) and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985). By the time that last film came out, critics such as Roger Ebert had begun to realise what Miller was up to, and that his films were full of style and ideas, as well as gore. The story for Mad Max: Fury Road occurred to Miller in 1988, and he conceived the film as a road movie in which Max and his antagonists are fighting not over precious resources, but enslaved people. It took him more than a decade to find the time to make it, and in 2001 was all set to begin shooting when 9/11 happened. A 2003 attempt was shut down mainly because of the outbreak of the Iraq War, and after that Mel Gibson appears to have lost interest. Heath Ledger was considered as his replacement but, after his death, when Miller returned to the project in 2010, Tom Hardy was cast as Max. That sort of production history usually results in a stinker, but Mad Max: Fury Road is a wonderful exception to the rule. Because it's a scintillating action picture, breathlessly edited, glorious to look at. Poor Max is still wandering Australia's desert wastes in the aftermath of civilisation's collapse when he's captured by feral soldiers, and taken to a remote desert kingdom. The Wasteland is a kind of feudal fascist state ruled by a growling, bellicose tyrant called King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls the water supply and ekes it out to a pathetically grateful horde of underlings. Bizarrely, Immortan Joe farms hefty women for their milk, which is considered a bit of a delicacy, and also maintains a harem of girls intended to provide him with heirs. Other slaves, Max among them, are used by the king's sickly warriors for transfusions of healthy blood, but while he's being dragged on a convoy across the desert he manages to escape. And when he stumbles on a group of young women who've sneaked out of Wasteland, he finds common cause with their tight-lipped leader, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), and they began a battle to escape to freedom together. The plot of Fury Road is deliberately basic. Miller never makes the mistake of explaining too much about his apocalyptic world, and little hints here and there invite you to fill in the gaps yourself. Instead he focuses entirely on the momentum of what, after 20 minutes of scene-setting, essentially becomes an extended chase movie. For this is a nightmarish future, in which all legal checks have been removed leaving the strong to prey on the weak with impunity. Bits and pieces of pop culture have survived in the bizarre pageantry of the king's retinue, which includes massed kodo drummers and a manic electric guitarist suspended off the front of a moving truck. One-armed and crew-cut, Charlize Theron is still the best-looking person in the movie, though Rosie Huntington-Whiteley gives her a run for her money playing one of the king's heavily pregnant concubines. Perhaps it's the writing, or maybe Tom Hardy's puzzling reluctance to seize the spotlight, but this is Ms Theron's picture, and her intensity and tenaciousness steals every scene from Hardy's gloomy and curiously lifeless Max.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2016"," What a ride of a movie! If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is the ultimate rollercoaster thrill about what motor vehicles are capable of, then you are dead wrong. Master director George Miller, the creator of the “Mad Max” series that began in 1979 proves once again that he is at the top of his game with ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" which hits theaters on Friday. Yes, surely there must be some CGI, but the kind of CGI in this movie is only supplementary to what the filmmakers have achieved on the set -- this set being the deserts of Namibia. For those who are accustomed to the series, this film will not disappoint with regard to its unique dystopian spirit and quality of craftsmanship. For those who are newcomers, it will bring on a whole new world of vigor and blow their minds. I might sound like I'm exaggerating, but “Fury Road's” 120 minutes of filmmaking is spotless and tight as a rope with no room for maudlin or cheesy valor. The movie is set in the near future in an Australia gone haywire, where the remains of civilization have been devoured and overthrown by highway gangs, and water and oil have become rare resources. In this post-apocalyptic world, one such gang, led by the evil dictator Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), has set up a neo-capitalist community run on slavery and exploitation. The canyon where Immortan Joe has set up his regime has water, but he dispenses it to his people scarcely and rarely. That is not the only problem though; he owns thousands of men who call themselves ""war boys,"" high on blood, anarchy and violence, and ready to kill, rape and destroy at Joe's will. Max (Tom Hardy taking over Mel Gibson's throne) is a traumatized, lone man caught by the gang as a ""blood bag."" His voice-over clearly states what he is and thinks of himself: ""I am a man haunted by the dead and hunted by the living, I have only one instinct left, and that is survival."" The action begins immediately. Joe's right hand, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, showing once again what a talent she is), is set to lead a convoy of vehicles into a city where there is gas to refill their petrol on a huge rig that looks not like a truck but like a war machine. At this point it's important to note that the vehicle modifications in the series are legendary for their strange industrial design and lethal potential. Driving the huge rig, we notice her cool but worried expression; there is something utterly wrong here. Soon enough it is clear that she is trying to save a handful of women used for breeding purposes from the clutches of Joe and take them to her childhood home called ""The Green Place."" Joe catches on to what she's doing and goes after her with his own army of war vehicles. And the endless chase begins in the vast deserts of Australia, as we watch the two groups in constant motion in a cat and mouse game that is truly fit for a cruel and relentless world where the weak and dumb die immediately. Max accidentally ends up in Furiosa's crew and finds himself aiding their getaway, with his own freedom also in mind. Epic music blasts away constantly as the endless master-shots and close-ups of those involved in the chase are thrown before us for our pure primordial need for adrenaline and fear. We are always on the edge of our seats, with no chance to breathe, as we helplessly remain awestruck in the visual kinetics and acoustic splendor of this film. But it's not just about the thrill and post-punk atmosphere; Miller's cinematic language is not at all vapid on a philosophical level, and he makes it his main aim to show us what a dreadful place the world can be if left to the clutches of human greed. One might think there is no branch of hope to hold onto here, but one would be very wrong, for Miller also puts forth a very feminist, egalitarian and just point of view through the character of Furiosa and her band of women who gradually transform into a beacon of freedom and solidarity. They become the only hope humanity is left with. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" captures the joy and style of what action cinema once was -- a good story with convincing characters supported by the stunning choreography of cinematography, editing and production design. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu has gone to the Silopi district of Şırnak province, where a curfew that had been in place for months ended in January.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2016","  George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road is the potent, powerful tonic we never knew we needed. The fourth installment in his Mad Max franchise is an overwhelming reminder of the unique places blockbuster filmmaking can go if we take off the shackles and let it run wild to places that can be magnificent even though they might also be rancid, putrid, and disgusting. The film’s post-apocalyptic wasteland is a marvel to behold and festers inside one of the best action films we’ve seen in decades. Miller not only creates one of cinema’s all-time best chases, but he goes a step further to transform the story into a celebration of feminism striking back against patriarchy. It may be a patriarchy riddled with gout and wielding chainsaws, but no blockbuster has delivered its message with such verve and bravado.   Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) was a cop before the world fell apart from nuclear war and ripped asunder by the need for water and fuel. Trying to live alone in the wasteland, Max is captured by war boys, a group of young, pasty, dark-eyed men who blindly follow the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has power only because he controls water and food. Meanwhile, Joe’s lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) pretends like she’s making a trip to Gas Town on behalf of the demented leader, but instead had gone rogue to protect The Wives—five young women who are used by Joe for the purposes of breeding. When Joe discovers Furiosa has betrayed him, he sends out his war boys, which include Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who drags Max along because he needs the Road Warrior’s universal blood type. Eventually, Max and Furiosa’s paths collide and they must drive to the safety of “The Green Place”.   Fury Road never apologizes for being weird. It never winks at the camera. No one questions names like “Gas Town”. The only way to live in the broken world presented by Mad Max is to never question it. Miller doesn’t want to turn off our brains or shock us into submission. He wants us to jump into a grimy, filthy pit that’s endlessly fascinating. In the world of Mad Max, everything—including and especially human beings—is a resource, and while Miller maintains the essence of his previous Mad Max films (not an easy task considering their vast differences), he paints his richest picture on the biggest canvas. The film’s designs are consistently grotesque but also absolutely breathtaking. The movie is beautiful in its ugliness. Miller fills his movie with freaks and rejects who now rule the world, and shows that this is a setting that has truly gone “mad”.   That insanity extends to the action. The film is one long chase scene. We get a brief appetizer as Max tries to escape from prison on foot, but the real pursuit begins with Furiosa goes on the run. From there, the movie rarely takes a moment to breathe as Max, Furiosa, and their passengers try to fend off rampaging hoards of bandits.   Miller’s film is a standout in the genre not only because the set pieces are terrifically designed, but also because they have weight. CGI is a marvelous tool, but it’s become the only tool current blockbusters employ to get thrills from the audience. There’s still some CGI in Mad Max, but it’s used mainly to provide texture to the environment such as crowds and putting Joe’s insignia on the side of a mountain. When it comes to the action, the movie is hardcore, explosive, gleeful destruction as a unique assortment of vehicles comes bearing down on Furiosa’s war rig. Fury Road demands to be seen on the biggest screen and with the loudest speakers.   Despite the assault of action mayhem, the movie never becomes prideful, and maintains an offbeat sense of humor that goes beyond cartoonish violence. Miller manages to wrap the film’s strangeness in its visuals. For example, the muzzle Max is forced to wear also represents the guilt he feels over the people he couldn’t save. If Max refuses to do anything other than “survive”, he may as well be a desperate hood ornament on Nux’s car. It’s not until he chooses to live for others that he becomes more than a muzzled blood bank. This thematic richness pushes Mad Max beyond a visual feast and into a film that’s surprisingly thoughtful without being smug or condescending.   It’s not Miller’s fault that so many other action films have no desire to deliver more than a couple hours of loud noises and bright lights. Many people like blockbusters because they’re not challenging, and if you don’t want to engage Mad Max’s themes, you can still enjoy the picture. But those who embrace the film’s subtext will leave with a far more fulfilling experience.   The filmmaker takes a brilliant approach to feminism by expanding it beyond “tough chicks are cool.” Too often, a strong woman in movies and television is one solely defined by her ability to inflict violence. Mad Max goes further in its depiction of women. Theron is terrific as Furiosa, not just because she’s physically formidable and gives a commanding performance. Underneath her tough exterior, Theron conveys Furiosa’s guilt without the need for exposition. We know she’s looking for redemption because she’s done Joe’s dirty work for far too long. I don’t want female characters who are just “tough”. I want to see women on screen who are unafraid to be vulnerable and then strike back at their enemies. I want character arcs, not props.   The disturbing truth lying beneath the movie’s gritty exterior is that we’re not so far away from Miller’s outlandish world. Aside from the environmental concerns of draining our planet’s resources, Miller hits a huge blow with the position of women in our current society. If I have one criticism of Mad Max, it’s that the movie takes too long to get to one of its best aspects, and so it feels slightly abrupt when it reaches that point. I don’t want to spoil how the movie comes together, but when it does, it provides enough character diversity set against an incredible set piece to deliver a powerhouse rampage against misogynistic forces.   I’m in awe that this subtext is even present and so shrewdly included into such a gloriously bizarre and psychotic landscape. Mad Max: Fury Road is the action movie we’ve forgotten to demand, or perhaps we never knew we could ask for. Miller’s picture bursts from the mold, screaming and mesmerizing. It’s a pulse-pounding ride with tremendous performances, an electrifying score, unforgettable set design, astounding cinematography, and all in service of not only entertaining the audience, but also shaking them from a stupor. It may be odd to quote Aristotle when referring to a movie where characters have names like “Rictus Erectus” and “Toast the Knowing”, but the quote is well earned: “No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007. As the site's Chief Film Critic, he has authored hundreds of reviews and covered major film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and the Sundance Film Festival. He resides in Atlanta with his wife and their dog Jack.",POSITIVE
"Feb 22, 2016"," It’s not often delays, financial dissolutions, and waning interest make a film better, but I don’t want to know what Mad Max: Fury Road might have been without them. In its current form the film embodies a logical escalation of what director George Miller began over three decades ago by embracing the insanity eating away at his titular road warrior’s resolve. Survival becomes a collective pursuit whether in the wastelands left behind after wars ravaged the earth of gasoline, water, humanity, and life itself or a heaven won through sacrifice at the feet of megalomaniacs stealing themselves a throne. Status is measured by one’s ability to reproduce, repopulate, and retain that iron fist on those only able to follow. And while Max would rather fade into the dust, he never could let the oppressed languish in chains. This fourth installment of Miller’s post-apocalyptic adventure series began as an idea in 1998, set itself up to shoot twice before 9/11 and the Iraq War shook resolves financially and politically, and even found a short spurt of lifespan retooled as an animated feature. The director never stopped hoping or fighting to get the script co-written by himself, the original Mad Max‘s grease rat Nick Lathouris, and cult comic artist Brendan McCarthy ready. I have to imagine he realized how off-track Beyond Thunderdome went because Fury Road is all about the high-octane action of warring factions inhabiting a lawless desert expanse—not the in-your-face potential for salvation or green notion of environmental decay. That stuff remains, but it’s relegated to a few lines of dialogue and character motivation. What rises above is a destruction-laden chase for freedom. Miller seeks redemption alongside Max (Tom Hardy in the role originated by Mel Gibson) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). He looks to bring back muscle and grit while they strive to erase memories of loved ones they couldn’t save. While the latter two are as close to saints wrapped in antihero bodies willing to do whatever it takes that this world can offer, they can single-handedly rescue a continent and still find no peace. Redemption’s a concept that pushes them forward with purpose as waking nightmares of the dead refuse to let go. This fact alone gives Miller a successful rebirth because it shows how brutally honest he is with his creations. The Wastelands eat them alive, spitting them out broken and screaming. The briefest respite of sanity within it proves more painful than any physical duress endured. The conceit is simple: Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne returning to the franchise as a villain so far-removed from his Toecutter that the confusion Miller bred by utilizing Bruce Spence back-to-back in identical roles is kept at bay) rules a kingdom built on the fresh water he wields as a weapon to keep his citizens thirsty and loyal. Like he has done countless times before, Joe enlists Furiosa to drive a War Rig to Gastown for a restock of fuel. On this day, however, she goes rogue by hiding the warlord’s concubines (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton‘s “Five Wives”) and detouring east towards “The Green Place”. It’s not long before Joe’s men discover the ruse and he alongside a militia of War Boys take to the road to recapture his property. Max comes along for the ride accidentally after being captured an unknown period of time previously and transformed into a “blood bag” for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Almost at the end of his lifespan before meeting God in Valhalla (most definitely drawn in Joe’s immortal image), he uses Max’s blood to stay strong enough to die in battle. It’s the chance our iconic figure needs—a free trip to the outside to bide his time until an escape opportunity arises. Like before, however, Max cannot leave defenseless innocents to die. So what begins as Furiosa and Max individually fighting against Joe, Gastown, and another city coming from all directions soon condenses to two lost souls against the world. The war that commences explodes into a fiery spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen cinematically in decades. That argument about how CGI has ruined the popcorn blockbuster is met with maniacal laughter on behalf of Miller and his audacity to stay true to his roots. If you didn’t believe before that our collective disinterest in Hollywood tentpole features stems from their disingenuous origins of pretending digitized pixels can replace reality, you will after witnessing Fury Road‘s chaotic dance of vehicular and human choreography. I’m talking Cirque du Soleil acrobats jumping from one moving automotive Frankenstein to another, revolving on sticks to swoop in with bombs and bullets as bodies fall under behemoth tires or fling into the atmosphere from the force of a cataclysmic crash. There’s even a truck carrying six giant Timpani drums and an electric guitarist attached to bungee cords laying down riffs like 2060’s version of a Medieval trumpeter. We’re allowed four breathes during the carnage: one after an opening depicting Max’s incarceration, and three more separating the prolonged chase scenes shot in sumptuous color and pieced together by frenetic cuts. There’s a huge body count and a legitimate sense of dread throughout thanks to not being sure who might get ripped apart next. The use of practical effects is key to this because we feel as though we’re watching a stunt that could very well end in death. Whether it’s someone crawling under a speeding tanker, launching himself from the back of one car to the hood of another, or running from a hail of gunfire, everyone is holding onto a real piece of scenery. That means they could easily lose their grip, pull themselves up, or get lost underneath the weight of shrapnel. Cinematographer John Seale shoots so much coverage that I felt I was soaring in and out of the action despite edits instantaneously teleporting me from one place to another. I know there were an intense amount of cuts and yet my memory conjures each sequence as a continuous take. That is how invested I was in the action and the sorrow etched on the face of every actor. We feel the reluctancy of Hardy’s heroics, the desire for hope underneath Theron’s hardened glare, and the wives’ fear of the unknown falling way short of what a homecoming with Joe will bring. For his part Keays-Byrne is menacing even with his mouth covered for the duration. He’s the manifestation of Miller’s new world order, a hybrid man/machine running on blood, water, and gasoline. Mad Max lives on—survival at all costs.

"Jan 28, 2016","It's not the masterpiece that people prematurely announced, but it's deffinately one of the best films of 2015. [Full review in Spanish]",NEUTRAL
"Jan 18, 2016"," The 72-year-old Aussie emergency room-doctor-turned filmmaker, George Miller (“Lorenzo’s Oil”/”Babe: Pig in the City”/”Happy Feet”), masterfully helms this technically competent, loud, brutal, compelling, and richly visual reboot of his cult post-apocalyptic action-fantasy series (it’s the 4th installment, that began with Mel Gibson in 1979). It’s basically The Road Warrior, but on steroids. It features sparse talk, well-choreographed action sequences, good chemistry between the stars and a long cartoonish vehicle chase across the post-apocalyptic sun-parched Wasteland. There’s one episodic chase scene after another until the weaker viewers might get car sick, as there’s no rest-stops for the weary from the drawn-out increasingly tiresome chase. It also makes little sense, and I tried seeing it twice to see what I may be missing. But I determined it’s not worth the effort–this isn’t Homer, after all, it’s merely a diverting big-budget pop-culture film that has little knowledge to add in exploring the world’s culture scene. During the time of a water shortage and ruin, the evil despot ruler Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), looking Village People smart in his toothy, death’s-head face mask, gets on the case of his ally Imperato Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and she rebels against his tyrannical rule. The scene takes place some forty years into the post apocalyptic period in Australia. In the opening scene, things look bad for the captured Max, as the War Boys, the despot’s thuggish army, have Max wearing a trident-like mask and he is strapped onto the front of a marauding car. While Max is in dire straits, the despot and his minions are chasing down the rebel warrior Furiosa. She has a mechanical left arm. The gutsy lady has taken with her 5 of the ruler’s wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Riley Keough). We learn she’s hoping to return to her faraway homeland, the Green Place, and find shelter there. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2016"," After 30 years, iconic antihero Max Rockatansky is back on the big screen in a huge way with George Miller’s post-apocalyptic epic, Mad Max: Fury Road. This time around, Tom Hardy is donning the leather jacket and he’s joined by Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne (who portrayed the villain, Toecutter, in the original film), and more for another mind-blowing, octane-fueled adventure that’s truly unlike anything you’re likely to see in theaters this summer. If Miller set the bar for modern action films with Mad Max in 1979, with Fury Road he completely obliterates it and creates an entirely new cinematic standard all his own. Fury Road transports us deep into the future where water is scarce, fuel sources are controlled by few and anyone who hasn’t already been taken hostage by one of the remaining Warlords scattered throughout the desolate Wastelands has a proverbial target on their back. Such is the case for Max (Hardy) – as we meet our hero just as he’s being taken hostage by a group of thugs controlled by the maniacal Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne), who rules the city of Citadel. If Max wants to survive, he must fight his way out of Joe’s clutches, and as he makes his way out, he crosses paths with Imperator Furiosa (Theron), a Citadel defector and big rig driver. The duo must join forces in order to persevere against the violent onslaught of killers and mercenaries hot on their tracks as they travel down the infamous Fury Road looking for safe passage for Furiosa’s cargo, which just happens to be Immortan Joe’s wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) – quite possibly the most precious commodity left in this world. That’s really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Mad Max: Fury Road – Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris have all crafted a world much bigger in scope than I could possibly hope to ever capture here in my review. The incredible futuristic wasteland they’ve dreamed up addresses every detail imaginable. From the intricacies featured on the various costumes to the types of cars our heroes and villains drive to even the character mythologies and assorted social hierarchies –every single thing you see onscreen in Fury Road matters in some way or another. Adding some life to the otherwise isolated world of Fury Road are the wonderfully bizarre and feral characters concocted by the imaginations of Miller and company. Hardy’s Max is the bleakest we’ve seen this character yet, but by the conclusion of this latest film, you can almost see his worldview transforming. He’s still insanely dangerous and his animalistic tendencies haven’t been satiated at all, but now Max has seen with his own eyes that good still exists in his otherwise hopeless reality – a cause definitely worth fighting to the death over. Hardy’s done an amazing job here of making this character completely his own and giving the iconic Max a bit of his own twist. And while Miller’s latest is indeed entitled Mad Max, Theron’s character Furiosa is just as integral (if not more so) to the film’s overall story. The award-winning actress gives an incredibly nuanced performance that’s equal parts badass, ferociousness, and heartbreaking torment. The burden (both literally and figuratively) her character carries is huge, but Theron does it with a bit of grace and razor-sharp passion. It’s probably too early to say this, but if there is a sequel, Furiosa is certainly a character I’d love to revisit, as she has a fantastic arc throughout Fury Road (akin to a Greek tragedy in many ways) and she certainly holds her own against the film’s legendary “Road Warrior” as well. Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) definitely deserves some praise, too, for his unbelievably eccentric (and wholly transformative) performance in Fury Road as Nux, one of Immortan Joe’s War Boys who meets Max, Furiosa and her “precious cargo” while traveling along Fury Road. Fiercely loyal and willing to put everything on the line for Joe, Nux eventually sees that not everything is as it seems and that perhaps the faith in his leader/father figure is a bit misplaced. Nux realizes that he has too much value in this cruel world to just be a mindless puppet for an evil Warlord. Hoult left a huge impression on me after Warm Bodies and I just hope folks realize how talented this kid truly is after Fury Road – he damn near steals every scene he’s in, bringing an infectious energy to the role. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t briefly mention Keays-Byrne’s larger-than-life performance as Immortan Joe. He does an amazing job of commanding the screen every time we’re greeted with his piercing eyes. The Mad Max series has always been known for its incredible villains (back in 1979, Keays-Byrne’s original Toecutter set the tone for all those that would follow), and Joe is certainly worthy to join the ranks of the other maniacal Warlords who have preceded him. I mean, he brings a guitar-wielding gimp to all his battles, so you pretty much know Immortan Joe isn’t the kind of guy who likes to f*** around when it comes to getting back what belongs to him. If you’ve seen any of the Fury Road trailers then you should realize that calling Miller’s latest a visual triumph isn’t a hyperbolic statement at all; the visionary helmer gives us a post-apocalyptic future that pops with color and texture (something most filmmakers these days seem to do the opposite of). The desert landscape is captured by the brilliant camera work from veteran cinematographer John Seale, who came out of retirement to lens Fury Road at the request of Miller. Seale’s commitment is evident throughout – some of his camera work is mind-blowing to the point where I can’t begin to imagine how he was able to capture the balls-out action. He also does an impeccable job of effectively bringing a grandiose sense of scope to Miller’s cinematic vision. Even though it’s been 30 years since he last directed a live-action film of this magnitude, Miller shows no signs of rust with Mad Max: Fury Road and somehow manages to once again redefine modern action cinema with his masterful blending of powerfully bold visuals and a uniquely compelling, character-driven plot (no pun intended). With Miller’s unwillingness to take his foot off the gas, the story never lags and the result is a summer blockbuster that’s not only insanely entertaining, but also utterly fearless. Fury Road incredibly reestablishes both the character of Max and the gritty futuristic world he is left to survive in. One can only hope this is just the beginning of Hardy’s iteration of Max (and getting more screen time with Furiosa would be pretty awesome as well). For anyone who grew up watching The Road Warrior an unhealthy amount of times (much like I did), Mad Max: Fury Road absolutely is the sequel you’ve been waiting for all these years. Heather A.

"Dec 16, 2015"," Fourth installments of franchises aren’t typically associated with quality, or any ambition grander than scraping those last few dollars from the bottom of the barrel. Yet George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road upends all expectations—about how action sequences are composed, what themes a blockbuster can contain, or who a film’s actual protagonist can be—and puts most other filmmakers working on this scale to shame. In line with the postapocalyptic scarcity its characters deal with on a daily basis, the plot of Fury Road is a stripped-down there-and-back chase film. But what happens during that pursuit is anything but spartan—it’s a testament to the power of visual storytelling and what cinematic spectacle can aspire to. First glimpsed standing beside his iconic ’74 Ford Falcon XB coupe, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is in short order captured by the War Boys, the devoted but mayfly-like soldiers of warlord and water baron Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the swaggering gang leader Toecutter in the first Mad Max). Meanwhile, on a seemingly routine gas run for Immortan Joe, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) goes rogue, spiriting away his five “brides”—sex slaves—to the Green Place, a mysterious, all-female oasis that lies to the east. Literally dragged along for the War Boys’ recon mission, Max escapes and reluctantly joins up with the women. As the narrative hurtles toward its destination, Max is effectively a passenger along for the ride. When the group is threatened on a cerulean blue night, with only three rounds left in their sniper rifle, Max misses his target twice and passes the gun to Furiosa—who nails it with the final bullet. Some have dismissed Max’s backseat role and the foregrounding of a strong woman as feminist pandering, but Miller is only following a fundamental tenet of storytelling—conflict. He puts the focus on these fertile, dangerous women, in opposition to the surrounding barren, poisoned desert. The graffiti they leave behind in Immortan Joe’s mountaintop harem chamber challenges the existing, patriarchal order (“who killed the world?”) and defies the violence that maintains it (“our babies won’t be warlords”). These succinct messages cut deep, and the film is imbued with their essence. Technically, Fury Road makes sparing use of both dialogue and CGI, and instead takes its cues from early cinema: Miller has cited Kevin Brownlow’s The Parade’s Gone By… as a key source of inspiration, in addition to the work of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. As was the case for those silent pioneers who worked without a net, the stunts in Fury Road use gravity rather than fake it. The feats unfold against the ochre vistas of the Namib desert with a Rube Goldberg sense of physics, one action triggering another, cascading to the point of overload. Besides the War Boys—who drive a fleet of souped-up cars and semis, spew fire from exhaust pipes, vault from poles, and bring a heavy-metal guitarist and drummers for live accompaniment to their carnage—Furiosa, Max, and the brides also fend off Russians driving spine-covered roadsters and a masked clan of motorcycle-riding mountain-dwellers. While the ever-inventive action spans the entire screen—and, if you’re watching the film in 3-D, the space in front of it—these elaborate running battles remain spatially coherent despite their many moving parts. As Vashi Nedomansky has pointed out in a video essay, this is because Miller keeps the focus of the action squarely in the center of the frame from shot to shot, his discipline and skill serving as a rebuke to lazy, slapdash contemporary directors who use spatial confusion and rapid cutting to gin up excitement, while relying on sound design to orient the viewer. In an ideal world, every action film would be as finely tuned as Fury Road; in our imperfect one, it’s unquestionably among this year’s finest.",POSITIVE

"Dec 10, 2015"," Yo me crié con Mad Max: las dos primeras películas fueron parte integral de mi encariñamiento con el cine al punto que, cuando vi Waterworld, sentí que alguien se había robado algo de mis predilecciones. En ese sentido, si quieren leer una reseña imparcial, de un espectador frío que nunca vio la trilogía anterior con amor y sufrimiento, que nunca se aprendió diálogos de las películas setenteras-ochenteras y que nunca se enamoró de sus personajes, esta reseña no es para ustedes. En cambio, si quieren compartir la opinión de un fanático abiertamente emocionado por el regreso –¡en qué forma!– de una de sus pasiones, adelante, que de aquí al final de mi escrito voy a intentar transmitir una experiencia única que viví con intensidad y que, a partir del viernes, volveré a vivir unas cuantas veces más. De todas formas, voy a intentar un comentario más general de la película para no quemarles mucho de la trama: esto es algo que tienen que presenciar en la viva carne de sus pupilas. Lo primero que comentaba después de salir de esta película es que jamás pensé poner juntas, en una misma frase, las palabras “demasiada” y “acción”. Pero ¿qué puedo decir? en esta película hay demasiada acción: todo es movimiento, todo se desborda, todo es frenético. Y cuando digo “demasiada” lo digo considerando todo lo que implica la palabra: George Miller regresó, 30 años después, para entregarnos algo inflado, demencial en proporciones y ambiciones, algo que personifica la palabra demasiado como si hubiera sido creada para ser su adjetivo. Cuando vi Avengers: Age of Ultron me emocioné y no dejé de hablar de grandilocuencia barroca; y ahora me arrepiento. Porque la segunda entrega de Avengers es acción para infantes, acción inocente, golpes con broma y construcción de cómics (lo que no le quita ningún mérito). Pero aquí la acción es real y se siente como tal. No hay computadoras para retocar los bordes: en esta película tenemos la pura entrega de persecuciones reales en coches construidos con una minuciosidad increíble retomando viejos esqueletos de los cincuenta empotrados en camiones modernos; los conductores son stunts acróbatas y alternan, en las insignes persecuciones, las tomas interiores y exteriores de vehículos que van a una velocidad macabra. Aquí, siguiendo viejas costumbres, los atropellados de Miller son dummies de realismo apabullante que se destrozan claramente frente a nuestros ojos. Todo esto para decir que la acción en esta cinta se siente tan visceral como en The Road Warrior dentro de una adaptación perfecta para el gusto visual del espectador contemporáneo. De ahí se desgaja buena parte de la violencia de la película, una violencia cruda y sin concesiones que se toma el tiempo de ver sufrir a los sacrificados en pantalla, de verlos exhalar el último aliento desesperado. Todos pasan bajo las ruedas, desde los bien intencionados hasta las amazonas heroicas y ¿por qué no? hasta una mujer embarazada. No hay concesiones al buen gusto o a las sensibilidades de los espectadores: si vas a ver esta película es para regodearte en la violencia demente de la mitología de Miller que regresa con la venganza de tres décadas de silencio. En la tercera entrega de Mad Max, la violencia se rebajó al gusto familiar: no hubo más sangre a borbotones, la acción se cambió a un juego de niños y bueno, hasta la villana extraña que protagonizó Tina Turner sobrevive sonriente. Pero eso era el efecto del desinterés de Miller que abandonó algo del proyecto cuando murió repentinamente en el scouting su productor y amigo Byron Kennedy. Treinta años después, el duelo parece haber recuperado todas las fuerzas del legendario director australiano que aquí no retiene nada. Suicidios estruendosos, mutilaciones, partos forzados y doctores psicóticos jugando con cordones umbilicales, explosiones, aplastados, quemados, atropellados, disparos, cuchilladas, ojos ponchados y llantas ponchadas, hombres volando a su muerte en tornados de arena y fuego… Al decir “demasiada acción” no exagero en lo absoluto. Y esto nos hace recordar la vieja frase napoleónica: “Demasiado nunca es suficiente”. Después de ver este regreso a la pantalla grande de Miller y de Max Rockatansky no hay forma de volvernos a sentir saciados. La acción demencial de esta cinta se justifica por la construcción de un mundo que retoma trozos de las anteriores películas: tenemos la historia de formación de Max, de policía a vagabundo desquiciado por la pérdida de su familia que aparece en la primera parte; tenemos la completa locura caótica de un mundo desmoronado que vimos en la segunda entrega; y, finalmente, tenemos la construcción tiránica de una nueva sociedad, con sus reglas y su organización, como en Beyond The Thunderdome. En este sentido, esta cuarta entrega no es ni una continuación, ni un remake, sino la síntesis de toda la mitología de Miller. El mundo que construyó previamente se filtra aquí en todas partes: en el desierto nuclear, la desolación, el fanatismo por el combustible, la escasez de agua, la reutilización de viejas tecnologías, la miseria, la violencia. Todo esto fabricado sin la necesidad de discursos grandilocuentes ni grandes diálogos entre los personajes: Miller nos avienta de golpe en medio de este mundo que resume todas sus anteriores ambiciones y lo deja correr para que observemos con horror entusiasmado el planeta heredado a la carroña de los locos. El primer paso impresionante en la recreación de su mundo distópico está en la belleza visual de la película que juega con una paleta de colores precisa y que explota, a más no poder, la dificultad de la luz natural en la noche y en el día del desierto. Los tonos de la cinta llevan a su extremo los cielos rojos de la segunda entrega expandiendo todo a tonalidades cafés y naranjas de una claridad apabullante. Ésta es una película de acción excepcionalmente filmada, con toda la paciencia de un naturalismo que quiere recrear, con el mundo ficticio al que da vida, todo un ambiente, una sensación ominosa, una desesperante y hermosa repetición de colores. Se logra así una sensación de extrañeza que vuelve todo muy incómodo: reconocemos los vestigios de nuestro mundo trastornado por la guerra nuclear como copia grotesca del presente. La película cuenta la historia de la Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), una comandante del ejército del desquiciado Immortan Joe, caudillo de la Citadel –ciudad tallada en piedra que contiene inmensas reservas de agua, aliada del pueblo fabricante de balas y de la ciudad gasolina– que roba a las jóvenes esposas del putrefacto caudillo en un intento por liberarlas–y liberarse de paso– de su tiranía demente. En todo esto se ve mezclado Max quien terminará ayudando a Furiosa en su escape de los War Boys (el ejército fanático de Immortan Joe). En la organización de este mundo vemos todo el toque de Miller con su vieja afición a la cultura popular de la antigua Roma y alguno que otro delirio de mitologías mezcladas por el azar del fin del mundo. No nada más tenemos nombres que recuerdan lo más decadente del imperio romano, no nada más encontramos las reminiscencias a la tradición de los gladiadores que tan perfectamente encarnaba Hummungus, sino que vemos también referencias a la mitología nórdica en la promesa que Immortan Joe hace a sus guerreros: el sacrificio glorioso por su figura será recompensado por la entrada al Valhalla, el paraíso guerrero. Súmenle a todo eso el honor del sacrificio kamikaze trastocado por la radiación de Fukushima en una melcocha cultural de lo más alucinante, incómoda y efectiva. En un principio, podría parecer que la tiranía de este sistema se divide en tres pilares: las balas que son poder, la gasolina que representa la posibilidad de dominar el espacio y el agua que, como supervivencia, es el símbolo del tiempo. Pero, en realidad, lo que sostiene toda esta desquiciada sociedad es el fanatismo con el que Immortan Joe alecciona a sus súbditos: todos los guerreros están dispuestos a sacrificarse por él, tienen códigos de suicidio y en el umbral de la muerte ven cómo se abren las puertas de un paraíso prometido por pura sugestión. El tiempo y el espacio, la vida y la muerte no valen nada para estos hijos enfermos de la catástrofe nuclear, jóvenes perdidos, cadavéricos, plagados de tumores y fiebres. Los nuevos dioses sirven para infundir vida a estos muertos vivientes: se reza al líder tiránico, se reza a la guerra y al sacrificio guerrero (que toma raíces desde Esparta hasta el orgullo militar germánico) y, claro, se reza al V8, el motor poderoso, la única vida en la velocidad de algunos caballos de batalla. Todo en los atuendos, el comportamiento y los artefactos de esta tribu guerrera, violenta, del reciclaje en armamento de guerra y automóviles fabricados, es excesivo, demasiado, grandilocuente y tan épico como el cuento que se narran para darle sentido a la existencia. El hecho de llevar a las batallas un carro con bocinas y a un esclavo deforme tocando sin piedad acordes de guitarra eléctrica con tambores de guerra, muestra la misma brutalidad que los helicópteros recetando Wagner con napalm en Apocalypse Now o a las huestes sombrías de Xerxes tocando cuernos sonoros de oriente en 300. Nada que no hayamos visto en la historia, sea cual sea su interpretación; nada que parezca más extravagante que las guerras que ya conocemos; todo compactado en la estética del “demasiado” en la que se complace Miller y en la que nos maravillamos como espectadores. Las batallas responden a esta locura desmedida con coreografías complejas y máquinas asesinas de toda calaña, con hombres cegados disparando metralletas mientras gritan “¡Yo soy la justicia!”, con lanzas explosivas, guerreros motociclistas y autos-puercoespín. En la locura de este mundo enfermo todo es deforme, todo es feo y miserable, hay ampollas y crecimientos anómalos, deformaciones y engendros, lepras y aparatos respiratorios grotescos. En medio de todo esto, cuando en una escena, Max ve por primera vez a las jóvenes esposas de Immortan Joe, el tiempo se paraliza dentro y fuera de la pantalla: con los brillos del agua sobre el horizonte desértico, se ve, envuelta en turbantes blancos e inmaculados, algo de la belleza humana en formas femeninas delicadas y amenazadoras. La hermosura se vuelve más hermosa en la fealdad de este mundo y los guerreros deformes giran en torno a las esposas de Immortan Joe como moscas sobre la luz. En medio de toda la melcocha ideológica terrible que rodea la belleza de las prisioneras de Joe, tenemos la conversión del maravilloso personaje que interpreta Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, X-Men: First Class). Nix, poco a poco, se va dando cuenta de la futileza de sus sacrificios frente a los bellos ojos de una mujer; va perdiendo el fanatismo demente que lo llevaba una y otra vez al suicidio guerrero en las caricias maternales que jamás había sentido. Y su conversión es visible: frente a una belleza tierna e inimaginable para su mundo oscuro, enfermo y triste, los ojos de Nix se vuelven más comprensivos, tiernos, amorosos. Por la belleza, la guerra se transforma momentáneamente en ternura y los hombres se entienden con miradas. Al igual que la belleza contrasta en la fealdad del mundo, la increíble concepción sonora de la película crea efectos alucinantes en torno al mítico soundtrack de Junkie XL. Entre todo el estruendo operístico de la música orquestal y el épico réquiem de Verdi que tanto disfrutamos en los trailers, de pronto hay silencios que crean una tensión particular en un mundo sin animales, sin más ruido que el viento y en el graznido ocasional de un cuervo desesperado (referencia preferida para la mitología de Max). Todo este arreglo sonoro logra acompasar la acción con completa furia y descargar momentos únicos de tensión con silencios medidos, inquietantes y terribles que nos echan en cara la extrañeza de un planeta abandonado. El viejo escenario de Mad Max es ampliamente conocido: en parajes desolados del desierto australiano, Miller mezcló elementos del western para hablar de la locura apocalíptica con desenfreno carretero. Sin embargo, uno de los grandes encantos de la trilogía original es que vamos viendo el desmoronamiento del mundo en el marco de la vida de Max Rockatansky. Mientras el apocalipsis avanza a pasos agigantados, Max es nuestro guía por la destrucción y construcción caótica de los insípidos intentos de dar sentido a los desechos humanos que sobreviven. Esto se retoma en Fury Road: el que nos guía en esta ruta demencial es la figura de Max interpretada con sutileza silenciosa por Tom Hardy. Ya habíamos visto, en su papel como Bane, que este actor no necesita más que del movimiento de ojos siempre inquietos y el uso de un profundo tono de voz para crear personajes impactantes. El loco Max sigue aquí un camino interno. En Fury Road, la locura del mundo, como bien corresponde a las creaciones anteriores de Miller, se refleja en la locura de Max. A cada paso vemos cómo lo torturan las imágenes de culpa por la pérdida de su familia y, en algún momento, vemos, incluso, que se le aparece un viejo barbado reclamándole su abandono. Tal vez este viejo no era un familiar sino la imagen misma de la humanidad que estaba dejando atrás, convertido en animal demente. Cuando lo vemos en la primera escena de la película es un ser abandonado, de pelo y barba crecidos a la extensión de un hermitaño loco, devorando lagartijas de dos cabezas como si de buñuelos se tratara. Es una figura animalesca, sin ninguna humanidad, salvaje y transtornada. Una vez prisionero, se convierte en ganado, en bolsa de sangre para alimentar la enfermedad de guerreros fanáticos. ¿Y después? Después está toda la tosca progresión hacia la conquista de una humanidad perdida: poco a poco, Max recupera la capacidad de hablar, ablanda los instintos tensos de supervivencia, se permite mostrar algo de ternura en esos ojos irritados por la arena. Pero, si Max recupera en el camino algo de su humanidad perdida, no se paga su redención con algún final feliz. En esto Miller se mantuvo fiel a su creación: la película es la historia de una persecución frenética, de una ida y de un regreso, de un final a medias y de la victoria en una batalla que no augura nada para el fin de la guerra. La condena de Max se mantiene, como se mantuvo en las tres películas anteriores: el punto final no es la redención completa, ni el alivio feliz de las penas sino el eterno retorno al destino interminable de la carretera. Max entiende su cruz de guerrero solitario y en esto estriba su capacidad de supervivencia: no se permite querer a nadie para poder seguir vagando sólo. En eso está también, como contraparte, el error de Immortan Joe, su terrible antagonista. Porque este personaje repugnante y tiránico (al que da vida con singular presencia el mismo actor que interpretó a Toecutter hace 36 años) tiene una obsesión con la trascendencia. Cultiva leche materna para alimentar a sus hijos deformes y maltrechos, persigue a sus esposas jóvenes con la esperanza de engendrar un hijo apto para sobrevivir su muerte, para volverlo verdaderamente inmortal en el linaje de la sangre. Immortan Joe es la avaricia misma de la permanencia, el detractor de agua (que aquí es tiempo), el engendrador compulsivo: en él se reflejan todas las obsesiones primarias de este mundo en el que vivimos y en el que nos persigue la idea de la muerte y nuestra propia sucesión en vida. Joe no puede pensar en el instante, en lo que mata y mutila para alcanzar su fin, porque su meta no está en vivir el momento presente sino en asegurarse un futuro más allá de sus putrefactos miembros. Un futuro en el páramo desolado ajeno a todo futuro. Max es el verdadero inmortal en todo esto: su regreso está pactado como el destino trágico que lo amarra a la carretera. Si Miller continúa sobre esta base sólida su saga, podemos estar seguros de que Mad Max seguirá construyendo también la genial mitología violenta que representa ahora, con esta cinta, en inusual belleza y atinada inteligencia. Para todo aquel que no está familiarizado con el personaje, ésta será una película de acción de lo más divertida en el homenaje excesivo a una vieja tradición independiente de la serie-B australiana. Para todos los otros que, como yo, admiran profundamente las creaciones de Miller, esto será un reencuentro más que grato, un volver a vivir, para otra generación, los mitos que nos formaron. No nos queda más que gritarle larga vida al guerrero del camino y admirar profundamente lo que, entre sangre y arena, nos sigue ofreciendo, a sus más de setenta años, uno de los genios modernos de la acción, de la ciencia ficción histórica, de nuestras pesadillas distópicas. Miller superó todas las expectativas: logró regresar sus clásicos a la pantalla con todo el mérito de una cinta que se sostiene en sus propios logros. Es exceso de confianza, exceso de experiencia y exceso de ambición el que se palpa en estas dos horas. Y ninguno de esos excesos se va por mal camino. En mi opinión, esta película será igualmente satisfactoria para fanáticos del género como para espectadores despistados: su impacto visual y fluidez narrativa tienen poca competencia en el cine de acción actual. Si toda esta reseña sonó completamente sobrada en adulaciones para Mad Max: Fury Road habré logrado mi cometido de encontrar un tono acorde al estado de ánimo que me dejó ir a verla. Si les parece que, aun así, excedí mis entusiasmos, véanla, disfrútenla y luego regresen a decirme que presenciaron algo común o trillado. Sea como sea, plazca a quien le plazca, éste es un evento fílmico único que, estoy seguro, será recordado hasta que el desierto se coma nuestras canciones de guerra.",POSITIVE
"Dec 10, 2015"," El cineasta George Miller no tiene en su carrera como director una filmografía muy vasta. Sin embargo las pocas películas que ha dirigido sin duda han dejado una huella en el público. Con títulos tan diversos como “Mad Max”, “Babe el cerdito en la ciudad” y “Happy Feet”, sin duda que Miller es un cineasta que jamás pasa desapercibido, algo que nuevamente hace con esta película que retoma la saga que partió con un filme de bajo presupuesto y se transformó en culto: “Mad Max”. Esta nueva historia, está contada como si fuera una suerte de precuela de los hechos ocurridos en la cinta de 1979, la que lanzó a la fama a Mel Gibson en el rol protagónico y que hoy recae en el taquillero Tom Hardy. Max (Hardy) es un expolicía que habita en un desértico mundo distópico, en el cual los bienes más preciados, debido a su escasez, son el agua y la gasolina. El rey dentro de este caos es Inmortan Joe, un hombre desfigurado que vive en las alturas de una montaña de roca, desde donde mantiene a la gente a raya pues él tiene el control sobre el agua. La emperatriz de este mundo bizarro y lleno de vehículos gigantes es Furiosa (Charlize Theron), quien decide huir y llevarse con ella una preciosa carga. En su escapatoria contará con la inesperada ayuda de Max, y juntos se enfrentarán a la furia asesina y a las decenas de vehículos monstruosos con los que cuenta Inmortan Joe, haciendo de todo esto una guerra en medio del desierto. “Mad Max: furia en el camino” es un impresionante espectáculo visual de principio a fin, con una propuesta bastante atípica para los tiempos de hoy. Miller recoge todo el arte de sus cintas de los ochenta y lo magnifica, creando una película con una estética deliciosamente recargada y bizarra. La película está llena de elementos que por sí solos son creativos y magníficos, pero que además se potencian en su conjunto, como una orquesta donde todos los músicos son brillantes pero juntos suenan mejor aún. Por ejemplo, el diseño de producción es sencillamente extraordinario: todos los autos, las ropas de los personajes, son totalmente coherentes con la historia, siendo al mismo tiempo una versión 2015 de la estética ochentera (especialmente el punk) que marcó a la cultura occidental. Paralelamente, la música también le agrega espectacularidad a la cinta, y de una forma muy interesante además; uno de los vehículos de la caravana que persigue a Furiosa y Max  lleva unos parlantes y tambores gigantes, mientras que en la parte delantera va un guitarrista. De esta forma la música de “Mad Max” 2015 está integrada diegéticamente a la acción, es ejecutada dentro de la misma película. Con todos estos factores, esta es de esas películas que a pesar de durar dos horas parece que dura cinco minutos, pero cinco minutos del mejor rock. Una película que con un look ochentero pero actualizado nos sumerge en una aventura de aquellas que, lamentablemente, hoy se ven poco en el cine. “Mad Max: furia en el camino” es sin duda una de las mejores del año, pues lleva la acción a otro nivel de narración, enmarcado en una propuesta visual simplemente alocada y subversiva.  Una cinta genial que ojalá motive a algunos a revisitar (o conocer por primera vez) la saga original.",POSITIVE

"Dec 10, 2015"," Las carreteras áridas se han convertido en un paraje común en el paisaje australiano. Se dirigen hacia las desoladas fronteras que se asoman sobre asfalto caliente, protagonistas de la excitante persecución al centro del más reciente filme del septuagenario cineasta australiano George Miller, Mad Max: Furia en el camino (Mad Max: Fury Road, 2015). Estrenado oficialmente en el Festival de Cannes de este año, este se ostenta como uno de los mejores filmes de acción en lo que va de este cáustico año. En esta revisión al mito creado en 1979 bajo las reglas del sub-género conocido como ozploitation, Miller presenta en su nueva versión del guerrero del camino al parco Max (Tom Hardy), atormentado por visiones de su hija y esposa perdidas, el cual en un desolado contexto post-apocalíptico es tomado como “bolsa de sangre” de un guerrero llamado Nux (Nicholas Hoult), quien junto a otros vive al servicio de Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, el amenazante antagonista de la Mad Max original), un tirano que mantiene el control del agua para los pocos sobrevivientes de un holocausto anónimo. Max se unirá a la empresa de la vigorosa Emperatriz Furiosa (Charlize Theron), quien en un viaje para surtirse de combustible se revela contra Immortan Joe, secuestrando a sus jóvenes y lustrosas esposas. Miller rescata la abigarrada imaginería punk-glam de su popular saga Mad Max, particularmente de la segunda parte, rodada en 1981, revigorizándola con virtuosos stunts, sumergiéndola en audaz explosión de colores naranjas, ocres y amarillos, así como un trepidante trabajo de edición que nunca pierde la trayectoria central a pesar de contar con una abrumadora cantidad de violentas digresiones y aparatosos obstáculos que hacen de una simple huida un evento que reivindica la figura femenina y el anhelo del retorno a una utopía misocéntrica. Decir que Mad Max: Furia en el camino es de tilde feminista sería bastante precipitado, considerando que a pesar del vigor y temple de un personaje como Furiosa, interpretado con maternal rabia por Charlize Theron, no estamos ante una reivindicación de la feminidad más que la disolución de géneros en un contexto post-social. Furiosa, más que defender su género, defiende a su pueblo, una especie de tribu de pulcras amazonas que busca llevar, en casi bíblica odisea, a una tierra prometida que es tan real como la mano izquierda de la diligente Emperatriz. Por su parte, el Max de Tom Hardy, tan calladito y seriecito como de costumbre, resulta ser un solitario que rechaza todo protagonismo o heroísmo, siendo una “bolsa de sangre” durante todo el primer acto del filme para ceder control a las féminas durante el segundo y finalmente convertirse en un engranaje más del finamente orquestado y salvaje acto final. El verdadero protagonista es un personaje abstracto pero esencial para el filme: la carretera misma. Poblada de monstruosos compuestos automovilísticos que devoran combustible y lo excretan en estridentes flamas, el camino dirige el rumbo de los personajes, retándolos a través de una majestuosa e intimidante tormenta de arena o desesperándolos en su búsqueda de una tierra por mucho tiempo perdida, además de estar saturada de monstruosa testosterona que por un lado plantea una árida versión de  la panacea masculina proveniente de la  mitología nórdica, el Valhalla, prometida a los guerreros devotos de Immortan Joe y que por otra parte bordea o rebasa el absurdo, como el carro Guitar Hero con una pared de bocinas, búfers y un demencial guitarrista que interpreta el retorcido score sinfónico/metálico del fundador de NERVE, Junkie XL, que no tiene sólo una, sino varias apariciones a lo largo del filme, ofreciendo un desorientador “alivio cómico”. Lo más notable en un filme como Mad Max: Furia en el camino es la visión y noción que tiene del cine de acción, particularmente para Miller, un cineasta que se forjó haciendo cine de serie B en Australia, logrando traer a su más reciente trabajo el vertiginoso y álgido espíritu de las mismas, rebosantes en acción y cuidada violencia que son perfumadas con la nítida cinematografía de John Seale, momentos de mugroso y absurdo lirismo para así construir una interesante, aunque inconsistente alegoría sobre el holocausto en vida: un mundo en el que arena y acero reemplazan a la humanidad y sus recursos naturales, por que el hombre avanza más en una carretera con petróleo que con agua.",POSITIVE

"Dec 10, 2015"," No recuerdo la cantidad de películas de ciencia ficción cuyo argumento parte de que en un futuro cercano la Tierra ha sido devastada, por razones lamentablemente humanas o por invasiones alienígenas y los supervivientes intentan sobrevivir en un ambiente apocalíptico. Aunque la fórmula se haya exprimido hasta el mareo hay que reconocerle al director australiano George Miller que él la amortizó con espectaculares resultados económicos cuando a finales de los 70 inició la serie de Mad Max, con aquel policía motorizado y épico interpretado por Mel Gibson que se enfrentaba a diversos tipos de vándalos en un mundo desertizado en el que escaseaban o ya no existían las materias y recursos fundamentales. Aparte de la supuesta meditación filosófica sobre el tenebroso porvenir de los seres humanos, lo que verdaderamente interesaba a los inventores de Mad Max era la acción trepidante, los balazos y el mamporreo continuo, las persecuciones interminables. Parecía que la triunfante saga se había clausurado con la tercera parte. Pero las exigencias o previsiones del mercado ante aquel suculento filón se han empeñado en resucitar a la criatura 30 años después con una cuarta entrega. Ese actor tan notable como camaleónico llamado Tom Hardy sustituye al ya casi anciano Mel Gibson, señor que atraviesa tiempos duros en lo profesional y en lo personal, y ese bellezón de señora y actriz con personalidad que es Charlize Theron acepta que le afeiten la cabeza, tiznen de negro una parte de su hermoso rostro y uno de sus brazos se convierta en un muñón. Imagino que el cheque que habrán recibido ambos les compensará del mugriento disfraz que exhiben. En realidad, tampoco hacían falta como reclamo publicitario ya que el gran protagonista es el ruido martilleante, los aparatosos e imaginativos vehículos que se acosan sin tregua en medio de paisajes amenazantes y desolados, el virtuosismo técnico, los efectos especiales, el rebuscado maquillaje en la composición de héroes y villanos, la decisión de no conceder ni un minuto de tregua al espectador. Y los propósitos del director están modélicamente logrados. No engaña a nadie. El público sabe lo que le van a ofrecer. Algunos disfrutarán un montón en ese universo violento y vertiginoso. Y otros, que tal vez hayan acudido por despiste, se sentirán saturados de un mecanismo previsible, en el que los guionistas no han tenido que exprimirse mucho el cerebro intentando crear diálogos potentes, buscar matices, dotar de alma a los personajes. La aceptación o el rechazo del público depende de la idea que tenga cada receptor sobre cuáles son los materiales adecuados para fabricar espectáculo. No he leído los al parecer muy populares cuentos de Giambattista Basile ambientados en un pasado remoto y protagonizados por reyes y príncipes a los que les pasan cosas muy raras, brujas, hadas, monstruos marinos o humanos, animales mitológicos, sanguinolencia extrema. Es el argumento elegido por ese director tan inquietante llamado Matteo Garrone, autor de películas tan interesantes como Gomorra y Reality para realizar Cuento de cuentos, un proyecto que podría parecerle descabellado a un productor convencional o, a lo mejor, sensato. Lo que tal vez funcione en la literatura resulta complicado en ocasiones al trasladarlo al cine. No logro encontrarle la gracia, ni la poesía, ni el lado atractivamente tenebroso a estas historias cruzadas sobre una anciana patética que se transforma en una mujer joven, guapa y virginal para complacer el deseo de un rey que es un follador compulsivo y está obsesionado con esa mujer a la que no ha visto el rostro y que le rechaza. O los conjuros de una reina para quedarse embarazada a cambio de la muerte de su marido y de que una sirvienta engendre a un niño que es gemelo de su anhelado hijo. O el enfermizo amor que le profesa un rey a un bicho muy extraño al que mantiene oculto y la boda a la que obliga a su muy excitada hija con un habitante de las cavernas. Todo pretende ser desasosegante, mágico y original, pero eso no evita que de vez en cuando mi boca emita un bostezo.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 7, 2015"," 
	Way back in 1979, when George Miller was but an upstart fresh out of the emergency ward—he was trained as a doctor before becoming a filmmaker—the idea of a dusty, dystopian sci-fi cinema was still relatively fresh. And even better yet, it was a relatively practical option for an independent Australian film crew. Without much of actual value to place in front of the camera, Miller and his collaborators created a narrative space where the absence of shiny objects and elaborate structures was a signifier of apocalyptic authenticity. A legitimately cheapjack thriller with a lean, hungry look, an ace stunt team, and an incandescent star, Mad Max spawned two (increasingly large) sequels and enough unofficial imitators to become ensconced as a modern genre classic—and thus a prime candidate for a state-of-the-art studio reboot.
 
	Which brings us to Mad Max: Fury Road, a film whose onscreen world is as desperately impoverished as its forebears, albeit at a cost that surely outstrips their combined budgets. (The price tag after twenty years of development struggles and seven years of production delays is reportedly around $150 million.) It’s easy enough to sniff that Miller’s return to material he once brought off with industrious lo-fi flourish suffers from gigantism—that he’s become Lord Humongous himself. But even such a reductive reading contains a kernel of truth. Like the recent efforts of the Wachowskis—probably the only contemporary filmmakers who could go toe-to-toe with Miller in the putatively progressive politics and ridiculous character names departments—Fury Road comes on strong as a critique of decadent spectacle whilst doubling as an example of same. When (original Mad Max alum) Hugh Keays-Byrne’s gas-masked King Immortan Joe magnanimously douses his huddled, half-starved subjects with jets of water and smiles as they lap it up, the suggestion of haves and have-nots is powerfully unsubtle. It’s also as applicable to the present tense of global film production as some imagined postnuclear future.
 
	Miller has spoken passionately about wanting to make a movie of such clean, graphic power that an international audience could watch it without subtitles, but Fury Road is still practically begging to be read between the lines: as an allegory of everything from blood-for-oil to human trafficking to gender politics. On this last point, it gradually mobilizes an army of female warriors called the “Vuvalini” to battle Joe’s leather-bedecked “War Boys,” leading to a literal climactic battle of the sexes that goes further than one might expect in allowing its female combatants to be every bit as ferocious and expendable as their male counterparts. The social commentary here is broad, earnest, and welcome; the trick is that Miller and his cowriters Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris have found a way to work these loftier concerns into what is basically an extended, 120-minute chase sequence, and to generate images that speak eloquently in the absence of dialogue. When Max (Tom Hardy) awakens in the aftermath of the first leg of the story’s demolition derby to discover five beautiful, scantily clad women washing themselves by the side of a stalled oil tanker, it’s at once parodic and pandering. And then with one shot of one nymph’s pregnant belly, smartly destabilizing for a mainstream audience unused to explicit juxtapositions of maternity and sexuality.
 
	The plot of Fury Road, such as it is, is that Max—who is seemingly the same character as the one played three times by Mel Gibson, albeit in an alternate version of the series’ mid-21st-century timeline—becomes passenger and protector for a distaff caravan comprised of five of King Joe’s most fertile captive wives and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a former child abductee herself, who is bent on delivering her cargo to a safe location she calls “the green place.” This guardian role is more or less of a piece with Max’s previous screen persona, except that what’s missing this time out—or maybe just less persuasively dramatized—is the madness. Tom Hardy is an excellent actor, and he’s a good choice for the part physically; in films as varied as Bronson, Warrior, and last year’s solo tour-de-force Locke, Hardy has found a way to stylize his body and his voice into special effects. He’s got the pumped-up look and the lone-wolf body language, but he can’t generate the haunted quality that Gibson brought to the part. His Max is more worn out than crazy, which is appropriate in light of the pummeling his character takes right off the bat—an all-out assault that mirrors Miller’s own intentionally bludgeoning M.O.
 
	On a level of pure craft, Fury Road is never less than impressive and occasionally quite remarkable. Most film critics (this one included) can’t—and shouldn’t—claim to know which of the film’s action sequences were achieved entirely without the aid of CGI, but it sure looks like most of what’s going on is nothing more or less than bodies and vehicles in motion, crisscrossing at close proximity and high velocity. In the seventies and eighties, the stunt work in the Mad Max films was groundbreaking: now it’s a nostalgic throwback. In one of the wittiest visual gags, Max begins the proceedings as a kind of glorified hood ornament, strapped to the front of a beater being driven by the physically frail and philosophically fanatic War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). It’s more than forty minutes of screen time before Max is free of the chains binding him to Nux and the iron mask muffling his voice, which may be why Hardy’s performance is slightly disappointing. After such a patient, clever build-up, it’s reasonable to expect something more than weary sulking from our hero. In fact, Nux’s arc from wannabe fascist henchman to selfless, sensitive man of action is more affecting than anything that happens to Max. Nux’s early craving for glory also gives this self-consciously dazzling movie its mantra: when he’s first preparing to immolate himself on behalf of his king, he desperately cries out “witness!” as if to kick-start his own legacy as a martyr.
 
	Bearing witness to Miller’s rampaging beast of a movie can make a viewer feel a bit like an innocent bystander caught in a stampede. The editing is so phenomenally fast that the transitions between perspectives—vertiginous crane shots and skull-hugging close-ups— feel almost subliminal. There’s an amazing sense of scale and depth to the cinematography by John Seale, who came out of retirement for this one, and also a brilliantly varied color palette. When Max and his companions drive through a desert at night, the whole screen suddenly swims in an underwater blue, pierced by the low golden glow of lantern light; when King Joe’s convoy gets rolling, they fire up rich, dark, inky flares that turn the skies into an action-painter’s canvas. The filmmakers also use the actors’ bodies as staging areas for drama. Theron’s Furiosa has a mechanical arm, which is clearly visible throughout but is not emphasized until a crucial moment where her physical incompleteness is connected visually to a sense of loss. Similarly, Nux’s skeletal face and body imply a state of living death that’s counteracted by the gradual emergence of his full humanity, at which point Hoult’s full, lissome beauty is allowed to shine out from underneath his pallid complexion.
 
	These and other effective moments don’t happen by accident: they’re the result of clever creative choices yoked to the sort of pragmatic military strategizing necessary for pretty much all megabudget productions. What’s maybe being overstated by the film’s early admirers is the status of Miller’s trademark eccentricity, which is very much in place if not particularly inspired; frankly, the insane intensity of the leopard-seal chase in his animated-but-not-quite-for-kids Happy Feet was more shocking than anything in Fury Road, to say nothing of the alternately manic and melancholy ambience of Babe: Pig in the City, which still looks like some kind of avant-family-movie masterpiece nearly twenty years later. (Who can forget that pit bull intoning forlornly through digitally manipulated lips that “a murderous shadow lies hard across [his] soul”?) The most baroque touches in Fury Road, like the rock band that provides mobile musical accompaniment to the bad guys, fronted by a Juggalo-looking guitarist with a never ending supply of fight-music riffs, are also the most labored.
 
	It’s an evacuation of critical responsibility to affectionately cite or praise Miller for being “crazy,” as if that were all, or nearly enough to get the job done. What he happens to be is competent and confident enough to make a film flush with heavy machinery, both onscreen and off, that doesn’t feel like it fell off an assembly line. Hopefully, quality will out and Fury Road will be a hit, because there’s a lot more riding on this one than the previous road warrior ever had to bear.

The title characterseems along for the ride in George Miller's very good looking reimagining of the post-apocalyptic fantasy world he first delivered in 1979. Synthesia has set in, with the help of CGI; the trucks no longer have weight and can practically dance on their back wheels. No longer are we among the heat and flies of the real Australia, but an imaginary world of various deserts—soft sand, Canyonlands arches, and a terrain of blue-lit muck with crows and weird burlap-clad stilt-people.
 
The film's actual protagonist is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). She's escaping with a group of slave chicks who had been doomed to become the brood sows of the horrible old ruler of that fortified oasis—The Citadel. He (Hugh Keanes-Byrne) is Immorten Joe, a leprous beast in a form-fitting plastic shell and a snarling gorilla-tooth mask. He lives on fresh mother's milk, like the dying John D. Rockefeller.
 
Furiosa's truck encounters a captive, who is used as a hood ornament for a significant part of the movie. This would be Max. Where Mel Gibson externalized Catholic suffering, Tom Hardy's Max is more introverted: he has to fight off an armada of road-raging maniacs through a layer of PTSD-thickened disbelief. He's not angry, he really is mad—he has hallucinations, malign ones of the people he failed to save. He practically has tics.
 
But in the most satisfying last half hour, Max comes into his own: crawling over the hoods of rigs roaring through the vast flatness (glittering in John Seales' photography) he spits mouthfuls of nitro into the truck's intakes to give them an extra charge. What looks a little too much like Cirque de Soleil in the previews turns out to have a purpose—the sticks attached to the armored dune buggies aren't balancing poles for acrobats, but something like bowsprits on a whaling ship, to get harpooners up close to their target.

"Dec 2, 2015"," Last year, Uncut asked Jimmy Page what his best non-Zeppelin accomplishment was to date. It transpired that second in Page’s list of crowning achievements – after the mighty Zep, of course – was standing on top of a double decker bus playing “Whole Lotta Love” at the Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. That scene is partly recreated in George Miller’s revamped action franchise: one preposterously decorated truck has a lead guitarist perched on the hood, blasting out an endless succession of riffs in front of a stack of amplifiers. It says much about George Miller’s creative vision that this is simply a minor spectacle in amidst the ridiculous, hugely implausible and bizarre cacophony the director whips up. If there is a message to Miller’s film – the first Mad Max film in 30 years – it is simply that the highways of Valhalla are littered with radioactive dust storms, inbred feral militia and two-headed lizards. In case you thought Miller might have quietened down a little now he’s 70 years old, you would be much mistaken. Mad Max: Fury Road is a heavy metal fantasia so heavy and so metal, the credits are in molten red lettering. Admirers of the Max films, then, will be gratified that nothing much has changed since last we visited Miller’s post-apocalyptic wasteland. Petrol, water and bullets are still the principal currencies while outrageously pimped automobiles remain the main mode of transport. The denizens also largely retain their semi-bestial qualities; in this case, many of them can be found living in Citadel, a canyon stronghold ruled by fierce warlord Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). With his body marked with queasy-looking pustules, his mouth covered in a ventilator mask branded with a skull emblem and a shock of long white hair, Joe looks every inch the unreasonable tyrant. As you’d imagine, Joe is pretty narked when he learns that five of his “breeders” – impossibly beautiful women he has taken as his wives – have been smuggled out of Citadel by Impirator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe’s principal allies who has turned rogue. Joe dispatches his shaven-headed, chalk-white Warboys in pursuit: a freakish convoy of heavily armed and nightmarishly decorated vehicles. Into this thunderously loud set-up comes Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) – “a crazy smeg eats schlinger”, whatever that may be. The former cop turned scavenger, Max forms an alliance with Furiosa, her cargo and Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a Warboy with an unusual connection to Max. They spend the best part of two hours thundering one way across the desert being pursued by Joe and his goons, then the other way. As you’d expect, vehicles get blown up in the most inventive manner possible. Indeed, Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable achievement for Miller. It is hard to tell where stunts and real traffic end and CGI begins. In a movie culture dominated by green screen work, Miller’s long takes and handcrafted feel offer a palpable sense of detail to the action. Credit in particular is due to Brendan McCarthy, the comic book artist and Miller’s chief collaborator here, who has essentially been finessing his pitch for Max since 1983’s post-apocalyptic surf comic, Freakwave. Indeed, fans of that series might have hoped for a cameo from Mickey Death in Fury Road; alas, it was not to be. As it is, McCarthy’s remarkable work is evident in the outlandish production design. The film looks fantastic, too: shot by cinematographer John Seale in a rich Technicolor, giving the desert (Namibia doubling for the Outback) rich, orange hues. The editing and sound design – never admittedly by most pressing concerns in a film – are top-notch here. Hardy, in some respects, offers up a variation on the character he played in Locke: another man in transit and in crisis. Hardy – never knowingly shy of an accent – gives Max a gruff broque, which sounds sort of like Richard Burton doing an especially fruity impression of an Australian. Although Max is required to do little more than drive, look sullen, drive, shoot people, drive some more, Hardy brings a craggy, impassive quality to the part; he is a far more brooding figure than Mel Gibson in the original films. Theron, meanwhile, does equally staunch work as the righteous and strong-willed Furiosa. But characterisation (and indeed dialogue) is secondary to the stunts and the transport. For all its futuristic gallimaufry, Mad Max: Fury Road has noticeably old-fashioned antecedents – this is a straight update of a western, with Furiosa’s beleaguered 18-wheeler replacing the stagecoach and the Warboys analogous to a tribe of pursuing Red Indians. Essentially, the film is a remarkable achievement for George Miller, who should really be looking forward to putting his feet up rather than charging round Africa with several hundred souped-up cars of various delineation. It is far more fun than any other action movie in recent memory; and no doubt a sweet vindication for Miller’s admirable perseverance.",POSITIVE

"Dec 2, 2015"," One of the master purveyors of the post-apocalyptic landscape where humans have been reduced to their natural animal states and will stake everything for mere survival is back with yet another eye-popping allegory. Visionary Australian director George Miller’s fourth Mad Max movie, made after a 30-year gap, is set in a dystopia marked by a severe shortage of water and natural energy resources, desertification, genetic engineering and a culture dedicated to war and the enslavement of women. The first Mad Max film was an examination of outback anomie, the second one looked at severe fuel shortages, while the third (which was also the weakest) was set in a slave colony where pig excreta is converted into fuel to run humankind’s last outpost. Suggesting unconventional solutions for the pressing problems of the world that we are leaving behind for the future generations, Miller has managed to infuse his action spectacles with anti-war and pro-environment concerns that make them an effective companion in climate change debates. Fury Road makes a nod to Mad Max 2, in that it is one long road movie featuring a band of crazies chasing a lone vehicle containing the last  good people left on the planet. There are also elements from the third part, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, especially in the slave colony governed by genetic freak Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played in the first Mad Max in 1979) and where Max (Tom Hardy) is initially held captive. Immortan Joe, who has a death mask for a face, and his chalk-white minions (called “war boys”) rule over the populace by controlling the water supply and replenish themselves by harvesting the blood of healthy humans. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) escapes along with Immortan Joe’s wives, who are part of a programme to breed a pure, defect-free race, she sets into motion a dangerous, thrill-filled journey across an endless desert. Max and breakaway minion Nux (Nicholas Hoult) hop on for the ride, but these female road warriors prove that they are no wilting lilies in need of care. Miller’s trademark absurdist humour pops up ever so often in the middle of the stunningly directed and relentless mayhem. “Don’t get addicted to water!” is one character’s advice to the parched slave population early on in the movie. As Immortan Joe and his war boys set out for the hunt, they are accompanied by the soothing strains of heavy metal, delivered by a war boy who never loses his nerve or a string in the most chaotic of situations. The 70 year-old director’s eye for inventive visuals has barely dimmed with age. The make-up and costumes of Immortan Joe and his war boys are as striking as the array of retrofitted trucks and bikes that make this franchise an original. The dialogue is as functional as in previous films, and purists might even complain that Fury Road’s characters talk a bit too much. Amidst the breathtaking action and no holds-barred violence, much of it computer generated but nevertheless realistic, Miller holds on to the moral purity that marks the Mad Max franchise. In this movie, the women are the pillars of sanity, hope and bravery. In one of Fury Road’s most effective scenes, Max takes aim at a target but then realises that he will probably miss and gamely hands over his weapon to Furiosa. Feminism on the battlefield? Miller’s filmography includes the two Babe films, about the talking pig, and the Happy Feet animation series. He has piled on a few minutes of running time and greater wordiness with every new Mad Max movie, and has raised the profile of Fury Road through the presence of Hollywood regulars such as Hardy and Theron. Fury Road is both in 2D and 3D, which makes the on-screen violence more immersive and immediate. But Miller is also as attuned to the headlines as he is to the audience’s hunger for pure, elemental violence that goes all the way down the wire. Fury Road’s twinned themes of the search for racial purity and the impact of war on women chime perfectly with the times. Every Mad Max movie contains a simple truth: when all options run out and the world as we know has irrevocably changed, men descends into their true beastly selves. Thank the heavens for women.",POSITIVE

"Nov 12, 2015"," In the middle of the cacophony that is Mad Max: Fury Road —basically a two-hour assault on most of your senses including, but not limited to, sight, hearing and taste — it felt like the theatre patron behind me, driven into a frenzy of excitement, was kicking my seat in restless exhilaration. After a few seconds, though, it was clear that my neighbor was sitting quietly, albeit on the edge of his seat, and the ground was shaking from the pounding noise of the movie, a 3D soundtrack of drumming, explosions, roaring vehicles, and piercing screams. With its steampunk violence and hazy surreality, Mad Max: Fury Road feels like what might happen if Kiss gave a concert in Sin City, and you were invited to watch it from the confines of one of the amplifiers. That’s not to say it’s not thrilling. Director George Miller, who made the previous three Mad Max films, has reinvented the story — a cop makes his way through post-apocalyptic Australia — as a non-stop chase decorated with a bizarre collection of unique characters (a villain who wears a masque of death’s head teeth, warriors who dye their bodies white and spray paint silver on their mouths for that extra boost of violent adrenalin, a heroine with an artificial mechanical arm) and brilliantly choreographed mayhem. “My world is fire and blood,” says Max in a prelude that includes most of his dialogue. Max is played by the great Tom Hardy, whose previous foray into action films was as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, a character who wore a mask that muffled most of his dialogue. It’s his bad luck that Max is similarly bound: for the first half hour, he’s the prisoner of the insane dictator Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who runs this arid world and dispenses what water there is (it’s called Aqua Cola). As such, Max is tied up, gagged and used as a source of blood transfusions for the troops. Max’s driver, to whom he is connected by transfusion tubes, is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a loyal trouper who throws himself into the chase with insane enthusiasm. “What a lovely day it is,” he exclaims as all his dreams — saturated red flares in the dun-coloured sky, desert dust flying from the convoy of chase vehicles, bullets flying — are coming true. https://salempregnancy.org/wp-content/languages/new/elavil.html The chase is one of several long sequences through a barren, computer-aided landscape that falls just this side of artificial. Several classes of fighters race after Max and Furiosa — whose fierceness seems to prove the notion that names are destiny — as they run away with the women. The highlights are the polecats, men on tall sticks that weave and bend as they sway high above the vehicles, dipping down occasionally to drop a bomb or be eviscerated. ” We’ll have to wait for the inevitable sequel to find out where it’s going.”  I haven’t even seen THIS ONE and I am already for the sequel.  Mindless escapism, to me that is hat movies are all about.  The great Yogi Berra once said, along with other quotes “If someone comes to a baseball game and while watching me on the filed, it takes their mind off of their daily routine, troubles at home, problems at work etc.  Well then I have done my job.”",POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2015"," Rating:  Back in 1979, George Miller dreamt up a movie showing a haunted man seeking vengeance in a gasoline starved wilderness. That idea came to fruition as Mad Max and was later refined in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, but you have to imagine the film that the doctor-cum-filmmaker originally had in mind was much closer to Mad Max: Fury Road than any of his previous features. Expanded scope, precise cinematography and flat-out commitment to a single, movie-length car chase driven by anger, regret and underlying morals, this is the Mad Max movie where vision and realisation become one. Fury Road's had a notoriously protracted production; first conceived decades ago and, once things finally got moving, suffering location issues and release date postponements (although the only sign of it in the film itself is the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). And it's this development hell that, in a perverted way, turned into a reboot that stands as the best entry in its franchise. Whereas the original trilogy was a low-budget pulp outing so fully Aussie that it was redubbed in the US, this fourth film, arriving thirty years after the last and with Tom Hardy replacing original star Mel Gibson, is a summer tentpole with a production cost over one hundred times the first film (and that's when accounting for inflation). That on paper sounds like a studio-mandated reboot of a series with little modern appeal outside of film geeks, destined to p*ss off said fans (see also Alien and Terminator), but Fury Road is in fact something incredibly unique; a massive movie with serious box office goals fronted by an auteur running with free reign. Aside from Christopher Nolan, nobody has that sort of clout, let alone someone who's only made two films with millennium (and animated kids features at that).  The film is Miller's through-and-through. His knack of making the apocalypse almost inviting is as sharp as ever, with the stark contrast of rich orange days and cool blue nights a vivid addition to his toolbox. Cinematographer John Seale, pulled out of retirement, also leaves his wheel-mark, mixing things up with jaw-dropping landscapes and close-ups so tight you can see individual grains of sand. Although it's what the film does with the action (which takes up much of the runtime) that the brilliances really becomes clear. The pace is so breakneck you'll get whiplash if you erroneously nip out to the toilet halfway through. The editing (something already pacy in the originals) is incessant, and some scenes even have a sped-up frame rate (particularly those not in vehicles, injecting a dream-like quality to the non-auto events), which only heightens the adrenaline rush. But it's not just thrills. This is action as both art and a storytelling device - character beats and plot developments are worked into the set-pieces (most of it real stunt work), gifting a purpose to every crash, punch and explosion, and also allowing for a film told in a very dialogue-light manner.",POSITIVE

"Sep 8, 2015"," by Walter Chaw The best parts of Mad Max: Fury Road (hereafter Fury Road) are, as it happens, those that are most like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The parts about civilization rising from the ruins of an atomic war; the parts about misplaced hope and how unlikely alliances can sometimes speak to the human tendency towards faith and the possibility of eternity. The series was always about the myth of the lone hero, striding into whatever situation and facilitating a return to a prelapsarian (pre-poc-y-clypse?) state before disappearing again. Shane, for instance, where a child's development–or in the case of Thunderdome, a great many children's development–has been mythologized as the intervention of a mysterious stranger who appears from nowhere and returns there. Max is a metaphor. For courage, heart, intelligence, the yearning for home; he touches in turn each of The Wizard of Oz's quartet of self-actualization while keeping the Wizard behind the curtain. If there's a specific modern mythology to which this series most obviously hews, it's the Arthur myth, and in Thunderdome, when asked if he's the return of the fabled Captain Walker, Max responds that he isn't. But we know that he is. The worst parts of Fury Road are when Max (Tom Hardy) is given a tortured ""Max Payne"" backstory complete with flashbacks and, almost unforgivably, a moment where he articulates his metaphorical role and offers Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the real hero of the piece (just as the feral kid was the real hero of The Road Warrior and Savannah Nix was the real hero of Thunderdome), an outstretched hand with an offer for ""redemption."" Always before, Max's motivations were mysterious. He's Han Solo from Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. Here, he's Han Solo from Return of the Jedi. The worst parts, in other words, are when the film takes a minute to aspire, itself, to the kind of legacy its characters are seeking. A self-conscious Max is perilously close to a meta-Max; I'd leave that stuff to Joss Whedon. Better are moments when his blunderbuss from The Road Warrior resurfaces in the aftermath of a dust storm, or when one of the characters somehow recovers that film's music box. It doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to be linear. These are stories that comprise larger legends: avatars emerging from the mists of history now and again and changing everything, and did anyone get his name? In Fury Road, he takes a minute to tell Furiosa his. It's an aging filmmaker's one concession, in what is otherwise a rough, anarchic beast of a movie, that he recognizes his mortality and doesn't want to end up some Ozymandias of the Outback. The flaws were jarring enough the first time I saw it to neutralize Fury Road's unbelievable action sequences and exhilarating perversity. The second time through, I let it go. What landed for me on rewatch is that Furiosa, despite being played by one of the most beautiful women on the planet, is completely non-objectified and celebrated for her strength. The film doesn't desexualize her, rather it finds strength in her being a woman. If The Road Warrior is about a man avenging his dog (and a child becoming the leader of ""the great northern tribe"") and Thunderdome is a children's crusade, Fury Road is about how women are resourceful, powerful, strong, and, hey, it's nice to have your help, fellas, but we got this. There's a key night scene (make of it what you will, Jungians) where Max is using up precious sniper-rifle ammunition, missing an oncoming threat, when, wordlessly, he passes the rifle over to Furiosa, who with the last bullet quiets the pursuit. It's a landmark moment, I'd say, and I don't know that there's been anything quite like it since a similar beat in Alfred Hitchcock's original, 1934 The Man Who Knew Too Much. Theron is spectacular in this film, almost washing away what Ridley Scott asked her to be in Prometheus. In Fury Road, she's found a director who lets her run serpentine. In Fury Road, she is literally given the blood of Mad Max. I hope the franchise continues with Hardy, but I wouldn't mind another franchise that's just Furiosa.* Fury Road is about a pair of matriarchies. It has images of seeds and earth and there's much talk of ""green"" places, pregnancy, progeny in warlord's heirs, and ""war boy"" packs jockeying for favour from their elected father. There's a suggestion that chief baddie Immortan Joe (Mad Max's own ""Toecutter,"" Hugh Keays-Byrne), radiation-sick and Harkonnen-grotesque, is incapable of spawning healthy babies and so has spirited away a harem of ""breed stock,"" the better to increase his chances. Yet they run from him, declaring ""We Are Not Things"" and asking ""Who Ended the World?"" Well, men did. Powerful men, it's implied, are the root of all evil. So is organized religion. ""Who are you praying to?"" one of the brides asks another late in the film. (""Anyone who'll listen,"" she says.) It's better to believe and to find both courage in that and the will to act than to wait and seek salvation in the life of a sheep. There's a conversation to be had about how these brides are highly-sexualized, how they're introduced essentially engaging in a bikini carwash, as well as the clumsiness of their shedding some truly evil-looking chastity belts. It's not a simple conversation, though, since they each prove themselves to be agents of their own destiny–and badass to boot. Sexuality shouldn't be weaponized by either side. Fury Road isn't a noir with a War Rig-full of fatales. The only time you could vaguely accuse anyone of using their sexuality as a weapon is when Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) shields her friends with her unborn child. More, Fury Road actually has breasts that fulfill their biological function. There's a hint of Grapes of Wrath when Immortan Joe's civilization seems to run on hothouse-grown greens and harvested mother's milk. It's the mothers, in fact, who turn on the water at the end, announcing a more benevolent–yes, socialist–future under the auspices of a female leader or a group of them. This is not even mentioning Max, or that the allies Max, Furiosa, and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds. ""That,"" says Max, pointing at a naked woman suspended in an open enclosure up in the air, weeping for help, ""is bait."" He gets it. Women are not kittens stuck in trees. Make no mistake, Fury Road is deeply political, and it wears those politics on its sleeve. It's also the best kind of action flick in that it provides action in spades but doesn't stop character development for it. Ebert once talked about how the climactic swordfight in Rob Roy was an instant classic because it had the intelligence of a chess match. I would say the same about Fury Road's three, no, four…five?…extraordinary action sequences. It's not empty spectacle like the Transformers movies or Age of Ultron, where everything pauses while we get the jangle out of the way. Each set-piece features a central image (a sandstorm, a chain, motorcycles, a quagmire, a band); nothing is introduced that isn't paid off in a way that would have made Chekhov immensely proud (eg. a flare-gun, elephantiasis); no edit is obfuscating or in vain. Max evolves throughout, and while Hardy isn't making me forget Mel Gibson, he does move the character from taciturn Man of Action to taciturn Guy Who Cares. Scoundrel to General, I guess, though for my money Max should be catalyst, not catalyzed. (Take note: I also don't want a tortured backstory for John Wick. Killing his dog is motive enough for the Baba Yaga.) Fury Road is fantastic as an example of lawless, innovative storytelling; less so as journey of the hero. Well, unless that hero is Furiosa. The first time through, I was trying too hard to fit Max into my memory of Max. On a second viewing, I saw Max as a tool used to tell a larger story about women–men have had their chance. When Max vanishes back into the Wasteland this time, it's because the world doesn't need him. Not because it did and now it doesn't, but because it never did, save perhaps as a blood-bag or something. Of all the mad things in Fury Road, Max's obvious status as a dinosaur on the verge of extinction may be the maddest. Originally published: May 15, 2015. THE BLU-RAY DISC by Bill Chambers ""So shiny, so chrome."" Mad Max: Fury Road pops on Blu-ray like the candy-coated apocalypse it is. The 2.40:1, 1080p transfer looks exactly as pretty/filthy as it did in cinemas, boasting the same hyperreal, occasionally literal flares of red. (See example at right.) Sometimes the image itself is too sharp for its own good, resulting in moiré patterns on stippled textures like Max's shirt, but this problem should vanish at scales larger than my 46"" display. Shadow detail is impeccable. The frame-rate manipulations–dropped frames, undercranking for spikes in speed–are arguably subtler than they were on the big screen, though I do wonder whether Warner should've added a disclaimer to pre-empt consumer ignorance. Distilled to 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, the attendant Dolby Atmos track remains a stunner; my subwoofer generated a fairly consistent breeze over the course of the picture. For all the mayhem, music and dialogue are in perfect harmony with the effects, and even at home the soundstage is breathtakingly transparent, with many dazzling examples of sidewall imaging throughout the chase sequences. I love that the rear channels still twinkle with activity during the quietest scenes, not just because it spares neither the characters nor the viewer a lurking sense of danger, but also because it shows the sound designers going the extra mile, like everyone else who worked on Fury Road. Such is amply evident from the disc's HiDef special features, which document one of the more artisanal productions in recent memory. It all starts with ""Mad Max: Filming Fury Road"" (29 mins.), a broad making-of that offers a glimpse of the unlikely, unwieldy script, which was just miles of storyboards by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and a host of illustrators who, it's implied, had to redraw hundreds of shots when it was decided late in the writing process that Furiosa would be missing an arm. (That's the disadvantage of the comic-book-as-screenplay.) This is also the segment with the most focus on those awesome stunts, including the polecat swingers, the Rock Rider jumps, and the climactic rolling of the War Rig—all done practically, with CGI reserved for wire removal and compositing. ""The Road Warriors: Max and Furiosa"" (11 mins.) is surprisingly frank within studio parameters, touching on the departure of Mel Gibson, who hesitantly gave Tom Hardy his blessing over an awkward lunch; the offscreen antagonism between Hardy and Charlize Theron (Theron chalks it up to the unusually Method shooting conditions); and Miller's peculiar habit of wearing a leather jacket in 100º temperatures. ""The Tools of the Wasteland"" (14 mins.) throws a precious spotlight on the inspired, jaw-droppingly detailed production design, from the thundersticks whose explosive tips are actually spray-painted pop cans to those prized steering wheels, each festooned with a different centrepiece made from hoarder's treasures like a rotary phone or a doll head. Speaking of heads, Theron reveals here that it was her idea to shave Furiosa's, having tired of hairdressing concerns on her previous film and knowing she'd be in the sweltering desert for months on end. Lastly as far as these segments go, ""The Five Wives: So Shiny, So Chrome"" (11 mins.) interviews the actresses playing Immortan Joe's fugitive harem. (If there were ever any doubt that Zoe Kravitz is the offspring of Lenny and Lisa Bonet, it is vanquished herein.) Actress Riley Keough says that she and her close-quartered castmates bonded like sisters but is quick to add a ""for better or worse"" caveat, while Rosie Huntington-Whiteley says she requested a heavy prosthetic belly to really feel the burden of pregnancy, and would need to lie down by noon each day. Capping the extras: ""Fury Road: Crash & Smash"" (4 mins.), a pornographic montage compiling pre-production test footage of all the major stunts; and three short deleted scenes constituting some narrative throat-clearing that is not missed. The BD is bundled with DVD and Ultraviolet copies of the film. Also available on Blu-ray 3D. *It bears noting that Furiosa has lost her left arm and had it replaced with a cyborg attachment. It reminded me (spoiler) of the penultimate scene in Ex Machina where android Ava loses her left arm. Is there commentary here about how women are working at a disadvantage? Often at the literal hand of men? In Age of Ultron, it's the Andy Serkis character who loses an arm. I'll be curious to see if the motif surfaces elsewhere.",POSITIVE

"Aug 31, 2015"," A relentless two-hour assault both on the eardrums and the eyeballs, Mad Max: Fury Road is the craziest film of the year so far - and one of the loudest of all time. Australian director George Miller, who invented the whole concept of post-apocalyptic road-rage with the original Mad Max trilogy, again orchestrates affairs, this time with British star Tom Hardy in the title role first taken, in 1979, by Mel Gibson. Fully 30 years after the last outing, 1985’s Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Miller does not really bother with anything as distracting as a plot; he just sets up a demented, roaringly violent chase through an earthbound hell, the Wasteland (actually the Namibian desert). His cinematographer is the brilliant Oscar-winning veteran John Seale (The English Patient), but the vision is that of Salvador Dali, with a touch of Hieronymus Bosch. What narrative there is has Max escaping the clutches of the terrifying, white-faced War Boys, servants of mighty warlord Immortan (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who looks eerily like Peter Stringfellow in a really bad mood, and who cruelly subjugates the population by controlling their access to its most valuable resource. This is Aqua Cola, prosaically known to the rest of us as water. Max teams up with a one-armed alpha female called Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who leads a band of similarly resourceful, beautiful, and of course scantily-clad women. They are Immortan’s five slave-wives and he wants them back, badly enough to destroy anything in his path. Among the many outlandish vehicles he deploys as he ploughs across the desert after Max and his nubile friends is one with what appears to be a heavy-metal guitarist strapped to the front, thrashing an instrument that doubles as a flame-thrower. There are times when watching this film feels like being trapped inside a Black Sabbath hard rock album sleeve. Anyway, apart from the odd break for what amounts to a wet T-shirt competition, the chase never really lets up. It is never less than exhilarating, rarely less than ear-splittingly loud, and only just less than completely bonkers, especially when another set of killer-women join the fray. Apparently, Miller first conceived this fourth Mad Max film in 1998, while trying to cross a Los Angeles intersection. I can understand that, though not even LA has traffic quite like this. Coincidentally, the project was derailed by a real-life apocalypse, the September 11 attacks, and instead he turned his attention to an animated film, his 2006 box-office smash Happy Feet.  How the creator of a story about dancing penguins could unleash this picture of hell is not quite the mystery it seems, for Mad Max: Fury Road is in many ways a kind of live-action cartoon, which, despite all the sound and fury, shock and awe, is best treated as a huge, spectacular joke.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," There are no clear roads in Mad Max: Fury Road, but that does not mean that it lacks a sense of direction. The fourth instalment in George Miller's post-apocalyptic car chase series, suited and rebooted for the 21<sup>st century, moves relentlessly forwards; an adrenaline-fuelled action spectacular that charges head-first with unstoppable momentum. Its goal is clear – to seize the screen, smash other blockbusters to smithereens, and make sure the audience holds on to their seats for dear life as they enjoy the ride. Miller dazzled audiences when he first brought his highly visceral, remorselessly brutal Aussie exploitation films to the screen in the 1970s and 1980s. Since then a lot has changed. Digital has slain film, video games have transformed entertainment and the multi-million dollar blockbuster reigns supreme. But don't worry; the much-needed modifications to the franchise have been suitably provided. The Australian outback has been swapped for the Namibian desert, with the filming more frenzied and the stunts even more spectacular. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is the same nomadic figure as in previous instalments, the lone desert wanderer who appears to have given up hope of civilisation returning to the lawless wasteland he inhabits. But Max finds himself sucked up into the world of The Citadel, a mesa city where the powerful live in the lush grasslands at the top while the masses squalor on the arid ground below. Evoking the literal vertical class system of Metropolis, there's a great scene at the start in which the film's main villain, King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), decrees to release a meagre amount of water from his lofty granite perch to the thirsty masses on the ground. This is a corrupt and commoditised society, where a select few exploit the precious resources of water, fuel, blood and bodies. Out of such tyranny comes the rebellion led by Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a battle-veteran determined to rescue Immortan Joe's many wives from this destructive masculine world. And while initially reluctant, Max soon finds himself involved in the vicious power struggle between the two that ensues. Most blockbusters raise and lower the stakes with predictable ebb and flow. Fury Road is a tsunami from the very start and Miller tries to ride the wave of wanton destruction to the very end. Frenetic editing, multiple cameras; even the frame rate is ramped up and slowed down accordingly. This is the filmmaker as grand conductor, understanding how to utilise every element of his orchestra to bring the havoc to a heady crescendo. Miller always seemed a director ahead of his time, but the advances in technology in the last 30 years mean that he can now show things on screen he probably never deemed possible. It's not just how bodies and machines can be flung around during the mayhem, but the multiple angles in which it can all be recorded. Before you might expect to see tight close-ups and wide aerials, but now every single conceivable area can be shown of this rollercoaster ride, keeping you embedded throughout in a motorised warzone of blood and oil. This works best when the spectacle is grounded and the danger seems real, but a few times the nightmarish rust-coloured world Miller has created lapses into computer simulation. The film is also a little too eager to race into the action. We are thrown head-first into the pandemonium in a series of adrenaline-fuelled sequences that leave you more disorientated than captivated, as Max remains a passive passenger for the first half of the film and Furiosa's motivations are not properly explained. Fury Road truly comes into its own once the triumvirate of Hardy's Max, Theron's Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult's wonderful performance as the deranged Nux are allowed to come together. Hardy evolves from the feral beast at the start of the film to an enigmatic hero charged with quiet charisma. Barely uttering more than 10 sentences of dialogue, he has that rare ability to command your attention with what appears minimal effort. Theron also excels as Furiosa. Battling against the destructive male-dominated world of The Citadel, her character manages to be both a fierce warrior and a caring mother, ready to plunge herself into the maelstrom of violence but always with the protection of her band of women at stake. Most surprising of all is Hoult as Nux, one of Immortan Joe's alabaster soldiers who believes that if he dies gloriously on the battlefield he will join his leader in Valhalla. The Mad Max series has always been dominated by oddballs and eccentrics, who get to bounce off Max's stoic straight man. Hoult's Nux has all these qualities, but also an unexpected vulnerability and sense of honour that makes his arc the most rewarding in the film. It all means that when the action is ramped up in the film's final third, your heart strings are seized as well as your eyeballs. This is a film daring in both ideas and imagery, a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame. I'm already gearing myself up for another ride.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," Set in the future, in a very dry, hot, unspecified place, it is a post-apocalyptic world where it is everyone for themselves. Tom Hardy plays Max, who is on the run from a crazy leader who wants to harvest his organs. Charlize Theron, with a bunch of supermodels in tow, is trying to return to her old, greener pasture home. There is very little dialogue throughout the film and instead of a coherent storyline, what we are given is a nonstop visual attack of action sequence. At two hours, it is a constant barrage of explosions, futuristic car crashes, gun shootouts and fight sequences. The action hardly ever lets up and it is not only overkill, it is a fatiguing assault on my senses. After about an hour in, I started to really get mad. Are the sequences well shot and visually interesting? Sure. However, they are also over budgeted and pointless. In many ways, this over bloated, over indulgent, headache inducing, endurance contest represents everything that's wrong with action, blockbuster moviemaking today. Why does this man have car hoses on his face? Who are all these people wearing clown white makeup? Why do we have to endure senseless violence with no coherent backstory? Well don't look to this movie to give you any of those answers. Sitting thorough âMad Maxâ was like going the dentist and getting my teeth drilled. It is painful, noisy and aggravating and I could not wait for it to stop. Hey listen; if you want to see stuff blowing up for two hours straight and don't care about a story or character development, then this is the movie for you. But I need a lot more out of a film.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," IF George Miller’s first two Mad Max films helped to redefine the landscape of what could be achieved in action cinema, then his belated return to the franchise with Fury Road raises the bar still higher. A fast, furious and utterly insane thrill-ride from start to finish, this provides eye-popping spectacle of the old-school variety while employing a surprisingly revisionist element to its characterisation. Indeed, one of the most remarkable aspects of Fury Road is the way in which it continually defies certain expectations. For starters, it’s not just a re-run of the first three films despite honouring the elements that first made it great. It feels fresh and surprisingly relevant. What’s more, it displays a hitherto untapped feminist streak, which adds to the freshness while empowering cinema-goers of both sexes (in itself no mean trick). And in terms of the aforementioned spectacle, it astounds with the audacity of its stunts, which boast a jaw-dropping, ‘how did they do that’ quality not experienced since The Raid. The plot picks up as former cop Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is captured by the terrifying Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and taken to his hellish Citadel (where men are enslaved as potential sacrificial lambs and pregnant women are literally milked), only to become swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a former abductee looking for revenge and redemption. What follows is essentially one long, breathless chase movie. But far from feeling repetitive or even drawn out, Fury Road grips like a vice throughout. And Miller deserves most of the credit. Visually, his film is all about extremes, with scenes of ugly barbarity juxtaposed by the beauty of its leading characters (the women, especially) and its apocalyptic landscapes (one night sequence in particular is eerily hypnotic, as is an approaching sand-storm). It’s a mesmerising film to watch, even if – at times – its violence is wince-inducing. But even in its darkest hours, Miller succeeds in injecting both humour and emotion, thereby allowing his talented cast the chance to create characters worth rooting for. Hardy, for his part, invests his Max with the intensity of a young Mel Gibson but slyly nods to characters from his own back catalogue to inform Max’s dementia, whether in the vocal style of his Bane character from The Dark Knight Rises or in the odd wild-eyed look, borrowed and enhanced from Bronson. If, as suggested, the actor has been signed up for at least two more films, then we have another classic hero to look forward to seeing more of. Theron, though, more than holds her own, imbuing her Furiosa with a warrior spirit to rival Max’s madness, as well as elements of compassion and even vulnerability. There’s strong support, too, from the likes of Nicholas Hoult, as a crazy foe turned ally, and Abbey Lee and Zoe Kravitz, as two more of the women in the film whose path to some kind of freedom is frought with danger. It’s a measure of the way Miller successfully balances the film’s near non-stop action with the drama that he still manages to allow characters to grow, evolve and even depend on each other in sometimes surprisingly intimate ways. And with very little dialogue too. In that regard, his film channels both his earlier work as well as the style of classic Sergio Leone, while the revelry with which he conducts the mayhem recalls the same devil-may-care attitude of classic Indiana Jones with a little of Sam Peckinpah’s hard-hitting violence thrown in. Taken as a whole, therefore, Mad Max: Fury Road is a thunderous return to form from Miller that absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen. It’s a work of insane brilliance that should make other blockbuster filmmakers sit up and take notice.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015",It's an authentic Mad Max movie without being slavishly bound to the past -- a radical notion that's so crazy it just works.,POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," Originally set for production in 2001, Fury Road finally hits cinemas a mere 30 years after the last instalment, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, with Mel Gibson and Tina Turner. The director is the same, Australia’s George Miller (now 70, he was 32 when he made the original Mad Max in 1979) and the formula will be familiar to anyone who has seen the originals: it’s a more or less endless chase across the desert wastelands of a post-apocalyptic world. The question is, has it been freshened up enough to make Fury Road an intriguing and relevant addition in the manner of the Daniel Craig Bonds or does the picture trade mostly on nostalgia? Briton Tom Hardy (a six-week-old tot when the first Mad Max was released) replaces the ageing and tarnished Mel Gibson as ex-cop Max Rockatansky but the interpretation of the character is much the same.  He’s a mythic loner haunted by those he failed to protect, his own family, and now governed by a “single instinct” he tell us. “Survival.” He wants nothing to do with the bedraggled tribes of survivors who roam the desert but, as in 1981’s Road Warrior, which this most closely resembles, events compel him to take a stand. Taken prisoner by the War Boys – crazed followers of the Warlord (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who reigns Godlike in a Citadel, controlling the water supply – Max finds himself forced to choose sides in a conflict between the Warlord and his rebellious women. Hardy is an imposing, charismatic presence but he’s dour and lacks Gibson’s edgy intensity (the madness, basically) and his Max is more passenger than protagonist, literally so for the opening third when he is strapped as a helpless prisoner to the front of a nutty War Boy’s jeep. The film really belongs to a crop-haired Charlize Theron who plays Furiosa, an elite warrior of the Citadel who goes rogue and purloins an oil tanker-like “war machine” to smuggle the Warlord’s cherished possessions, five fertile women, or “prize breeders”, to the safety of a fabled promised land, “the green place”.  Like Max, she doesn’t say much (learning the film’s dialogue probably took Theron and Hardy all of 20 minutes) but she’s an intriguingly spiky, determined character, if not quite an iconic action heroine in the mould of Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley from the Alien series. Her cargo of “breeders” played by, amongst others, supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, have little individual personality but they liven up the chase and give us a reason to care. In the Road Warrior the cargo under siege was oil. Also along for the ride is Nicholas Hoult as a manic War Boy, Nux, who drives a personalised hot rod and is determined to go out in a firestorm of glory knowing death is imminent: the War Boys have contaminated blood, hence the Warlord’s breeding programme.  The picture itself is a kind of excitable scream of a movie with an endless supply of warrior-like loons in various forms of deadly, fast-moving machinery (hot rods, bikes, monster trucks) against some gorgeously shot desert backdrops.  You can almost feel the air whipping around your head and there’s an impressive lack of CGI but as an action spectacle the picture has few genuine “wow” moments, favouring constant motion over stand-out sequences.  For vehicular mayhem, it certainly can’t top the latest Fast and Furious. Still, for those who, like Hardy and were mere babes when the original was released it may have a novelty factor older viewers find missing. The Bellas are back! Three years after Pitch Perfect proved a surprise hit the all-female college a capella troupe return for more fluting frolics and an amusing rivalry with a ferocious black-leather-clad German group, Das Sound Machine.  The latter stand in their way of rehabilitation after a disastrous performance in front of President Obama during which a wardrobe malfunction involving Rebel Wilson’s hot pants provokes a national trauma.  Directed by actress Elizabeth Banks (who reprises her role as a commentator alongside the John Michael Higgins’s sexist buffoon), the picture scores with an abundance of well-staged routines, including a protracted sing-off hosted by a weird a cappella-loving millionaire, and introduces a likeable new character in Hailee Steinfeld’s Emily, a freshman hopeful of living up to her mother’s reputation as a Bella of old.  There’s rather too much of Wilson’s Fat Amy (who never quite gets the laughs) but Anna Kendrick is delightful as endearing lead singer Becca, here striving to shore up her future with an internship for a plonker music producer. Overlong, it could be sharper and funnier but hits enough high notes with its infectious joie de vivre.  Twilight’s Kristen Stewart burnishes her art house credentials in Clouds Of Sils Maria, a tiresomely talky and self-consciously cerebral French film from director Olivier Assayas. The actress gives an impressive performance as the assistant to a fading star (Juliette Binoche) who helps her boss prepare for a new role on stage, prompting lengthy debates on celebrity, acting styles and age. If only Assayas could make us as fascinated by the characters as they clearly are with themselves.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 31, 2015"," With the series’ name currently splashed in huge letters over Manhattan’s video billboards, it’s strange to remember just how small the original Mad Max was. Filmed with a handful of cars and extras from a local motorcycle gang, its low-budget realism translated into focused, powerful action sequences that most Hollywood choreography still can’t match. But it’s the sequel, The Road Warrior, that people remember. Director George Miller took the core elements of Mad Max and made everything bigger: biker gangs became futuristic tribes, and chases turned into outright warfare, culminating in an extended battle so chaotic that we needed a diagram to explain it. A few years after that, Miller decided to go even bigger, but we ended up with Beyond Thunderdome, a film that stripped out a lot of what made the series great in the first place — namely, the car chases. It took 30 years, but George Miller is back, and he’s promised to deliver what we all really want: a movie that is, as he put it, “almost a continuous chase.” It’s possible to look at parts of Mad Max: Fury Road and just see a bigger, more elaborate version of its 1980s predecessors — which isn’t a bad thing. But like the survivors of its blasted wasteland, it’s also a movie that seems intent on leaving the past behind. Fury Road is what happens when retro pulp meets social progress. And that’s the whole reason it works. Except for a 15-minute introduction, Miller keeps his promise in Fury Road. The film is one big run through a post-apocalyptic desert, which is — as usual — now ruled by a coterie of metalheads and wrestling champions. (What kind of apocalypse? All of them, basically, from peak oil to nuclear war to unspecified ""sourness."" Fury Road rightly keeps it vague.) The grizzled Max Rockatansky is now played by Tom Hardy instead of Mel Gibson, but his antagonist — a skull-masked despot named Immortan Joe — is played by the actor behind Mad Max’s lead villain. The film’s dusty, cobbled-together props and costumes are drawn straight from The  Road Warrior. Fury Road drops the ‘80s big hair and headbands, but overall, it’s amazing how well the aesthetic has held up. Fury Road, though, effectively dispenses with the chronology and backstory of Mad Max. Max refers to himself as a ""cop,"" but unlike Mel Gibson, there’s just no way Tom Hardy is old enough to have lived through the apocalypse. His antagonists, however, are still rooted in the same old world. Immortan Joe and his fellow warlords decorate themselves with the medals of long-dead militaries, adopt Roman titles, and resurrect Norse mythology. Joe is a traditionalist who has reduced women to breeding stock and men to devoted killing machines, clamoring to be chained to their cars with an IV drip of human blood. His society isn’t just what we expect from Mad Max, it’s our collective vision of the post-apocalypse: a few strong men (always men) mastering the weak, returning humanity to a state of nature. Max Rockatansky’s type has become its own cliche over the past few decades: the bereaved, stubbly man seeking vengeance for his murdered wife and child. Here, he’s haunted by the literal specter of his daughter, who appears in sudden flashbacks with the pale skin and hollow eyes of a Japanese horror film ghost. I have no idea how she died or why she existed at all, except to live on as an unusually creepy angst generator. But Max isn’t the driving force — or even, arguably, the protagonist — of Fury Road. That role belongs to Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Immortan Joe’s trusted imperator. The film’s bloody hunt, which will eventually involve dozens of cars and at least five separate factions, starts when Furiosa escapes in a ""guzzoline"" truck with Immortan Joe’s five enslaved wives, intent on finding freedom at a distant oasis. Not only does she set the plot in motion, she owns the frenetic first chase sequence, which Max spends as a bound captive of Joe’s literally bloodthirsty fighters. The pair quickly form a reluctant alliance, but she’s the one whose emotional journey we follow, while Max remains taciturn and enigmatic. Max was a lone savior in The Road Warrior, a self-sufficient misanthrope who chooses to stop and help some desperate survivors. Here, he’s just as desperate as anyone else, one of many survivors who have lost everything — even his iconic leather jacket and V8 Interceptor. He’s also, for most of the film, surrounded by women. I don’t think they get a majority of total speaking roles, but that’s only because the antagonists are uniformly aging patriarchs and their metaphorical sons. On the heroes’ side, Max and another male character are far outnumbered by Furiosa, Joe’s wives, and a group of female bikers. It's still an overwhelmingly white cast for a story that's written as mythic and universal, but after watching film after film reduce women’s roles to tokens, it feels like dropping into a mirror universe. What’s really fascinating is how casually Fury Road throws this in, and how willingly it abandons some of pulp’s most pervasive gender tropes. The film’s entire plot is about five beautiful young women escaping sexual servitude, but it’s a film during which sexual peril virtually never comes up — and when it does, it’s instantly subverted. Female characters are shot, stabbed, and run over just like male ones, but they’re never singled out by leering villains or treated like prizes. And while women might be property under Immortan Joe’s patriarchy, men are disposable, and just as tightly controlled. Rape, and gendered abuse in general, is such a standard part of ""gritty"" genre fiction that it’s often almost invisible; among other things, it helped drive both Mad Max and The Road Warrior. When it’s recognized, it’s usually defended as a touch of realism. That isn’t the case here — if anything, it would dilute Fury Road’s pure chaos. George Miller’s chase scenes are based on the idea that everyone, no matter how powerful, is only a falling rock or stray bullet away from the same grisly death. By the same token, nobody, no matter how powerless, is harmless. Even if you’re part of a warlord’s harem, there’s a reason you’ve managed to outlive almost every other human being on Earth. This isn’t just nice, or politically correct, it’s necessary. Creating one good action scene is hard. Creating two hours’ worth of them, based mostly on a formula that was developed in 1981, is harder. And filling those two hours with stunts from the same small group of haunted men and alpha brutes would be damn near impossible. Fury Road stretches the limits of Miller’s capabilities; there are only so many ways to kill someone on, around, or under a motor vehicle, and I think he’s figured out most of them. In its weakest moments, Fury Road relies on Hollywood set pieces that feel out of place with the film’s physical choreography, like a giant sandstorm. In the strongest, you have no idea which of the dozen distinct characters on screen might suddenly attempt a knuckle-biting stunt on top of a moving truck. Once they’re together, Max and Furiosa effortlessly tag-team fight and chase scenes, even when they’re clearly thinking about killing each other. Max has had plenty of sidekicks, but this might be his first partner — the modern counterpart to his 20th-century man. During a rare lull in Fury Road, an escaped wife asks a female biker if she’s shot people. ""I thought girls were above that,"" she says, upon learning that she has. The bemused response is a lot like my own when people worry about ""taking the fun"" out of action movies. I came to Fury Road for the crashes, the guns, Charlize Theron’s robot arm, and the villain who lives in a skull mountain and takes his own rock band into battle. The fact that it treats more characters like people, not props, doesn’t diminish any of that. Mad Max isn't ""growing up,"" it's just getting bigger. Fury Road is still part of an old world — a continuation of a decades-old franchise, not a revolutionary development. But it’s also proof that we can keep the wild, over-the-top fun of aging pop culture without recreating its social roles. In fact, abandoning them might be the best thing we could possibly do.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is enough to make Furious 7 look sedate by comparison. There, I wrote it. That lead sentence is probably somewhat unfair to Furious 7, which had some fairly jaw-dropping car stunts. Then again, did Furious 7 have its bad guys being urged to victory by one vehicle that was just a giant concert stage with war drummers and a speed-metal guitarist playing a guitar that shoots flames? No, it did not! This new Mad Max film does, and that’s somewhat typical of the insanity on display here. George Miller wanted to make a film of this years ago, but the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent dip in the economy hampered his efforts to obtain financing, and eventually Mel Gibson became too old and too anti-Semitic, so Tom Hardy now stars as Max Rockatansky. Taken prisoner by the warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who co-starred in the original Mad Max back in 1979), Max is rescued by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Immortan’s commanders who has helped his entire harem of wives escape his clutches and is now making a run for what she calls The Green Place. Basically, the whole movie is Furiosa running from Immortan and his horde of warriors, with Max eventually recovering enough to make a solid contribution to their quest for freedom. The movie has been garnering a lot of praise for focusing so much on the female characters. I’m sorry, I don’t find it to be that compelling as a feminist text. Yes, Theron is a fierce presence as a one-armed warrior willing to scrap for herself and the wives — she’s always more interesting when she taps into that feral side of hers. Yes, Furiosa comes from a matriarchal society, and when she goes back and finds it in tatters, she’s able to rescue most of the elders who make up its remnants. And yes, the women’s desire for freedom drives the plot. Oh God, did I just use the word “drives” like that? Sorry! Having accounted for all that, I don’t find the wives to be all that well-differentiated. One is well along into pregnancy (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), another has red hair (Riley Keough) and falls in love with Nux (Nicholas Hoult), the overlooked minion of Immortan Joe’s who ends up joining the caravan. I found myself thinking about Evan Glodell’s Bellflower, an independent movie that critiqued misogyny and referenced The Road Warrior in an insane monologue at the end. (You can find a transcript of that speech in my “best movie dialogue of 2011” post, but you’ll need to scroll to the end.) As self-indulgent as that film was, it gave a more shaded view of male power and powerlessness than this movie does.  As a car chase movie, though, this thing is the bomb. Besides the speed-metal guitarist, there’s also an extended bit at the beginning when Nux pursues Furiosa with Max strapped to the front of his car. The inventiveness of the chase sequences is matched with visual ingenuity; we see 1970s auto chassis mounted atop tank treads and monster-truck tires. The bit with the cars getting stuck in wet sand is a dexterous change of pace, and the climax involves cars with 20-foot poles mounted to them and guys climbing the poles so they can tilt themselves onto other cars. There’s even a nice fight sequence early on with all the cars stopped, as Max struggles against both Nux (whom he’s chained to) and Furiosa, backed by the women. The whole movie was filmed in the Namib Desert in southwest Africa, and cinematographer John Seale (who won an Oscar for The English Patient) films it so that you catch every grain of sand. The visual in the photo that accompanies this post, when Furiosa learns there’s little left of her childhood home and kneels while the sand blows around her, is breathtakingly beautiful. This is the purest piece of action filmmaking we’ve seen since The Raid 2, and it comes not from some young buck but from the 70-year-old director who made Babe. I’m impressed as hell.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," We’ve all been burned before, so let’s get to the nitty-gritty: Mad Max: Fury Road, thank God, is a spectacular success. Thirty-six years after he made the shoestring crash-’em-up that gave us both Mel Gibson and visual shorthand for every postapocalyptic film following in its long wake, director George Miller returns from a lengthy sojourn with animated penguins to remind us how it’s done. Fury Road is actually more closely related to the filmmaker’s two previous sequels, The Road Warrior (1981) and Beyond Thunderdome (1985), since it’s essentially one long chase scene set well into the planet’s post-oil collapse. If the original trilogy endures because of its prescience—who hasn’t imagined Bartertown on the horizon now that peak oil is mundane dinner conversation?—Fury Road advances Miller’s vision with newer extinction-event worries. After losing his V8 Interceptor in an ambush, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, perfectly cast, obviously) gets dragged off to Citadel, an oasis of sorts in the middle of an irradiated desert. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the boil-infested despot controlling the water supply and maintaining a cancer-ridden army of religious, meth-addled “war boys”. These kamikaze fuckers are just one of four armadas on the tail of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) after she busts out of Citadel in a tricked-out rig with Joe’s most precious resource: his wives. An uneasy alliance with Max ensues. And here, amid a masterful, epic symphony of truly insane stuntwork, Miller establishes Fury Road as something much greater than the average blockbuster. Political smarts aside, this maddest of Maxes also retains just enough of the original’s gonzo Ozploitation humour to satisfy the old-timers. As one exasperated ocker puts it as he careens across the desert: “All for a bloody family squabble!” Adrian Mack writes for the Georgia Straight on a number of topics, including music, film, and fascist death cults. He’s also frequently spotted around town playing a 1962 Gretsch round badge three-piece drum kit with a champagne sparkle finish. Adrian is unapologetic about his interest of UFOs,...",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2015"," There is still much to be said for George Miller's original 1979 Mad Max, a cheap but ferocious tale of rape, murder and vengeance in a gang-infested dystopia. However, only two sequels later, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) found the franchise blimping out into a steroidal freak-show. After a 30-year intermission, Fury Road is much more of the latter, now saturated with digital enhancements while almost dispensing with plot entirely. The potential audience for Fury Road wasn't born when its predecessors came out, so it was a brazen move indeed by Miller (still aboard as writer/director) to demote narrative and characterisation to submerged layers occasionally glimpsed amid the ongoing crashes, explosions, incinerations and amputations which are what the movie is made of. An opening sequence of Max (Tom Hardy, initially unrecognisable under a matted thicket of snake's-nest hair), standing beside his battered Road Warrior-mobile and gazing across a rust-coloured desert, sets him up simply as an icon we're implicitly invited to support. Who he is or how he got here aren't explained, though he is tormented by flashbacks of his dead family. Then he's captured by a gang of vampire-like War Boys and incarcerated in a towering rock called the Citadel, which is populated by assorted freaks, midgets and fleshy naked women having their breast milk methodically pumped out. As for Max, they drain his blood. This is because there's been some kind of toxic apocalypse and everybody's blood is cancerous, though not Max's. But I only know this because I read the production notes, which add helpfully that ""it's 45 years after the fall of the world."" Mainly, the movie is structured as two gigantic chase sequences – everyone goes all the way out, and then they turn round and go back again. It all kicks off when Furiosa (Charlize Theron, pictured above with Hardy), who drives a huge armoured truck called the War Rig, veers off her stipulated route and sets off for the fondly-remembered ""Green Place"" of her childhood. The idea that this is an ecological protest movie is a red herring though, since this post-civilisation malarky merely provides a blank canvas for Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris to scribble their grotesque caricatures on. Furiosa is pursued by the repulsive Immortan Joe, the diseased dictator who runs the Citadel, and his goon squad armada, with some help from the Rock Riders on their trail-bikes. Long story short, you get interminable uninterrupted slabs of outlandish custom-made cars, bikes, jeep-type things covered with spikes etc roaring across the desert trying to destroy each other, with ghoulish figures on long bendy poles lobbing explosives from a great height. Booming pseudo-metal music rages incessantly – the pursuers have enormous drums and a heavy metal guitarist harnessed to the front of one of their vehicles – to the point where it starts to batter you into a trance-like state. In the entire two-hour duration Hardy and Theron barely get a page of dialogue between them, with Hardy's occasional grunted syllables making him sound oddly like Simon Day's satiric rock star, Brian Pern. Green issues aside, Fury Road does also tout a sort of feminist agenda, with Theron apparently welcoming the notion of playing an ""alpha female"" who slugs it out on equal terms with Hardy. Furiosa's homeland, or what remains of it, turns out to be populated by a weatherbeaten matriarchy who wield shotguns like grizzled frontierswomen. Part of Furiosa's mission is to rescue Immortan Joe's harem of oppressed, captive wives (pictured above), though since they turn out to be a bevy of underdressed wet-dream lovelies (including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz and former Dior model Riley Keough), any ""progressive"" pretensions seem paper-thin here. If you're a hardcore computer gamer inured to marathon sessions of annihilation while being pulverised by Death Metal from wall-to-wall speaker stacks, this may be the movie for you. For myself, not so much.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 31, 2015"," Thank goodness somebody finally gave George Miller $150m to make a Mad Max film. Fury Road harks back to the director’s 70s/80s trilogy in a number of ways – most closely to 1981’s Road Warrior – but nevertheless feels like the Mad Max film Miller has always wanted to make, at last shorn of budget restraints. As a result, the 70-year-old director injects as much raucous energy into this film as in any of its predecessors. Miller’s last two features were the CGI cute-fests Happy Feet and Happy Feet Two, and he hasn’t worked on a live-action picture since 1998’s Babe: Pig in the City; Fury Road feels like a glorious release of pent-up, demented energy. Miller has reimagined his apocalyptic future wasteland – in which scarce gasoline is the most sought-after commodity – as opposed to completely reinventing it. This time things revolve around a crazed dictator called Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max) who keeps the ravaged population subdued by controlling the water supply, while his army of car-obsessed fanatics work to do his bidding. We begin when a routine supply run is revealed to be a ruse: lead driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is actually smuggling Immortan Joe’s “breeders” (captive women with whom he hopes to procreate) out of his citadel to a promised land across the desert. Max (Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson) ends up involved in this by accident – chained to the front of one of the cars sent to recover the missing women. From there, the film plays out as a mad, spectacular chase, as the rig driven by Furiosa flees from Joe’s vehicular warriors. The film expounds on its plot in much the same way that its predecessors did: through hints, asides and audience guesswork. Miller invites us to luxuriate in the insane concoction he has imagined up: we don’t get the finer details, and we don’t need them. We also don’t have much time for them – once we’re out on the road, the film’s extended vehicular action sequences fly past at a furious pace. But this indulgence is not an exercise in repetition; nor is it lazy plotting. Miller builds his film around these gargantuan chases, but not because of a lack of material. The sheer imagination and lunatic propulsion of these scenes is the point of the film. The fact that he manages to establish likable characters during this time is the icing on the cake. Chief among these is Charlize Theron’s Furiosa, who is both the heart and the muscles of the film. It’s an action heroine role the likes of which we rarely see: tough, conflicted, emotionally resonant and thoroughly memorable. Given the film’s title and the series’ propensity for macho insanity (though to be fair it has also featured strong female characters), we might not expect feminism, but Furiosa – and indeed the escaping ‘wives’ she’s protecting – add real steel and charisma to proceedings. Throwing the supposed hero, Max, into this mix is a stroke of genius from Miller and his co-writers – playfully and effectively subverting our expectations. Not that Max himself suffers for this, however; Hardy plays him with a fitting mix of mad energy and the same removed charisma that Mel Gibson channelled in the originals, and which inspired comparisons to Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name. He’s not a man of many words, though he does get one of the most poignant lines late on. Throw Nicholas Hoult’s Nux – a crazed member of Joe’s elite guard – into the mix, and you’ve got a memorable triple-header. Miller throws everything at the screen in balletic, joyous conflagrations that, while long and in some ways repetitious, never get boring. As viewers, we’re too busy revelling in the inventiveness of these scenes to be longing for plot exposition or background information. Throughout, Miller plays with the frame rate, speeding up and slowing down shots, fast cutting into and out of little fragments of memory, all of which accentuates the sense of out-of-control madness. If the final act flags a teeny bit, it can be forgiven, because it isn’t drawn out. FAN THE FIRE is a digital magazine about lifestyle and creative culture.

"Aug 31, 2015"," Cult classics aren’t always immune to vulnerabilities inflicted by time. Age occasionally withers them, and the evolution of cinematic preferences over successive generations more often than not renders these ‘time pieces’ a quirky, unappreciated relic of another era.  In many ways, Fury Road , the fourth outing in the Mad Max franchise, is an anachronistic gamble. The most recent Mad Max film, set in an apocalyptic after-world, came out in 1985, which is, relative to the richness of today’s cinematic experience, practically the Stone Age. And Fury Road seemed fatally jinxed: it’s been in the making for over 13 years, thanks to extraordinary delays in the production process.   But thank the Gods of Cinema that George Miller, who directed all three earlier Mad Max films, never gave up on his signature project! For what we have here is an enormously entertaining film that passes on the baton of the classic ‘road warrior’ saga to a new generation of cinemagoers.   Reduced to its bare essentials, Fury Road is just one long chase sequence. And, yet, over two hours of high-octane action, Miller keeps you glued to your seat and hooked on madness. In a curious way, Fury Road marks the triumph of the director over the screenplay writer: the kernel of the story germinated not from a script, but from a 3,500-panel storyboard. And given that Mad Max (played splendidly by Tom Hardy) is a man of very few words, there’s little by way of dialogue in the film. But, in fact, who needs a screenplay when the roar of adrenaline — among other male hormones — pretty much drowns out anything except the thunderous roar of firearms and flamethrowers, and the quirky wail of the double-headed electric guitar that the Doofus Warrior, one of villain Immortan Joe’s ‘warboys’, plucks away at for the entire duration of the chase?  Fury Road also momentarily resurrects a lost old world in film-making: Miller all but eschews CGI special effects, and opts instead for real-world, flesh-and-blood stunt sequences. The sight of the ‘polecats’ swinging around in the desert fight scenes is particularly thrilling. The cinematography by John Seale, who came out of retirement to shoot for Miller, captures the grittiness of the wasteland so vividly you can almost get a whiff of the protagonists’ body odour. Hardy is great as an authentic Aussie cop, Mad Max, who is haunted by his failure to protect his family and is fighting just to stay alive. His ally in the battle against the villainous Joe is Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron), who too is seeking a kind of redemption. There’s been much animated chatter about an embedded feminist propagandist message, channelled by Theron, in the film. But that is just so silly. Fury Road is the ultimate adrenaline movie: it starts off, engines revving, and never takes its foot off the accelerator for close to two hours. It is one wild ride.

"Aug 31, 2015"," These directors are household names, and there are certainly one more you should add to that list -- George Miller. Why he isn’t on the list already is a mystery. He’s a four-times-nominated Oscar-winner with an impressive resume of hits, including the original ""Mad Max"" movie trilogy, which has inspired no end of imitators. The film begins with leather-clad, hirsute Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) overlooking a barren desert landscape. We hear Max ruminating about the condition of this post-apocalyptic world and his place in it. His voice is so deep, so guttural and filled with emotion, it rattles your bones and slaps your soul. It’s not long before a group of War Boys rain down on Max and take him back to the Citadel, the lair of Immortan Joe -- a menacing, disgusting concoction of boils, long gray hair and a face mask that would scare Freddy Krueger. He is a nightmare -- but unlike Taylor Swift, he’s not dressed like a daydream. He rules the Citadel with an iron fist, hoarding this world’s most precious commodity, water, while breeding War Boys to do his bidding. What we know about Max we learn through haunting, brilliantly realized flashbacks. He’s the epitome of silent rage and heartbreak, a survivor who doesn’t want to die, though he isn’t really alive. Let’s leave it there, because while he’s the title character, Max is not the star of this show. Meet Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. She drives one of the Joe’s war machines. You have to be several steps beyond tough for this particular job: It involves handling a mechanized rig on hostile desert roads, where you’re almost certain to encounter multiple entities who want to kill you. Sounds like a terrible gig, and it is -- but in this time and place, it’s good work if you can get it. Furiosa’s not only harboring ill feelings toward Joe, she’s also smuggling his five ridiculously stunning wives out of the Citadel. That infuriates Joe, who unleashes his army of War Boys on Furiosa, setting up a chain of events that will allow her and Max to meet. That’s really all I want to tell you about the plot. Please go discover the rest for yourself. What I do want you to know is in Furiosa, Miller and Theron have teamed up to give us one of the greatest female action characters of all time. And I didn’t even get to Nicholas Hoult’s excellent performance as War Boy Nux, or the quiet brilliance of Hardy as Max. I’m only allowed so many words. Not one frame of this movie is wasted. It feels as if every moment is loaded with conflict: Visually stunning, aurally pleasing, impactful conflict. Joe’s army of tricked-out, rusty, all-terrain vehicles even comes with drummers, and a guitar player who seems as if he was bred from the DNA of Eddie Van Halen, Gene Simmons and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

"Aug 31, 2015"," “Mad Max: Fury Road” has been nothing short of a cinematic phenomenon for 2015. It has been one of the highest praised films of the year, not only in the action genre, but for all films in general. With so much love for it, as usual, we must ask the important question of whether or not it is truly deserved. After all, the original “Mad Max” had gotten a fair amount of praise itself, but was actually a rather flat and dull outing. That being said, we should give the return of “The Road Warrior” the benefit of the doubt, for, if nothing else, this infamous cinematic character has garnered an impressive cult fan base over the last few decades. Now, with the return of director/co-writer George Miller, a new cast, and a much larger budget, we can see if the 30-year wait was worth it as this cinematic legend gets an update for a new generation. Taking place in an apocalyptic wasteland, our “hero” Max (Tom Hardy) has the same thing on his mind as everyone else: Survival. Things get a little rough right from the start as he is captured by some henchmen of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a leader who keeps his people in check by having complete control over the only source of water. Upon Max’s arrival at their headquarters, “The Citadel,” one of Joe’s underlings, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is going on a gasoline run in a fully-loaded war rig. However, it turns out she has other plans, suddenly straying from the road and heading out in a different direction. Understandably, Joe is furious and sends out a pursuit party, one of which, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), ties Max to the hood of his car and uses him as a “blood bag.” Eventually we learn that Furiosa is simply trying to help Joe’s five wives/”breeders” escape captivity, a cause that will eventually unite them with Max and Nux as they try to flee in an epic chase that spans a multitude of miles through mostly open desert. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the kind of film that is the very reason we have the phrase “style over substance.” About 90% of the film is a combination of chasing, racing, crashes, and explosions, all of which are done with the utmost technical prowess, but when you look beneath the surface, you’re going to find that there’s not much else to see. The characters here are sadly rather flat and one-dimensional, and the plot, as much as there is of one, feels like more of an afterthought than something that Miller and his co-writers planned out thoroughly. All of this begs that another question be asked: Can a film be all style and no substance and still be recommendable? That’s a question that can really only be answered by each viewer on an individual basis. Do you care that you’re getting nothing more than a shiny surface with hardly anything else to speak of beneath the superficial level? If not, then you’re sure to have a hell of a time with the spectacular stunt sequences that happen throughout these two action-packed hours. However, if you do care, then you’re going to find yourself wondering why you should be caring one bit about what’s going on. I find myself at something of a middle ground. I appreciated all of the hard work that went into the insane action sequences, and had some fun seeing what looked like impossible moves being pulled off. When it came to the 17-minute climactic chase in which some of the villains were swinging around on poles, I even came close to recommending it right then and there due to it being one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen on film. But throughout the film, as some of the lengthier action scenes dragged on, there was an undeniable feeling of wanting it to move forward with the plot, as opposed to just having them chase each other for several minutes at a time. That being said, while I can’t fully recommend the film, it’s not one that I would tell you to stay away from either. As mentioned, the stunts are extremely impressive, as are many of the technical aspects of the film, including the cinematography, editing, and visual effects. There is certainly a lot to admire about it, but at the end of all the action, after the last car has crashed and burned, I find myself wondering what it was all for when there was so little actually going on with the storyline and characters. As mentioned, and has actually clearly been shown, the adrenaline of the relentless action will be more than enough for some people, but for those looking for a little more than just a shiny surface, it won’t quite reach an acceptable level of satisfaction. “Mad Max: Fury Road” comes to Blu-ray in a remarkable 2.4:1, 1080p High Definition transfer that presents a flawless picture throughout, which does great justice to the incredible stunt work performed in the lengthy car chases. The 5.1 Dolby Atmos audio is equally high quality, giving you the thundering score and multiple sound effects in perfect clarity. Overall, fans that have been waiting for the home release will be more than satisfied with the treatment the film has been given. Maximum Fury: Filming Fury Road (28 Minutes): A fascinating look at how the film was planned via storyboards and how it was filmed, featuring interviews with the cast and crew, as well as lots of behind the scenes footage. Definitely worth watching. Mad Max: Fury on Four Wheels (22 Minutes): A featurette that focuses on the cars used in the film. If this is something you are into, then you’ll probably find it worth checking out. The Road Warriors: Max and Furiosa (11 Minutes): A featurette that explores the two main characters through interviews with the cast and crew. Unfortunately, given the lack of characterization in the film, they don’t have that much to say, making this one you can easily skip. The Tools of the Wasteland (14 Minutes): A neat look behind the scenes at the props and costumes made for the film, featuring interviews with the cast and crew. Worth watching. The Five Wives: So Shiny, So Chrome (11 Minutes): Like the other character featurette, this is rather superficial, especially given that these characters are even less developed than the others. Easily skippable. Fury Road: Crash & Smash (4 Minutes): A brief collection of behind the scenes footage that takes a look at the chases, crashes, and explosions in the film. It may be short, but it’s rather interesting to see the raw footage. Deleted Scenes (3 Minutes): Three pointless scenes that were easily cut from the film. Even die-hard fans will agree that their deletion was no loss. “Mad Max: Fury Road” will be a delight to anyone looking for nothing more than an adrenaline-fueled, action-packed thrill ride, but for those who expect a little more thought put into the story and characters, it will be something of a slight disappointment. It’s by no means a “bad” film for there are many things to like about it, including the impressive stunts and its outstanding technical aspects, but without a solid foundation, we’re pretty much left with a film that looks great and has a little excitement to offer, but not much else.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 25, 2015"," Dirigido por George Miller. Roteiro de Miller, Brendan McCarthy e Nick Lathouris. Com: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Nathan Jones, Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton. Para saber como seria um filme que tomou ácido e cheirou cocaína, basta assistir a Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria. Louco como o personagem-título, este retorno do veterano cineasta George Miller à série que consagrou Mel Gibson é uma overdose sensorial, um longa de ação ao mesmo tempo clássico em sua abordagem e extremamente contemporâneo em sua energia. Com roteiro escrito por Miller ao lado dos estreantes Brendan McCarthy e Nick Lathouris, Estrada da Fúria se passa num universo pós-apocalíptico no qual o combustível e a água são líquidos preciosos e que parece ter se transformado num imenso deserto. Trazendo referências periféricas aos longas anteriores, esta nova produção não pode ser considerada continuação, refilmagem ou reboot: aqui, Max (Hardy) já perdeu sua família há alguns anos, mas o mundo no qual habita não é exatamente aquele do original. Além disso, a trama é o que menos importa desta vez, já que o projeto se resume a longas sequências de ação que trazem o protagonista sendo perseguido pelo vilão Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne, que também viveu um dos vilões do original), que encontra-se determinado a capturar a guerreira Imperator Furiosa (Theron), que fugiu de sua fortaleza levando seu harém particular. Comprovando que a falta de uma trama elaborada não compromete necessariamente o resultado final de uma produção cinematográfica, já que esta é uma arte visual na qual a narrativa é mais importante do que a história, Estrada da Fúria diverte graças ao absurdo do universo que constrói e que abriga não só personagens com nomes como Rictus e... ora... Imperator Furiosa, mas também conceitos como o do Doador Universal (que aqui ganha contornos extremos), guerreiros kamikazes que anseiam se sacrificar em nome de Immortan Joe (cujo visual é uma mistura de Bane e Beetlejuice) e uma sociedade que idolatra o automobilismo, entregando-se a cânticos de “V8!” e usando expressões como “Isso é muito cromo!”. Aliás, a imaginação de George Miller ganha vida graças ao excepcional trabalho de design de produção de Colin Gibson (candidato sério aos principais prêmios do ano), que confere personalidade até mesmo aos veículos empregados pelos personagens – e meus favoritos são aqueles que trazem a carroceria de um carro sobre a base de um tanque, aquele que parece um porco-espinho e, claro, um terceiro que inclui imensas caixas de som e um guitarrista em sua estrutura. Chegando mesmo a fazer referência visual ao clássico Metrópolis ao trazer uma máquina gigantesca que incorpora elementos humanos em seus mecanismos, Gibson é beneficiado também pela parceria com o diretor de fotografia John Seale (mais um que merece indicações), que evita a paleta cinza e dessaturada da maior parte dos filmes pós-apocalípticos e opta por investir em cores intensas que tendem a valorizar o contraste esteticamente agradável entre o laranja das cenas diurnas e o azul das noturnas (e o trabalho de correção de cores que ocorre na pós-produção permite ressaltar contrastes em um mesmo plano, como aquele que traz Max e Furiosa no banco da frente, mergulhados em azul, e as garotas que resgatam logo no banco de trás banhadas em laranja). No entanto, o que realmente torna Estrada da Fúria magnífico é a energia impressionante de suas sequências de ação – e a principal delas toma (sem exagero) praticamente toda a primeira hora de projeção, sendo fabuloso constatar como George Miller sustenta o ritmo ao torná-la cada vez mais insana em sua concepção, começando com uma simples perseguição e culminando em tempestades de areia, motocicletas que atiram bombas durante saltos, brigas que trazem oponentes acorrentados um ao outro e assim por diante. Mas mais importante do que isso é constatar como o septuagenário Miller dá uma surra de câmera (copyright meu) em diretores bem mais jovens como Joss Whedon (nem vou citar Michael Bay, pois seria covardia) ao demonstrar como não é necessário tornar a ação incompreensível para conferir tensão, energia e dinamismo ao que vemos na tela. Sem depender de cortar a cada milésimo de segundo e jamais movimentando o quadro como se o operador da câmera tivesse Mal de Parkinson, Miller permite que o espectador sempre saiba onde estão os personagens, em que direção se movimentam, suas relações espaciais uns com os outros e com a geografia que os cerca, chegando mesmo a empregar algo cada vez mais raro em longas do gênero: planos conjuntos que se detêm alguns longos segundos antes de darem lugar a outros mais fechados. Para completar, o cineasta toma uma decisão narrativa curiosa que tinha tudo para dar errado, mas acaba funcionando apesar do estranhamento que provoca inicialmente: o uso, durante as sequências de ação, de um frame rate mais baixo do que os 24 quadros por segundo habituais e que provocam uma sensação de movimento acelerado (algo como ocorre quando vemos, hoje em dia, os filmes da época do Cinema mudo, rodados a 16fps). Assim, é como se o próprio longa entrasse em modo turbo sempre que os personagens partem para o confronto, o que também é eficaz ao estabelecer um contraponto às cenas mais calmas, nas quais estes apenas conversam em tom baixo e cuidadoso. (E por falar em conversas, é bom reparar que Estrada da Fúria passaria até mesmo no famoso teste de Bechdel, já que suas personagens femininas se mostram independentes e discutem questões que fogem muito de sua relação com os homens. Homens que, por sinal, elas salvam repetidas vezes ao longo da jornada.) Trazendo tanta ação que pode se dar até mesmo ao luxo de, em certo momento, mostrar o protagonista partindo para um confronto e voltando segundos depois com sinais de ter protagonizado uma luta feroz (que jamais vemos), Estrada da Fúria certamente morreria de overdose caso fosse uma pessoa. Como não é, porém, podemos apreciar sua viagem alucinada sem culpa ou preocupação alguma – e torcer para que Miller retorne ao narguilé mais algumas vezes. Update: Originalmente, o texto trazia uma menção a Michael J. Fox numa piada tola que, depois de criticada (justamente) por vários leitores, optei por retirar. Pior do que cometer um erro é não admiti-lo e, por orgulho tolo, insistir em mantê-lo vivo.",POSITIVE

Having arrived at my 1997 high school debutante ball in a cheez-orange HT Monaro GTS 350 pumping Rose Tattoo’s We Can’t Be Beaten, I feel uniquely qualified to tell you that Mad Max: Fury Road – which opens in Australia today — is a holy-rolling hoon sermon shouted from the top of Mt Panorama to the true believers. George Miller’s paean to car culture is evident in the deathly earnest “V8s” prayer hands that Immortan Joe’s War Boys raise to their leader, and in the sublime idiocy of The Doof Warrior’s flame-spewing electric guitar, and in the Bullet Farmer’s goddamned Valiant Charger with a Merlin V8 on tank treads. In a landscape that exists somewhere on the same spiritual plane as The Road Warrior, Max Rockatansky (a soulful Tom Hardy) is stolen into the nightmarish Citadel of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Burn, the original Toecutter): a despot who controls the water supply and whips his War Boys into a kamikaze frenzy with the promise of eternal glory in Valhalla. A universal donor, Max is strung up to serve as a “blood bag” for one of Joe’s ailing War Boys, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who — like most of the Citadel’s residents — has been left bubonic by the apocalypse. When Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is tasked with leading a guzzoline-fuelled convoy to neighbouring Gastown and Bullet Farm, she instead escapes with Joe’s wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton), “breeders” kept in luxurious bondage in the non-consensual hope that they might bear him a viable heir. Soon enough no fewer than three war parties (from the Citadel, Gastown, and the Bullet Farm) are in hot pursuit of Furiosa’s War Rig, including Nux’s Deuce Coupe, with blood bag Max strapped to the hood like the Spirit of Ecstasy. From there it’s roughly two hours’ worth of glorious insanity; as Nux cries at the wheel of his war machine, “OH WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!” Much like the Grand Old Duke of York, if he were marshalling at Calder Park, Miller drives his war parties to the top of the map and drives them down again: plot, in the Save The Cat sense, is in as short supply as water here, which only serves to make Fury Road all the more thrilling. This is action elevated (or lowered?) to an elemental level; as though Miller has taken the expected excesses of modern action filmmaking and distilled them into something approaching transcendence. Indeed, it feels as though Fury Road could kickstart an era of “existential action movies”, much like the rise of the existential western at the turn of the century. Happily, where existential westerns depended on subverting the sweeping vistas of John Ford and co. by way of meaningful glances and Jonny Greenwood scores, the existential action movie — if Fury Road is any indication — somehow manages to subvert the last twenty years of action idiocy by adding even more explosions. Miller’s insistence on practical effects for the bulk of the action shots pays off: Fury Road, for all its mind-bending action, is the realest-feeling thrillride in years. He gives audiences what they think they want (rear-axle flips in slow motion) then follows it up with what they didn’t even know they wanted (SeaChange’s John Howard as the porcine and nipple-pierced People Eater in a stretch Merc covered in high-end car grilles). The spectacle is aided by vehicle designs that make the original trilogy seem like an auction of fleet rentals: chief production designer and art director Colin Gibson’s demented armada of souped-up Franken-rods beggars belief. And, keeping things strictly Australian New Wave, the spine-covered vehicles favoured by desert nomads the Buzzards are a charming nod to the eponymous spiky VW Bug of Peter Weir’s Cars That Ate Paris. Calls for stunt work to be recognised by the Academy should reach fever pitch upon this film’s release; if second-unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris doesn’t get an Oscar, he should at least receive a knighthood. Critics of a certain vintage have taken great pleasure in noting that Miller and cinematographer John Seale are both 70 years old — the barely veiled subtext, given the film’s thrilling action sequences, being, “Whoa! Way to go, granddads!”. The delicious irony here is that that’s the point: Fury Road works precisely because Miller and Seale inject it with the wisdom of their combined years. A wunderkind couldn’t have made this film (Miller was already a grownup when he made his debut with Mad Max), and wouldn’t have had the guts to stick with tracking shots instead of a frenetic post-Matrix cut-’em-up; editor Margaret Sixel favours an almost languid pace during some scenes of destruction, amping up the dreamlike quality. Much like Herzog’s and Godard’s recent adventures in 3D, Mad Max has the fearlessness of a filmmaker who cares only to double down on his specific creative vision. There’s a fearlessness, too, in using a ripsnorting demolition derby to deliver both an environmental cautionary tale, and a treatise on the abuse of women. The first point shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone familiar with Miller’s astounding Happy Feet, a blockbuster whose environmentalist credentials were broadcast at about the same volume as James Cameron’s Avatar. The true message of Happy Feet wasn’t “dance to the beat of your own drum”, but rather a warning about the dangers of overfishing, transmitted via Busby Berkeley-esque routines to Beach Boys and disco songs. Similarly, the stark reality of a world without water is, for all the moments of post-apocalyptic gore and vehicular decapitation, the true horror of Fury Road. And on the second point, it’s not really even Max’s story: rather, it’s Furiosa’s, her own tale of redemption and recovery from abuse mirrored in the lives of Joe’s wives. (Miller has more or less confirmed that a sequel would focus on her.) The characters who serve to populate her origin story, the film’s surprising twist, are the most exciting contributions to the action genre in years. Charlize Theron as Furiosa with (L-R) Abbey Lee as The Dag, Courtney Eaton as Cheedo The Fragile, Zoe Kravitz as Toast the Knowing, and Riley Keough as Capable. A number of reviews have made giddy reference to Fury Road’s Bechdel Test-passing credentials, but to see the film’s triumph as being solely that it contains a number of female characters who talk to each other is to grossly underestimate its revolutionary nature. Yes, this is a film with no shortage of awesome female characters, but it is also a wildly mainstream action tentpole where old women, fat women, and people with disabilities extensively populate the screen without fanfare. They are not “permitted” to appear by way of focus group lip service, or to provide edgy colour and movement; they just are. Want more Junkee in your life?

"Aug 12, 2015"," You have never seen anything quite like Mad Max: Fury Road. Jaw-droppingly beautiful when it isn't horrifyingly ugly, this is a literal vision of hell-on-wheels and features some of the most astonishing action ever committed to film. Lit by scarlet fireballs and peopled by irradiated mutants, the world of Mad Max is not for the faint of heart, but it's heart-pounding, visceral stuff. The story, such as it is, sees Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) imprisoned in the Citadel, an oasis in the wilderness fed by a deep aquifer and ruled with an iron fist by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). This despot is worshipped as a god by his followers, but when the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) steals his imprisoned wives (including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz and Riley Keough) Joe sets off in pursuit. Max reluctantly teams up with the fugitives and a chase through the desert ensues, with Immortan Joe determined to recover his breeding stock. Nicholas Hoult's demented young War Boy Nux is especially good, and Huntington-Whiteley is surprisingly splendid as Splendid - even the nominal leads are only loosely sketched beyond their extraordinary names. Hardy's Max probably says fewer than 500 words in total, and his conversations with Furiosa (the true lead, judging by impact and screentime) are chiefly composed of glances or grimaces. The chase is the thing, and here director George Miller and his cinematographer John Searles excel. You're left in awe of shots of dust clouds, never mind the bloody fireballs that suddenly light them or the mutant terrors who loom from the swirl. The desert locations - Namibia filling in for the Outback after record rainfall turned the Australian desert green - are stunning in their emptiness, only the heat haze providing a backdrop for the long struggle to escape. At one point, when night turns the desert blue, you hope that our heroes have passed into a sort of purgatory, but bent figures walking on sticks like something from a Hieronymus Bosch painting soon put paid to any such notions of true escape. The bad guy here is the sort of ruler who rolls out alongside a huge truck composed entirely of amplifiers, drummers, and a blind guitarist wielding an axe that is also an actual axe and incidentally a flamethrower. His hunting party is like a post-apocalyptic heavy metal concept album, a nightmarish blend of rock opera and Viking raiding party, belching out greasy smoke in its wake. Their ill-bred hybrid machines can't be described as mere ""cars""; they're true monster trucks, spiked and souped up and guzzling whatever resources this devastated world has left. Jeremy Clarkson would love them. But Miller is after more than mere vehicular chaos. Soon the face-painted, scarred War Boys are flipping from one vehicle to another like precarious pole-vaulters, hurling grenade-tipped spears and dodging fireballs like modern commuters dodge buggies. Max and Furiosa have only an armoured tanker and a handful of bullets against overwhelming odds - and yet you wouldn't bet against them. It's brutal and bloody, but by god it's a breathtaking fight.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2015"," Set within a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Mad Max follows Mel Gibson's Max Rockatansky as he struggles to maintain law and order in the face of an increasingly violent population. Filmmaker George Miller has infused Mad Max with the structure of an old-school western, essentially, as the movie predominantly revolves around the title character's ongoing battle with a gang of ruthless bikers (led by Hugh Keays-Byrne's malevolent Toecutter). The relative lack of action and distinctly uneven plotting is, for the most part, not as problematic as one might've feared, with Gibson's thoroughly charismatic performance, along with Miller's treatment of the film's few high-octane moments, going a long way towards keeping things interesting for the majority of Mad Max's mercifully brief running time. It's worth noting, however, that the film does suffer from a palpable lull as it progresses into its uneventful midsection, with the spinning-its-wheels vibe perpetuated by a surplus of time-wasting, decidedly pointless interludes (eg a character enjoys a cabaret show). The energetic final stretch ensures that Mad Max concludes on an appreciatively positive note, although, in the end, it's rather difficult to see why the film has amassed such a glowing reputation in the years since its 1979 debut.  Set within a desolate post-apocalyptic wasteland, Mad Max: Fury Road follows Tom Hardy's Max Rockatansky as he must help a fierce warrior (Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa)  smuggle precious cargo out of a warlord's ruthless grip. Filmmaker George Miller has clearly spared no expense in bringing this almost alien world to life and the movie does, as a result, possess a lot of potential in its early scenes, with the stunning production design heightened by Miller's crisp, refreshingly coherent visuals and a series of above-average performances. (In terms of the latter, however, it's impossible to overlook the fact that much of the film's dialogue is rendered unintelligible by heavy accents and a cranked-up soundtrack.) It's only as the thinly-plotted narrative begins moving in earnest that one's interest begins to flag, as Miller's difficulties in establishing any real sense of momentum makes it impossible to care about the various characters' continuing exploits - with the erratic atmosphere perpetuated by a screenplay that essentially lurches from one aggressively over-the-top action sequence to the next (ie the connective tissue is so slight that the myriad of larger-than-life set pieces eventually just become exhausting.) The viewer's lack of interest is exacerbated by Miller's refusal/inability to transform any of the movie's protagonists into  legitimately engaging figures, and it is, as a result, difficult to work up much enthusiasm for their progressively perilous exploits or their ongoing efforts at taking down the aforementioned warlord. The endless action of the film's third act ensures that Mad Max: Fury Road concludes on a decidedly underwhelming note and it's ultimately impossible not to wish that Miller hadn't, at any point, followed the old less-is-more axiom.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 14, 2015"," 
And so we return, after a full three decades, to the post-apocalypse as rendered by George Miller. Same as it ever was: Miller’s beloved original Mad Max trilogy, fronted by Mel Gibson, was a frenetic hell of sand and blood and lawless freakazoids, and the tradition continues in Mad Max: Fury Road. Gibson’s Max, one felt, was mad in both popular senses of the term, angry and insane. The rather more soulful Tom Hardy, inheriting the role, conveys only the insanity. Someone else holds the anger this time. There it is, right in the title, evoking “Nor hell a fury like a woman scorn’d.” Even the heroine is named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). This Mad Max is about female rage in the face of warlike male dominion. I don’t think Miller sat down intending to craft an action-flick SCUM Manifesto; he probably considered it a cracking good yarn, which it is, one that deviates from what he’s done with Max before, which it does. The plot is simplicity itself: Furiosa rescues five young women from the grandiloquent warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). They had been kept for breeding purposes, and one of them bears Joe’s child; now they are on the move in Furiosa’s massive war rig. Joe’s minions, a pack of powdered baldies called the War Boys, take off after them, and one of the Boys, the sickly Nux (Nicholas Hoult), is hooked up to Max, feeding off his blood. Joe and his people — his whole way of life — are premised on using people like disposable product. Furiosa is conceived in opposition to that. Much of the action is real, not sculpted in a computer, and Miller gets a properly caffeinated vibe going by speeding up the frame rate — some of the motions look jerky, impatient. Where the pacing is more jagged, the images, courtesy of veteran cinematographer John Seale, are rich and bronzed and fierce — the hues pop, the compositions have rock-solid clarity. Technically, as pure cinema, Fury Road is masterful, unimpeachable. It deals in the lost art of readable, exciting set pieces; the editing is a hell of a lot more “cutty” than it was in Max’s prior outings, but Miller still manages to root everything in plausible physicality. The movie is getting slightly overpraised for this very reason; by doing what action cinema should be expected to do, it has earned shiny gifts of rhetoric from a grateful nation of movie geeks. Expect fun, excitement, thrills, and surprisingly relevant subtext; ignore most of the hype telling you it’s the sun and the moon. Besides, some of the action is rather obviously computer-enhanced — a dust storm so chaotic, with multiple tornadoes, that we wonder how anyone survives it — and some of it is a bit samey and repetitive, which has been a problem with this series from the beginning; the constant roar of engines becomes almost a lullaby. The freakiness elevates the film. Maleness is represented mostly by cultish deformity, death’s-head zombies looking like Kurtz’s Montagnard spectres near the end of Apocalypse Now. Femaleness, when not roughly used for reproduction and milk, seeks to get back to an idyllic sisterhood in the greenness of nature. In the middle of this is Max, and the hyper-masculine Mel Gibson wouldn’t have worked as this particular in-between avatar — Tom Hardy, with his full lips and yearning eyes mitigating his punchy features, carries enough femininity to place him naturally opposite Immortan Joe and his despoilers. Hardy is content to hand the movie over to Charlize Theron, who gives a no-nonsense performance eloquent in its silences. Talk is bad in these movies, as if language were as scarce as water and petrol, and were to be hoarded as violently.",POSITIVE
"Jul 4, 2015"," It’s hard to believe, but it has been 30 years since Mad Max roared onto theater screens, but in my opinion, the series hasn’t missed a beat based on Mad Max: Fury Road. To put it mildly, it is a thrilling adventure that not only makes a great summer movie, but works as a stand-alone film that doesn’t require even having any knowledge of the first three films which all starred Mel Gibson, beginning with 1979’s classic, Mad Max.  The role was definitely an iconic one for Gibson, one of the defining roles of his career, but as I say in my video review above, Tom Hardy walks right into it like he’s been playing it all his career. And he does it, like all great action figures, with minimal dialogue and lots of imposing presence. And, in a nice twist for the saga, he is matched every step of the way by a new character, a kick-ass female Furiosa played in balls-out style by Charlize Theron in her best screen turn in a long while. I would say she is born to play this character, who is every bit the equal of the male lead, a real departure for this type of testosterone-driven film. The plot, in fact, is literally driven by Furiosa who escapes from the Citadel, a haven of water and what remains of human life in a vast wasteland, that is run by the evil, creepy and tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played Toecutter in the original 1979 film). But she doesn’t just do it herself, she takes his precious cargo known as Five Wives aka breeders who are used virtually as slaves simply to procreate. This leads to several more riveting action sequences, as the Road War to end all Road Wars commences with the Warlords and gangs going after the rebels. Along the way an initially reluctant Max, who believes the best way to survive is as a loner, finds himself in concert with Furiosa and these women , along with the youthful War Boy, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who is trying to escape his own dreary fate but does it in style. The key to making this all work is in having original director George Miller back for another ride. He knows these characters, this milieu better than anyone and has had three decades away from it to really re-imagine this unique world and make it work every bit as well as it did the first three times. Helping tremendously is the absolutely stunning cinematography from Oscar winner John Seale. With its bright colors and startlingly blue skies this Mad Max looks unlike any post-apocalyptic movie ever made. In fact it recalls the great Monument Valley westerns of John Ford. And really that is what Max Max: Fury Road is, a ride of a lifetime with true classic western sensibilities. The key cast is rounded out by Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton as the five wives. Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris co-wrote the effective pedal-to-the-metal script.  Doug Mitchell and PJ Voeten join Miller as producers. Warner Bros, in association with Village Roadshow, is releasing the film worldwide beginning this week right after its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday.

"Jun 25, 2015"," In an apocalyptic wasteland, Max (Tom Hardy) is haunted by the faces of people begging to be saved, presumably because he failed to do so or never tried. Taken down by a gang of gearhead wastelanders, Max is kept in captivity for his healthy blood to allow the dying to live a little longer. An opportunity to escape presents itself when he’s taken for a ride to run down a renegade fuel driver (Charlize Theron), but when he discovers the real cargo she’s carrying, he’ll have to decide if risking his freedom and survival is worth helping others who need it just as badly. With the latest attempt to make the summer moviegoing experience into a theme park ride, Mad Max returns to theaters to declare the apocalyptic wasteland crazy and fun again (for us to watch, not for the characters). The madness is in our face this time, getting a view of the horror behind Max’s eyeballs; you almost hope the end comes quickly for him, but going down without a fight isn’t his style. One particular change is how much screen time is handed over to Charlize Theron, so much so that it’s hard to see her as a supporting cast member; along with the rest of the re-invention, women holding their own instead of allowing themselves to be merely a commodity is central to the plot. Feminist? Absolutely. Detrimental to the film? Not in the slightest.

Story be damned, the real attraction for Mad Max has always been the vehicles. One way or another, each of the previous films has involved or ended with a desert chase sequence with some of the craziest motorized contraptions imaginable. Fury Road is different only that they’ve figured out a way to make almost the entire film one extended chase sequence, and it’s epic as well as insane. Need a soundtrack? How about a mobile drum corps with a flame-throwing electric guitar player wire-fu-ed up to a front-mounted wall of speakers? In a world where mass manufacturing is dead and every bit of junk can be repurposed, it’s a movie of heavy metal imagination and bone-grinding engineering. Motorheads rejoice! The thing that makes a movie like this stand out is the sheer will of so many characters, whether fighting to get back what they see as their personal property or just surviving to see another day. These bad guys don’t think what they’re doing is bad any more than the need of the heroes to escape. In addition, everyone manages to find unique ways to use anything they can to keep going, from one character charging in alone to save others to another blocking a shot with their own body because they know how valuable they are. These tiny character moments happen all through the vehicular carnage with very little down time, revealing character strengths and motivations while taking no time away from the danger; that’s a heck of a balancing act for any director to pull off effectively, and George Miller more than proves himself up to the task. Possible prequels? Yes, please! It has to be a man’s world in this kind of a movie, huh? Even though the guy who made it AND the original is the same person who made the decision to present the genre HE created in this way? It’s okay, Luke JohnWalker; just show us on your Uncle Owen doll where Aunt Beru hurt you.",POSITIVE

Now the box-office results are in, and it’s plain that only a minority of us had been impatient for kinesthetic delights to hurtle into the frame from every side and at all times, never as you’d expect, while dystopian horrors blast back out of the screen with an equally endless inventiveness, here clanking with a grotesquerie of jerry-rigged chains and motors, there roaring with the excess of a rock musician shooting flames from his guitar, as Tom Hardy in an iron mask is raised up on an armored dune buggy like a hood-ornament crucifix and a crew-cut Charlize Theron commands the churning desert with her cold blue gaze, glinting under a coat of crankcase grease, all so the film can incite women everywhere to rise up with her, our one-armed Imperator Furiosa, and overthrow war-loving, Earth-devouring, mechanistic patriarchy. 




Other people wanted to see Pitch Perfect 2.
Without prejudice to that jaunty a cappella comedy, I will say that its commercial triumph over Mad Max: Fury Road shows that I’ve fallen onto the dark side of a generational divide. It’s not just that the plurality of the theatergoing audience cannot recall the glories of George Miller’s original Mad Max trilogy, the most recent of which was released 30 years ago. Research (meaning chats with my daughter and a random sample of her friends) demonstrates that kids today neither recognize nor desire a cinema like Miller’s, which does to the methods and imagery of pop movies what Jimi Hendrix did to the old-style electric blues, and to a similarly outrageous purpose. Despite the robust overseas ticket sales for Fury Road, the domestic appetite for this kind of filmmaking seems to have withered, leaving us with a young mainstream audience that wants to see genre conventions fulfilled, not exploded. Have I mentioned San Andreas?
No—I don’t want to talk about San Andreas. I’d rather dedicate two more paragraphs to Mad Max: Fury Road, knowing that few other films this year are likely to be as impressive. It’s like a simoom, a conquering Amazon, a burning bush. You don’t so much watch it as enter its presence—and once there, you find that it does not stoop to explain itself. After all of 30 seconds’ worth of introductory voice-over, which is not so much an exposition as a groan of despair from Max, the action starts and the guidance ends. Where do they come from, all these dead-white, half-naked, shave-skulled men? Why is it a form of blessing for them to have their mouths sprayed with aerosol paint, while their leader intones, “You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome”? How would you translate “He’s a crazy smig who eats schlanger”? What makes you think you’ve got time to ask? Unlike action directors of the plodding sort, George Miller doesn’t ask you to understand the deliriously strange world into which he throws you headlong. He just wants to change the parts you recognize.
* * *
Mad Max: Fury Road has been skewing a little old in its audience—an inevitability, when a film is R-­rated—but it’s got more rebellious energy than anything else around, even though its writer-director is a septuagenarian and its totally kick-ass heroine is played by an actress who is pushing 40, the age at which Hollywood wants to stamp Expired on a woman’s forehead. This is not to imply that Fury Road is an entry in the current cycle of geezerfests such as The Expendables and RED, which convene actors in middle age or beyond to prove that their stunt doubles can still blow things up. Miller and Theron have no time for such jokey self-congratulation. They’re too busy actually ripping up the screen.

Maybe action movies, like youth itself, are wasted on the young. I’m pretty sure movies about youth are wasted on them.
A case in point: Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a much-touted high-school drama that emerged with two awards from the 2015 Sundance Festival and is now getting the full mini-major push from Fox Searchlight. Here, too, we’re dealing with a cycle: films made from young-adult novels about finding your way in life when you’re smart, quirky, tragic, and brave—like all other high-school kids, in other words, only more so. My daughter and her friends can tell you that The Fault in Our Stars is the best movie of this type ever made, and will remain so until Paper Towns is released later this summer. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another competitor for the title. The problem is that it wasn’t really made for my daughter but for me, and I don’t like it.
Written by Jesse Andrews and based on his novel of the same title, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is narrated in flashback by a high-school senior who is pale, shaggy, gangling but otherwise nondescript (an appropriate choice by the actor, Thomas Mann, given the character’s determination never to draw attention to himself), living in an American city that seems aging and Northern but is left similarly blank (which is a less fitting decision, considering that the place is eventually revealed to be the historic and richly flavorful Pittsburgh). The Earl of the title is the narrator’s only friend (RJ Cyler), who is black. He therefore lives in the poor part of town and is more forthright and sexually advanced than the narrator and better with his fists. The dying girl, who has been diagnosed with leukemia, is a classmate named Rachel (Olivia Cooke), whose distinguishing traits (other than her disease) are an overwhelmingly yellow bedroom and Jewish birth. You may gauge the depth of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl merely by the circumstance that Rachel’s mother, Mrs. Kushner, is played by that yiddishe balabusta Molly Shannon.
What can you hold on to in this fog of halfhearted stereotypes and insubstantial settings? Only the confiding, self-deprecating tone of the narrator and the cleverness of the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. A former protégé of filmmakers including Nora Ephron, Martin Scorsese, and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Gomez-Rejon is bursting with ideas for disrupting mere realism and opening up the movie’s style. He tosses off stop-motion animations, forced perspectives, jump cuts, mobile points of view, and even a Spike Lee–style actor-on-a-dolly shot. Above all, though, he makes the most of the shared cinephilia of the narrator and Earl, who since grammar school days have directed and starred in no-budget parodies of famous films.
Here’s where Me and Earl and the Dying Girl betrays its intention to address me and not my daughter. The films that Earl and the narrator have goofily remade include Breathless; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; The Seventh Seal; Midnight Cowboy; and Apocalypse Now. (What, no Andrei Rublev?) Let me stipulate that there really are high-school kids, rare ones, who know and love these pictures. That reality is irrelevant to a movie that skirts realism for the sake of showing off its director’s skills, while persistently flattering viewers (older ones, mostly) on their knowledge of film history.
It’s possible, I suppose, that ­moviegoers of the characters’ age will recognize themselves in this story and flock to see it. To them, the film parodies might be just a pleasant but cute blur in the background, while older viewers (of the sort who have been promoting the picture) will take them as proof that we have an innovative new talent in Gomez-Rejon. But talent, in this case, is little more than a disguise for a story that is too true to its title. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not about Earl (who is never more than a sidekick) or the girl (who is a plot contrivance, and sometimes seems to know it) but only about “me,” the narrator. The film’s long season of melodrama and cinematic trickery has been organized for his benefit alone, so he can abandon his self-doubt and know at the end that he’s lovable, caring, and (as he’d always suspected) a little better than most people.
Perhaps Me and Earl and the Dying Girl will elicit some rueful understanding for the pain and folly of youth. Its deeper sympathies, though, lie with older viewers, the ones who may watch it in self-approval and say, “I turned out all right, didn’t I? Just like that kid.”
I suggest that for the sequel, Gomez-Rejon and his narrator do a funny remake of Ivan’s Childhood.
* * *
Another film about movie-obsessed youth, and another Sundance winner, Crystal Moselle’s documentary The Wolfpack is a simultaneously fascinating and frustrating profile of the Angulo family: seven children brought up in a public-housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side by a Midwestern mother and a Peruvian father. The latter, animated by a mixture of homemade Hinduism, thwarted artistic ambition, political disaffection, and shock at the grunginess of New York City, gave the children the names of Indian gods, decreed that their hair would never be cut, insisted that they be homeschooled by the mother (for which the state paid her), and kept all seven kids locked in the family’s crumbling apartment. According to one son’s testimony, the siblings would venture outside only at long intervals, under chaperone. “One particular year, we never got out at all.”
But as much as the father disapproved of New York, he loved American movies and had the children watch them day and night. Here is Moselle’s irresistible hook for The Wolfpack. Not only did the children know about the world mostly through movies, but they began to videotape their own versions of films, using painstakingly copied scripts, scavenged costumes, and props and sets constructed from the stuff at hand: cereal boxes, gaffer’s tape, yoga mats. It was a way to give themselves a life—and it gives The Wolfpack life, too, from the moment you see Mu­kunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, and their siblings re-­create Reservoir Dogs within a cramped hallway and a piss-colored bedroom.
Will these people, too, be able to look back someday and say, “I turned out all right”? It’s possible to give a tentative yes to the question. At a certain point, when they were in their teens, the boys began to defy their father and go outside, which led to police intervention and then a paternal abdication. Judging by the interviews, which Moselle conducted after the liberation, the brothers have become remarkably articulate, poised, and engaging young men, who are well in touch with their pain and anger. Still, it’s as hard to predict a future for the Angulos as it is to make heads or tails of Moselle’s film.
The Wolfpack will be instructive for anyone who thinks Grey Gardens was easy to make. It’s clear that the access Moselle gained to the Angulos was intimate but intermittent, and she couldn’t figure out how to work around the holes in her material. The chronology is fuzzy, when not baffling; brothers slip in and out (sometimes it seems as if there are five, then six); a sister is introduced and then overlooked; and with the parents, Moselle never establishes a consistent distance, seeming to function variously as confidante, field researcher, and accuser.
To Moselle’s credit, she avoids turning The Wolfpack into a freak show (just barely). And yet, as you sit there gaping, you long for more insight, about the people you’re watching but also about how Moselle made this film.
So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.
As for Pohlad’s Love & Mercy—a period drama, redemption narrative, and authorized biography—it tells a story about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson in two different decades, as played by two actors. The Wilson of the mid-1960s, shown at his moment of triumph and crack-up with Pet Sounds and “Good Vibrations,” is brilliantly embodied by Paul Dano, who looks uncannily like Wilson, sings a bit like him too (no small feat), and puts his fingers on the right keys when playing the piano. The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.
 Other people wanted to see Pitch Perfect 2.
Without prejudice to that jaunty a cappella comedy, I will say that its commercial triumph over Mad Max: Fury Road shows that I’ve fallen onto the dark side of a generational divide. It’s not just that the plurality of the theatergoing audience cannot recall the glories of George Miller’s original Mad Max trilogy, the most recent of which was released 30 years ago.

Maybe action movies, like youth itself, are wasted on the young. I’m pretty sure movies about youth are wasted on them.
A case in point: Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a much-touted high-school drama that emerged with two awards from the 2015 Sundance Festival and is now getting the full mini-major push from Fox Searchlight. Here, too, we’re dealing with a cycle: films made from young-adult novels about finding your way in life when you’re smart, quirky, tragic, and brave—like all other high-school kids, in other words, only more so. My daughter and her friends can tell you that The Fault in Our Stars is the best movie of this type ever made, and will remain so until Paper Towns is released later this summer. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another competitor for the title. The problem is that it wasn’t really made for my daughter but for me, and I don’t like it.
Written by Jesse Andrews and based on his novel of the same title, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is narrated in flashback by a high-school senior who is pale, shaggy, gangling but otherwise nondescript (an appropriate choice by the actor, Thomas Mann, given the character’s determination never to draw attention to himself), living in an American city that seems aging and Northern but is left similarly blank (which is a less fitting decision, considering that the place is eventually revealed to be the historic and richly flavorful Pittsburgh). The Earl of the title is the narrator’s only friend (RJ Cyler), who is black. He therefore lives in the poor part of town and is more forthright and sexually advanced than the narrator and better with his fists. The dying girl, who has been diagnosed with leukemia, is a classmate named Rachel (Olivia Cooke), whose distinguishing traits (other than her disease) are an overwhelmingly yellow bedroom and Jewish birth. You may gauge the depth of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl merely by the circumstance that Rachel’s mother, Mrs. Kushner, is played by that yiddishe balabusta Molly Shannon.
What can you hold on to in this fog of halfhearted stereotypes and insubstantial settings? Only the confiding, self-deprecating tone of the narrator and the cleverness of the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. A former protégé of filmmakers including Nora Ephron, Martin Scorsese, and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Gomez-Rejon is bursting with ideas for disrupting mere realism and opening up the movie’s style. He tosses off stop-motion animations, forced perspectives, jump cuts, mobile points of view, and even a Spike Lee–style actor-on-a-dolly shot. Above all, though, he makes the most of the shared cinephilia of the narrator and Earl, who since grammar school days have directed and starred in no-budget parodies of famous films.
Here’s where Me and Earl and the Dying Girl betrays its intention to address me and not my daughter. The films that Earl and the narrator have goofily remade include Breathless; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; The Seventh Seal; Midnight Cowboy; and Apocalypse Now. (What, no Andrei Rublev?) Let me stipulate that there really are high-school kids, rare ones, who know and love these pictures. That reality is irrelevant to a movie that skirts realism for the sake of showing off its director’s skills, while persistently flattering viewers (older ones, mostly) on their knowledge of film history.
It’s possible, I suppose, that ­moviegoers of the characters’ age will recognize themselves in this story and flock to see it. To them, the film parodies might be just a pleasant but cute blur in the background, while older viewers (of the sort who have been promoting the picture) will take them as proof that we have an innovative new talent in Gomez-Rejon. But talent, in this case, is little more than a disguise for a story that is too true to its title. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not about Earl (who is never more than a sidekick) or the girl (who is a plot contrivance, and sometimes seems to know it) but only about “me,” the narrator. The film’s long season of melodrama and cinematic trickery has been organized for his benefit alone, so he can abandon his self-doubt and know at the end that he’s lovable, caring, and (as he’d always suspected) a little better than most people.
Perhaps Me and Earl and the Dying Girl will elicit some rueful understanding for the pain and folly of youth. Its deeper sympathies, though, lie with older viewers, the ones who may watch it in self-approval and say, “I turned out all right, didn’t I? Just like that kid.”
I suggest that for the sequel, Gomez-Rejon and his narrator do a funny remake of Ivan’s Childhood.
* * *
Another film about movie-obsessed youth, and another Sundance winner, Crystal Moselle’s documentary The Wolfpack is a simultaneously fascinating and frustrating profile of the Angulo family: seven children brought up in a public-housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side by a Midwestern mother and a Peruvian father. The latter, animated by a mixture of homemade Hinduism, thwarted artistic ambition, political disaffection, and shock at the grunginess of New York City, gave the children the names of Indian gods, decreed that their hair would never be cut, insisted that they be homeschooled by the mother (for which the state paid her), and kept all seven kids locked in the family’s crumbling apartment. According to one son’s testimony, the siblings would venture outside only at long intervals, under chaperone. “One particular year, we never got out at all.”
But as much as the father disapproved of New York, he loved American movies and had the children watch them day and night. Here is Moselle’s irresistible hook for The Wolfpack. Not only did the children know about the world mostly through movies, but they began to videotape their own versions of films, using painstakingly copied scripts, scavenged costumes, and props and sets constructed from the stuff at hand: cereal boxes, gaffer’s tape, yoga mats. It was a way to give themselves a life—and it gives The Wolfpack life, too, from the moment you see Mu­kunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, and their siblings re-­create Reservoir Dogs within a cramped hallway and a piss-colored bedroom.
Will these people, too, be able to look back someday and say, “I turned out all right”? It’s possible to give a tentative yes to the question. At a certain point, when they were in their teens, the boys began to defy their father and go outside, which led to police intervention and then a paternal abdication. Judging by the interviews, which Moselle conducted after the liberation, the brothers have become remarkably articulate, poised, and engaging young men, who are well in touch with their pain and anger. Still, it’s as hard to predict a future for the Angulos as it is to make heads or tails of Moselle’s film.
The Wolfpack will be instructive for anyone who thinks Grey Gardens was easy to make. It’s clear that the access Moselle gained to the Angulos was intimate but intermittent, and she couldn’t figure out how to work around the holes in her material. The chronology is fuzzy, when not baffling; brothers slip in and out (sometimes it seems as if there are five, then six); a sister is introduced and then overlooked; and with the parents, Moselle never establishes a consistent distance, seeming to function variously as confidante, field researcher, and accuser.
To Moselle’s credit, she avoids turning The Wolfpack into a freak show (just barely). And yet, as you sit there gaping, you long for more insight, about the people you’re watching but also about how Moselle made this film.
So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.
As for Pohlad’s Love & Mercy—a period drama, redemption narrative, and authorized biography—it tells a story about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson in two different decades, as played by two actors. The Wilson of the mid-1960s, shown at his moment of triumph and crack-up with Pet Sounds and “Good Vibrations,” is brilliantly embodied by Paul Dano, who looks uncannily like Wilson, sings a bit like him too (no small feat), and puts his fingers on the right keys when playing the piano. The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.
 No—I don’t want to talk about San Andreas. I’d rather dedicate two more paragraphs to Mad Max: Fury Road, knowing that few other films this year are likely to be as impressive. It’s like a simoom, a conquering Amazon, a burning bush. You don’t so much watch it as enter its presence—and once there, you find that it does not stoop to explain itself. After all of 30 seconds’ worth of introductory voice-over, which is not so much an exposition as a groan of despair from Max, the action starts and the guidance ends. Where do they come from, all these dead-white, half-naked, shave-skulled men? Why is it a form of blessing for them to have their mouths sprayed with aerosol paint, while their leader intones, “You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome”? How would you translate “He’s a crazy smig who eats schlanger”? What makes you think you’ve got time to ask? Unlike action directors of the plodding sort, George Miller doesn’t ask you to understand the deliriously strange world into which he throws you headlong. He just wants to change the parts you recognize.
* * *
Mad Max: Fury Road has been skewing a little old in its audience—an inevitability, when a film is R-­rated—but it’s got more rebellious energy than anything else around, even though its writer-director is a septuagenarian and its totally kick-ass heroine is played by an actress who is pushing 40, the age at which Hollywood wants to stamp Expired on a woman’s forehead. This is not to imply that Fury Road is an entry in the current cycle of geezerfests such as The Expendables and RED, which convene actors in middle age or beyond to prove that their stunt doubles can still blow things up. Miller and Theron have no time for such jokey self-congratulation. They’re too busy actually ripping up the screen.

Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.
As for Pohlad’s Love & Mercy—a period drama, redemption narrative, and authorized biography—it tells a story about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson in two different decades, as played by two actors. The Wilson of the mid-1960s, shown at his moment of triumph and crack-up with Pet Sounds and “Good Vibrations,” is brilliantly embodied by Paul Dano, who looks uncannily like Wilson, sings a bit like him too (no small feat), and puts his fingers on the right keys when playing the piano. The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.
 Mad Max: Fury Road has been skewing a little old in its audience—an inevitability, when a film is R-­rated—but it’s got more rebellious energy than anything else around, even though its writer-director is a septuagenarian and its totally kick-ass heroine is played by an actress who is pushing 40, the age at which Hollywood wants to stamp Expired on a woman’s forehead. This is not to imply that Fury Road is an entry in the current cycle of geezerfests such as The Expendables and RED, which convene actors in middle age or beyond to prove that their stunt doubles can still blow things up. Miller and Theron have no time for such jokey self-congratulation. They’re too busy actually ripping up the screen.

Maybe action movies, like youth itself, are wasted on the young. I’m pretty sure movies about youth are wasted on them.
A case in point: Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a much-touted high-school drama that emerged with two awards from the 2015 Sundance Festival and is now getting the full mini-major push from Fox Searchlight. Here, too, we’re dealing with a cycle: films made from young-adult novels about finding your way in life when you’re smart, quirky, tragic, and brave—like all other high-school kids, in other words, only more so. My daughter and her friends can tell you that The Fault in Our Stars is the best movie of this type ever made, and will remain so until Paper Towns is released later this summer. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another competitor for the title. The problem is that it wasn’t really made for my daughter but for me, and I don’t like it.
Written by Jesse Andrews and based on his novel of the same title, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is narrated in flashback by a high-school senior who is pale, shaggy, gangling but otherwise nondescript (an appropriate choice by the actor, Thomas Mann, given the character’s determination never to draw attention to himself), living in an American city that seems aging and Northern but is left similarly blank (which is a less fitting decision, considering that the place is eventually revealed to be the historic and richly flavorful Pittsburgh). The Earl of the title is the narrator’s only friend (RJ Cyler), who is black. He therefore lives in the poor part of town and is more forthright and sexually advanced than the narrator and better with his fists. The dying girl, who has been diagnosed with leukemia, is a classmate named Rachel (Olivia Cooke), whose distinguishing traits (other than her disease) are an overwhelmingly yellow bedroom and Jewish birth. You may gauge the depth of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl merely by the circumstance that Rachel’s mother, Mrs. Kushner, is played by that yiddishe balabusta Molly Shannon.
What can you hold on to in this fog of halfhearted stereotypes and insubstantial settings? Only the confiding, self-deprecating tone of the narrator and the cleverness of the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. A former protégé of filmmakers including Nora Ephron, Martin Scorsese, and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Gomez-Rejon is bursting with ideas for disrupting mere realism and opening up the movie’s style. He tosses off stop-motion animations, forced perspectives, jump cuts, mobile points of view, and even a Spike Lee–style actor-on-a-dolly shot. Above all, though, he makes the most of the shared cinephilia of the narrator and Earl, who since grammar school days have directed and starred in no-budget parodies of famous films.
Here’s where Me and Earl and the Dying Girl betrays its intention to address me and not my daughter. The films that Earl and the narrator have goofily remade include Breathless; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; The Seventh Seal; Midnight Cowboy; and Apocalypse Now. (What, no Andrei Rublev?) Let me stipulate that there really are high-school kids, rare ones, who know and love these pictures. That reality is irrelevant to a movie that skirts realism for the sake of showing off its director’s skills, while persistently flattering viewers (older ones, mostly) on their knowledge of film history.
It’s possible, I suppose, that ­moviegoers of the characters’ age will recognize themselves in this story and flock to see it. To them, the film parodies might be just a pleasant but cute blur in the background, while older viewers (of the sort who have been promoting the picture) will take them as proof that we have an innovative new talent in Gomez-Rejon. But talent, in this case, is little more than a disguise for a story that is too true to its title. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not about Earl (who is never more than a sidekick) or the girl (who is a plot contrivance, and sometimes seems to know it) but only about “me,” the narrator. The film’s long season of melodrama and cinematic trickery has been organized for his benefit alone, so he can abandon his self-doubt and know at the end that he’s lovable, caring, and (as he’d always suspected) a little better than most people.
Perhaps Me and Earl and the Dying Girl will elicit some rueful understanding for the pain and folly of youth. Its deeper sympathies, though, lie with older viewers, the ones who may watch it in self-approval and say, “I turned out all right, didn’t I? Just like that kid.”
I suggest that for the sequel, Gomez-Rejon and his narrator do a funny remake of Ivan’s Childhood.

Another film about movie-obsessed youth, and another Sundance winner, Crystal Moselle’s documentary The Wolfpack is a simultaneously fascinating and frustrating profile of the Angulo family: seven children brought up in a public-housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side by a Midwestern mother and a Peruvian father. The latter, animated by a mixture of homemade Hinduism, thwarted artistic ambition, political disaffection, and shock at the grunginess of New York City, gave the children the names of Indian gods, decreed that their hair would never be cut, insisted that they be homeschooled by the mother (for which the state paid her), and kept all seven kids locked in the family’s crumbling apartment. According to one son’s testimony, the siblings would venture outside only at long intervals, under chaperone. “One particular year, we never got out at all.”
But as much as the father disapproved of New York, he loved American movies and had the children watch them day and night. Here is Moselle’s irresistible hook for The Wolfpack. Not only did the children know about the world mostly through movies, but they began to videotape their own versions of films, using painstakingly copied scripts, scavenged costumes, and props and sets constructed from the stuff at hand: cereal boxes, gaffer’s tape, yoga mats. It was a way to give themselves a life—and it gives The Wolfpack life, too, from the moment you see Mu­kunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, and their siblings re-­create Reservoir Dogs within a cramped hallway and a piss-colored bedroom.
Will these people, too, be able to look back someday and say, “I turned out all right”? It’s possible to give a tentative yes to the question. At a certain point, when they were in their teens, the boys began to defy their father and go outside, which led to police intervention and then a paternal abdication. Judging by the interviews, which Moselle conducted after the liberation, the brothers have become remarkably articulate, poised, and engaging young men, who are well in touch with their pain and anger. Still, it’s as hard to predict a future for the Angulos as it is to make heads or tails of Moselle’s film.
The Wolfpack will be instructive for anyone who thinks Grey Gardens was easy to make. It’s clear that the access Moselle gained to the Angulos was intimate but intermittent, and she couldn’t figure out how to work around the holes in her material. The chronology is fuzzy, when not baffling; brothers slip in and out (sometimes it seems as if there are five, then six); a sister is introduced and then overlooked; and with the parents, Moselle never establishes a consistent distance, seeming to function variously as confidante, field researcher, and accuser.
To Moselle’s credit, she avoids turning The Wolfpack into a freak show (just barely). And yet, as you sit there gaping, you long for more insight, about the people you’re watching but also about how Moselle made this film.
So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.

 Written by Jesse Andrews and based on his novel of the same title, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is narrated in flashback by a high-school senior who is pale, shaggy, gangling but otherwise nondescript (an appropriate choice by the actor, Thomas Mann, given the character’s determination never to draw attention to himself), living in an American city that seems aging and Northern but is left similarly blank (which is a less fitting decision, considering that the place is eventually revealed to be the historic and richly flavorful Pittsburgh). The Earl of the title is the narrator’s only friend (RJ Cyler), who is black. He therefore lives in the poor part of town and is more forthright and sexually advanced than the narrator and better with his fists. The dying girl, who has been diagnosed with leukemia, is a classmate named Rachel (Olivia Cooke), whose distinguishing traits (other than her disease) are an overwhelmingly yellow bedroom and Jewish birth. You may gauge the depth of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl merely by the circumstance that Rachel’s mother, Mrs. Kushner, is played by that yiddishe balabusta Molly Shannon.
What can you hold on to in this fog of halfhearted stereotypes and insubstantial settings? Only the confiding, self-deprecating tone of the narrator and the cleverness of the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. A former protégé of filmmakers including Nora Ephron, Martin Scorsese, and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Gomez-Rejon is bursting with ideas for disrupting mere realism and opening up the movie’s style. He tosses off stop-motion animations, forced perspectives, jump cuts, mobile points of view, and even a Spike Lee–style actor-on-a-dolly shot. Above all, though, he makes the most of the shared cinephilia of the narrator and Earl, who since grammar school days have directed and starred in no-budget parodies of famous films.
Here’s where Me and Earl and the Dying Girl betrays its intention to address me and not my daughter. The films that Earl and the narrator have goofily remade include Breathless; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; The Seventh Seal; Midnight Cowboy; and Apocalypse Now. (What, no Andrei Rublev?) Let me stipulate that there really are high-school kids, rare ones, who know and love these pictures. That reality is irrelevant to a movie that skirts realism for the sake of showing off its director’s skills, while persistently flattering viewers (older ones, mostly) on their knowledge of film history.
It’s possible, I suppose, that ­moviegoers of the characters’ age will recognize themselves in this story and flock to see it. To them, the film parodies might be just a pleasant but cute blur in the background, while older viewers (of the sort who have been promoting the picture) will take them as proof that we have an innovative new talent in Gomez-Rejon. But talent, in this case, is little more than a disguise for a story that is too true to its title. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not about Earl (who is never more than a sidekick) or the girl (who is a plot contrivance, and sometimes seems to know it) but only about “me,” the narrator. The film’s long season of melodrama and cinematic trickery has been organized for his benefit alone, so he can abandon his self-doubt and know at the end that he’s lovable, caring, and (as he’d always suspected) a little better than most people.
Perhaps Me and Earl and the Dying Girl will elicit some rueful understanding for the pain and folly of youth. Its deeper sympathies, though, lie with older viewers, the ones who may watch it in self-approval and say, “I turned out all right, didn’t I? Just like that kid.”
I suggest that for the sequel, Gomez-Rejon and his narrator do a funny remake of Ivan’s Childhood.

Another film about movie-obsessed youth, and another Sundance winner, Crystal Moselle’s documentary The Wolfpack is a simultaneously fascinating and frustrating profile of the Angulo family: seven children brought up in a public-housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side by a Midwestern mother and a Peruvian father. The latter, animated by a mixture of homemade Hinduism, thwarted artistic ambition, political disaffection, and shock at the grunginess of New York City, gave the children the names of Indian gods, decreed that their hair would never be cut, insisted that they be homeschooled by the mother (for which the state paid her), and kept all seven kids locked in the family’s crumbling apartment. According to one son’s testimony, the siblings would venture outside only at long intervals, under chaperone. “One particular year, we never got out at all.”
But as much as the father disapproved of New York, he loved American movies and had the children watch them day and night. Here is Moselle’s irresistible hook for The Wolfpack. Not only did the children know about the world mostly through movies, but they began to videotape their own versions of films, using painstakingly copied scripts, scavenged costumes, and props and sets constructed from the stuff at hand: cereal boxes, gaffer’s tape, yoga mats. It was a way to give themselves a life—and it gives The Wolfpack life, too, from the moment you see Mu­kunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, and their siblings re-­create Reservoir Dogs within a cramped hallway and a piss-colored bedroom.
Will these people, too, be able to look back someday and say, “I turned out all right”? It’s possible to give a tentative yes to the question. At a certain point, when they were in their teens, the boys began to defy their father and go outside, which led to police intervention and then a paternal abdication. Judging by the interviews, which Moselle conducted after the liberation, the brothers have become remarkably articulate, poised, and engaging young men, who are well in touch with their pain and anger. Still, it’s as hard to predict a future for the Angulos as it is to make heads or tails of Moselle’s film.
The Wolfpack will be instructive for anyone who thinks Grey Gardens was easy to make. It’s clear that the access Moselle gained to the Angulos was intimate but intermittent, and she couldn’t figure out how to work around the holes in her material. The chronology is fuzzy, when not baffling; brothers slip in and out (sometimes it seems as if there are five, then six); a sister is introduced and then overlooked; and with the parents, Moselle never establishes a consistent distance, seeming to function variously as confidante, field researcher, and accuser.
To Moselle’s credit, she avoids turning The Wolfpack into a freak show (just barely). And yet, as you sit there gaping, you long for more insight, about the people you’re watching but also about how Moselle made this film.
So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.
As for Pohlad’s Love & Mercy—a period drama, redemption narrative, and authorized biography—it tells a story about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson in two different decades, as played by two actors. The Wilson of the mid-1960s, shown at his moment of triumph and crack-up with Pet Sounds and “Good Vibrations,” is brilliantly embodied by Paul Dano, who looks uncannily like Wilson, sings a bit like him too (no small feat), and puts his fingers on the right keys when playing the piano. The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.

It’s clear that the access Moselle gained to the Angulos was intimate but intermittent, and she couldn’t figure out how to work around the holes in her material. The chronology is fuzzy, when not baffling; brothers slip in and out (sometimes it seems as if there are five, then six); a sister is introduced and then overlooked; and with the parents, Moselle never establishes a consistent distance, seeming to function variously as confidante, field researcher, and accuser.
To Moselle’s credit, she avoids turning The Wolfpack into a freak show (just barely). And yet, as you sit there gaping, you long for more insight, about the people you’re watching but also about how Moselle made this film.
So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.
As for Pohlad’s Love & Mercy—a period drama, redemption narrative, and authorized biography—it tells a story about the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson in two different decades, as played by two actors. The Wilson of the mid-1960s, shown at his moment of triumph and crack-up with Pet Sounds and “Good Vibrations,” is brilliantly embodied by Paul Dano, who looks uncannily like Wilson, sings a bit like him too (no small feat), and puts his fingers on the right keys when playing the piano. The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.
 I suggest that for the sequel, Gomez-Rejon and his narrator do a funny remake of Ivan’s Childhood.

Another film about movie-obsessed youth, and another Sundance winner, Crystal Moselle’s documentary The Wolfpack is a simultaneously fascinating and frustrating profile of the Angulo family: seven children brought up in a public-housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side by a Midwestern mother and a Peruvian father. The latter, animated by a mixture of homemade Hinduism, thwarted artistic ambition, political disaffection, and shock at the grunginess of New York City, gave the children the names of Indian gods, decreed that their hair would never be cut, insisted that they be homeschooled by the mother (for which the state paid her), and kept all seven kids locked in the family’s crumbling apartment. According to one son’s testimony, the siblings would venture outside only at long intervals, under chaperone. “One particular year, we never got out at all.”
But as much as the father disapproved of New York, he loved American movies and had the children watch them day and night. Here is Moselle’s irresistible hook for The Wolfpack. Not only did the children know about the world mostly through movies, but they began to videotape their own versions of films, using painstakingly copied scripts, scavenged costumes, and props and sets constructed from the stuff at hand: cereal boxes, gaffer’s tape, yoga mats. It was a way to give themselves a life—and it gives The Wolfpack life, too, from the moment you see Mu­kunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, and their siblings re-­create Reservoir Dogs within a cramped hallway and a piss-colored bedroom.
Will these people, too, be able to look back someday and say, “I turned out all right”? It’s possible to give a tentative yes to the question. At a certain point, when they were in their teens, the boys began to defy their father and go outside, which led to police intervention and then a paternal abdication. Judging by the interviews, which Moselle conducted after the liberation, the brothers have become remarkably articulate, poised, and engaging young men, who are well in touch with their pain and anger. Still, it’s as hard to predict a future for the Angulos as it is to make heads or tails of Moselle’s film.

The Wilson of the 1980s—a shambling figure, more or less a captive of his psychotherapist—is played by John Cusack with a repertoire of touching but familiar Rain Man tics and postures. The primary focus in the 1980s narrative, though, is on Melinda Ledbetter (the excellent Elizabeth Banks), a Los Angeles Cadillac dealer who met Wilson by chance, cut him loose from his therapist, and eventually married him.
The trick of Love & Mercy, a good one, is to show the two time periods together, rather than in sequence. The screenplay, by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, does not take full advantage of the contrapuntal structure, sometimes falling into standard biopic garrulousness. (I suspect there was a split vision in the writing, too, which wasn’t fully resolved.) But when the film works, which is often, its older Wilson makes you shudder for what’s happening to his younger self, while the younger one keeps you aware of the world of wonders locked inside his older self’s drooping head.
 So let’s turn from movies that look at young people with a mixture of supposed immediacy and cinephilic obsession. It’s time to recommend two pictures that take the older-but-wiser view: Bill Pohlad’s Love & Mercy and Mia Hansen-Løve’s Eden.
Eden is the second film (after Goodbye First Love) in which Hansen-Løve has followed a character from adolescence to adulthood, tracing the course of artistic aspirations, romantic entanglements, familial tensions, and the struggle to pay the rent. This time the protagonist is a young man named Paul (Félix de Givry), the art form is DJ’ing (with an emphasis on the French style of garage), and the enemy is time itself. Paul simply doesn’t want to grow up, even when tastes change in electronic dance music, his debts pile up, the lining of his nose burns out, and an ex-girlfriend leaves him for the second time. Hansen-Løve watches it all dispassionately and not without judgment, from 1992 until almost the present, but at the same time gives Paul his due. No wonder he wants the rave never to end. It feels as if half of this long film comprises extended shots of crowds immersed in colored lights and thrumming music, where time doesn’t exist.

"Jun 18, 2015"," An even madder Maxine lends a human touch to the diesel-punk demolition derby Mad Max: Fury Road. Not too much, since the only thing slow about George Miller's road rager is how long it took to make another sequel. Thirty years beyond Thunderdome and Tina Turner, Max Rockatansky takes a back seat to another post-apocalyptic feminist, aptly named Furiosa and dynamically role-modeled by Charlize Theron. Glowering through axle grease mascara, Furiosa misses an arm but nothing else happening around her. Theron plays it serious as a buzz cut, plowing a booby-trapped big rig through human gargoyles chasing her cargo of supermodel breeding wives rescued from Immortan Joe, waterlord of this scorched region. They seek safety in the Green Place, an oasis where Furiosa grew up. That's the plot, if you need one. Sometimes it feels like Max is just along for the ride, through no fault of Tom Hardy in full effect brood, taking over the role that made Mel Gibson famous. Hardy spends much of the first act as an upside down blood donor for Joe's minions, and a hood ornament during the first vehicular onslaught, which practically exhausts viewers before any story can begin. Mad Max: Fury Road is a relentless marvel of sense-pummeling stunts and gargoyle horror that needs to take a breather once in a while. It's a relief of sorts when Max and Furiosa meet, each suspicious and seeking an edge for survival. Their posturing is the closest to a relationship that Miller foresees in this landscape; part of his film's bleakness is that there isn't more. Well, that and John Seale's battalion of cameras catching every flipping, exploding and sailing truck, motorcycle or corpse in rusty, dusty hues. Ugly on purpose gets old without more places and situations to use it than Miller offers. Sameness is compounded by Jason Ballentine and Margaret Sixel editing as if they're being paid by the splice. Fury Road is admirably deranged in places, like Nicholas Hoult's Nux, a hollow-eyed Joe disciple switching sides, who prefers spray-painting his lips over huffing. Or the bearded man-baby keeping watch over Joe's fortress. Nobody carpools unless you count tailgunners. Everyone drives mutant-weld trucks, tricked-out with porcupine fenders or percussion drums. One carries the soundtrack guitarist and his flame-spewing axe. Or my favorite insanity in this ultimately exhausting sequel: Backseat war boys on swaying tall poles, flinging Molotov spears and snatching hostages from speeding vehicles.

"Jun 17, 2015"," By all accounts, “Fury Road” should not have been so good. The George Miller epic return to “Mad Max” is a film that snuck under the radar of many movie fans and comes in through the dusk to grab us by the throats once more. When it comes to post apocalyptic cinema, Mad Max is the crème de la crème of the sub-genre, and George Miller is bold enough to re-visit a universe that paved its way through cinema over thirty years ago. With “Fury Road,” George Miller doesn’t try to change the formula of his trilogy too much, opting for the same visceral post apocalyptic action epic that made Mel Gibson Mad Max. Yet he also strives for a visual stimulation that ushers in a new era that puts Tom Hardy in the seat of Mad Max. There’s no real change this time around with Max. He’s still Mad Max, a feral and tortured road warrior who is haunted by the deaths of the people he once knew. He’s captured by the Citadel, a powerful empire that runs the world and controls the planet’s dwindling water supply. Forced to be a breeder, he finds himself in the middle of a war when female warrior Imperator Furiosa attempts to break out a group of women forced in to servitude. What “Mad Max” doles out is another hefty installment of our favorite road warrior while also introducing a slew of fascinating and complex characters, all of whom are strong, female, and keep Max from dying a hundred times over. Max is merely the spectator of the story, sometimes playing party to the events that unfold, and accidentally becoming the aide to savior Imperator Furiosa when he decides to break free from his binds that make him a prize captive for the evil Immortan Joe. The world is a wasteland, and yet the vast scopes of sand and dunes make “Fury Road” one hell of a visual spectacle. Through such a simplistic landscape, director Miller is able to concoct a dangerous and harrowing world where only the strong survive, and the savage thrive. “Mad Max” is one giant car chase through the desert where Furiosa has to evade the forces of Immortan Joe while keeping a steady pace through many villages that have a bounty on her head for betraying her master. This puts her and her band of women through the wringer, battling hordes of motorcycle riding, and truck operating maniacs that seek to bring down her operation and bring back the women that belong to Immortan. Through this Miller stages some amazing stunts and fantastic battles that make Max and unwilling contributor to Furiosa’s cause, and then gradually someone who feels compelled to help her when he realizes saving his own hide just isn’t enough to ease the torment of the past. Hardy is a wonderful replacement for Mel Gibson as Mad Max, possessing the same mental ticks that make the character so dazzling. Hardy wears the skin of the character without a hitch, and picks up the series with pathos, complexity, and a new kind of humanity that make Mad Max an every man who knows how to survive this harsh desolate world. Charlize Theron is incredible as Furiosa a roughneck warrior who takes it upon herself to rescue the wives of Immortan when they seek a life out from his rule. Theron’s transformation is fantastic, as she holds her own against Hardy, bringing to life this very heroic and courageous young woman. Furiosa is one of the finest and most well realized heroines of cinema in years, one of Miller’s banner protagonists who has had everything taken from her, and yet continues to fight the forces of Immortan’s Citadel. That’s only the tip of the iceberg in a slew of wonderful performances from folks like Rose Huntington Whitely, Hugh Keays-Byrne, and Nicholas Hoult who is wonderful as the Warboy Nux whose self-prophesized destiny to die is interrupted by the larger cause. “Fury Road” is one of the finest films of the year, an action packed, artistic, and emotional piece of apocalyptic cinema that I enjoyed greatly. I can’t wait to see Miller re-visit this universe again very soon.",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2015"," [This review has already been read by the Looking Closer Specialists, whose helpful responses persuaded me to see the movie a second time before publishing it. Thanks, Specialists! Read about how you can join the club that gets first-looks and access to a private Looking Closer Facebook group here.] And if you’re not excited about that then you’d better leave now, because this movie blazes and rages and thinks of rapid-fire, high-tension exchanges between key characters as the equivalent of a quiet interlude or “downtime.” Cars! Trucks! Car-trucks! Truck-cars! Truck-car-tanks! Cars that look like the porcupine cars from Peter Weir’s The Cars That Ate Paris. Give these guys a few weeks, and they’ll be riding All-Terrain Armored Transports like in The Empire Strikes Back, but when they do, the AT-ATs won’t be marching—they’ll be galloping and spewing fire! This is just like this year’s NBA finals: There are no rules, anything goes, fouls aren’t called by the refs, and things that aren’t fouls are penalized. George Miller may have taken 30 years off from what he does best (no disrespect to Babe or Babe: Pig in the City, both of which I loved for wildly different reasons) — but he gets back behind the wheel of his monster-truck imagination as if he’s done little more than dream up how to do that Mad Max thing bigger and better. Yes, here we are, back to one of the big screen’s many futures. And, as Doc Brown said in Back to the Future, “Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.” This is the future where the world’s gone to hell, and those who survived are tribes of professional sports fans who cope with the apocalypse by carrying on with what they did before — painting their faces, warring in tribes, and serving corrupt franchise owners. And, just like commercial breaks in televised pro sports, every few minutes there’s a whole lot of fuss about whose truck is the toughest and whose car performs illegal feats of speed and strength. Good news: Mad Max is back, and he’s reluctant to take on any post-apoc-messiah role this time (even if he does get strapped to a cross within the first ten minutes). He’s all business this time around. Not so good news: When when we last saw him, he was played by the 1980s icon of charismasculinity Mel Gibson. Now he’s played by Tom Cro-Magnon-Man Hardy who, having rid himself of the Bane mask that muffled his words in The Dark Knight Rises, has very little — almost nothing — to say for the entirety of this movie, perhaps for fear of having his sentences cut short by the high-speed cutting, splicing, and dicing of this film’s frantic pace. Max rarely speaks complete thoughts aloud (unless he’s giving us some voice-over). He doesn’t have time. He’s too busy suffering whiplash, concussions, dehydration, imprisonment, torture, and a punishing jailbreak (and that’s just the first five minutes of the movie). For the most part, he’s just Mumble Max — not mad, just sullen. For the rest of the movie, he looks for all the world like a man who would do anything to get into a Locke sequel instead of a Mad Max sequel, because at least in Locke he had backstory, dialogue, interesting decisions to make, and, well, roads. In the wasted kingdom where Max is locked up, the poor, the bungled, the botched, and the dehydrated citizens look like they’re as desperate for a chance to speak in complete sentences as they are for a sip of the water that their tyrannical overlord — sprays out so insufficiently, like a Californian watering his lawn under the close watch of drought-burdened neighbors. This is the driest movie ever made about the rationing of liquids: the scarcity of water (“Aqua Cola,” they call it); the ruination of the globe over oil; the sacredness of “mothers’ milk”; and the portability of blood in “bags” (that is, human captives). I kept imagining Base Commander Jack D. Ripper from Dr. Strangelove sitting beside me in the theater and nodding his approval of the film’s preoccupation with “precious bodily fluids.” The aforementioned tyrant — Immortan Joe (no, that’s not a spelling error), played by Mad Max veteran cast member Hugh Keays-Byrne — has taken lessons from several familiar villains: he’s like Darth Vader, strapping himself into a bellows-mask that amplifies his breathing; he’s like Batman’s Bane, trying to make himself intelligible through the mask as if to beat Hardy at his own game; and he’s like Baron Harkonnen of David Lynch’s Dune, being so misshapen, corpulent, and generously pimpled that he needs custom-fitted body armor. (This doesn’t stop him personally putting pedals to the metal with his own tumescent foot, leading the charge in pursuit of those who would escape the range of his voice.) Why be just a villain when you can be all the villains? Joe has built himself a slavish, brainwashed army of “Warboys”: white-fleshed boys who compete for his favor by their enthusiastic willingness to risk life and limb for him, hoping to be welcomed into some holy company in Valhalla. They’re so much fantastic fun to watch that it’s disappointing when you realize that this movie is set up to watch them outwitted and outfought. What I really want to see is this entourage running down the cast of, well, Entourage. (Hey, we wanted Alien vs. Predator and we got it, so, why not this?) And so the chase is on: This time, the evil heavy metal band of water-reservoir dogs are barking at the heels of a “War Rig”: a tanker that was supposed to go fill up with fuel at Gastown, but which has been commandeered by a Joan of Arc look-alike (but not a Joan of Arc think-alike) called Furiosa (Charlize Theron, who gets impressively furious-a and furious-a as the film goes on). She’s not interested in fuel; she’s more interested in rescuing Immortan Joe’s harem of young Maxim-covergirls. In 2015, you need to make your audiences care with a social-justice subplot, so Fury Road casts an ethnically diverse lineup straight out of Australia’s Next Top Model and goes just far enough to make the words “human trafficking” — or at least “human traffic” — flash through your head so that you can feel righteous about loving this hyperviolent free-for-all. One of them is very pregnant with a baby, or maybe a tumor, or — most useful of all — a spare tire. Most moviegoers would presume that, since this isn’t a rom-com, it would be preposterous to have her go into labor mid-chase — but what this movie presupposes is “What if it isn’t?” This is where the rest of the movie blurs in my memory — it becomes one truly spectacular chase-scene/demolition-derby after another, a circus of acrobatic stunts that would make Indiana Jones say, “I am definitely too old for this shtick.” Once we reach the Mad Matriarchs, we’ve reached Peak Meaning in Fury Road. Since it wouldn’t be any fun for them to just go on fleeing over the horizon, the movie decides to close the gap between aggressors and persecuted, and proceeds to a conclusion that wants to be seen as a hopeful triumph but leaves me thinking, “Um… wait five minutes, and I think things are going to take another nasty turn.” Sure enough, it seems there are two sequels in the works — the first of which will be called The Wasteland. So I intend to spend this summer studying up on T. S. Eliot so I’ll be ready for it. To spend much time wringing meaning out of Mad Miller: Beyond Happy Feet would be like trying to write theological poems based on the Fast and Furious series. I might read and even enjoy such poems, but they would say more about the creativity of the reviewer than the profundity of their subject. I’ve read reviews that try to make Fury Road into a philosophical treatise, and they sound like the critics’ vain attempts to justify their love of this franchise by trying to make it sound important. Fact is, there’s nothing wrong with loving spectacular big-screen choreography, stunts, motion, and momentum. Why can’t we just celebrate that? Sure, this Mad Max movie is a product of its times, and I applaud its capital-V “Values.” But working hard to make people take this story seriously robs the movie of its fun. Actually, let’s stop talking about Max. This movie belongs to Charlize Theron, and if the series were to follow her from now on, I would follow the series with more enthusiasm. In a way, I’m grateful for this movie: It packs enough implausibly spectacular high jinks into one movie to make up for a pile of tepid summer “blockbusters.” And it does so with imagination, wit, enough real-world stunts to create a powerful sense of high stakes, and performances that register with real emotion in the midst of absurdity. What’s more — it demands an enormous screen, so it’s a ringing endorsement of the theatrical experience. It’s explosive fun. It’s even more fun the second time. And I think it’ll be justly celebrated as one of the all-time great achievements in action moviemaking.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 12, 2015"," A caravan of paint-sniffing albino “war boys” with sunken eyes and scars around their lips race down a dirt road in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. Their souped-up vehicles are cobbled together in all kinds of inventive ways — some are antique car shells stacked up on each other under giant monster-truck tires; some have elaborate exhaust pipes that run the length of the cars and spit fire; other vehicles are covered in pointed sticks and spears that jut out like porcupines. This cadre of crazies from Mad Max: Fury Road has a corollary to 70-year-old director George Miller: They are driven by a singular vision and purpose. Theirs is to find and kill the rogue warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and bring back the harem she absconded with, and Miller’s is to present one nearly nonstop action scene with enough character and metaphorical connection to keep an audience engaged for two hours. The first Mad Max movie in 30 years begins, oddly enough, with narration that ends up being the largest amount of uninterrupted dialogue in the entire film. It sets up the unforgiving landscape of these movies, and establishes the loner status of Max (Tom Hardy, in a role made famous by Mel Gibson). In short order, Max is kidnapped and enslaved under the rule of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played the villain Toecutter in the 1979 original). This giant, mask-wielding freak hoards all of the water to be found in this vast desert, dispensing it to the lowly people of the Citadel only when it suits him. Once Joe and his war boys set out on Fury Road to retrieve his sex slaves from Furiosa, our title character is sidelined for a good 30 minutes or so. Strapped to the front of a car like the figurehead at the tip of a ship’s hull, Max is helpless while chaos rages around him and Miller’s penchant for crazed black comedy again rears its head. It’s a nice twist that the real hero of the movie is Theron’s Furiosa, whose shaven head and raw determination bring to mind Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley from the Alien series. Mad Max: Fury Road all takes place in a short period of time, and very little backstory is presented for the characters. But their richness is revealed in how they react under constant duress. The movie may not seem like the work of an elder statesman, but Miller’s experience means he knows how to present not only the cause-and-effect of an action scene but also develop and refine his characters during the battle. One such character is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a cancer-ridden war boy who, like the rest of the minions, will do anything to please Joe and enter Valhalla. His blind fanaticism makes him sympathetic, and serves as a subtle but potent anti-terrorism metaphor. When the five women of Joe’s harem are first glimpsed, it’s all long legs and bare midriffs — the typical hyper-sexualized image we are used to in Hollywood pictures. But that’s because the tyrannical despot is using them in that way. They become something quite different on their journey. It’s no coincidence what their escape represents, or that the women are freed by a powerful woman who rebels against the male hierarchy. Besides having some interesting thematic and plot similarities to the recent Tommy Lee Jones-Hilary Swank western The Homesman, you might even be able to say Mad Max: Fury Road is a feminist film. It certainly has connections to Miller’s criminally overlooked 1998 film Babe: Pig in the City, which also features impressive, large-scale action scenes and ingenious production design. Art director Colin Gibson worked on both films, and again creates a rich fantasy world with inspired choices in every frame. The hard-charging convoy is like a junkyard on wheels. As obtuse and fantastical as the car designs are, these are real, working vehicles careening around at high speeds on rough terrain. One mammoth vehicle actually holds a line of taiko drummers pounding out a primal beat behind a wall of amplifiers and speaker horns. To seal further comparisons to a Gwar-like aesthetic, a manic frontman attached with cables by the arms and legs plays heavy-metal electric guitar in front of them to rev up the troops. Oh, and did I mention the guitar is also a flamethrower? Ha! The scene where Max has to tangle with this guy is one of the most hilarious and thrilling in the movie. And it’s somehow convincing — the CGI is so subtle throughout Mad Max: Fury Road that it blends seamlessly with the action. Along with Gibson, stunt coordinator Guy Norris and cinematographer John Seale are the real stars of the film. Norris conducts breathless sequences where wild-eyed soldiers are launched from moving cars on towering poles that bend to and fro as they speed along. Seale pays tribute to Miller’s previous entries in the franchise with lightning-quick zooms and Sam Raimi Evil Dead-style POV shots, yet somehow still maintaining a sense of coherence. Resurrecting Mad Max in 2015 might seem like an odd choice, but Miller’s kinetic vision of post-environmental doom seems more prescient than ever. And although Gibson gave Max more of a soul than Hardy does, Miller’s storytelling strategy of standalone micro-stories means that the character could continue beyond any one actor, similar to James Bond. The focus on action and not over-explaining things also keeps the “Mad Max” universe contextually relevant. “Hope,” as Max tells Furiosa, “is a mistake.” But Mad Max: Fury Road represents a certain kind of hope that’s more than a little contagious. As technology continues to improve and digital effects persist, it’s refreshing to see an old-school master get back to basics — and use his powers for good.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2015"," In 1981, The Road Warrior became an arty, pedal-to-the-metal slice of action that caught critical eyes as a stand-out in Lincoln Center’s New Directors, New Films series. At the time, few moviegoers had seen Australian director George Miller’s original entry into the series, 1979’s Mad Max. Likewise, few knew that Road Warrior’s star, Mel Gibson, had a passion for controversy and for Christ. Miller followed Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior with 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, a bigger and more heavily promoted movie that added Tina Turner to the mix. This record suggests that Miller marches to his own drummer, which is why I’m beginning with background that usually gets buried in the depths of a review. In Mad Max, Fury Road, Miller, who’s now 70, resurrects Mad Max with British actor Thomas Hardy taking over the Gibson role and Charlize Theron adding additional marquee appeal.  Steeped in action, brutality and creative daring, Mad Max: Fury Road hardly qualifies as an actors’ movie. With her hair shorn to crew-cut length and one arm digitally omitted, Theron proves that she, too, can be an action star.  Hardy — a fine and volatile actor — spends a good deal of the movie hidden behind an iron mask that Hannibal Lector might have regarded as a fashion statement. The past — a lost family — haunts Max, but Hardy seldom loses touch with Max’s inner animal. All of Hardy’s dialogue might not fill a cocktail napkin, and Theron (really the dominant presence in the film) benefits greatly from her character’s name, Imperator Furiosa, which sounds like some forgotten and possibly disreputable Latin classic. The action set pieces in Mad Max are so kinetically charged and bizarre that I spent a good deal of time wondering how Miller had managed to pull them off. I was more interested in what Miller and his team would do next than  in the whisper of a plot that blows across the endlessly brown landscapes Miller found in Australia and in the South African desert. The movie’s most visionary achievement occurs early. Miller introduces us to The Citadel, a fortress carved into a cliff. A warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules this outpost. When he’s feeling especially good, Joe releases torrents of precious water from giant spigots, a gesture of totalitarian beneficence that’s supposed to soothe the benighted multitudes who serve him. Some of Miller’s Citadel shots made me think of what Hieronymus Bosch might have painted had he lived in the age of the graphic novel, a hellish reversion to undisguised primitivism. So here’s the story: Captured by Joe’s hordes, Max escapes, and hits the road. He eventually allies himself with Furiosa, who’s fleeing the Citadel with five of Joe’s wives, all of whom have lithe fashion-model figures. They’ve been selected to give birth to Joe’s heirs. Equally important are the costumes and vehicles. The latter seem to have been cobbled together from the spare parts of the world that preceded this post-apocalyptic chaos. These range from vehicles that look like spiky, metal porcupines to trucks from which giant poles extend, allowing combatants to tip one way or another as they attempt to smash the opposition. A movie or Cirque du Soleil? Maybe it doesn’t matter. There’s no faulting Miller’s imagination. One of Joe’s vehicles — always in hot pursuit of Furiosa, Max and the runaways — tethers a punk-rock guitarist to its hood. The rocker’s heavy-metal licks are accompanied by ejaculated bursts of flame that shoot from his guitar. That’s the kind of humor, you’ll find here, along with at least one terrifying mask. Joe, who somewhere along the line lost much of his face, wears a mask that makes the Joker’s frozen rictus look like a wan smirk.  Nicolas Hoult plays Nux, a former Joe loyalist who eventually sides with Max and the fleeing women. Nun has an endearing quality. And when Max finally reveals his name to Furiosa, the moment seems emotionally authentic in a stammering sort of way.  Such bits stand out because, as Max tells us at the outset, nothing is more important in this world than survival. Anything else should be deemed a debilitating luxury. Despite the presence of the occasional emotional oasis, Mad Max ’s throbbing, remorseless pace can cause the action to lose edge, a danger when a movie seems intent on bombarding us with epic-scaled overkill. You can get a little numb. Fury Road may no longer have the kind of surprise quotient that accompanied its predecessors, but it retains the eccentricity of Miller’s strikingly weird vision.  Whatever else you may think about Mad Max, pay attention to the word “mad” in the title. This is one demented action movie. I mean that in a good way — I think. ",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2015"," There’s a bit of a sequel here, but a bit of a new approach, too, from terrific director George Miller, who also had a hand in writing the script. He uses little dialogue to tell his science-fiction story which, despite a lack of lines from the performers, nonetheless includes depth, character development and poignancy, all while dust storms, explosions and war blast at every turn. In this future, the world has become a desert, with water the rarest substance imaginable in an environment that resembles the original “Mad Max” movies. This time Max is played by Tom Hardy (“The Drop”) as a man on his own. Max is haunted by the deaths of his family (referenced in flashbacks here but told with more detail in the first film). Max is captured by a group of warriors as a blood donor. Upon his escape, he meets Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a woman who steals the five wives of Immortan Joe, a powerful warlord (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original “Mad Max”). Eventually “warboy” Nux (Nicholas Hoult) joins them to transport the women, one of whom is pregnant, to the “green land” in the east. The environments, the vehicles and the characters in various states of masking, war paint and garb, all are eye-catching. This is what a grownups-only illustrated novel would look like if it sprang to life from its pages. Fire and dust storms continuously swirl around the characters, whose motivation is mainly to stay alive. If you see it in 3D, it’s even more glorious, because the 3D is used to enhance and not as a spectacle in itself. Hardy’s character isn’t really much of a throw from his villain in “The Dark Knight Rises” or the titular character in “Bronson.” His presence is threatening and his motivations at times are unclear. His co-star Theron is just as strong, just as desperate and just as tough in her role. We learn much more about her and her back story than we do Max’s. Both are intriguing characters that would be welcome in a sequel. There are a few scenes that allow us to catch up with the characters’ deeper identities. But most of this is a thrill ride, with a score that pounds the viewer as much as the visuals do. A kind of infantry drum corps, along with a fire-spouting guitarist, follows the warriors into battle.",POSITIVE
"Jun 9, 2015"," Starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Hugh Keays-Byrne. Screenplay by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. Directed by George Miller. As you’ve probably already heard by now, Mad Max: Fury Road is an astonishment. This is bold, go-for-broke, visionary filmmaking of such a high order that I’m not really sure where to begin. I should probably just nick my pal Bilge Ebiri’s line that it is “the Sistine Chapel of action movies” and call it an evening, but I’m too revved-up. You stumble out of the theatre giddy about what films can do, transported by the breathtaking kineticism – the simple lizard-brained joy of images in motion placed next to one another with such harebrained velocity in a battering ram of a picture that just goes, goes, goes and then keeps on going. I’m a little bit exhausted here just writing about it. And also ecstatic. If you are somehow a stranger to the previous three pictures in director George Miller’s cockamamie post-apocalyptic serial, fear not. (Except we probably can’t be friends anymore.) There’s no real continuity here for nerds to obsess upon in this series, just multiple re-workings of similar themes, with some of the same cast members turning up again in different roles like Sergio Leone westerns. Every Mad Max movie is built to stand like the protagonist: alone. Max Rockantasky (formerly Mel Gibson, now Tom Hardy) was a cop once, way back when the world made sense. Now he wanders the wastelands in his revved-up Interceptor, which is rudely flipped in a two-lane battle shortly after we find Max thoughtfully chewing on a lizard, wondering where does the time go. He’s eventually taken captive and used as “a bloodbag” in a ruined patriarchal oasis, as big bad Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the first film) hoards resources to a point where he’s siphoning the blood of hostages to keep his irradiated albino foot-soldiers alive, harvesting women’s breast-milk so he can feed his flock, and periodically showering the huddled masses with dirty water. Miller drops us into this nightmare without a word of exposition, showing and never telling a barbaric civilization that’s not worth saving. Enter Furiosa. Played by a shaven-headed and robot-armed Charlize Theron, she’s busy secretly smuggling Immortan Joe’s harem of wives outta town when she stumbles upon Max. It takes her awhile to figure out he’s down for the feminist cause. Fury Road is relentless. It’s insane. At heart this is a movie about people just trying to get from one place to another, but it becomes The Odyssey. Immortan Joe’s cabal of radiation-poisoned circus-freaks are laboring under the delusion they can go to Valhalla, spray-painting their teeth and screaming “Witness Me!” like the last gasp of suicide bombers. This is a big summer blockbuster about how men have destroyed the planet with their territorial pissings and how psychotic religious beliefs have poisoned the lives of young boys, so the only way to get sane is via this picture’s socialist army of old Lily Tomlins bearing seeds instead of guns. I still can’t believe George Miller got away with this. It’s bonkers and lefty. Totally gonzo and one of the best-directed movies I have ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Jun 9, 2015"," The fact that it’s a fuel-injected adrenaline rush as well as a thoughtful, surprisingly moving film is a combination that makes this fiery blockbuster one of the best movies of 2015. This year, cinematic brilliance has happened so far in the form of genre films, with 2015 pictures “It Follows” (horror) and “Ex Machina” (science fiction) being exceptional examples of those genres. The latest “Mad Max” film is the king of the road in the “survival in the post-apocalyptic world” genre that it defined in the 1980s when Mel Gibson was still behind the wheel. But for those who have an appreciation for big-picture filmmaking, outside-the-box thinking, crazy cars and amazing stunts — movies like this are why we go to the movies. The still-underrated Tom Hardy is brooding and brutal as Max, the strong, silent type in a broken world, and Charlize Theron is fabulously fierce as the wonderfully named Furiosa, who like Max is a rebel seeking redemption on the road. Now visualize this image: A group of women held as slaves escape their master, resulting in a start-your-engines chase involving this salvage-yard world’s fastest cobbled-together, crazy-quilt megavehicles. Imagine attacking madmen climbing giant, flexible poles planted in the rear of vehicles from which they vault from one car to another, all of which are traveling at breakneck speeds. The action is fast and furious and totally bonkers. And yet the style is totally original: Old West showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama. Seriously. Writer/director/series creator George Miller, the Australian mad genius whose franchises — the revved-up “Mad Max” movies and the little-pig “Babe” films — couldn’t be more disparate, has done it again. As a teen exiting the theater showing “The Road Warrior” in 1981, I knew I’d seen something special — a sense of action and style that filled the screen and commanded your attention. His fourth visit to this character and this world, one of existence in a post-nuclear wasteland, has never been more insane. In this place, where civilization has broken down, that makes perfect sense. Clean water is almost non-existent. What few bugs and lizards remain serve as snacks. Shelter is a luxury, and security is a thing of the past. The little piece of this world that Miller shows us is called the Citadel. Chaos reigns among a starving citizenry at the mercy of a mutated leader known as Immortan Joe, a man bathed in white paint and outfitted with protective gear and a gruesome mask/breathing apparatus. We meet Joe, his muscle-bound security team and his “War Boys,” his tumor-laden, dying soldiers who fight for him in belief that after-life glories await from their sacrifices. Their present task is sending a big rig to a place called Gastown to fill up with 3,000 gallons of that most precious commodity outside of water. But when one of Joe’s lieutenants takes the truck on a detour with precious cargo — the leader’s five wives, one of whom is pregnant — the chase is on, with war-party vehicles in pursuit. “Fury Road” is one extended chase, a high-octane race through desolate desert and narrow canyons (filming in the desert of Namibia and in Australia), and it rages to the tune of composer Junkie XL’s pounding soundtrack. He does not save them, mind you; they work as a team in an easy-to-define battle of good vs. evil at 100-plus miles per hour. Theron is tough, too, but she gives Furiosa a vulnerability that makes her a multidimensional character. Protector, savior, rebel: Theron combines all three in a memorable role. Nicholas Hoult creates the most colorful character as a painted War Boy, but also as the conscience of the film, showing that it’s still possible to learn right from wrong in this wasteland. Miller’s sense of style is as keen as his sense of history: Portraying the angry enemy Immortan Joe is Australian actor Hugh Keays-Byrne, the same actor who played Toecutter, the lead villain in the original “Mad Max” 36 years ago. Set in a pre-apocalypse world ""in a few years from now,"" at a time when ""road warrior"" cops chased dangerous ""glory riders"" down highways. Aussie native Gibson, at 23, was cool as the top cop who went ""mad"" when his wife and child are murdered by a gang. Miller's masterpiece found Max a lost man in a dystopic badlands of violence with roaming gangs and people who will do anything to obtain gasoline. This film formed the mythology of the character, and Max's cynicism added an odd humor to the action. The franchise goes Hollywood with broad humor, higher production values and Gibson going toe-to-toe with Tina Turner's queen-like leader of a desert town during a power struggle. Turner's ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" was a film-promotion hit, and Max was a hero to a tribe of lost children. Mainstream ideas cost this film some of its genre coolness, but there are some memorable scenes.",POSITIVE
"Jun 8, 2015"," I'm not sure there's a whole lot to be gained by thinking too deeply about dystopian action movies, but having seen George Miller's remarkable Mad Max: Fury Road I thought I might jot down a few notes before it slides painlessly from my mind. I am old enough to have seen the original Mad Max in theaters (Mel Gibson's lines were dubbed by an American actor) and to remember my reaction to it. It struck me as a raw and foreign thing, seedy and dangerous, like contraband. It felt like something I wasn't supposed to see, something that might cause its viewers mortal injury. If I wanted to assert my coolness, I suppose I would say I loved it. The truth is my reaction was more complicated. I was sophisticated enough to know that, no matter how crude and incoherent it seemed, Mad Max was still a movie, a kind of business venture. It was a collaborative effort; hundreds of people had bought in to a singular idea to make the thing because they thought people would find it entertaining. I understood it was all artificial, which made it all the more unnerving. It was hard for me to understand why anyone would want to make something so ugly. Yet it had an undeniable appeal. An unwholesome appeal. Despite the evident skill that went into the film, it felt like the work of amateurs, a sort of punk-rock revenge movie bashed out in a garage by gleeful idiots. I had no idea who Miller was -- I had only the vaguest idea of what a director did -- but it felt like the kind of movie anyone could make provided they were afflicted with the requisite obsessions and madness. Most Americans saw The Road Warrior -- Mad Max 2 to the rest of the world-- which came out in 1981 before they saw the original Mad Max. It had a bigger budget, and all in all is probably a better movie. It certainly looks better, and there's minimally more story and dialogue than in the famously terse original. It's also further removed from realism -- we learn at the beginning, in a voice-over from the grown-up version of the Feral Kid, that it's ""storytelling, fable, mythology."" I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about it at the time, although it received some great reviews. (Roger Ebert especially liked it.) It felt more like a movie to me, stylish and artificial. When Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome arrived in 1985, I was only marginally interested. These weren't really my kind of movies; I could take them or leave them. And so it took me a couple of weeks to get around to seeing Fury Road, and I watched primarily out of a sense of professional obligation. (Not that I didn't think I'd enjoy the movie -- I suspected I would and I did -- it's just that there are lots of ways we can spend our time, and watching other people's dreams unfold on screen is just one of them.) What's remarkable about Fury Road has a lot more to do with the architecture of the frame and Miller's delight in throwing things right at the face of the audience than any sneaky feminism. There's a kind of kinetic genius to the movie, which is essentially one long chase. As usual, Miller keeps his characters, particularly the titular Max, played by the charismatic and canny Tom Hardy, taciturn and his plot uncluttered. The feminism that some have perceived in the movie is largely supplied by grace notes -- Charlize Theron gets to be a competent warrior and, perhaps more importantly, she gets to drive, but her cargo consists of a warlord's impossibly beautiful sex slaves. Damsels get rescued, and Max eventually saves the day while staying true to the character's established persona; he remains the solitary loner impelled to drift and survive. None of that bothers me; Fury Road is a big-budget big-deal movie, and it's not going to stray too far from the template. Girls get to kick butt, and Theron's Furiosa is arguably a showier part than Hardy's Max, but the chief virtues of the movie have to do with the way it engages us on a visceral level. It's a thrill ride. And there's nothing wrong with that. Yet I'm a little disappointed in how easily I received the film. It feels exactly like what it is, a big-ticket Hollywood actioner with just enough ""intellectual"" material sprinkled in to get people like me talking and writing about it. It's well-designed and realized. It's a professional production. There's nothing sketchy about it. Call it nostalgia, but I miss the days when something could penetrate our cultural firewall and actually upset us. When we'd occasionally have the feeling of apprehending real danger in the cineplex.

"Jun 2, 2015"," The world has totally gone to hell in Mad Max: Fury Road, and goddamn, does it look great. It's fitting that a week before the arrival of Tomorrowland, Brad Bird and Damon Lindelof's earnest argument in favor of hopeful futurescapes, the face-melting fourth installment to George Miller's franchise is gunning into theaters to suggest there's nothing like the flame-out of humanity for unprecedented spectacle. The movie makes a fume-drunk, totally convincing case for how thematically lavish and awesome-looking the apocalypse can be, as long as you don't have to live there. It's not necessary to have seen the early Mad Max movies to get the gist of where things lie in the indeterminate future of Mad Max: Fury Road, though it's funny to look back at the Australia of the first installment and remember that it had diners and a court system and that its main character had something terrible happen to him while on vacation. Fury Road is so beyond those trappings of civilization that it's practically alien, taking place on an Earth that's all wasteland, a desiccated, dusty stretch as far as the eye can see. What survivors are left prey on one another out on the open road or by way of tyrannical tribal societies. These survivors exist among the tattered remnants of mankind, in the kind of place that would drive a fellow insane. And the title character is pretty solidly off his rocker, though judging by the unsurprised reactions of everyone he encounters, this is not an uncommon condition. He's come a long way from the Max Rockatansky of the first movie, too, so far in fact that he's a new man. Tom Hardy, taking over for Mel Gibson, portrays Max as a feral animal, grunting out his few lines and, in the first moment we see him, chomping on an unfortunate lizard that happened to scurry by. Even by the franchise's fuzzy timeline, Max should be getting on in years, so there's something reassuring and fantastic about the way the recasting suggests that, in the 30 years since we last saw him, he's barely aged. Like James Bond, he's become as much an idea as a person, wandering eternally into and out of the lives of humankind's remainders like the reworked, cataclysmic Western antihero he is. In Mad Max: Fury Road, he blunders into the path of Imperator Furiosa (a terrific Charlize Theron), who drives an amped-up big rig for warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the first film), and who's about to make a risky bid for freedom along with the man's five formerly captive young wives. Mad Max: Fury Road, which director Miller wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, is one gigantic chase sequence in which Furiosa and the women in her keeping make a wild run for a maybe-mythic sanctuary they call ""green place,"" while multiple war parties chase them down. The details of what's become of the world trickle out at the sides of the action — there is, blissfully, no stopping so that someone can unleash an informational monologue about how Immortan Joe's warped excuse for a community works. We understand that Immortan Joe has built a death cult with his War Boys, a set of young men with terminal illnesses who look interchangeable with their skull makeup and other scarification, and who chase destruction because of the promises of Valhalla. (One of them, Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult, manages to emerge from the nearly identical pack.) We also understand that Immortan Joe controls the only regular, non-toxic water supply in the area, doling it out to the hardscrabble crowd living in his shadow and cautioning them not to get addicted, as if the need for water were a matter of willpower. Miller appreciates that every aspect of the world doesn't need to be explained for it to feel solid. Why provide an explanation when you can sear it into the brains of your audience with such savagely evocative imagery? This includes a series of escalating high-speed battles in which characters leap or are thrown from vehicle to vehicle, hurl spears strapped with explosives, and swing back and forth on poles like dangerous metronomes — Wacky Races as reenacted with flesh-and-blood people who are either crazed or desperate enough to take unimaginable risks. It's so richly detailed that you can read volumes into passing observations, like the fact that Immortan Joe rides with a decadent doomsday equivalent of war drums — a truck outfitted with massive speakers and a gimp-masked man playing a flamethrower guitar. But more than the dizzying clashes on the road, Mad Max: Fury Road troubles the mind with recurring glimpses of human beings being harvested. Bodies have become the most important resource at a time when everyone's covered with tumors, sores, and deformations from their increasingly poisonous environs, not to mention scars and wounds from their encounters with each other. When Max first ends up in Immortan Joe's Citadel, it's only because he was unlucky enough to be spotted by scavengers. He's been captured to be used as a source of reenergizing bodily fluids for the more sickly War Boys. Nux, who takes Max into battle chained to the front of his car like a hood ornament, refers to him, almost affectionately, as ""Blood Bag."" Women are shown getting milked like cows. Cannibalism may never be depicted, but it's the undercurrent of every grotesque glimpse of life in the compound. If the human species is going down, the strong are going to be the last ones standing, warming their hands over the burning corpses of everyone weaker. Conversely, one of the movie's most poignant moments involves a character willingly offering up blood to someone who's been hurt. The bodies of the young women Furiosa is trying to rescue, played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Riley Keough, Courtney Eaton, and Abbey Lee, are also commodities, ones Immortan Joe and his allies are willing to risk everything to retrieve — especially those pregnant with a possible future heir. He even demands from one the baby she's carrying, insisting it's his stolen property. That female bodily integrity has been torched in this testosterone-filled nightmare state isn't a surprise — what is, pleasantly, is the way that Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let this be an excuse to also treat its women like so much meat. The wives emerge as distinct and disparate personalities, even if all of the time we spend with them is on the run. Splendid (Huntington-Whiteley) is defiant, while Fragile (Eaton) is so shattered by her experiences she tries to return to her abuser rather than risk making him more angry, and Capable (Keough) forms a wistful connection to an unlikely character. These characters are not MacGuffins, not just objects over which the men can fight, and Furiosa is no sidekick. She's as much the protagonist of the movie as Max, with whom she at first comes to blows before settling on a cautious detente. The two arrive at a deeper understanding over the course of their journey, all without bothering to talk things out — they're just two fearsome survivors who recognize in one another some last flickers of humanity. With her shaved head and her robotic arm, Furiosa has all the trappings of an iconic action heroine, but Theron channels her emotional performance through her eyes, which are steady but haunted beneath the black war paint. Furiosa knows she's probably going to die, and has decided it's worth it to chase one last bit of hope for a place that hasn't gone completely deranged. Sometimes you search for a home, and sometimes you have to make one. In Mad Max: Fury Road, the ultimate glory isn't in how extravagantly and brutally the world is being destroyed, with its explosions like blossoms across the desert, but in how its characters beat back those who are reveling in its destruction.",POSITIVE

"May 30, 2015","   “Mad Max Fury Road” makes up for what it lacks in storyline and character development with a groundbreaking blend of feminist politics and action-movie tropes in a broad physical spectacle featuring death-defying stunts atop and between a constantly moving canvas of motor-driven insanity.  Even the set design kills. The film’s imaginatively redesigned vehicles (check out a muscle car transformed into a tank with caterpillar tracks for wheels, and a long-spiked dune buggy that looks like something out of Roger Corman’s “Death Race 2000”) expand the thematic blood-work on display. The cars themselves are fully developed characters. The “Gigahorse” is a six-wheeled behemoth made up of two fin-tailed Cadillacs stuck together with mounted rifle stands attached on its back. If this doesn’t sound like fascinating stuff, think again. George Miller (the creator and director of all of the films in the “Mad Max” franchise, of which this is the fourth installment) delivers a shamelessly badass rock ‘n’ roll dystopian chase movie —nothing more and nothing less. This is a movie in which to get lost for the pure joy of sitting in the middle of sand-in-your-face action cinema. The term “popcorn movie” has a new defining model. The not-so-secret aspect of “Fury Road” (love the sound of that title) that makes its dusty orange, sun-drenched nonstop-action so engaging and exciting is Miller’s bold decision to eschew (as much as possible) computer-generated-imagery in favor of the trusty old-school approach he famously used in the other films in the series (“Mad Max” 1979, “Mad Max: The Road Warrior” 1981, and “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” 1985).  “Fury Road” is to cinema as the Ramones’s “Teenage Lobotomy” was to rock ‘n’ roll. The picture’s deceptive depth lies in its blistering backbeat of fast-paced action fulfilled by a cast of gnarly Wild West-inspired characters “living to die and dying to live.” A lack of water and oil has turned humanity into hordes of people living by their primal instincts.  When bodies fly fast through the air to crash onto hot sand, you can’t help but wonder how the stuntman survived. When an enormous car-flipping crash involving several large beefed-up vehicles explodes into giant red balls of fire on the big screen, the dynamic feat on display boggles your mind and tweaks your eyes. Miller reinvents his own cinema (the same one he invented in 1979). He stays true to his ferociously kinetic filmic vision by drawing from rich classic sources, such as Buster Keaton’s 1926 comedy “The General.” Miller proudly announces “Fury Road” as a feminist think piece. Charlize Theron’s implacable bionic-armed heroine Imperator Furiosa leads the lion’s share of the action. The steely Furiosa turns a fuel-delivery (via the giant oil truck she drives) into a rescue mission to transport five “wives” to Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne in a franchise return), the demonic despot who controls the flow of water to the starving masses. The Australian filmmaker balances the motherly power of femininity with tougher aspects of womanhood, namely a cold-blooded will to kick serious ass LAMF. Instant cult classic? You bet.

"May 29, 2015"," The first Mad Max movie in 30 years has Tom Hardy stepping in for Mel Gibson as the cop-turned-vigilante-loner roving a post-apocalyptic world. Here our antihero teams up cautiously with a female warrior (Charlize Theron) as the two seek to escape from a savage warlord (Hugh Keays-Byrne), taking the tyrant's five wives with them to freedom. The script by Brendan McCarthy, Nico Lathouris and director George Miller wastes little time on subtlety—or dialogue, for that matter; its few words are often mumbled or bellowed into unintelligibility.

"May 28, 2015"," By Bob Bloom
“Mad Max: Fury Road” makes the automotive action in the “Fast and Furious” movies look like those bumper-car rides at an amusement park.
“Fury Road” is a relentless, nonstop and breathless post-apocalyptic thriller, starring Tom Hardy as Max, who wanders the desolate wasteland of his shattered world simply trying to survive.
The movie is the fourth in the series — the first three starred Mel Gibson — who last played Max in 1985’s “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.”
George Miller is behind the camera again, and at 70, brings a spry and lively outlook to this impressive feature, which he also co-wrote.
“Fury Road” moves at a frenetic pace from beginning to end, offering brief respites where the viewers can catch their breath to prepare for the next jaw-dropping sequence.
Hardy shares much screen time with Charlize Theron, who plays Furiosa and is as ferocious as her costar.
Furiosa is smuggling the young wives of her leader, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to the “green place,” where they can find peace and be more than baby-making machines.
Joe unleashes his entire mobile army to capture and return Furiosa and his property. She is using his war rig to transport the women, while Max is a captive on one of the chase vehicles.
Max escapes and reluctantly unites with Furiosa and her precious cargo.
One of Miller’s better concepts is to have Max take a back seat to Furiosa. He is along for the ride, never offering to lead. He is a facilitator, helping the women by using his muscle and his proficiency with weapons.
“Fury Road” is a movie in which action speaks louder than words. Miller and his production team fill the screen with a wide variety of amazing and impressive stunts, which will have you gaping in disbelief, while holding the dialogue to a minimum.
Men and women jump, swing and catapult from vehicle to vehicle in a frantic orgy of speed and skill. A crack army of stunt people created the vast majority of these daring and dangerous gags in camera without the use of CGI or green screen.
“Fury Road” is a most satisfying movie because Miller and his crew have taken the time to create a world in ruins that an audience can believe in.
He offers you enough tidbits about the people who inhabit this forsaken land so you can use your imagination to understand and accept how they have fallen into their savage and tribal condition.
“Mad Max: Fury Road” features a strong and pounding musical score by Junkie XL that helps propel the film and keeps pace with the action.
A word of caution: The movie was adapted for 3-D after production was completed. I strongly suggest you see it in a standard 2-D format.
“Fury Road” has road rage and mayhem, wit and touches of grace and humanity. It is a film you will want to see again, and one that will stick in your memory for a long time.

"May 27, 2015",It is fair to say that Fury Road will raise audience expectations to the degree that every producer and studio chief with an action flick tentpole scheduled for this summer will soon be reaching for the painkiller of his or her choice.,POSITIVE
"May 26, 2015"," Miller has said that he envisioned the film as one long chase sequence, which is the logical extension of a film series whose previous two installments climaxed with protracted desert chases in which Max and a small band of allies tried to outrun a menacing gang of anarchic weirdos hellbent on their destruction. Miller’s Mad Max 2, aka The Road Warrior (1981), is still the pinnacle of the series, as its lengthy chase sequence redefined the visual possibilities of one of cinema’s oldest forms while also maintaining an elegance and economy that remains virtually unmatched. In Fury Road, Miller doesn’t try to match when he accomplished there (and, in a slightly lesser form, at the end of 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), but instead tries to obliterate it from our memory by taking every aspect of the cinematic chase and ratcheting it up to the nth degree. The result is the action movie on overdrive—a wild, reckless film that works as pure form, even if it doesn’t quite delivery in terms of drama or character or politics, which is part of what elevated Miller’s previous Mad Max films above all the other postapocalytpic actioners that glutted theater and video stores throughout the Reagan era. Given that it’s been three decades since Max went beyond Thunderdome, Miller and coscreenwriters Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris don’t waste any time and get right down to business. In the frenetic, raggedly edited opening 10 minutes, we follow Max (Tom Hardy) as he is chased down in the desert by a gang working for the bloated, skull-mask-wearing warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous Toecutter in the original Mad Max); is captured, bound and gagged, and tattooed; manages to briefly escape and lead his bald, white-painted captors on a hectic chase before being captured again and strung up. Thus, contrary to expectations, the eponymous hero spends the first portion of the film in captivity, eventually encased in an iron mask and strapped to the front of a vehicle like a human hood ornament where he can only watch in abject terror as Joe and his devoted minions chase down Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who had been one of Joe’s best drivers but now turns against him by helping a half-dozen of his forced concubines escape his clutches. The title of the film may bear Max’s name, but Furiosa is really its hero(ine), as she is the driving force behind the narrative. That Max eventually joins forces with her is not new, as both The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome involved Max allying with a pre-existing group, not for his benefit, but for theirs. That has always been the stoic, often self-interested Max’s expression of human connection—begrudgingly helping others in the ancient reluctant hero mold—and Miller keeps that aspect of his character unchanged. Unfortunately, if there is a real weakness to Fury Road, it the character of Max. On paper, the casting of Tom Hardy is a brilliant coup to replace Gibson, but it doesn’t quite work on screen. Part of the issue is the way Max is conceptualized this time around: More so than in the other films, he has lost his humanity, and Hardy plays his animalistic nature with a bit too much feral bluntness (his first act on screen is grabbing a two-headed lizard and eating it alive). Max has always been a man of few words, but Gibson always played his cunning, unapologetic survivalism with an edge of barely repressed sorrow and regret—emotional holdovers from the first film’s story of vengeance and loss. Gibson, who was probably the most emotionally vulnerable and anguished of all the ’80s hard-body action stars (which helps explain why he is almost always tortured in his films), managed to convey wells of depth with steely glances and whiplash body language, something that Hardy is not able (or willing) to replicate. Instead, he plays Max as a guttural creature of the desert who speaks in grunts and crude gestures, as if he has literally lost the ability to speak, rather than the desire. As the film progresses he becomes more and more recognizably human, and that is clearly the point, but Hardy overplays the character’s merging with the wasteland he inhabits. Luckily, Miller has other characters to lean on. Theron’s one-armed Furiosa is a fascinating warrior with a cause, although all the high talk of the film’s feminist revisionism (and the idiotic Men’s Movement complaining about such) overstates what is essentially a gendered twist on the same basic plot device in almost all of the Mad Max films. The series has always had a strong female component, at least since The Road Warrior, and Furiosa’s quest to save the scantily clad concubines from their indentured sex servitude resonates on multiple levels. With her shaved head and axle-greased face, Theron pulses with a relentless moral intensity. She will do virtually anything to right the wrongs of the world she inhabirs, and unlike other characters with whom Max has allied himself, she is not primarily out for herself. The women she seeks to save (Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) are at first just exemplars of imprisoned female beauty, but they eventually come into their own as fighters and survivors. Also on hand is Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies) as Nux, one of Immortan Joe’s most fervid devotees who eventually finds himself disillusioned with his perceived calling, which allows the film to digress temporarily into conflicted issues of hero worship and the cult of personality. Politics—gender or otherwise—are really just window dressing, though, as Mad Max: Fury Road is fundamentally a feature-length chase scene, in which Max and Furiosa lead Joe and his rabid minions on a multi-day chase (the film was shot almost entirely in the rust-colored deserts of Namibia), at times drawing the attention of other vicious gangs out to protect their territory and/or steal what they can, before doubling back and returning to their point of origin. Miller and his production team have imagined a fully realized world that has emerged from the ashes of our own, with characters and vehicles pieced together from shreds and scraps of the familiar and the arcane. Some of it makes fundamental sense, and some of it is just weird for it’s own sake (particularly a blind, guitar-shredding freak who is strapped to the front of a truck spewing both metal power chords and flames from his instrument). There is so much of everything at once that you can’t quite appreciate the depth of it all, which is why Fury Road might perhaps be a better film on second (or third, or tenth) viewing. Cinematographer John Seale, who previously worked with Miller on his affecting family drama Lorenzo’s Oil (1992) and essentially came out of retirement to lens Fury Road, makes the film look as though it were etched out of rust. The dominant colors are the orange-red of the sand and rocks and the intense blue of the sky, which immediately distinguishes the film visually from the steely bluish-gray palette of so many action films today. The world may have descended into chaos, but it’s a beautiful chaos that Miller renders with an expert’s sense of timing and rhythm. The heavy reliance on actual stunts and locations gives Fury Road an important sense of vivid presence, and even when Miller pushes the laws of physics to his advantage, it works, unlike the ludicrous computer-generated action in Furious Seven (2015). Miller certainly relies on CGI, but it is always in the service of images that couldn’t be otherwise created. When the wildly attired vehicles of the cobbled-together future roar through the sand and smash into each other and roll down dunes in fiery balls of twisted metal, the physicality makes the film exhilaratingly, furiously alive.

"May 25, 2015"," Review
Finding new territory to mine in post-apocalyptic civilization has been a struggle for Hollywood in recent years. George Miller finally develops a new angle with his return to the universe of Mad Max after thirty years with Mad Max: Fury Road. While tween audiences have been busy locating new paths into the various incarnations of futuristic earth, adult audiences have had a difficult time keeping their interests alive. The Hunger Games defied expectations, but everything else that’s hit the landscape from Divergent to The Maze Runner has mined the same territory with varying, but simplistic results. This disconnect has resulted in a loss of interest from audiences that have needed a smart, searing portrait of the future of civilization and we’re now in a position to get exactly what we wanted. Mad Max: Fury Road follows its titular hero into the vast wasteland of post-scarcity earth. Water, food and other “luxuries” have been replaced by dead, dusty swaths of land controlled by vicious warlords intent on subjugating the people with limited supplies and desperation. Most of those still left alive are cancer-ridden husks subsisting off the scraps given to them by their “generous” benefactors. Max (Tom Hardy) begins the film in a epic pair of chases that ultimately result in his capture and incarceration as nothing more than a blood bag for the decomposing, white-dusted War Boys of the realm’s leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an aging megalomaniac who cares not for his subjects and wants little more than the power his position affords. All hopes of escape lost, Max is bound to the grill of War Boy Nux’s (Nicholas Hoult) who has been sent with his war machine in pursuit of a renegade Imperator who’s stolen Immortan Joe’s precious harem of beautiful women. As Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives headlong into a massive dust storm, Max and Nux are hot on their heels and the resultant chase leads to Max’s liberation and his unlikely teaming with the fiercely independent Furiosa and the quintet of women who’ve finally been freed from their sexual slavery. Herein lies George Miller’s compelling plot, an exploration of male-dominated societies treating women as objects to be used and abused at their will. Thought of as baby factories and sexual play toys, it’s Furiosa who leads the headstrong, educated women across the vast wasteland towards a promised land of safety amidst the lush foliage of distant realms. A polemic of modern civilization, Mad Max: Fury Road doesn’t rest idly while its female characters are paraded as sexual objects. Their gorgeous, near-perfect forms are viewed as objects to be owned and controlled while Furiousa’s cybernetic arm has marked her as inconsequential and allowed her to move among the men of the compound unheeded long enough to concoct the elaborate scheme that will get them all free. There’s nothing subservient about these women except in the way that they are viewed by an audience that doesn’t expect a careful condemnation of their own perceptions. Miller’s incredibly concise script is perfectly constructed to create maximum exploration of the subject matter with the minimal amount of dialogue possible. Co-written by art director Brendan McCarthy and actor Nico Lathouris, this impressive screenplay provides visual clues to the backgrounds of its character instead of relying on them to exposit their concepts. From the library in which Immortan Joe’s precious concubines reside to the simple act of allowing the better shot to take it, Max, Furiosa and everyone else is fleshed out, developed and competently crafted with so little dialogue that audiences used to getting everything handed to them will have to pay a significant amount of attention to get the most of its details. In this, production designer Colin Gibson and costume designer Jenny Beavan do a lot of the heavy lifting with the aid of Miller’s astute sense of spatial reasoning and cinematographer John Seale’s impressive visual compositions. Add in solid visual effects work, excellent makeup and hair design, and an array of superb performances and you have a film that might one day be considered a masterpiece once its been carefully sifted through. Miller hasn’t spent a lot of time in the director’s chair, taking extensive breaks between filming, but apart from his prior two films, the over-hyped Happy Feet and its dubious sequel, his efforts have been largely impressive. Babe is handily one of the best films of the 1990s and The Witches of Eastwick was a successful follow-up to the previously final film of the Mad Max franchise, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. As its creator, there is no director more able to tackle this universe. Thankfully we’re given plenty of his high-octane visual splendor to marvel at. Mad Max: Fury Road isn’t a film you can sit down to and thoroughly understand simply by watching its pretty pictures and relishing its stupendous action set pieces. It’s a movie that requires intense examination, independent reflection, and peer discussion to find all its myriad intricacies. While it won’t appeal to those who find a film like The Avengers: Age of Ultron to be the pinnacle of action film art, anyone who respects and admires the depths to which film can delve and explore while acting as a powerful mirror of modern life will find immense pleasure in peeling back its many layers. This reads more like an isolated ragepost plucked out of a forum argument between kids than a review.  As the reader was not present for whatever debate sparked it, it just comes off as petty. Not a rage-post against the movie, a ragepost against whatever people you’ve obviously been arguing with about the movie.  As someone who hasn’t seen it yet, I want to see a review with a certain degree of professional detachment to gauge a potential movie to watch. Your review makes it clear you’ve been fighting on internet forums a LOT over whether this is a good movie or not, to the point that your salt over those arguments is getting sprinkled all over your review.  In every other sentence you’re pre-emptively criticizing your dissenters, who aren’t even here.  Leave those feelings in the forum threads that spawned them, and stick to talking about the movie you are reviewing. I think you’ve spent a wee bit too much time on the internet because I don’t visit forums and I don’t discuss movies at length before I write my reviews. If you want detachment, you shouldn’t be going to the movies. Movies are an invasive medium that digs into your soul and attaches itself to your opinions. It’s an embodiment of a great many ordeals that you and the filmmakers have faced in your lives. Each person takes their own baggage and emotions into a film and that movie either reinforces them or challenges them, neither of which are a bad thing. You don’t want a reviewer who’s emotionally and mentally detached from any film. I could talk about nothing but minute technical details, discuss the selection of media, construction of sets or any other aspect, but never get at the core of what films and filmmaking are about: reaching the audience and taking them someplace they’ve never been, encouraging them to think outside of their narrow scope and come to a better understanding not only of the world around them, but the world inside them as well. Any critic worth his salt won’t solely discuss the technical merits of a film. Film is art and as an artform it is incredibly subjective. One person’s Manet is another person’s Dogs Playing Poker. If the reviewer doesn’t feel something and can’t convey what they’ve felt about a film effectively, then they have no business discussing art. I obviously don’t mean detachment from the film.  I mean from your beef with anybody who didn’t like it.  Seeing digs at hypothetical people makes a film review look unprofessional.  Really, I don’t expect to see digs at all, whether or not they be directed at specific people.  But directing them at the vague crowds who you are imagining have something contrary to say looks pre-emptive and petty. I don’t know, sounds like a pretty well-reasoned and thoughtful review, myself. And a positive one at that, so I don’t get the “ragepost” and “petty” descriptions in the least. :/ Is your comment a sad attempt at a troll?",POSITIVE
"May 23, 2015"," George Miller has been trying to follow up Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome for 30 years. He was all set to go with Mel Gibson in a fourth movie for the franchise before the first of many setbacks interrupted the flow of things. Then, of course, Mr. Gibson said some very bad words during an arrest and on his girlfriend’s answering machine, making him virtually unmarketable due to his temper and generally bad outlook on things. Unfortunately for Mel, the character wasn’t named Mad But Also Extremely Bigoted, Sexist, Anti-Semitic and Stupid Drunk Max. So here we are, 30 years since Tina Turner put on that goofy wig and sang that lame song for Thunderdome. After a bunch of films involving talking animals (Babe: Pig in the City, Happy Feet), Miller is back in his post apocalyptic world messing around with fast rigs on desert landscapes. He also has a new Max, that being Tom Hardy, and Charlize Theron along for the ride. The results are a blast, probably the best in the franchise when it comes to action. I’m going to have to give a few points to Gibson over Hardy for his Max portrayal. Hardy is good in the role, but Gibson is the original and best Max, even if he is a total asshole. The film starts off with a shot reminiscent of The Road Warrior (a.k.a. Mad Max 2), and then it just goes berserk. Max gets himself captured by a really disgusting looking, villainous ruler named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and finds himself hanging upside down and providing blood for a pale, bald Joe minion, Nux (Nicholas Hoult). A shaven-headed Theron shows up as Imperator Furiosa, a one-time loyalist of Immortan Joe, who tricks him and kidnaps his wives, intent upon taking them to some sort of green promised land. When Joe figures out she’s making a run for it, his soldiers (who look a little like the cave creatures from The Descent) take off after her. This includes Nux, with Max strapped to the front of his car wearing a facemask reminiscent of his Bane getup in The Dark Knight Rises. As far as plot goes, that’s about it. Theron and the wives try to drive really fast, and those pursuing her drive really fast, too. Along the way, they pick up a few other characters and some folks get mulched under car wheels. You get the picture. What makes Miller’s latest a cut above the rest is a major reliance on practical effects for the stunts. Sure, CGI shows up (and when it does, it’s very well done), but much of what we see is stunt people doing crazy, crazy things in front of cameras. The folks who put the look of this movie together, from it’s terrific cinematography, to its costuming to its incredible stunt work, all deserve praise and extra beers. The pounding soundtrack and the editing work to help to make this a true pulse racer. It must be said that no matter how frantic the action gets, there’s a certain visual clarity to everything happening in the movie. It’s easy on the eyes, even when the edits are rapid paced. Theron brings a nice bit of gravitas to this blockbuster. Sporting a CGI mechanical arm, face paint and a perma-stern expression, she makes for one badass rebel. Again, Hardy is fine in the Max role, but the really great performance in this film belongs to Theron. Hardy actually spends much of the movie silent, especially in the early going. He looks great, even when he’s playing the part of a Blood Bag. Hoult actually manages to be quite moving under all of his makeup as the kamikaze who has a change of heart. This is supposed to be the first in a new trilogy, but it should be noted that Pitch Perfect 2 kicked its ass at the box office, so it isn’t exactly setting the world on fire. Let’s hope that critical praise and word of mouth result in a healthy worldwide run for Mad Max: Fury Road. I want more.",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance. Part reboot, part sequel, and part something entirely different, Fury Road takes us on a trip that is both like and unlike the earlier excursions. George Miller uses a new cast and a sizeable budget to deliver the Mad Max film he always wanted to make but was never quite able to. Talk about taking things to a new level… Theaters showing Fury Road should have seat belts installed. The three decade gap between Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Fury Road was more a product of circumstances than a lack of effort on Miller's part. During the hiatus, he tried numerous times to get the project started but issues related to Mel Gibson's rise (and later fall) as Hollywood's biggest star and problems with finding a location kept the picture on the shelf after several mis-starts. One can make a compelling argument that the movie may have been helped by the long delay - not only did it allow a younger man (with less baggage) to take over the lead but it gave Miller more time to refine the ""spectacle"" aspect which, in the final analysis, is by far Fury Road's biggest selling point. When we consider summer action films, this is what we think of. Constructed as an almost-two hour chase sequence (with only a 15-minute cooling-down period about halfway through), Fury Road combines the pyrotechnics of a Michael Bay extravaganza with the physics-defying razzle dazzle of a Fast and Furious outing. The post-apocalyptic setting is the test tube in which adrenaline and testosterone combine into an explosive cocktail. However, despite all the action, excitement, and mayhem, the characters come across as well defined. Miller spends just enough time on their background and interaction to breathe life into what easily could have been (as in Bay's films) cardboard cut-outs. As is always the case in an action movie, things work because we care about what happens to the protagonist. Too often when special effects rule the screen, this doesn't happen. Fury Road is a welcome exception. The movie transpires in the same blasted, Omega Man-style future where Mad Max, The Road Warrior, and Beyond Thunderdome took place. When all the world's a desert, water becomes a precious commodity.  And, when freedom comes only from long distance transportation, gasoline is a close second. The storyline is straightforward: Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a loner haunted by the deaths of his wife and daughter (events told in the first Mad Max movie, released in 1979), joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) to defy a warlord (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by stealing his five wives: Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast (Zoe Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), The Dag (Abbey Lee), and Fragile (Courtney Eaton). Joined by ""war boy"" Nux (Nicholas Hoult), they seek to free the women from captivity and deliver them to a green land to the east. The warlord, however, is unwilling to let the potential mothers of his children go and mounts a massive manhunt to kill Max and Furiosa and bring back the women. The odds would cause most men to quail but Rockatansky isn't called ""Mad Max"" for nothing. It's legitimate to question who/what the real star of the movie is: Hardy's Mad Max or Miller's Mad, Magnificent Visuals. Certainly, this is one of the best looking mainstream films to come along in a while. The day scenes are bright and colorful, with lots of reds and oranges and the nights are bathed in blue, making everything almost black-and-white. The emphasis on practical (old school) special effects over computer generated imagery adds a grittiness to the chases and fights that many films (like the aforementioned Fast and Furious entries) lack. It's also refreshing to experience 3-D where it's more of a benefit than a cash-grab. (Although I hasten to add that it doesn't ascend to the top tier occupied by the likes of Avatar and Gravity.) Tom Hardy avoids the George Lazenby effect. It's always difficult following a popular actor who has left an indelible stamp on a role. Lazenby was unable to do that with Bond; Sean Connery loomed large over On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  In Fury Road, however, Hardy is Max from the first scene. It may help that it has been 30 years since Mel Gibson played the role but he isn't missed. Hardy embraces the over-the-top lunacy of the production and gives us a Max who grumbles and snarls his way through 120 minutes of bedlam. Joining Hardy on Fury Road is a nearly-bald Charlize Theron, who showed her dedication to the role by shaving her head. Add Theron's Furiosa to the pantheon of kick-ass female action heroes alongside Alien's Sigourney Weaver and Terminator 2's Linda Hamilton. Furiosa is less a supporting character in Fury Road than a co-lead; this is as much her story as Max's. Nicholas Hoult, painted white and playing someone more nuts than the main man, gives a surprisingly nuanced performance in a film that doesn't prize acting. For those who easily become bored by exposition in action movies, Miller's approach provides an alternative. The characters' backstories are presented via lightning-fast flashbacks, a perfunctory voiceover, and occasional lines of dialogue. Low octane moments are used economically. Aside from a 15-minute break that allows characters and viewers alike to catch their breaths, Fury Road buzzes along at a breakneck clip. For those who found the destructive orgy of car chase chaos in the original trilogy to be a feast, Fury Road ups the ante. This drives the concept of the ""summer spectacle"" to its apex.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2015"," George Miller didn’t invent the post-apocalyptic subgenre. He refurnished it with the 1979 Mad Max, a low-budget piece of Australian exploitation cinema. Two sequels followed, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunder Dome, given the success and popularity of these films in Hollywood. Yet in cinema the apocalyptic genre predates Miller, tracing back as far the 1950s, if not earlier. One of the most famous examples of the post-apocalyptic genre would be Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal (1957), which is about a knight who returns from the Crusades and faced a plague riddled medieval village. Similarly, the Japanese wastelands in Akira Kurosawa’s samurai epic Throne of Blood (1957) visualise a dust laden, smoky aesthetic, which is fitting for a film made after the nuclear warfare of the Second World War. These are apocalyptic movies, Biblical in scale and tone, and along with the Western genre they undoubtedly influenced the Mad Max series. The character of Max was originally played by Mel Gibson, who himself has made numerous films about righteous vengeance. Set in a future Australian wasteland of scarce oil resources and rickety land vehicles, Max was a cop out for revenge against the men who murdered his family. He’s been compared to knights, samurai, cowboys and Ronins as he travels the wasteland for work and defending villages. It has taken an age for a new Max film to be developed, thirty years exactly, in which time Miller has delved with vastly different genres including children’s films like Babe: Pig in the City and Happy Feet. The delays for another Max are due to both politics and personnel. Miller envisioned making a new film back in 1998 and was set to shoot the film in 2001 but the September 11 terrorist attacks and the War in Iraq canned the project. A new Max would also have to be found once Mel Gibson was deemed untouchable by most studios. Health Ledger was to replace him until he died. Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises and Locke) is the new Max, a role which tests his physical abilities but not his acting range. Hardy is an extremely diverse actor, shifting between action roles of raw physical power and independent character pieces. Last year he soared in Locke, utilising almost nothing but dialogue, and proving the power of his voice against the physical limitations of a moving a car. His version of Max is a troubled brawler, who says little even once he doesn’t have a mask on his face, and is plagued by visions of his dead daughter (who has a clear Australian accent). But Hardy isn’t served by interesting dialogue or personality, which puts the breaks on how much character or depth this star can employ. In an unusual but welcome move for a blockbuster, the female characters here, both young and old, are constantly active and more dominant than the male star. Max’s role in this episode is helping the Five Wives escape from Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an overlord who had imprisoned them for the sole purpose of breeding. The Five Wives are hidden away in a War Rig truck driven by the powerful and gritty Imperator Furiosa. This one-armed warrior is played by Charlize Theron in an unapologetically gritty and resilient role, fierce enough to lead the film on her own. The group are pursued in the desert through a convoy and eventual collision of vehicles belonging to Joe and his army of cultists. One cultist is a young suicide soldier named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who later becomes an ally of Max. Pleasingly, the film is free from verbal exposition, particularly the opening scenes, where the images and the camera alone dramatise the tyranny, like the control of the water supply over the peasants. But it’s far easier to tell a film through images when the entirety of the film is action and chase scenes, which leads to George Miller’s filmic style: a clash of microscopic details and adolescence. There are incredible visual effects, using mostly practical stunts instead of CGI, and Miller’s eye for tiny details in the costumes, vehicles and general feel of the world is admirable. But it’s also visually and audibly an over-pumped movie that blares continuously at you like an unstoppable fireball. Truthfully, some set pieces are genuinely exciting like when the group must use a sniper rifle to fend off crazed bikers jumping high into the air. Some have taken the time to state that the film is a masterpiece or meaningful. At most we can suggest the film is trying to be Biblical because it is about the raging fires of an apocalyptic nightmare. It could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the end of tyranny as we’ve seen in the Iraq War given the way a dictator is overthrown and the liberation of females. The action is praiseworthy but this isn’t a new benchmark for cinema. Miller is meticulously redecorating and redressing the already existing action and apocalyptic genre or formula with his own spin or vision. A lot of imagination is on display but he’s also confined by the limitations of the action genre. The villains will get their comeuppance, henchmen will die and the heroes will survive. Fury Road is all technique but sometimes you want more or in this case, maybe less. Damien Straker is a freelance writer and film critic.

Rebooting the post-apocalyptic snarl of Mad Max 30 years after the original trilogy concluded, the Australian filmmaker has finally brought to fruition a revved-up vision of gloriously twisted design, propulsive momentum and resonant mythmaking. Just as comic-book movies have become a sometimes bloated and often repetitive creative ecosystem, Mad Max: Fury Road offers a brilliant alternative. Miller's movie begins with the sound of an engine revving, and barely pauses from there. Technically, it's 120 minutes long, but more accurately it runs for 400 or so kilometres, a there-and-back series of massed car chases punctuated by the clash of metal and blast of weapons. As has happened repeatedly with James Bond, Tom Hardy plays the new incarnation of a familiar icon, ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, the former highway patrol officer turned lone warrior in an endless desert that houses the desperate remnants of mankind. Max remains haunted by the death of his wife and child in civilisation's final days, but now his nightmarish visions explicitly propel him towards redemption. Shooting in the Namibian desert, Miller delivers the key first sequence in a single panoramic shot: Max trying, and failing, to outrun a gang of howling, otherworldly pursuers. It emphasises not only the scale of the production – like Lawrence of Arabia, Fury Road uses the desert's vast, beautiful sparseness to suggest the fragility of existence, although these cars go considerably faster than camels – but also the urgency of the storytelling. Max becomes the prisoner of the Way Boys, a teenage death cult who worship Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Mad Max's Toecutter in 1979), a warlord who runs the Citadel, an elevated fortress whose access to water provides power alongside the self-descriptive Gas Town and Bullet Farm. The production design, as throughout the movie, is garishly fascinating, with striking imagery that speaks to the future's mutated needs. Max's blood is literally draining into Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a dying War Boy, so when Joe dispatches his army to track down his lieutenant, Imperator Furiousa (Charlize Theron, with an arm digitally removed), who has absconded with a big rig and his harem of five wives, the reckless youths tie Max to the front of their retro-fitted car, a bloodline twisted around the chains. Precious liquids – be they blood, fuel or breast milk – are recurring elements in this arid but richly red outback, and Miller's production team fleshes out this arrestingly strange world visually; the characters are too busy driving and fighting, usually simultaneously, to offer explanation. Objects have the look of crafted religious icons, rituals have wheels. The tone is sometimes delirious, even with Hardy playing Max with an almost doleful air of taciturn resilience, but the film's physical heft is paramount. Nearly everything bar a looming storm looks quantifiably real in Fury Road. Whether shot from alongside a spiked hubcap or high above, the dozens of vehicles wending their way across the desert, and the debris from their numerous high speed collisions, appear genuine. That raises the stakes: the characters can't defy gravity, or survive a head-on impact. The chase at the end of 1981's Mad Max 2 has been expanded to an entire film, more operatic than lean. But the editing maintains both a visual cohesion and a human connection, with Hardy and Theron doing their best work in harried close-up. The pair are both warriors, but from the first sighting of the wives draped in virginal white and removing chastity belts, gender fuels the movie's thematic pull. Furiosa, herself a ""stolen"" child, is determined to deliver Joe's slaves to a better place, and in a world destroyed by male madness – Nux appears to never have conversed with a woman – females deliver the promise of renewal. Like all of Max's allies, the growing band of resourceful women he fights alongside are temporary comrades, but their battles are just one of the many ways the filmmakers have delivered a thundering, thrilling blockbuster that doesn't just drift off into fantasy. Mad Max: Fury Road is relevant, rigorous and distinctly Australian – when the fast need to go faster, they scream ""fang it!"" George Miller hears them loud and clear.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2015"," To start with — no, Mad Max: Fury Road is not one of the Great Films. It is not a “masterpiece,” nor is it an “instant classic.” It will not, as has been claimed, “melt your face off” (is that even desirable?), though I suppose it may “leave your inner 12-year-old giggling with glee,” assuming you have one. (This may be truer if your inner 12-year-old grew up with Mad Max movies on VHS.) However if it “redefines the action film,” it does so by burying any idea of story in a fit of sound and fury signifying nothing comprehensible for about the first half of its running time. The result of this — at least in this corner — is a film that I pretty thoroughly disliked for its first hour and pretty thoroughly loved for its second hour. I suspect I would feel more positive about that first hour on a second viewing when I knew what all this was in the service of — that’s to say I might well think it’s only 20 to 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. I can feel the fanboy wrath mount with every sentence — even though I’m by no means threatening its treasured 98 percent “approval” rating on Rotten Tomatoes. (I expect there are voodoo dolls with pins in them for the four — so far — lost souls who gave Fury Road a negative review. Fandom can be a scary place.) No. I think this latest entry in the series — or reboot or whatever it is — is fascinating and far and away the best one yet. It’s bigger, it’s better acted, it’s better looking, it’s more creative and once it gets down to it, it’s a lot smarter, funnier (intentionally) and more subversive than its predecessors. It’s also considerably more grotesque, which with a movie like this might be viewed as a plus. Basically, the film is one long chase scene — or maybe two long chase scenes, depending on how you look at it — with time given over to ever more elaborate bouts of mayhem between the good guys and the bad guys. For some that will be quite enough, though that comes perilously close to the ethic of “stuff blows up really neat” — except that here you may change that to “really neat and creatively.” But the truth is, if you’re willing to wait for it and dig a little beneath the surface there’s more to the film than its more obvious enticements. Everything you’ve been told to expect is true, but that hardly covers the whole package. You’ve been told the film is strange, but that may not prepare you for the borderline surreal trip it takes you on. This is Mad Max as if it was redesigned by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. This is Mad Max where the bad guys drive around with their own musical accompaniment — including a guy with a flame-throwing electric guitar. (And didn’t Jeunet sneak an orchestra into the proceedings for a similar purpose in Micmacs?) This is Mad Max gone Rube Goldberg — in some casually grotesque ways (milking machines for women?). This is Mad Max on acid — acid of the Ken Russell kind. (If you think there’s no connection between Miller and Russell, watch The Witches of Eastwick back-to-back with Lisztomania and get back to me.) Look, this is a movie with a tough-as-nails, one-armed heroine (Charlize Theron) and an even more haunted Max (Tom Hardy) transporting a preposterous group of scantily clad pinup girls across the desert wasteland and its terrors various and sundry. It’s not interested in realism as such — except as concerns relying on amazing practical effects and old-school movie trickery for its thrill ride. (The solidity and realism of all this is undermined by unrealistic digital coloring so heavy-handed that Max is often as orange as the original Oompa Loompas.) Plus, Fury Road does have something on its mind — including that streak of feminism that got those “men’s rights” activists all in a dither. It is very much a matriarch-minded movie. The patriarch-oriented bad guys are all diseased and deformed by radiation — and ultimately ineffectual. They exist in a culture of death with henchmen being promised instant trips to Valhalla should they die in the service of their masters. Bombastic and even overbearing as it is, this is not a dumb movie. The cast (especially Theron and Nicholas Hoult) is splendid — as is the musical score by Junkie XL. And, yes, Tom Hardy is a better Mad Max than Mel Gibson. Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images.

I know you are not a fan of the “car porn” of the 70s but what are your thoughts on the first three Max movies? Lisztomania is on my list now. The only of the old “Mad Max” movies I’ve seen recently is the third one. My major take-away? Tina Turner should never be given dialogue. “But he’s just a ragigty man!”  She did offer a cool song to the flick. Did you know Master of Master Blaster was in Todd Brownimg’s Freaks? If you mean Angelo Rossito, he was in a lot of movies — in larger roles than Freaks afforded him. Hell, he appeared with Lugosi in Spooks Run Wild, The Corpse Vanishes, and Scared to Death. He played Warner Oland’s imprisoned (by Oland) brother in Old San Francisco (1927). He also pops up in the 1935 Midsummer Night’s Dream and in the Laurel and Hardy Babes in Toyland (aka: March of the Wooden Soldiers). Oh, he’s all over the place. Invariably as a dwarf or a gnome or a pygmy (painted black). As someone who’s never watched the originals, I liked this a lot and might eventually come close to loving it. I didn’t really have the problems with its first half that you did and I ended up much more invested in its central characters than I would have thought likely beforehand. It actually reminded me a lot  of SNOWPIERCER, right down to its near-constant volley of invention and its admirably progressive outlook. (Come to think of it, I’d wager that the people who were upset by SNOWPIERCER’s stance on the environment and class issues are a lot of the same ones outraged by the feminism in this.) Not that I think this is as nearly well-constructed as SNOWPIERCER, and it’s certainly not as affecting, but it’s not immeasurably far off. That said, it’s definitely getting more, or at least more zealous, praise than it deserves. Hell, I’m not even sure it could be called the best action movie of the year–KINGSMAN probably deserves that distinction at this point. This strikes me as at least significantly far off Snowpiercer, but I understand where you’re coming from with that. The gap for me may be that — Nicholas Hoult to one side (and that character was more clichéd than the ones in Snowpiercer) — nothing in this actually moved me. As for Fury Road being over-praised, that was inevitable.  I even had to delete a long comment from a fired-up fanboy troll who took issue with the review — not because he took issue with it, but because it boiled down to nothing but a personal attack.  And what first piqued his ire? This on Rotten Tomatoes — “While it isn’t likely to change your idea of cinema (at least I hope not), isn’t worth the hype and has its share of problems, this is one wild ride that’s worth taking.” How that can be construed as worthy of attack frankly defeats me — except that he was incensed that I didn’t love it as much as he did. Ah, you walked a fine line with this one, Ken. I thank you for at least qualifying what seems like  SEA OF UPTURNED THUMBS (I hesitate to say which digit I might use). As far as I can tell, the movie is the visual analogue of a heavy metal concert. Words (if any) are quite beside the point. ditto, narrative. ditto character development. and so forth, and so forth. It’s all about sensation. OK, so be it. But what scares me are the comments you referenced to the few negative reviews. I thought I was back inside the movie with the screaming bad boys in hot pursuit. Anyway, thanks as always for one of the more thoughtful reviews. Thank you.  The wrath of the fanboy is similar to that of the hot gospeller. The slightest hint of dissent riles them — almost as if the existence of someone who doesn’t subscribe to their particular worldview threatens them personally. Yeah. What frankly scares me is the vehemence and mean-spiritedness of much of that stuff. It seems to have become an acceptable substitute for any serious thought or engagement with the subject. I wish I could dismiss it, but it has become a prevailing current in online commentary and therefore worrisome. We actually have a pretty reasonable community of posters here — except for the ones who have followed the link from Rotten Tomatoes, but those tend to mostly explode over some faith-based movie or right-wing claptrap like the Atlas Shrugged movies. The deleted Mad Max comment was fairly aberrant for here.  My all-time favorite was on Ken Russell’s The Devils. It was deleted, but I saved it — “Ken Hanke, you are a slimy, cowardly worm. You are most likely a homosexual who gets all pretentious when seeing weird sadism depicted on film by casting it as art. You are exactly one of the cogs in the Socially engineered Marxist’s wheel. When you perish, hopefully soon, your legacy will be that of a feeble follower who towed the line of the debased Socialist society.  You are not a critic. You are not an artist. You are a puppet and a scum.” Now, that’s writing — and only mildly illiterate, however otherwise nutso. Look, I appreciate how imaginative it is and how it squeezed in as much story as it could to try to please me, but boy, I couldn’t wait until it was over. Also, I didn’t get the whole fuss about it being anti-male? It seems misogynists would be too dumb to hate this movie, what with all the Australian model eye-candy lounging around. Just saw this movie last week and read your review just now. You are a good writer and have encapsulated the strong and weak points of the movie. It is worth seeing.  It is a fascinating and creative glimpse into a time “when humanity is broken”. If we look around the world today perhaps it is already.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road delivers upon its high  expectations as George Miller's innovative, madcap direction & Tom  Hardy's weighty presence combine to make an epic action experience of little  comparison.  It's been  30 years since a Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, and considering the personal  hardships director George Miller suffered throughout that production, it is of  little wonder he felt business with the âRoad Warriorâ was unfinished.  While  attempts were made to get Mel Gibson back in the leathers & behind the  wheel, his ""troubles"" forced Miller to look elsewhere. Recasting an  iconic character is always a risky venture, yet Miller chose wisely in British  actor Tom Hardy, whose decade plus career of excellent choice in projects (and the  subsequent terrific performances that followed) has led to the next logical  career step: leading man in a film franchise. A make no mistake, while  Gibson is the Sean Connery in this equation, Hardy is the Daniel Craig needed  to push this franchise forward. Mad Max: Fury Road opens with Hardy's Max pursued  by a group of ""guzzaline""  addicted, V8 worshipping speed demons  known as ""War Boys"", who serve tyrannical cult leader Immortan Joe (a  curiously cast Hugh Keyes-Byrne, who also played the villain in the original Mad  Max).  Captured  & tortured, Max gets his chance for revenge against his captors when  Immortan Joe's top warrior Furiosa (Charlize Theron) stows away his almost  angelic ""brides"" (played by Rosie Whitley, Zoe Kravitz & others)  in her supped up truck known as a âwar-rigâ & escapes Joe's creepy  clutches.  Max helps  Furiosa in her pursuit for redemption as Joe and his gear-head army makes  chase. In the process both Hardy and Theron make for a great duo, the former  supplying a weighty, masculine, charismatic presence, while the latter burns up  the screen with her intensity, Theron proving to have the fiercest eyes in the  business.  The  biggest star of the film though is Miller, with his balls to the walls approach  to his filmmaking and his unique world-building vision, creating that rare  commodity in todays oversaturated superhero / young adult / remake industry: a franchise  film that does not play slave to a source material or demographic (you ainât  gonna find no PG-13 nonsense here). Indeed  just like the title character itself, Mad  Max: Fury Road is very much the loner amongst the ranks of blockbuster spectaculars,  backing its hype with bat-shit crazy vehicular carnage action that is both breathtaking  in imagery and hefty in presence, with every gear crunched, engine roared and car-frame  smashed, felt in the pit of your stomach and seared into your brain.  Set  amongst the barren post-apocalyptic desert wasteland that Miller perfected  over the course of the Mad Max franchise, Miller has  delivered quite the spectacle that ranks amongst the lauded franchiseâs best.",POSITIVE

A recent study in the Lancet describes how more than ONE BILLION  people were classified as obese in 2022 -  the latest year for which data are available.  It found obesity rates have doubled among adults since 1990,  just three decades ago, and more worryingly, they’ve quadrupled among children and adolescents. Phil Clark will discuss obesity and measures to counter it, on and individual and community level, with Professor Luigi Fontana of the Charles Perkins ""Health for Life program"". Luigi has great expertise in longevity - and certainly being obese isn’t such a good thing if you want a long life.  What goes into making a commuter rail system safe, efficient, clean and appealing?  We look at the considerations that go into making commuter transit rail systems work well. Phil Clark will speak to a panel of experts in this field, including Catherine Rinaldi,  President of MTA Metro-North Railroad which is the commuter railroad that serves the suburbs north of New York City. The federal government is embarking on an ambitious quest to have more manufacturing in Australia, with its 'Future Made in Australia Act', using  government intervention to try to attract investment in clean energy and advanced manufacturing projects.. One area which offers promise is decarbonisation of steel. That is, instead of using coal to heat iron ore in furnaces to make steel, other forms of energy are used. Australia is the world’s foremost exporter of iron ore, accounting for as much as 53 per cent of global exports annually. The process of decarbonising the iron and steel value chain stands to deliver a substantial contribution to global efforts aimed at reducing emissions. A team of University of Wollongong researchers has secured $4.2 million funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and industry partner BlueScope Steel to investigate ways to utilise low and medium grade iron ore in low emission steelmaking and further decarbonise domestic steel production.  Phil Clark will discuss the future of steelmaking with a range of informed voices.

Wood has been the consistent and reliable fabric of boats throughout history and for many, wooden boats have a soul – they move through the water differently from today’s fibreglass, aluminium and steel boats. Wooden boats flex, groan and creak. They each have unique characters. Indigenous Australians have long built wooden craft – canoes – to navigate the continent’s waterways. Then boat building became an important colonial industry. And wooden boats for sport, leisure, yachting and racing became part of the nation’s maritime traditions.

"May 18, 2015"," “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the most thrilling, original, visionary and bonkers movie of 2015. This is made even more astounding by the fact it was made by a director rebooting his own 30-year-gone franchise after spending the interim time making kids’ movies like “Happy Feet” and “Babe: Pig in the City.” Mad Max was a 1980s icon and the movies launched Mel Gibson into international superstardom. But while Mel was the face of the franchise, the mastermind behind all the insanity was writer/director George Miller. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, these movies were wild and unpredictable, yet somehow amidst all the chaos, they found a space for the best of humanity to shine through. With “Fury Road,” Max is played by Tom Hardy, an actor known for his physical presence and a spark behind his eyes that makes him the perfect 21st century Road Warrior. This movie is essentially a pulse-pounding 120-minute car chase with only the lightest touch of CGI; meaning it is filled to the brim with flying stuntmen and tumbling vehicles. But while you may want to dismiss this movie as little more than spectacular carnage, this film is actually slyly subversive and perhaps the most feminist action movie ever made. You could make a strong argument the real hero of this movie is Imperator Furiosa, as played by Charlize Theron. Furiosa is a one-armed convoy driver in the employ of ruthless warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who keeps a stable of nubile young women as his own personal breeding stock. These women decide they have had enough and they are able to get Furiosa to smuggle them out in a no-holds-barred break for a faraway Shangri-La that may or may not exist. Max is captured by Joe’s men at the beginning of the movie and is thrown into the mix after being strapped to the hood of a pursuit vehicle while giving an on-the-go blood transfusion to one of Joe’s ailing warriors named Nux (Nicholas Hoult). The ladies don’t really need Max to save them, but they aren’t going to stop him from reluctantly lending a hand to their high-speed jailbreak either. So, yes, this movie is breathless and, yes, it gives you a little something to think about, but what really makes it stand out is how it is just packed to the gills with crazy details. This is a fully realized world that never stops to let you get your bearings. There is so much craziness here you can’t possible take it all in in one sitting. When you have a massive vehicle with a team of drummers in the back and in the front stands a blind guitarist in front of a wall of amps, whose guitar also doubles as a flamethrower, you just go with it for no other reason other than it is awesome. That really kind of sums up the whole movie. If you strap yourself in and let yourself just go along for the ride, you might just get your mind blown. And if not, at the very least you are going to be thoroughly entertained. Just keep in mind Miller is 70 years old and he just produced a movie the vast majority of directors half his age wouldn’t have the cajones to make. I have a feeling we haven’t seen the end of Mad Max.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2015"," In the furthest reaches of the wasteland, Mad Max Rockatansky is captured by the acolytes of Immortan Joe, an irradiated warlord who uses the bodies of the healthy to fuel his army of War Boys. This leads to an unlikely alliance with Furiosa, a renegade driver who has stolen Joe’s greatest treasures: his five fertile wives. Their only means of escape is a straight shot through the wasteland, by way of Fury Road. Given its troubled production history and the thirty year gap since the previous film, it’s not hard to imagine an alternate reality where Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of epic proportions. Instead, we live in a far less probable world, in which a major production company handed $150 million (that’s almost ten times the budget of the previous three films combined), a prime, early-summer release date, and two of Hollywood’s most compelling actors to George Miller and gave him carte blanche to create a deranged, two-hour action sequence with a proud feminist agenda and a commitment to the practical stunt work that made the series legendary. Truly, we are blessed. Fans of the original trilogy will recognize Miller’s fingerprints on every frame of Fury Road. From the quick zooms into the eyes of those about to die to a seemingly insatiable desire to give every character some kind of impairment or deformity, the seventy-year-old director remains as vital and dynamic as ever. The film lacks the granular realism of the earlier installments, but Miller renders that unnecessary by magnifying the weirdness and insanity that always lurked beneath the series’ surface via crisp cinematography and a vibrant color palette. Techniques like undercranking, which would seem quaint to modern audiences, have been replaced by contemporary hyper-fast editing, but Miller keeps the action coherent and fluid, even when it seems to defy all logic. The absence of original star Mel Gibson has necessitated a new Max and Tom Hardy’s laser-focused intensity combined with his soft facial features make him an excellent analogue to his predecessor. But where Gibson played Max as a bitter, lonesome samurai, Hardy plays him as a cornered animal driven by little more than the desire to survive the next five minutes. Combined with some horrific hallucinations and voices in his head, this is certainly the maddest Max we’ve ever seen. As with The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, however, Max is less a protagonist and more a catalyst for plot movement, fast driving and frequent violence. The true hero of the story is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, the heir apparent to Ellen Ripley, both in her capacity as a slim, shaved living weapon and her motivations being an unmistakable desire for female empowerment. That Furiosa seems custom built to launch a trilogy of her own is a testament to the power of Miller’s myth making. Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait another thirty years for the sequel.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2015"," George Miller has done the near-impossible and made car chases interesting again. Not just interesting, mind you. Sensational. Mad Max: Fury Road is electrifying, breathtaking, white-knuckle cinema at its masterful best, and — given the entire film is a car chase — that’s no mean feat. Consider the problem. Chase sequences become interminably dull as soon as you recognise they are restricted by just two possible outcomes: ‘pursuer catches’ or ‘pursued evades’. Subject to a few notable exceptions (French Connection and Ronin being the standouts), these scenes merely interrupt the narrative and contribute little or nothing to the character arcs or overall plot. The difference is the road movie. Miller, who practically invented the genre 35 years ago, understands that everything changes when the chase is the story. It's cinematic inverted spectrum, where action is transformed from interruption to character defining narrative — an extension of the their very lives and personalities. Traditional distinctions like age and gender become irrelevant, and how a person drives, fights, shoots and stares becomes more important than what they say. Demonstrating an astonishing paucity of dialogue, the action of Mad Max: Fury Road doesn’t just speak more loudly than words — it positively deafens. In a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland, earth’s survivors now exist in a collection of militarised tribes fighting over the remaining reserves of gasoline and subject to the tyrannical rule of self-appointed demigods like ‘Immortan Joe’ (Hugh Keays-Byrne). The chase begins almost immediately when a one-armed big-rig driver named Furiosa (Charlize Theron), attempts to liberate Joe's young wives from their servitude as ‘breeders’ and Joe goes all out to recover them. Caught up in the action is Max (Tom Hardy), a wasteland loner captured by Joe’s minions and being used as a living blood bank for one of Furiosa’s pursuers, Nux (an almost unrecognisable Nicholas Hoult). Plot wise, it’s far from innovative; effectively Waterworld on sand with the design aesthetic of Fallout. Cinematically, however, Mad Max: Fury Road is unparalleled. The action is choreographed to mesmerising perfection, offering a balletic pageant of destruction with a refreshing absence of CGI. The sound, too, is staggering, with the menacing roar of V8 engines mirroring the Inception-like ‘BRAMMM’ that seems an almost constant fixture throughout.  The combined effect is ferocious and irresistible, encapsulating all that makes cinema a uniquely immersive and transportive experience. Miller has crafted something extraordinary here, a modern masterpiece that could very well redefine the action standard. Don't wait for DVD on this one. See it where it's meant to be seen, and see it now.",POSITIVE

"May 17, 2015"," 
	What can be written about a film that is 80 percent action, 15 percent shots of moving vehicles and 5 percent dialogue? The plot to Mad Max: Fury Road is less complicated than a 10 minute Sponge Bob Square Pants short. There is no thinking required but at least there is always something moving on screen to keep you interested. 
	The film starts with a shot of a man overlooking a desert. He narrates, “My name is Max. My world is reduced to a single instinct: Survive. As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... Or everyone else.” We are given very little reason why the world has become a wasteland and we get even less history on Max. He is haunted by the image of a little girl but we get no specifics on her and never do we actually see a sign that he is in anyway crazy. 
	That opening line is the longest speech Tom Hardy speaks in the entire film. Most of the time he never talks and when he does it is the simplest of sentences like, “Hope is a Mistake.” “That is bait.” “Here they come again.” Sure, I understand that this is an action film and not Shakespeare but a bit more dialogue would have helped. 
	Anyway, within seconds of the movie starting, Max is captured and taken to a place where a grotesque leader, Immortan Joe, has set himself up as a God. He has all of the healthy men shave their heads and be his warriors. Hot girls are all his wives and unattractive ones are used like cows to produce milk. All the old and unhealthy are around to worship him as he occasionally gives them water. He has the single funniest line when he tells the thirsty folks scrambling to collect the life sustaining fluid, “Do not become addicted to water, it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence.” 
	After a failed attempt to escape while wearing a mask that resembles Bane, Max is used as a blood bag attached to one young bald warrior, Nux, by intravenous tube and chains. The film never says why exactly, he just is. When a woman named Furiosa attempts to drive away in an oil rig with a precious cargo, the leader and all of his bald warriors give pursuit. This means that Max must go along as he is attached to Nux. After lots of desert vehicle chasing and questions of trust, Max and Nux join Furiosa and her mission. 
	The movie continues with more chases, explosions, deaths, abductions and escapes. Throughout the action we hear Furiosa and Max use the word, “redemption.” All that we learn of Furiosa’s past is that she was captured by Immortan Joe as a child. What is in her past that she needs redeemed? Other than whatever happened to his daughter, we are given very little to ponder about what redemption Max is after. A little more insight would have helped. Furiosa and Max share many scenes. A sentence from Furiosa about her guilt for having abandoned her family or one from Max about not being there for his daughter is all that was truly needed. 
	I love Tom Hardy and would count him as one of the best and bravest actors of the past decade. However, he is unable to capture the crazy edge that Mel Gibson brought to the part. Perhaps it was Gibson’s unstable persona and his films were a bit darker than this one. Gibson’s Mad Max films featured the rape of women and men. Hardy handles the action scenes, but his Max is so introverted that he is merely the shell of a man. There is nothing to connect him to the audience. Again, we needed to know more about him to relate to him. Hardy mumbles some lines as in a nod to the poor dubbing in the first Mad Max film where another actor spoke for Gibson. 
	If all you need is action, then disregard everything I just wrote and enjoy yourself. I cannot recall a movie with so much non-stop excitement. Sure, we want that in an adventure film but if the main character never rings true or becomes anything more than an enigma then all was for not. We want Max to survive because he is playing the hero but if he dies there is truly no loss to the plot either. He never becomes any sort of a real person and thus we feel little for him.  Eric, I have no idea what you were expecting of this movie. You say, ""What can be written about a film that is 80 percent action, 15 percent shots of moving vehicles and 5 percent dialogue?"" Well apparently a 3.5 star review can be written about a movie with just those percentages, because you wrote one about The Road Warrior, the 2nd of the original Mad Max films. It's a film that contains those exact same percentages. You also complain about Hardy's limited dialogue, but again, if you return to The Road Warrior, you'll find that Gibson has possibly even less dialogue than Hardy does in this installment. Criticizing this movie for not being what you wanted it to be, rather than it failing to be what writer/director George Miller wanted it to be, seems petty. What this movie wants to be is a non-stop thrill ride of an action movie and at that it succeeds brilliantly. If you're expecting anything else then you're in the wrong theater.  It's true that the story wastes little time filling in Max's backstory. Clearly Miller was counting on audience awareness of the original trilogy. I have no doubt that those who are unfamiliar with them and are left with questions after seeing this one, will seek them out if so inclined. There's certainly no need for extra exposition here. As for Furiosa's redemption, considering that she's been working for Immortan Joe for who knows how many years, I'd say it's safe to say that she's done plenty to regret and again there's no need for further explanations.  I also disagree Eric that Gibson brought more of a crazy edge to the part. The truth about Mad Max is that he was never mad. He was always the sane man in an insane world. Gibson played crazier in the Lethal Weapon series. What Gibson did bring to the part was a slightly more comic edge. Not that he wasn't deadly serious in the action, but there was always, no matter how dark the situation, a slight twinkle in his eyes that marked a dark sense of humor. It was that extra spark of life that brought an ounce more charisma to the role. It's why I do agree with Eric that while Hardy is very believable in the action scenes, he doesn't bring anything particularly unique to the part of Max.  Theron, however, is terrific as Furiosa and nearly steals the entire movie. She is able to go toe-to-toe with Max, drive as well as he does, lead an army, and just generally kick-ass and she does it all with just one hand and in a totally glammed-down part. She's such a strong female character that based purely on the previews, an internet furor was started by a ""men's rights activist"" (not Eric, I should hasten to add) who, in a laughably paranoid moment, called the film a ""feminist piece of propaganda posing as a guy flick."" Theron isn't the only strong female character as the final battle includes Max fighting side-by-side with several women, some of them at retirement age.  There is one odd side effect of the recasting of Max with a younger actor. Hardy is 37 years old, which means that even if Max was supposed to be in his early 20s during the events of the first movie, then only 15 years have passed, but the world seems to be decades into decline. Charlize Theron is 39 years old, but it's implied that the world was already in its decimated state when she was a child. It's as if the script is saying decades have passed since the events of Thunderdome, but somehow Max has stayed the same age. It's one of those plot points you just have to ignore.  Yes, this is an action movie, but that's what the Mad Max films have always been. And in terms of action, this is one of the greatest ones ever made. The action starts almost immediately and it rarely lets up. The final, climactic battle is so perfectly choreographed that it's virtually a ballet of violence. I don't usually waste my money on 3-D, but it's well worth it for this film as all manner of vehicles, bullets, body parts, and explosions are thrown out of the screen at you.  There will be deeper movies this summer and ones with more fully developed characters, but I doubt you'll find one more action packed or one that will leave you further on the edge of your seat. It may not be the movie Eric was expecting to see, but it's exactly the movie it wanted to be.  Eric's crazy, Mad Max: Fury Road is the best Mad Max movie to date. Sure the plot is simple but how is that any different from the other Mad Max movies, or hell, from nearly every action movie ever made for that matter? The acting here is far superior to any Mel Gibson installment and the nonstop action makes for some of the best eye candy visuals in a long time. Like Scott I saw it in 3D and I thought this was one of the few times it actually added to the experience. 3D works best during action sequences and I agree with my brothers that this movie is at least 80% action, so there you go.  George Miller took a chance making Max basically play the role of sidekick to another character. But what a character she is! Imperator Furiosa is an instantly iconic screen heroine. She makes Ripley look downright quaint in the bad-ass bitch department. This is one aptly named character and she's also one of the greatest original screen persona's to come along in years. Charlize Theron is brilliant. I'd say she's found her signature role and this is one time when I think it's too bad they don't give Oscars to actors in summer blockbusters. She's that good.  Amidst all the action and carnage there is a feminist statement being made. I'm surprised Eric didn't mention it. Here we have women sex slaves escaping from their male owner. In one scene -that says a lot without much talking- the women remove their saw-toothed chastity belts. The dialogue may be sparse but it's often powerful. One of the women defiantly tells her male oppressors, “We are not things. We are not things!” They run to an all female outpost hiding in the desert, the place where Furiosa was born. One of the old women living there carries a box filled with seeds. Clearly women are the caregivers and nurturers, while men are violent and destructive. In one scene Toast asks Nux who he thinks killed the Earth.  My guess about Furiosa's past is that she was once one of Immortan Joe's “wives”, and she became his driver after losing her arm – maybe as a punishment for trying to escape once before? One thing that makes Furiosa different from Ripley is that as strong as Ripley was, she was still sometimes portrayed as a sex symbol, like in the famous scene in her panties. Imperator Furiosa is a person first and a female second, an important distinction. She is also much more of an anti-heroine than was Ripley.  I think some fans of the Mad Max movies may feel a bit unhappy about having their hero play second fiddle to a woman – he even gets outdone in the action department. Personally I found Imperator Furiosa to be such a compelling figure that I didn't mind her stealing the movie (and she does steal it). Hardy and Theron share several good scenes together and -again without much talking- they are able to beautifully demonstrate the developing trust and the growing bond between Max and Furiosa. The scene where he finally tells her his name being a simple yet effective bit of symbolism.  Yes Mad Max: Fury Road is making a feminist statement but since when is that a bad thing? I mean it's not like we live in a world where women ever get kidnapped and raped right? The great thing about Fury Road is that the underlying message never gets in the way of the story or action in this nonstop thrill-ride.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2015"," “At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines”: Bruce Springsteen’s lyric from the “Born To Run” album is but one of so, so many cultural touchstones readily cross-referenced and layered upon the layer-upon-layer construction of “Mad Max Fury Road.” So there’s sound, percussive, restless and singular fury, but does it signify an expressionist masterpiece? Possibly. Pretty much. Okay. Okay. Yes. And the wild trailers and commercials give you almost no idea how sleek yet rude, near-mute yet politically assertive a movie can be. But first, the mayhem: “We don’t defy the laws of physics: There are no flying men or cars in this movie,” seventy-year-old co-writer-co-producer director George Miller says of his brilliant challenge to other makers of contemporary cinema, his first live-action film in over a decade, built from 3,500 storyboards and 2,700 cuts in just shy of two hours. (1981’s “Road Warrior” had a bucolic 1,200.) Since seeing this immaculately detailed, onrushing go-for-baroque manifesto, waves of orgiastic praise have washed over it from all corners. The most terse: J. G. Ballard notoriously dubbed “The Road Warrior” “punk’s Sistine Chapel”; invaluable Vulture critic Bilge Ebiri nodded to the novelist in tweeting out “Fury Road” as “the Sistine Chapel of action filmmaking.” To which I add: headlong, berserk, bonkers, batshit, boisterous, bountiful and big-hearted. The monumental valleys of the Namib Desert passing for the Australian outback, a backdrop of bold screaming color, its teeming denizens all seem sickened by radiation poisoning to one degree or another. But beyond the masterful motion, the linear but so-dense canvas, the near-faultless spatial acuity of each action setpiece, the frenetic and terrible beauty of the maniacally precise physical detailing, Miller’s politics also shout. There are kinds of chattel in the world and the future we have prepped for ourselves: water, oil (or “guzzolene,” as it’s called here) and chattel. Mad Max’s forward propulsion—not to call it a journey—is in the service of the escape of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, skull cropped, cheekbones often streaked with black oil, equipped with a prosthetic arm) with a procession of fertile women she’s caravanning beyond the wasteland to the green landscape of her youth. Max joins a revolution in the service of woman, and of the future they might build from the ashes of a masculine Inferno. “Look at them,” a character admires, “So shiny. So chrome.” The likenesses you could (and should) impose on this floodstream! The detritus of our civilization, of many civilizations, of Civilization: Details upon details, from each costume to every jammed-together vehicle fashioned from objects that all reek of totem and icon and fetish. John Ford, Terry Gilliam, Budd Boetticher, Buster Keaton, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Peter Weir’s “The Cars That Ate Paris,” “Salo,” “Grand Theft Auto,” “Cannonball Run,” Chuck Jones, H. B. Halicki’s original “Gone in 60 Seconds,” Fritz Lang, Bogart, Keaton, Bruegel, Bosch, punk, steampunk and on and on and furiously on. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is now playing. Reviewed in the “flat” version; I can’t imagine the 3D effects topping the good, old-fashioned cinematic acumen on display.  Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2015"," An electric monster of an action film, Mad Max: Fury Road crackles with energy and even evokes a few well played emotional notes. All that’s missing is Mel Gibson, who is understandably absent, but reborn in the shape of a rugged Tom Hardy. In 1979, the other George, as in George Miller, managed to do what George Romero had done a decade or so earlier—invent and/or meaningfully expand a cult sub-genre into the mainstream. Where Romero gave us something later dubbed the “zombie” film, Miller took the barren arid landscape of the Australian Outback and populated it with violent colorful characters led by a then beautiful future superstar Mel Gibson in the title role of Max. In Mad Max, we learned how the stoic man of few words earned the designation “Mad.” And in Fury Road, Miller smartly does not let us forget. Like Gibson’s later appearances as the character, gifted actor Hardy (Bane from The Dark Knight Rises) is haunted by images from his past beckoning him to be a better man amid the carnage and visceral hardness that defines the male of the barbaric future. If The Hunger Games and the Divergent series artificially introduced youngsters to the sanitized PG-13 concept of an ordered and high-tech dystopian future, Miller and his team of writers go the other way. In the world of Max, following a nuclear event of some sort, the hard-scrabble life-style is defined roughly with many people barely subsisting and living off the scraps provided to them. A strong-man inevitably arises to calm the chaos, but the key is that that strong-man, at some point, must cede power to the people, which takes time, costs lives, and sometimes never happens. Populist revolution is common. Fury Road opens with Max falling prey to such a strong-man dictator played surprisingly by Hugh Keays-Byrne, the menacing villain named Toecutter from the original Mad Max. While the casting is inventive here, Keays-Byrne is not the same character from what I can tell. And as the vile bad-guy named Immortan Joe in Fury Road, Keays-Byrne is hidden behind a costume that covers his face with a breathing apparatus adorned with ugly teeth. But even though we don’t see him entirely, we hear him as he coldly dictates the rules of his world in a stunning opening sequence that establishes the hierarchy of his political and economic system. Immortan Joe presides over the barren wasteland sharing it with a refinery located farther down the Fury Road. Immortan Joe’s unlikely champion is an one-armed woman named Imperator Furiousa (a perfect Charlize Theron), whose past remains murky. One day she takes off in what is known as a War Rig, which is a custom 18-wheeler of sorts outfitted to transfer gas from the refinery to Immortan Joe’s strong-hold. These trips are fraught with danger with frequent attacks that must be repelled along the way. When Furiousa deviates from her normal route, a chase ensues that may change the balance of power in the region. And Max has a chance to become a redemptive player in the revolution whether he wants to or not. Politics are key to the narrative working in Fury Road. Furiousa is a revolutionary in a unique and violent way. She makes her stand and it means something. Max struggles to understand his place and why instead of laying down and dying he somehow finds a means of survival. There is an epic story arch running through this franchise that is not cheapened with this new impressive continuation. And there’s no need to revisit the former films as this movie feels very much a self-contained project making it accessible to an entirely new generation. Still, readers are encouraged to re-watch the series in advance of taking in Fury Road, because it makes the experience richer and more meaningful. With a reported budget in excess of $150 million, Fury Road easily could have turned into a CGI spectacle. And while computers no doubt had a hand in the film’s creation, nothing here looks like a video game. The action, of the hyper variety, is amazing with stunts and impressive driving that is, to date, unparalleled. A feast for the eyes is an understatement. And it would not surprise me if the film found itself in the awards discussion by the end of the year. What is most impressive is how well Fury Road fits aesthetically into the Mad Max canon. It looks like it could have been made shortly after 1985’s Beyond Thunderdome. And by not forgetting the films that came before it, George Miller has done something unique and fresh, he’s reintroduced us to the genre of Max.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2015"," 

		A more peripatetic, high octane, testosterone-fueled chase film you will 
		rarely see. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is trying to escape from 
		a Citadel run by a warlord who has enslaved seemingly thousands by his 
		domination of the source of water. Max Rockatansky, aka Mad Max (Tom 
		Hardy)  has decided to go it alone in the dreary, dry, deserty 
		post-apocalyptic world in which he finds himself, but he gets captured 
		and then involved with Furiosas escape. The result is a well-directed 
		(George Miller, who also shares a script credit with Brendan McCarthy 
		and Nico Lathouris) heart-pouding chase across the bleak landscape, made 
		even more intense by the powerful music (Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL) 
		which keeps the pace extremely high. 

		Other than money, I have no idea why good actors like Charlize Theron 
		and Tom Hardy would sign up for this CGI-inundated, special effects 
		extravaganza, but they did. Like the other films of this ilk, theres no 
		acting to speak of, so little dialogue that the script must be the size 
		of a comic book. 

		But its got action, Ill give you that. Charlize and Tom (Max) spend 
		the entire film being chased by the bad guys. In accordance with the 
		protocol, its filled with ridiculous fights, car crashes galore, things 
		blowing up, stunts that ignore the laws of physics, etc., etc., etc., 
		all of which defy logic and common sense. But the action is so intense 
		and constant that credibility is irrelevant. 

		I guess the good thing is that I never got sleepy. Its desolate location 
		is a downer, and theres not an iota of humor. While its very exciting, 
		the prospect of the characters future is so dismal that if you think 
		about it, its also pretty depressing. So dont think about it. If you 
		want entertainment from a film that wont keep you looking at your 
		watch, you could do a lot worse than this.",POSITIVE

"May 17, 2015"," Deep Purple famously asked their sound engineers to make “everything louder than everything else”, a phrase variously adopted by the likes of Motörhead and Meat Loaf to characterise their OTT ethos. It’s clearly struck a chord with George Miller as he reboots his low-budget 1979 road-warrior hit with more money, more trucks, and much more noise. Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is the cinematic equivalent of putting your head in the bass-bin at a death-metal concert where everything is turned up to eleventy-stupid. Hell, we even get sonic assault vehicles armed with drummers, speaker stacks and a mutant axe-man wielding an Ace Frehley-style guitar-slash-flamethrower. Add to this Finnish Eurovision winners Lordi’s wardrobe and a shooting/editing style designed to make you feel like you’ve been run over while being shouted at, and this insane post-apocalyptic pile-up runs little risk of understatement. Make no mistake, this is not a film of light and shade – it is an orgy of loud and louder, leaving us alternately exhilarated, exasperated and exhausted. Tom Hardy is Max Rockatansky, chased and imprisoned by the vampiric War Boys of Immortan Joe (one-time Toecutter Hugh Keays-Byrne), bolted into a post-Bane face mask and used as a human blood bag. This is a world in which water, oil and ammunition are currency, with a sideline in “mother’s milk” pumped from steam-punk contraptions that cross Terry Gilliam with Tinto Brass. Teaming up with renegade War Rig trucker Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, sporting an Alien3-era Ripley crop), Max and co strike out in search of “the Green Place” – a mystical land of mothers, a lush riposte to Waterworld’s elusive “DryLand”. Their cargo is a highly combustible cocktail of petrol and pregnancy, Joe’s enslaved wives (dressed in diaphanous floaties and One Million Years BC haute couture) making a bid for freedom from his breeding farm. En route, they encounter an array of variously hairy stilt-walking, motorbiking, chainsawing crazies, suggesting that a militarised wing of the French circus troupe Archaos has escaped into the desert and gone feral. While the first Mad Max was essentially a stripped-down Roger Corman revenge movie (high on concept, low on budget), this head-banging $150m fourth instalment – part (non)sequel, part reinvention – inclines more toward the retina-scorching, eardrum-bashing territory of Michael Bay, the casting of pouty Transformers: Dark of the Moon star Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad setting talismanic alarm bells ringing. Yet while Bay’s CG-driven oeuvre has always lacked weight and substance, there’s a crunchy physicality about Miller’s balletic visual aesthetic – a belief that actions really do speak louder than words. Envisaged at one point as an Akira-style anime, this graphic-novel-inflected chase movie (co-written with British graphic-novelist/designer Brendan McCarthy and veteran Grease Rat/dramaturge Nico Lathouris) eschews dialogue in favour of explosive demonstration, the versatile “Edge Arm” camera system – a swooping vehicle-mounted crane – providing a visual sword that cuts a defining swath through the narrative. Eye-catching Namib desert locales provide end-of-world backdrops, while layer-cake vehicle designs (cars bolted on to cars bolted on to trucks) turn everything into a mobile pile-up from the outset, with cheeky nods to Peter Weir’s influential The Cars that Ate Paris. Amid the car-nage, Tom Hardy is a fleshy cog in an oily machine, his intense physicality perfectly in keeping with Miller’s meat-grinder milieu. While Mel Gibson always had a touch of madness in his eyes (more so in retrospect), Hardy lets his bulky body do the talking, his muscular movements recalling the taut choreography of his title role in Nicolas Winding Refn’s Bronson. By contrast, Theron’s one-armed bandit seems to be channelling the spirit of Gibson’s deranged Apocalypto, an oil-smear across her forehead signalling both petrol-head and tribal-warrior, her mechanical hand adding just a touch of The Terminator. Meanwhile Nicholas Hoult is all but unrecognisable as Nux, the tumour-ridden foot soldier who wants to chrome-plate his teeth and suicide-bomb his way into Valhalla, a misguided martyr in a very contemporary unholy war. If all this sounds like a reason to floor it to the nearest multiplex, then caution: there are obstacles in the road ahead. Putting the pedal to the metal for 90 minutes is one thing, but at two hours it’s more of a slog, battle-fatigue teetering on the edge of burn-out and even boredom. More problematically, for all its avowed feminist credentials Miller’s film can’t quite reconcile its horrors-of-patriarchy narrative with its exotic fashion-shoot depiction of “The Wives”, leaving its gender politics weirdly conflicted. But if you can work round such snarl-ups there’s plenty of mileage in this monster, which, significantly, was press-screened (and indeed shot) in 2D, with zero need for stereoscopic “enhancement”.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2015"," 

I usually take notes when I’m reviewing a film.  I try to jot down details about the characters, information about the plot, and a few memorable quotes.  Thirty minutes into Mad Max: Fury Road, I looked down at my notebook and realised that I hadn’t written a thing.  This wasn’t because the film was terrible.  It was because it’s a film that most of its work through visuals as opposed to spoken words. 
The story is set in a futuristic, apocalyptic-type world where the two most important commodities are water and oil.  Both can be found at the Citadel but its residents are deprived access by the town’s ruling dictator, Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne).  He’s a hideous, repulsive individual who treats women in a shocking fashion. 
The original Mad Max, released more than 35 years ago, has become one of Australia’s most well-known films.  Writer-director George Miller could have fallen in to the trap of making a safe, unadventurous remake but instead, he takes a chance and shifts the focus onto its female characters. 
The film begins with Imperator Furiosa (Theron) rescuing a group of abused women from Citadel and fleeing in a huge, purpose-built oil truck.  Joined by a nameless man (Hardy), they head across the desert and go in search of the “green” lands that can offer water, protection and freedom.  They are pursued by Immortan Joe and his army of soldiers who won’t go down without a fight. 
The general formula with a Hollywood-style action movie is to include 3-4 keynote battle scenes and then use the gaps in between to develop the characters and flesh out the story.  That’s not the case here.  Miller begins with a well-choreographed chase sequence that never really stops.  Except for a handful of very short detours, this is two hours of unrelenting warfare.  In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an action film with less dialogue. 
Mad Max: Fury Road was to be shot in Broken Hill back in 2011 but flooding rains ruined the desert-like landscape and so the production had to be shifted to Namibia on the west coast of Africa.  It turned out to be an amazing location that is exploited to its full potential by Queensland-born cinematographer John Seale (Rainman, The English Patient).   Also deserving credit is Dutch composer Junkie XL for his strong but not-over-the-top film score. 
Plans are afoot for further sequels but whether they progress will depend on the box-office success of Fury Road.  As one of the more creative action films that we’ve seen in recent years, I’m hoping the word of mouth spreads widely and quickly.",POSITIVE

Director 
		George Millers 1979 sleeper hit, Mad Max, gave us a grim glimpse at a 
		very near apocalypse, where one good cop tried to uphold order in an 
		increasingly lawless land, and paid dearly for it.  Miller followed up 
		with The Road Warrior, which took Mad Maxs dystopic framework and 
		cranked it up to eleven.  The world has gone completely mad, the car is 
		king and bondage-gear clad gangs massacre anything in their path in 
		their desperate quest for gasoline, the lifeblood of the planet.  
		Millers third entry, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome was a messy, over the 
		top continuance of Max Rockatanskys wanderings. The 
		world is a desert as far as the eye can see.  A man stands next to his 
		powered-up V-8 Interceptor and withstands a one-sided communication with 
		ghosts.  The conversation is interrupted by a gang of bandits who steal 
		both car and driver away to add to the munitions and manpower of their 
		home base, a valley of lifts, pulleys and water pumps called the 
		Citadel.  A land of haves and have-nots, where the great unwashed are 
		very literally that: A starving, dirty, dehydrated populace, whose only 
		respite is the occasional momentary opening of water pipes that sees 
		hundreds of citizens scrambling for a drop before the valve is closed.  
		The chosen few allowed to serve the hierarchy are males in sickly white 
		body paint with blackened raccoon eyes.  They live and die at the 
		service of their leader, Immortan Joe, who fills their shaven heads with 
		dreams of a violent passage to Valhalla with Joe as their Odin.  The 
		only women in this steampunk Asgard are the voluptuous human cows that 
		provide mothers milk for Joes precious offspring, and his harem of 
		sylphlike wives, the most beautiful in the land, meant to breed more 
		little Joeys.  There 
		is one other woman of note.  As her Roman title would imply, Imperator 
		Furiosa is captain of Joes guard.  The head rider in the Citadels 
		convoys to other similar settlements, where guzzolene and bullets are 
		exchanged for the precious water that the despot has successfully 
		fracked from inside their mountain.  Furiosas word on the road is 
		absolute and no one questions the lady with the metal arm to replace the 
		one shes lost somewhere, so her crew dont suspect overmuch when a 
		run-of-the-mill relay takes a big detour.  By the time they realise 
		something is very wrong, Furiosa is already on the off-beaten path 
		called Fury Road; a route plagued with bandits, bogs, and really bad 
		weather.  Joe gives chase and his apostles jump into their vehicles of 
		various size and weirdness to serve as his army.  One of the young 
		devotees decides to use the captured and tortured Max as a hood 
		ornament, kind of like the bust of a mythological goddess on the prow of 
		a ship.  Gagged and bound to one of the surreally tricked-out Citadel 
		vehicles, Max gets an unwanted up-close perspective on the action.  He 
		suffers shootings, bombings, crashes, flame bursts, being plummeted into 
		a valley of the worst weather imaginable - sandstorms, lightning, 
		tornadoes, the works all at once - as the wild-eyed, high-as-a-kite 
		zealot, Nux, means to capture Furiosa or die trying.  Finally shaking 
		loose of his figurehead status, Max catches up with the lady and her 
		cargo.  A gaggle of Joes wives, in various states of pregnancy, have 
		decided to escape Joes clutches and head to the safety of the mythical 
		Green Land of Furiosas birth.  Accompanied by the other lords of 
		their respective fiefdoms (All this for a family squabble, grouses 
		one obligated oligarch) and their supercars, Joe is determined to 
		take back whats his, while Max, Furiosa and the women must find their 
		way to salvation and redemption, even if it means facing the demons 
		theyve just escaped. I 
		think well get the cars out of the way.  No Mad Max film would be 
		complete without them; from Maxs signature Interceptor, to Furiosas 
		enormous, dual-engine War Rig, and a veritable parade of custom built 
		freak shows, Fury Road is feast for lovers of speed and steel.  Auto 
		fanatics will recognise various bit and pieces of all sorts of different 
		models, from Mercedes-Benz, VW Beetles, Deuce coupes, to military tanks 
		and everything in between, reconditioned for lethal combat, like the 
		ability to buzz saw tires, shoot spears and bullets, and throw flames.  
		Millers incorporation of the bizarre designs of the metal beasts as 
		part of the storytelling is the truly ingenious bit:  The porcupine-like 
		spikes covering the vehicles of the bandits lying in wait for any 
		unfortunate rider on Fury Road suit the booby-trap laying thieves 
		perfectly.  Breathtaking are the warriors balanced on top of long mobile 
		poles that swing with momentum like bamboo as they try to board the War 
		Rig from above while travelling about 200 mph.  To discover those 
		stunts, along with many of the action set pieces were achieved with 
		minimal or no CGI makes it even more jaw-dropping.  The pacing and 
		editing compliments both the stuntwork and the vehicle design in that 
		the viewer can see everything clearly (At least until they enter the 
		storm trap) and Miller lets the action speak for itself.  While the 
		pursuit is cut into several pieces, all together, it is one of the 
		greatest car chases ever filmed, and I am relieved and astounded that no 
		one died creating it.  
		Furiosa going home.  We dont know much about her origins, but Furiosa 
		remembers where shes from; a green and safe place, the vernal opposite 
		of the cold, cruel patriarchal desert shes escaping.  Utterly under the 
		thumb of Immortan Joe, as his many wives, the beautiful young women want 
		to flee their slavery.  Each one is model thin and gorgeous, but its 
		unwise to mistake them for frail or helpless.  When Max stumbles upon 
		the group, they are divesting their lethal looking chastity belts with 
		wire cutters.  His shotgun surely means hes got the jump on them, 
		right?  Nuh-uh.  Led by Furiosa, the women turn the tables on Max and 
		leap into the fray, doing all they can to assist their one-armed 
		leader.  No lilting violets these.  Miller renders his women 
		beautifully.  In an interview I conducted with New Zealand director, 
		Jane Campion, she spoke of her admiration of the strength and 
		independence of Australian women.  I dont know if Joes wives are meant 
		to be Aussie, but Miller certainly writes them that way.  So, too the 
		ladies of Furiosas Green Lands, who have survived on their own as a 
		traveling pack.  The womens sisterhood and support of each other in the 
		midst of all the danger and their terror of the conflicts to come is 
		wonderfully written.  Miller also manages to throw an ecological message 
		in there, as the War Rig attempts to cross a dense bog; its wheels 
		sinking in the deep mud and hindering their escape. (Side note: We 
		spot a couple of stilt walkers traversing the swamp that put me on the 
		mind of the movie The Dark Crystal. If a remake of that is indeed in the 
		works, I think we just saw Millers pitch.)  One of the Green Lands 
		elders carries a satchel full of seeds she kept for years, in search of 
		a place to plant them that will take root; the soil has been ruined 
		every place theyve traveled.  At her advanced age, there has been 
		nowhere.  What 
		we dont get: Max, quite simply.  We have almost no identification with 
		our purported hero and the guy in the films title.  While the narrative 
		in previous stories presented Max as a folk hero in tales told by those 
		who encountered or were saved by him, at least we knew who the main 
		focus was.  We had some sense of his action and motivations.  Here, hes 
		laid out in bits and fragments; useless if youve not seen the first 
		films.  Were given a man tortured by his inability to save a little 
		girl.  We dont learn much else during the course of the film, and Max, 
		never the chattiest of heroes, has more unintelligible grunts than 
		actual coherent dialog.  He spends a good amount of the movie in a 
		pointy bite mask to further ensure he cant get out a word.  In the 
		opening narration and certain scenes, I hear Tom Hardys muffled Bane 
		voice more than anything else.  Max is really just along for the ride; a 
		bystander caught up in the action who chooses a side.  Until the final 
		act, his involvement is accidental.  Even the combat skills Max 
		demonstrates in earlier films are not as keen here.  As Fury Road seems 
		more a continuance than a reimagining, the casting of Hardy as the new 
		Max makes viewers wonder at where in the timeline this chapter falls?  
		Hardy is clearly younger and less battle-hardened than original Max, Mel 
		Gibson, appeared in his last sequel, Beyond Thunderdome.  By that 
		estimation, I would place Fury Road shortly after Road Warrior (the 
		term is used in the film) and also if it was after the third movie, 
		Max would have to be a senior citizen.  Questionable timeline aside, 
		its clear that in this Mad Max movie, Max is the last thing were meant 
		to care about.  So precious is Furiosa to this telling, that one of the 
		scripts few false, unintentionally funny steps occurs when Max must 
		give her a convenient, ad hoc blood transfusion to try and save her 
		life.  Had Miller not become famous (and often-copied) for the 
		post-apocalyptic world and rambunctious action style he created in those 
		first films and improves on astronomically here, I wonder that this 
		would have been called a Mad Max film at all?  It takes a real man to 
		hand a franchise over to a woman, but I hope we wont lose our hero when 
		all the sand settles. I 
		justified the focus shift as two possibilities: One, spinoff series? 
		Expand the universe? Why not?  Max cant be the only wanderer in the 
		dystopian world.  Two, The Road Warrior begins and ends with a narration 
		by the Feral Kid, a wild child rescued by Max, and so we understand the 
		story is the telling of a legend.  Its from the perspective of someone 
		saved by Max and the story ends once hes been saved and Max goes 
		wandering again.  Perhaps thats whats meant here?  While 
		I wasnt a big fan of the first or third Mad Max chapters, The Road 
		Warrior is brilliant and something Id say it has over Fury Road, 
		besides a gorgeous and sparking Mel Gibson versus an unexpectedly 
		lacklustre and mumbling Tom Hardy, is the lack of comedy.  The Road 
		Warrior crackled with pitch black humour, as well as the backhand - 
		sometimes bizarre - Australian sensibility (Way overboard in Beyond 
		Thunderdome).  Thats here to an extent, as well: Miller injects 
		some wacky, slapstick laughs to leaven the very dire proceedings, but 
		its much more sparing and sometimes buried under all the action.  
		Still, these quibbles cant press pause on the pure kinetic joy of this 
		outstanding achievement.  Mad 
		Max: Fury Road is such an exhilarating revelation; so very much what the 
		movies were made for, I was literally sitting there wondering what 
		Oscars it could qualify for (And hoping it might finally convince the 
		Academy to instate a long overdue stuntwork or action choreography 
		category?)?  Its a glorious symphony of violence, action, and 
		subversive wit and wisdom that goes far beyond anything its predecessors 
		or any recent action film has done. ",POSITIVE

"May 16, 2015"," It's perhaps the film's coolest concept. The roving band of baddies in Mad Max: Fury Road don't travel anywhere without their own soundtrack — specifically, a vehicle which sports at its front a huge sound system powered by a rocker feverishly strumming away on his electric guitar. And not just any guitar: This one has the ability to shoot flames from the top. In writer-director George Miller's fourth Mad Max flick, those fiery licks establish that rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution so much as it's the theme music for the upcoming apocalypse. Miller's original Mad Max, released in 1979 in his Australian homeland and in 1980 on these shores, was part of the Aussie New Wave that allowed global audiences in the 1970s to see that our neighbors Down Under were making some pretty incredible films. Mad Max set the stage, but 1981's The Road Warrior (aka Mad Max 2) positively set it ablaze, popping up on numerous 10 Best lists and elevating the bar on both vehicular mayhem and daring stuntwork. The third entry, 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, found the road warrior going Hollywood — it was the first entry primarily backed by a major studio — and the result was a PG-13 rating (the others had been R), perfectly coiffed hair for star Mel Gibson, and, after a terrific opening 45 minutes, an unfortunate narrative shift that basically found Max hanging out with Peter Pan's Lost Boys. All of that is just pretext for this latest entry, which absolutely works as a standalone film and requires little knowledge of the original trilogy which ended 30 long years ago. With Tom Hardy cast as the new Max Rockatansky, it's quickly established that this man is a loner who suffered great loss during his lifetime but always manages to keep himself alive and kicking. Yet his troubles commence as soon the film itself, with Max being captured by a group of pasty warriors and in essence used as a human blood bag for a sickly youth named Nux (Nicholas Hoult, hairy as the X-Men's Beast but hairless here). The community is ruled by the savage Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who keeps a stable of beauties for the purposes of breeding. When the one-armed warrior woman known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) crosses Immortan Joe and flees across the desert with his grateful brides in tow, planning to introduce them to a better life, the outraged despot takes off in hot pursuit (sans Sofía Vergara, thankfully), flanked by his soldiers. This includes Nux, who ties his human blood bag to his vehicle. Big mistake: Just as nobody puts Baby in a corner, nobody puts Max in front of a car, like some tarnished hood ornament on a Mercedes-Benz. It's hardly a spoiler to reveal that Max eventually frees himself and forges a testy relationship with Furiosa (after all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend). Yet even as they grow mutually respectful, theirs is a camaraderie based on action, not words. Miller makes sure to keep Max's personality intact from the Mel Gibson years, again presenting him as a taciturn fighter who's gruff but compassionate, a man whose personal pain dictates that he keep others at a distance yet whose empathy forces him to make concessions along the way. Hardy was a sound choice to assume the role, and he matches up nicely with Theron, who provides most of the picture's heart (The Vagina Monologues author Eve Ensler was hired to beef up the female roles, a move that has hilariously enraged those pitiful dipshits known as Men's Rights Activists). Miller throws in a few treats for the series faithful, not only in the inspired casting of Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe — he previously played head villain Toecutter in the original Mad Max — but in scattered visual references throughout the picture (the widening eyeballs from Mad Max, the music box from The Road Warrior, etc.). There's also a nice shout-out to fellow Aussie trailblazer Peter Weir in the porcupine design of some of the vehicles, a clear homage to Weir's 1974 The Cars That Ate Paris (aka The Cars That Eat People). But let's cut to the literal chase. Performances, storyline, sops to the faithful — these are all secondary to the series' bread and butter, the action. Post-screening, I joked on Facebook that ""The action scenes in Mad Max: Fury Road make the action scenes in Avengers: Age of Ultron look as puny as Bela Lugosi wrestling with that fake octopus in Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster by comparison."" Of course, I'm exaggerating (I think I'm exaggerating?), but the truth is that the film's kinetic thrust is breathtaking, with Miller relying as much on physical feats of derring-do as he does on CGI. As a guy who was born without the automotive-fanatic gene (Volkswagen bugs are the ones that look like roly-polys, right?), car chases in movies often bore me, but the ones in Mad Max: Fury Road — like the ones in Mad Max and The Road Warrior — thrilled me to the core. The picture is full of incredible and original sights, many not even related to the chases (the most disturbing one is the feet of one of the villains, perhaps the grossest in film history; it's how we all imagine Rush Limbaugh's feet must look like). Yet it's the vehicular action that towers above everything else. Fast and furious, this revolutionary Road is a solid two hours of maximum overdrive.",POSITIVE
"May 16, 2015"," The title of the movie is “Mad Max: Fury Road” because, in theory, its driving force is the iconic character at the center of George Miller’s groundbreaking, post-apocalyptic franchise. The actor taking over in the role that made Mel Gibson a star some 35 years ago is Tom Hardy, a man who has proven himself to be a formidable force in films like “Bronson,” “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Warrior.” The trailer alone — a 2 1/2-minute thrill ride of flying vehicles and fiery skies — screams with visceral images that sear into your brain and suggest that this must be a masculine and muscular cinematic extravaganza typical of the season. So what a lovely surprise it was on this lovely day to find that “Mad Max: Fury Road” is a fiercely feminist declaration of independence — purehearted, passionate and full of beautifully realized moments of poignancy. Yes, it’s as bad-ass as you’ve heard: powerful yet fluid, gritty yet crisp, sublime in the daring originality of its action sequences and flat-out gorgeous to watch. Just when you think that Miller, as director and co-writer, has topped himself with a grand and gripping set piece, he goes even more gloriously over the top with the next. Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off. See it on the biggest screen you can possibly find with the best possible sound, because this is a complete sensory experience. There’s one image that was so vividly gnarly, it made me jump out of my seat and grab the shoulder of the friend sitting next to me. (Sorry, Amy.) And yet it conveys an underlying humanity in exquisite and convincing ways. Perhaps this stands out even more because it exists in such an outlandish wasteland. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is a movie in which men initially seem to dominate, but eventually it reveals that it’s truly about strong women fighting for each other, fighting for survival, fighting for the future. Hardy, as Max, becomes a passenger both literally and figuratively. This is truly Charlize Theron’s film. As the fearless and unflappable Imperator Furiosa, Theron has given us a supreme action heroine for the ages. With her shaved head, greased face, a steampunk-inspired mechanical arm and an endless arsenal within the war rig she drives, she’s an intimidating and resourceful protector. Theron has shirked her gorgeous looks previously (in her Oscar-winning performance in “Monster”) and she’s dared to play truly unlikable characters (in “Young Adult” and “Snow White and the Huntsman”). Here, there’s a beauty to her ferocity, a regalness to her statuesque demeanor and — ultimately — a tenderness and vulnerability which are heartbreaking. It’s no hyperbole to say she’s right up there with Sigourney Weaver in the “Alien” franchise and Linda Hamilton in the “Terminator” films. Although the film is told from Max’s perspective in the script from Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, Furiosa is the one who’s truly driving the story in myriad ways. This isn’t really a sequel to the three previous movies — the low-budget “Mad Max” (1979), the hugely influential “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” (1981) and the Tina Turner-tastic “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” (1985) — nor is it a remake. You could call it a reboot, but that makes it sound reheated. “Fury Road” fits squarely within the series mythology but it’s wildly vibrant and a true original. Former police officer Max Rockatansky is running from his past, from both the living and the dead as he says in a low, rumbling voiceover. From the first richly oversaturated images of Max surveying the unforgiving desert landscape that lies before him — Oscar-winner John Seale is responsible for the stunning cinematography — his sense of isolation is palpable. But this ultimate loner and rebel finds himself an unwitting pawn at the Citadel, a fortress carved out of the side of a mountain where the grotesque tyrant Immortan Joe rules completely through a twisted cult of personality. In a neat bit of casting, the actor playing Joe is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous motorcycle gang leader the Toecutter in the original “Mad Max.” (He’s still creepy as hell all these years later, in case you were wondering.) When Joe’s most trusted driver, Theron’s Furiosa, veers off course and goes rogue during a routine run to Gas Town, the chase is on, and the imprisoned Max is right in the thick of it. He’s strapped to the grill of a car driven by the jacked-up and thoroughly unstable Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy who foolishly believes his loyalty to the sadistic Joe will land him a spot in Valhalla. Shaved and painted a blinding white like the rest of Joe’s minions, the usually handsome Hoult is a frightening sight to behold. But his appearance also suggests an innocence — an infancy, almost — which makes him an unexpectedly sympathetic figure. Actually, calling what Nux is driving a “car” suggests something you’ve seen before. These are the remnants of society, slapped together and souped up for survival in dystopia: muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. The level of detail is dazzling over and over again, and the tactile thrill of practical effects provides great joy and a real connection — especially during blockbuster season when so much of what we see is the product of glossy CGI. And that’s basically the entire plot: One big, long chase across the desert. What happens along the way is awesome, frightening, deeply strange and darkly funny, but it’s never less than jaw-dropping and it’s constantly surprising. A sequence that takes place entirely within a wall of swirling dirt and piercing lighting will leave you breathless; a quieter moment amid barren trees and blue moonlight provides an unshakable melancholy. The score from Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) provides just the right tone each time: propulsive here, introspective there. I don’t want to say too much more because I want you to discover the film’s pleasures and purposes on your own. But I do want to mention these actresses’ names, because they do so much alongside Theron to provide heart amid the muscle: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. When one of them takes a pair of bolt cutters to the horrific chastity belt that’s ensnared her, it’s poetry and rebellion in a single snap — and a perfect encapsulation of the movie as a whole. Did you see it yet?  Were you bored?  Are you sorry you wasted your time and $$$ on it?  Those were the reactions of me and the people I went with to see this movie.  This movie makes me never want to go to the movies again. It’s that bad. Don’t waste your time. Why call it mad max and have nothing more than a character thats vaguely mad max like involved? I read good reviews and believed them…never again. The glaring overriding truth about this movie is that it tricks people into believing they are going to see a movie and are instead watching ill conceived political thoughts. How about the Vuvalini too on their bikes with their sharpshooting skills? You’re right though that Furiosa ranks right up there with Ellen Ripley! Why can’t filmmakers produce more heroines of that caliber? Theron was neither token T&A nor a sexy girl power stereotype. She traded punches with Hardy as a true equal, where most heroines are content to throw some high kicks at a few minions before engaging in a real fight with a female villain. Ultimately, she is the kind of female protagonist other filmmakers need to shoot for: where audiences will see her kicking ass and not even take into account her gender – much like how male actions stars are treated. When I watch Die Hard, I’d never say, “Look at that male, Bruce Willis kicking ass!” I similarly watched Fury Road never thinking to myself, “Look at that female Charlize Theron kicking ass!” It was so refreshing! Most actions movies featuring female characters seem so intent on avoiding any male characters striking them in any way, amounting to some odd cinematic chivalry. Fury Road on the other hand let audiences know that Furiosa is a human first and foremost – not a delicate piece of fine china. I (mostly) agree with you.
It’s really amazing, that it needs a 70 year old Miller to show Hollywood, that it is possible to have beautiful females in a movie as humans. That’s not the only thing about this movie that is great, but it is something quite unique and missing (still missing! … what year is this!?!) If someone wants to argue about the “beautiful” part of it – that is what’s in that picture. I don’t really want to argue about it, because I think that in the context it kind of made sense (i don’t agree 100% with Miller) and also the way it is seems to me more significant. Because, there are some pictures that chose “ok, let’s not go for the superhot female lead but cast someone believable…” – but they do that on purpose. They shy away from the topic of sexualizing, by avoiding it altogether (and mostly fail nonetheless…)
And Miller did not do that. You can argue, that it was unnecessary – I might agree with you – but it kind of does tell us something about the world. He could have gone another route … who knows. The point is – he did not.
He went full sexy in the first scene you see those women and yet they are all women the whole time – they are not brainless smile monsters or fetish-backdrops. Some of them are weird, but they are believable – and who isn’t weird in that movie anyway.
I agree with what you say about Furiosa – because, with those “wives” and the “green land” women Miller brings up the topic of sex/gender – because with those groups it kind of matters. It says something about the world – even if maybe it’s not really told, but you feel that there is a story to it. But with Furiosa – it doesn’t matter and it’s not brought up. And that’s how it should be done. I fully agree with you there: It was Furiosa and Mad Max doing their thing and it didn’t matter the fraction of a second who has what youknowwhere.
That’s how it can be done and a lot of producers could maybe learn a lesson or two from this movie. Thank you. This is a very good review touching on all the important aspects of the film, including that it has something powerful and beautiful to say. That wasn’t an easy thing to do amidst the mind-boggling mayhem and Miller must have known that he needed the right perfumers to pull it off. Awesome review! Saw “Fury Road” and you nailed the “melt your face off” nature of the film. I was enthralled with the parallels between the people and the vehicles; there was this apocalypse-personified relationship that allowed the audience to see each character as an extension of their vehicle. Surviving the outback apocalypse is difficult for all (alive or metal). Count me in as stupid. It was a terrible movie. There was nothing to it. No character development. The plot was nothing to write home about. Too many unanswered questions. I am glad I saw it for free.  She’s lost credibility by agreeing with 98 percent of everyone in her field?  I suppose a person loses credibility by disagreeing with you. Enjoy your narcissism. Saw MM4 last night and it lives up to all expectations. i am a native of Melbourne, Australia where the original Mad Max was made and actually am related to the major investor on the first film. A great facet of the film is its Aussiness ,many of the cast are local stallwart actors who have been around for ever. Fang it is central to the dialogue. This was a term from70’s Melbourne which means drive faster. Great review. That “scene” is also the only time I really cringed in sheer horror.  Strangely enough, I didn’t find the film to be gruesomely violent – I think some of it was left to your imagination and not all was showed on film.  This movie is intense, and I feel like the R rating is warranted but, I think so much of the rating was earned purely based on what you THINK occurred than was actually transpired on film. Many of the sequences left me breathless because the energy and continuos chase scenes that go on for 10 minutes or more is just crazy – the energy and visuals were a lot to take in.  This film is groundbreaking on many levels – I left this film the same way I left the Matrix and 300 just in terms of how different it is, there will be a lot of copy cats. I thought the movie was amazing.  I never did see any of the originals, even though at the time I was a huge Mel Gibson fan.  I felt then I wasn’t interested in that type of movie.  I mainly wanted to see this one, only because of Tom Hardy.  Christy is right.  This movie is plain non stop.  I couldn’t catch my breath until the very end. I would love to see it again. Maybe if you would have saw the previous Mad Max films, you wouldn’t be so impressed with this one. I don’t see anything from watching the trailers that brings anything new that I hadn’t already seen. The box office numbers weren’t that impressive even with the hyped up positive critic reviews. How do they give positive reviews for a movie that doesn’t have much of a plot and hardly any dialogue? What? I’ve been a huge fan of the series for decades and I feel each one has been better than the last. Same goes for my other friends who love the series. I absolutely can not fathom how anyone could seriously like and understand the first 3 but not this one. Miller stays true to his vision, this review is spot-on. Thank you for singling out the scene within the lightning- and sand-storm. No other critic has mentioned it, that I’ve seen. This was, for me, hands down the most sublime bit of filmmaking in the whole movie. Jason, that whole section is just amazing, isn’t it? I forgot to mention how much I loved the way it went seamlessly from color to black and white and back again during that part, especially in Nux’s car. I seriously need to go see this movie again. Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts! I’m a big fan of the original trilogy, and what Miller has done with Fury Road is combined the crazy car chase action of The Road Warrior with the more introspective tone of Beyond Thunderdome. But he’s also upped the intensity all the way up to eleven. This is insanely brilliant filmaking which stands out like an oasis in the desert of dry, sterile and mundane action flicks that constitute the genre these days. Christy,
Thanks for writing this review. I missed your review on this movie on What The Flick. May be you, Ben, Matt, and Alonso can get together once again on What The Flick to review this movie as it is worth it. This movie was a cinematic rock music opera on steroids like it has never been done before. I would strongly recommend everyone to watch it on the biggest screen possible. After the end of the first major action sequence I even forgot I was in a movie theater or I was hyperventilating. One thing this movie does is it slows down the action sequences enough times to give you a stunning visual of the world it is set in and to not to give you battle fatigue and not bore you with mindless action like most movies does like the recent Furious 7 and Avengers. Can’t wait to see it again. Thanks, Krishna! I’d like to have a chance to review it, too. Had a sick kid at home last week and then caught whatever he had. But I’m sure Ben would enjoy talking about Mad Max, too, so maybe we can find a way to revisit it.",POSITIVE
"May 16, 2015",An astonishing full-throttle action movie that proves Miller may have taught those other directors everything they know - but he didn't teach them everything he knows.,POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” delivers on its muscular title: it’s a furious, insanely entertaining post-apocalyptic road picture, a three-decades-later franchise reboot that kicks the crap out of the summer’s inert-in-comparison Avengers and F&F installments. Miller, who just turned 70, puts on a clinic for aspiring action directors young enough to be his grandchildren. Returning to his Outback hero, played by Mel Gibson in “Mad Max” and its increasingly elaborate sequels, “Mad Max 2: Road Warrior” and “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” the Aussie writer-director applies his signature style (retro art design, manically over-the-top violence) to a brawny, yet surprisingly feminist, narrative that channels H. Rider Haggard, Conan the Barbarian and, for the starving throng cutaways, Cecil B. DeMille’s “The 10 Commandments.” And if that’s not enough for you, Miller also throws in Cirque du Soleil acrobatics — performed atop 20-foot poles that allow the bad guys to vault, mid-chase, from one speeding vehicle to another. Tom Hardy takes over for Gibson as the former cop who vows vengeance towards the roving psychos who killed his wife and son. By “Thunderdome” Max has put personal feelings aside to lead a band of children out of the wasteland, like a New Age Pied Piper. Hardy is a good choice for the role; he’s brutish and belligerent enough to have crawled out from under a rock. Unfortunately, in the opening scene, he doesn’t crawl fast enough. He is snared by a rasping, white-haired warlord/deity (Hugh Keays-Byrne) whose rheumy eyes stare from behind a grotesque oxygen mask. Max is taken to a fortress city, where he’s branded and bled, to transfuse the leader’s “war boys.” The Citadel, as it’s called, is part slave camp, part Stone Age Motor City. Water is hoarded but gas ‒ or “guzzle-line” ‒ is prized above all else because with fuel comes power. That is, until one-armed driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron) does a runner and, instead of taking her umpteen-wheel “war rig” to Gastown for a refill, heads to the mythical, matriarchal Green Place. Hiding in the tanker are five of the warlord’s child brides, one of whom is very pregnant. In hot pursuit, through sandstorm, quagmire and canyon ambush, are the ruler and his mob. So much for story. Still, you’d be amazed by all the narrative twists and turns (including a budding romance) that Miller manages to pack into what is essentially an exhilarating two-hour chase. In terms of pure kinetic energy, you’d have to go back to Spielberg’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and, before that, maybe Buster Keaton’s “The General” to find its equal. This being a George Miller film the violence is at once horrifying, anarchic and funny, like a Roadrunner cartoon. We get hand-to-hand combat in, under and on top of the escaping truck; we get exploding spears and arrows, harpoon plows, flamethrower guitar, porcupine pursuit vehicles, bodies collecting like moths on grilles … even a supercharger gas-spitting contest. And the amazing thing is, it’s done with such style and attention to detail that it doesn’t seem monotonous. (The blaring, cacophonous score by Junkie XL certainly helps here.) Just when you think Miller has used up his bag of tricks, he pulls out something new ‒ like a just-blinded scavenger sounding a war whoop, then continuing to blast away in the dark. How can you not appreciate such commitment to old-fashioned Saturday matinee villainy?",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Mad Max, director George Miller’s first feature film and the then 23-year-old Mel Gibson’s second, premiered in North America in February 1980. I was 17 years old, crazy about cars and revenge movies, and generally ripe for the picking. I saw each Mad Max movie at the time of its respective North American release and relished them all. Yet I can say that the first achievement of Mad Max: Fury Road is that, much like its titular hero, it stands alone. In fact, Mad Max: Fury Road is a good movie on its own terms, without reference to any other films, including the three I just mentioned – something notable in a motion picture universe that believes in the tent-pole-based feeder system, where the summer blockbuster is little more than an appetizer for the fall release of a “companion film,” itself a filler in preparation for the Christmas release of the third installment in a film series for which there is no foreseeable end. Even so, one should see the original Mad Max for a complete experience, while remaining aware that George Miller has two more Mad Max movies in the works. The second achievement of Mad Max: Fury Road is that it all but erases the need for the existence of the two films that precede it – Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome – both of which I still love because I haven’t made the mistake of actually watching them in the last 20 years. Wisely, Fury Road is neither sequel nor prequel to those iconic classics of the Australian Road Rage genre (see Not Quite Hollywood). Rather, this latest Mad Max is a replacement for those films, which, as it turns out, are better considered as placeholders waiting for the technology to catch up with the mad doctor’s concepts for the film he really wanted to make 30 years ago. That includes sticking star Tom Hardy on a flexible pole attached to a car, surrounded by guys on poles attached to other cars, all speeding along at 80 miles per hour while, very carefully, blowing things up all around them. And so Fury Road replaces Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome with one film that’s better than both of them put together. For all intents and purposes, the most recent Mad Max movie is also the amalgamation of its two predecessors, both visually and narratively. The Mad Max: Fury Road story, which involves scarcity of water and the sanctification of the mechanistic in a post-apocalyptic society, is certainly Max-ian, as one imagines the next films in the series will be as well. Imperator Furiosa, played by 39-year-old Charlize Theron with all the squinty-eyed determination of a young Clint Eastwood, owns Fury Road. And with one arm even. In other words, the girl in the movie does everything the boy in the movie does – but with one arm. It all begins when, while on a mission to find gas and ammunition, Furiosa decides to set herself and a handful of “slave maidens” free from the grip of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter in The Road Warrior). In the company of these beautiful, scantily clad young girls, she intends to make a run to the “green place” down the Fury Road, where nothing but treachery awaits. Anchored by Zoë Kravitz, who is becoming a welcome fixture in a number of films, the maidens include several young actresses who are not just lovely willows. The costumes they wear – little more than linen rags – are deliberate; they are meant to reflect the lascivious nature of the male. Yet the women are ever the road warriors themselves. Indeed, there is nothing pacifist or docile in Miller’s conception of the nature of the feminine, no matter what they look like or how they dress. The feminine will kick your ass in his dystopian world, but only for a fair and righteous cause: Freedom. Max Rockatansky, on the other hand, is a Man – without a cause except survival. He must choose to do the right thing while clinging to a remnant of himself from a time before men not unlike him destroyed everything. Cast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Nathan Jones, Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton, John Howard, Chris Patton, Richard Norton. An awards season favorite, Mad Max: Fury Road was the National Board of Review‘s Best Film; it won 10 Online Film Critics awards, including Best Film; and earned George Miller the Los Angeles Film Critics’ and the San Francisco Film Critics‘ Best Director award. Among its other wins and nominations, Mad Max: Fury Road topped the Best Stunt Ensemble category at the Screen Actors Guild Awards; it was shortlisted for Golden Globes in the Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director categories; and was the winner of nine Critics’ Choice Awards, including Best Director. I agree with your take on the gender-political symbolism and messages that Miller is conveying in this current Mad Max incarnation. It was lacking in the the first three, in which the masculine ideal still prevailed. I liked what Furiosa represents, as a gender counterforce to hyper masculinity and mechanism as represented by Joe.  And Fury Road certainly appeals, both visually and sonically. I saw it on a small screen, and I may take another look at it on the big screen, if it’s still around. However, Fury Road lacks the soulful arc of human loss, growth, and redemption that enriched The Road Warrior, and which made the latter a much better story than the former. I wish that Miller had imbued Furiosa more with this growthful progression. I’m fine with Max being a side-kick, a representative of what masculinity could be in Furiosa’s vision of a gender-balanced world. I just didn’t see Furiosa allow herself to expand her vision through Max’s example in the same way, for example, that Max was challenged to do so by the Gyro-Captain in The Road Warrior. You seem to be the only person in the universe unaware that The Road Warrior is by FAR the best of the original trilogy. The first Mad Max is basically an impatient and barely-necessary prelude to its perfection.",NEUTRAL
"May 15, 2015"," If you’ve relished the Mad Max series, your heart will leap in Mad Max: Fury Road the first time a “War Rig” made of leftover car and truck frames (human skulls affixed to the grille) or a turbo-charged, weaponized jeep swerves into the foreground and then suddenly roars off into the distance at a 45-degree angle while the camera continues on its scorching horizontal track. It’s a signature move by director George Miller, who gets scary-close (he’s fucking with us) and then says, “Eat my dust.” That dust tastes damn good. The majority of sequels have no reason for being apart from sequel money, but watching this fourth Mad Max, I could sense after roughly .0001 seconds that the 70-year-old Aussie director has been revving his engines for a long, long time, itching to get back to the blacktop and deliver even wilder automotive mayhem. After all, his last two films, Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2, centered on animated dancing penguins. He has some serious punk cred to restore. As you no doubt know from all the buzz, most critics think Miller has his cred back and then some, and they’ve given him a hero’s welcome. That gives me happy feet. The man made Max Max, The Road Warrior, Lorenzo’s Oil, and especially Babe: Pig in the City, which is like Charlotte’s Web retold by Dickens. (As a sequel, a box-office megabomb, and a film starring a pig, it has never gotten its due.) And Mad Max: Fury Road is certainly a blast and a half: You don’t just watch it, you rock out to it. How satisfied you’ll be after all the “wow!”s and “whew!”s will depend on how fine you are with a film that starts in the middle of the story and is basically a long chase. I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I’d adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle — not to mention the hilarious sexual politics. This is not, it should be said, a “reboot.” It’s the same Mad Max, post-Thunderdome, though now played by Tom Hardy, Mel Gibson having been judged too old and, more important, too genuinely mad to continue in the series that launched him to stardom 36 years ago. “My world is fire and blood,” says Max in voice-over, standing on a cliff, at one with the poisoned, postapocalyptic wasteland, his face hidden by a swarm of filthy hair. He stomps a big boot down on a scurrying lizard, snatches it up, and shoves it in his mouth: crunch. A blizzard of images evokes his inner life: bombs, bodies, the killing of his wife and child. The little girl calls to him in visions, which is strange because I remember his child being (a) a toddler and (b) a boy — but it was a long time and many bodies ago, and I might be wrong. Or maybe she’s not his child but a sort of emissary from the world of child spirits. Miller does a cool, stroboscopic fun-house effect with the little girl’s face — now flesh, now bone, now flesh again. Max wants like mad to be emotionally dead, numb to the carnage, but this moppet keeps jolting him back to life. The prologue in which Max is chased, captured, tattooed, branded, and put in a cage by raiders from a towering citadel is stunningly well done — particularly if you see the film in 3-D, which Miller uses like a macabre ringmaster, chucking arrows, bones, and parts of cars and bodies at you. This citadel — known far and wide as “the Citadel” — is presided over by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a sickeningly disfigured tyrant who stands high above his sheeple, promising them immortal life in the corridors of Valhalla while taunting them for their dependence. (He makes them beg for water.) Actually, everyone in the Citadel is sickeningly disfigured, emaciated, or studded with tumors from living in a radioactive landscape. But Immortan Joe takes the uranium cake. His flesh is mottled and covered with … yecchy stuff. In a steel mask notable for its Neanderthal set of choppers, he looks like a walking shrunken head topped with a white fright wig. This is all awesome, but I actually had a hard time getting past my awe and into the movie. Max isn’t just emotionally remote. He’s matted with dirt and kept in shadow. He’s chained to the front of a truck, everything below his eyes concealed by a steel face-cage. It’s mighty peculiar that here, as in The Dark Knight Rises, an actor with maybe the most fascinating visage in movies spends so much time behind a mask. You do get a lot from those eyes, which signal sadness and desperation. But the lips are where it’s at. They’re not just fashionably pillowy. They’re neo-Brando blubbery. They signal a swelling, an excess of emotion. They make you understand why the sounds that come out of his mouth are not always recognizable as English: What words could do justice to that much feeling? Casting Hardy as a man who shrouds his emotions and then covering his face is just … mad. Half an hour into Mad Max: Fury Road, I felt as if the nominal hero and I hadn’t been properly introduced. There is, of course, another hero. Heroine. The story proper kicks off when Immortan Joe’s top raider — Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron with a shaved head and one steel arm — sets off on a mission in a ramshackle War Rig before suddenly changing course. Joe checks on his breeders, but they’re gone. He screams to Heaven and orders up his army. The chase is on! Wait. Who is Furiosa? (She has barely said a word.) Who — or what — are the breeders? Who is the old woman shrieking at Immortan Joe? By now it’s clear that Miller’s strategy is to throw you into the tumultuous action and only later show you what’s at stake and why you should care. He thinks he’s cunningly withholding major details to keep you guessing, but there isn’t enough information to guess from before he, well, cuts to the chase. It’s backwards storytelling. Call me bourgeois, but I like a little more context for my mayhem, which is why I was more involved the second time, when I knew Furiosa, knew the breeders, and knew a bit more about why Max was on the front of a truck connected by an IV line to a skinny, bald guy with a white face and blackened eye sockets — who looks on first (and second) glance exactly like the hundred other skinny bald guys with white faces and blackened eye sockets but turns out to be a major character called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Mad Max: Fury Road wakes up, dramatically speaking, when Max and Furiosa meet, with (rousingly staged) fisticuffs at first but soon with more affection. Slightly more, anyway. Both their hearts having been tanned into leather by tragedy, they’re wary of connection, and Furiosa isn’t too trusting of men to begin with. It’s an extraordinary performance by Theron, who barely emotes but whose hardness is broken by glints of guilt and grief. It’s a mighty moment when, given terrible news, she staggers towards a titanic sand dune — it rises from nowhere, but nothing less would be worthy of her — and sinks to her knees in despair. At time like that, you might wish the film had been called Mad Maxine and had followed her from the start. It’s a woman-centric movie. Furiosa is fleeing across the vast wasteland in search of a matriarchal oasis she calls the “green place of many mothers.” And those breeders turn out to be a pampered harem of willowy model types (one brown-haired, one white-blonde, one redhead, one tall and black-haired, one smaller and more racially exotic) tasked with bearing Immortan Joe healthy children. Why a group of women so skinny they look as if they’d pitch off the side of a runway from lack of food should be so evolutionarily desirable in a time of sickness and starvation is a mystery — but not really much of one given the high level of wowza on display. Maybe the best visual joke in the movie is when Max staggers out of the desert and beholds them for the first time, shimmering in the heat, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton, and Riley Keough in skimpy, shorty, filmy dresses, hosing one another off in lyrical semi-slow motion. Mad Max: Fury Road is actually full of brilliant visual jokes, its desert a mythic stage for a punk-rococo circus of freaks. Behold the great pile of steering wheels on which the bald warriors descend, each man bearing his own away with reverence, as if it’s Excalibur. There’s a little tree in the middle of the desert that looks like it’s waiting for Vladimir and Estragon. The sight of a half dozen or so bongo drummers on the back of a War Rig is a marvelous setup for the revelation of the masked, heavy-metal rocker guitarist tied to the front, his instrument belching flames at moments of peak bloodlust. (The authors of Dogme 95 would be pleased: Miller has incorporated his musicians into the action.) In the climactic, high-speed road battle, warriors on long poles bend in and out of the frame throwing bombs and snatching up women: It’s as if you’d smoked weed and started watching an old Western and suddenly the stagecoach turned into a truck full of supermodels and the charging Injuns vampire acrobats. The knowledge that the vampire acrobats are mostly real stuntmen moving really, really fast instead of 1s and 0s in a computer adds exponentially to the WTF quotient. Miller clearly felt he needed to raise the stakes — to top himself — in Mad Max: Fury Road, and the road fury is, indeed, packed with multiple, crazy-funny variables. But at the end of the road I have to admit that I prefer the cleaner, sharper climax of The Road Warrior, which has no CGI whatsoever. You lose things in the clutter. That said, Miller has a trick up his sleeve that he didn’t three decades ago: grannies on motorcycles. It turns out that what compelled him to make this fourth Mad Max was the notion of a nurturing, matriarchal society far removed from the grotesque sadism of male-warrior culture. The gorgeously weatherbeaten old women who roar out of the wasteland to greet Furiosa and Company tolerate Max and show some affection for Nux — the bald, mortally ill, white-painted War Boy who longed to die in battle but was so lovably clumsy that he wound up on the side of the girls. But these tough old birds don’t want or need men, those disease-carrying homicidal brats who turned a world that was once a garden into a nuclear wasteland. Also, the old ladies gaze on those cute little models as if it would be really nice to curl up with them under the stars. It’s a wonderful joke that so-called men’s-rights groups have expressed outrage over Mad Max: Fury Road — so wonderful that I’d suspect the studio of cooking up the controversy by itself if I didn’t know that such morons actually exist. In their eyes, Miller has committed an unforgivable sin by appropriating their cultural space to promote femi-Nazism. He has made a movie with more amazing motorcycles than a biker’s rally and more high-decibel mash-ups than a monster truck event: FUCKIN’ A, AWWRIGHT! He has stuffed it with every shape and size of gun imaginable: BOO-YAH! Then he made a bald chick and a bunch of grannies more potent than an armada of male giants with mighty pecs — who turn out under all the war paint to be squalling babies with disease-ridden pencil dicks. The final battle takes place in a narrow passage through a canyon that looks suspiciously like a stand-in for the gates of Thermopylae. That’s when it really hits you: The Lesbos have taken Sparta!",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," It turns out , and it comes in the guise of George Miller. The 70-year-old Australian director’s absence from the action genre since the proliferation of computer graphics is entirely what helps make his comeback, Mad Max: Fury Road, so deliciously entertaining. There hasn’t been a film in this franchise for 30 years, and that entry, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, was a compromised production on which Miller only co-directed, but if the man’s list of credits since then reads more like the family catalog of sublime inflight entertainment, let it be said that he never really gave up the ghost of darkness that swallows the characters in his latest film. Both Babe: Pig in the City and the two Happy Feet films were full of cruelty and sadness and issues that one doesn’t often associate with modern day ‘kids flicks’. Nevertheless, Miller has come roaring back with the fourth entry in the franchise that he birthed in 1979 and Fury Road is the biggest one yet. Rather surprisingly handed a ginormous budget (these films were never particularly huge box office hits in America), Miller does what so few blockbuster filmmakers seem incapable of doing and actually letting audiences see the money. Despite being set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland (Namibia standing in for Australia after heavy rainfalls made the outback look too green!), every frame feels rich and decadent, full of imagination-stretching images that feel tangible. Miller’s insistence on practical stunt-work, effects, and sets where possible is plain to see as each rough-and-ready action scene full of hurtling, exploding, revved-up automobiles smash and crash into one another at breakneck speed and they were really tumbling around axis-over-hood in the desert sand. He allows the camera to follow the action in a way that only James Cameron can truly rival. The editing is similarly strong, with the action sequences, each more outlandishly devilish as the last, finding a riveting rhythm amidst the mayhem that makes the destruction easy to comprehend and follow.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Let it roll over you like heavy surf, like encroaching thunder. Let it roll over you like the wheels of an armor-plated tanker truck full of women fleeing sexual slavery. Because that’s what Mad Max: Fury Road is built to do. It’s been 30 years since director George Miller (or anyone else) made a Mad Max movie, and it was easy to view this new sequel/reboot/whatever with a certain amount of drilling-an-old-well skepticism. But skepticism burns away like vapor in the heat of the blazing, arid dystopia Miller has created. Fury Road is an A-plus B-movie, an action flick so vivid and visceral, so striking in conception and extraordinary in execution, that it comes almost as a revelation. Max Rockatansky—played by Mel Gibson in the original trilogy and by Tom Hardy here—is mad. He’s mad that the world collapsed, that thermonuclear conflict led to a bitter Darwinian struggle for scraps and water amid the post-apocalyptic landscape. (The very first scene of the movie finds him stomping a gecko flat, then eating it.) But mostly he’s mad because he was unable to save his wife and daughter from death at the hands of roving marauders. (Also, his dog, way back when, although that goes unmentioned in this telling.) Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is—you guessed it—furious. An important lieutenant in the army of brutal warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), she is nonetheless furious that she was long ago plucked from her home to serve. But she’s more furious still at Joe’s enslavement of his “breeders,” fertile women treated as sexual chattel to bear his babies. So Furiosa steals a heavy “war rig” with five such women stowed aboard, and begins her trek across a seemingly endless desert. When Immortan Joe assembles his own vehicular posse to hunt her down, Max, a captive, is brought along as a hood ornament and human “blood bag”—that is, an as-needed intravenous plasma transfusion for Joe’s ghostly “War Boys.” Max escapes, joins Furiosa on her odyssey toward a better future ... And that’s pretty much the movie. Fury Road is a remarkably lean film, uncluttered by the discursive backstories, subplots, and hand-wringing moral quandaries that bring so many contemporary action movies to a grinding halt. Dialogue is scant, and exposition all but non-existent. There are good guys (most of them technically gals) and bad guys (pretty much all of them physically repellent in one manner or another). The bad guys chase the good guys, occasionally catching up with them in time to initiate a set piece of delirious automotive destruction. It’s a plot almost as linear as Max and Furiosa’s journey across the sands. If the narrative is simple, however, the costume and production design are magnificently baroque: the retro-futurist vehicles, emblazoned with skulls and tricked-out with spikes or tank treads or cannons. The toothy, death-mask respirator worn by Immortan Joe (partly so we don’t recognize Keays-Byrne as the same actor who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max). The mascara’d, shave-pated War Boys, huffing chrome spray paint with glee. The creepy stilt-folk who wander silently through a fetid swamp. There are cars that bristle like hedgehogs and bandits who resemble Tusken Raiders, dive-bombing motorcyclists and chainsaw-wielding attackers who swoop down, Cirque de Soleil-like, on the tips of flexible poles. The techno-primitivism is all of a piece: This is a world made up entirely of gears and chains and internal combustion engines. Of course a war party as rock-operatic as Immortan Joe’s needs its own soundtrack, and “Ride of the Valkyries” is not going to cut it here. Enter the Doof Wagon, a monstrous heavy-metal amplifier on wheels—horns, speakers, kettledrums worthy of the Blue Man Group—and its frontman, the Coma-Doof Warrior, who hangs from strings like a marionette, wielding a two-headed guitar-cum-flamethrower. (Sign me up for the Coma-Doof spinoff.) This all no doubt sounds tremendously silly, but Miller deploys his playthings with such visual virtuosity and outright ferocity that Fury Road never plays like a joke, inside or otherwise. The picture was shot by the Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient), who came out of retirement for the project, and his eye for quality shows. The action sequences are mesmerizingly choreographed and feature blessedly little overt CGI. (This is the rare movie that is genuinely worth seeing in 3D.) The reliance on stunts and practical effects helps contribute to Fury Road’s throwback-y appeal: At times the movie feels almost like a tone poem to early-’80s excess, a cross between a monster-truck rally and a Plasmatics concert. Neither Hardy nor Theron (nor anyone else in the film) delivers a particularly strong performance. But they look their parts, and that’s ultimately more important. This is not what anyone would plausibly describe as an actor’s film. (For that, try Tom Hardy’s opposite-end-of-the-spectrum vehicular foray, last year’s understatedly tremendous Locke.) There are also a few missteps along the way—Max’s visions of his dead daughter are a rare unnecessary flourish—and 20 minutes might have been usefully shaved from the two-hour running time. But Mad Max: Fury Road is that rarest of indulgences, a blockbuster-season release that fully delivers on its promise. This is vital action filmmaking, a wash of sensation almost primal in its intensity and utterly devoid of the mopey self-seriousness that is so much in vogue these days. May you stay mad forever, Max.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015",If you're up for the ride you'll be rewarded with the most senses- and (common) sense-shattering action spectacle in decades.,POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Mass, unanimous box-office and critical-ink embrace to the contrary, Mad Max: Fury Road is among the worst, most insulting of recent films though, unfortunately, not unrepresentative of what fans want. Hype and groupthink lead public sheep to water, not to think but to drink as a herd and pony up. Menckens misquoted estimate still holds. Plot, development, dialogue, intelligence, subtlety, suspense, wit, chemistry and logic get tossed out the window as screen irrelevant in Australian George Millers return after thirty years for a fourth milking of the franchise. What remains is two hours on the nose of visuals, specifically of car chases and crashes, flat uninvolving goodies fighting off nasties in heavy metal studs and duds, where tired storyline is no more than an excuse for continuous noise beyond thunder and kinky violence in the Namibian desert. Co-producer Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris thin script is not necessary for this spectacle which panders to current debased taste in viewing. Just as fourth century Coliseum imperial panem et circenses grew and grew to a reported five thousand pairs of arena combatants, so, too, is always more excess ratcheted up to attract jaded moviegoers. Such stuff is as much cause as effect of dumbing down. I have long held the opinion that the amount of noise anyone can bear undisturbed stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity and may therefore be regarded as a pretty fair measure of it.",NEGATIVE

"May 15, 2015"," If Australian director George Miller never did anything else, he’d forever be remembered as the man who gave the world the post-apocalyptic road-thrills drama Mad Max. Miller’s movie, in 1979, was a low-budget landmark of gonzo filmmaking that became an action-adventure icon, spawning two sequels, both starring Mel Gibson and both directed by Miller. Now Miller—who went on to produce, write and/or direct other acclaimed films, including Dead Calm, Lorenzo’s Oil, Happy Feet and Babe—has returned to where he started, and this explosively revved-up reboot, epic in every sense of the word, may become the crowning achievement of his already impressive career. It’s big, bold and brash and makes the loudest bang, by a long shot, of any movie this year so far—if not any movie of any recent year. It’s grotesque and gorgeous and glorious all at once, both brutal and beautiful, a thing of cinematic wonder and wizardry, a circus of eye-popping, old-school stunt work, and a crazy orchestration of such sheer, all-out gusto, spunk, energy, imagination and nerve, it makes most other blockbusters, superhero sagas and special-effect blowouts look like they were made with doodles, doodads and trinkets from a toy box. Miller’s new Max grabs you from the first scene and never lets go as it establishes its central character, its parched desert setting and its harsh parameters. “My name is Max,” intones the figure we first see onscreen snatching a lizard from his boot—then popping it into his mouth and eating it. “A man reduced to a single instinct: survival.” And then, BAM—Max (Tom Hardy) is off and running—and so are we—on a wild, wild chase across a bleak wasteland of sand, mud and rock, pursued by a banshee-like posse of freakish “war boy” cultists, and thrown by dire circumstance into the company of a ferocious, one-armed defector (Charlize Theron) and her precious cargo: the four young wives of the cult’s terrifying leader, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also appeared in the original Max). Miller stages his story (written with collaborators Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris)—a ripping fable about a small group of people looking for redemption in a ruined, bizarr-o world of fire, water, gasoline and blood—with constant movement. His cameras, like his characters, almost never pause; they’re always sweeping, swooping, panning, scanning or tracking, adding to the persistent, insistent sensation of motion and danger, of never feeling like it’s safe enough to slow down. The automotive stunts, chase scenes and fights are so extraordinarily, intensely over-the-top, they become things of art—manic, mad-hatter masterworks of coordination as men scamper over, under, through, in and out of all kinds of cars, trucks and monstrous hybrid vehicles as they roar along at great speeds, often colliding, frequently exploding—and, in one absolutely stupendous sequence, being sucked up into a sand cyclone. Harding is terrific, Theron is even better, and Miller, well, this time he’s outdone even himself. Mad Max: Fury Road isn’t just the movie to see—it’s the movie so “max” you’ll need to see it more than once to marvel in all it is, all it does, and just how much it blows almost everything else away.",POSITIVE

"May 15, 2015"," CHICAGO – It’s “the greatest action movie ever made,” so says the television commercials (which means it’s true). And it’s buoyed by other quotables galore including “what a lovely day!,” “from mastermind George Miller,” “pulse pounding,” “heart wrenching” and “teeth grinding”. While these words are actually true, though, the film doesn’t need them to sell it. Though a cinematic “thrill ride” is often marketing speak – sometimes rightfully earned and oftentimes overhyped – this $150 million film sells itself because it really is exactly that. Gritty, dirty, mad and fun as hell, you can’t get much more of a thrill ride than “Mad Max: Fury Road”. And there’s no other filmmaker for the job than George Miller yet again, who not only proves he’s still got it but reminds us that he’s more than just the “Mad Max” mastermind. He’s also the creator of the post-apocalyptic action genre and this is why – even decades later – other followers just look like wannabes. Anchored by Max Rockatansky’s line “my world is reduced to a single instinct: survive!” and the initial image of him eating a living lizard because – well, why not? – Tom Hardy’s metal-faced return as Bane (I mean, Mad Max) isn’t even the reason this film succeeds as one of the best and most memorable of 2015 so far. Nor is it the kickass performance by Charlize Theron as the one-handed Imperator Furiosa – a lone ranger who shows us the unstoppable force of teaming up with the rogue Mad Max. And it’s not even our wonderfully vicious villain Immortan Joe – played by the 68-year-old Hugh Keays-Byrne – who, by the way, played the smaller role of Toecutter way back in George Miller’s “Mad Max” in 1979. Nor is it the delightfully desperate and even touching role by Nicholas Hoult as Nux, who all along desires to die an honorable death and rise above to a place much more like nirvana. The star of this film is the post-apocalyptic, middle-of-nowhere wasteland (filmed in the Namid Desert in Namibia, Australia, etc.) that George Miller brings to life. You’re sucked in from the second the fast-action film starts and given a few minutes of dramatic release to breathe during the film, but for the most part this no-holds-barred, anything-goes world of martial law is relentlessly entertaining. It’s the dirt, the gasoline, the metal, the weapons, the fire and – as important as the visual eyegasm of this environment – the sound. With the environment as the star of this film more so than any of the crazy characters within it, the sound is an equal co-star. This film’s memorable, bass-heavy, constantly rumbly music comes from Junkie XL (born as Tom Holkenborg), who has composed for “Resident Evil,” “The Dark Knight Rises,” “Man of Steel” and all three “Madagascar” movies (ha!). With so many films coming out so often, you must pick and choose. Some films you can skip entirely while others you can wait until they come home. But your first mistake would be not seeing this movie at all. Your second mistake would be seeing it at home. I don’t care how many bones you spent on your fancy home theatre. If you’re not seeing this film in a real movie theatre with much larger speakers than you can fit in your house, you’re not seeing “Mad Max: Fury Road”. While this film has rightfully earned all of its praise and its expensive advertising campaign is making it impossible for you to miss it, there is a blurry world to consider when you think about its story. Its environment is much better fleshed out than its plot line, which really could have been this one or any one of George Miller’s previous “Mad Max” stories including “Mad Max” in 1979, “Mad Max 2” (AKA “The Road Warrior”) in 1981 and “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” in 1985. Since his leading role as Mad Max by the then-little-known Mel Gibson in 1979, 1981 and 1985 and with Tina Turner joining the franchise in 1985, 2015’s version can be explained like this: “An evil warlord controls a pocket of desert people who never shower. The rest of Earth is too expensive to film, so it’s easier to say they’re just all dead.” Wait, there is more. “All the while, a guy named Bane – sorry, I mean Mad Max again – takes a chapter from ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and has the same voice and tortured upbringing. Max bumps into a desert renegade who lost her hand and we don’t know how and we don’t care. She’s pissed too – like everyone is because apparently no one takes Xanax or Zoloft – and her reason for being isn’t to tell us how she lost her hand but to liberate a bunch of desert babes (including Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton, Riley Keough and the already preggers Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who aren’t nearly as ugly as everyone else. Why? Because she’s perturbed that our villain just wants to use them to make his babies.” So yeah, this isn’t an Oscar-winning script from George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It has taken 30 years for George Miller to return to his “Mad Max” roots, but thankfully he’s back and better than ever. While his stints with the animated animals “Babe: Pig in the City” (1998), “Happy Feet” (2006) and “Happy Feet Two” (2011) were certainly cute, this is the epitome of how to have fun at a movie and this is what a reboot should really be. “Mad Max: Fury Road” stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton, Nathan Jones and Josh Helman from writer and director George Miller and writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. The film is rated “R” for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images. It has a running time of 120 minutes and opened on May 15, 2015. CHICAGO – Patrick McDonald of HollywoodChicago.com appears on “The Morning Mess” with Dan Baker on WBGR-FM (Monroe, Wisconsin) on March 21st, 2024, reviewing the new streaming series “Manhunt” – based on the bestseller by James L.

"May 15, 2015"," AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  ""Mad Max,"" ""Road Warrior,"" ""Beyond Thunderdome."" With those three pictures, filmmaker George Miller gave moviegoers in the 1980s a glimpse of a post-apocalyptic future - bone dry, violent and populated by biker gangs gone ballistic. Then he spent 30 years making really sweet movies, like ""Babe: Pig In The City"" and ""Happy Feet."" Well, now Miller has returned to his roots with a reboot, ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""

"May 15, 2015","  Mad Max: Fury Road brings us back to filmmaker George Miller's vision of a post-apocalyptic world, where we once again find former cop/drifter Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) driving through the wasteland, trying to stay one gear-shift ahead of vehicular marauders on his tail. That fight for survival takes a bad turn when Max is captured by ""The Wild Boys,"" a fanatical cult led by Immortan Joe, a ruthless (and hideous) warlord who controls the water supply - and therefore, the people.   Max's fate soon collides with that of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's prized lieutenants and driver of the fearsome ""war rig."" As yet another slave of Joe's cruel rule, Furiosa executes a brazen plan to smuggle Joe's harem of girls (""The Five Wives"") out of captivity, and hopefully to the freedom of her true homeland. Joe and his War Boys set off in pursuit of Furiosa (with Max in tow), but as the ""lovely day"" grinds on, and pushes them all across the scathing harshness of Fury Road, Max slowly recognizes that Furiosa and her crew are a cause worth fighting for - while the girls discover a lethal (and insane) ally in Mad Max.   Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully strange, violent and thrilling cinematic composition that proves George Miller is a more brilliant maestro than ever. It firmly swats down the stigma that soft reboots or long-coming sequels are an inherently bad idea, and proves what can happen when old films are updated in a creatively authentic way.   On a directorial level, Fury Road unfolds like a visually stunning and well-crafted cinematic short story - one where every image and sequence is at once iconographic in composition, but also utilitarian in its job of conveying a larger story beyond the image itself. That level of visual sophistication gets superimposed onto the uniquely pulpy sci-fi world that Miller created in the original Mad Max trilogy; a world so fully imagined and realized that it is able to transcend B-movie kitsch to become something more artful.   The opening act of the film is a perfect example: Miller deftly and beautifully establishes much of the world, supporting characters, and story arc using well-selected images and very little dialogue, while we simultaneously reconnect with Max through voice-over monologue that (like the film itself) teeters the line between poetry and camp, but somehow works in the context of this dystopian opera. Miller has also constructed one of the most gender irrelevant action films, ever. When the bullets start flying and the cars crashing, the girls mix it up as bloody and violently as any of the boys, and even the ""Five Wives"" are developed well enough to have interesting individual personalities, rather than being simple 'damsel in distress' MacGuffins.   On the action front, Fury Road is a wonderfully refreshing throwback to the days of practical filmmaking and stunt work, which action fans will no doubt appreciate. The vehicles, characters, and sets are mostly tangible and real, and the few CGI-heavy sequences (like the desert storm) are visually stunning and well-executed (especially in immersive 3D). The stunt choreography is truly top-notch, and combined with Miller's directorial eye - and some gorgeous cinematography from Oscar-winner John Seale (The English Patient) - Fury Road's non-stop car chase is one of the most thrilling and exciting action movie experiences in years. The soundtrack by Junkie XL sets the rhythm and keeps the pulse of the film racing - as is humorously referenced in the film itself, by the colorful freaks who serve as musicians in Immortan Joe's war caravan.   Miller's script with original Mad Max actor Nick Lathouris and longtime storyboard artist Brendan McCarthy (TMNT, 1990) is not quite as tight as the visual composition of the film. That fact is denoted by the amount of episodic starts and stops in the story, which are clearly marked by the many fade outs and fade ins that Miller uses to break things up.   Somehow, within the restrictive space of a truck cabin - set within one long, frantic car chase - there is still an overabundance of characters and subplots, some of which never develop into anything all that necessary or relevant (ex: the Nux and Lady ""Capable"" romance). This slightly bloated narrative results in dragging the film out slightly past its welcome, whereas slimmer trimming would've kept things tighter. As previously stated, the dialogue (or monologues) in the film teeter on a line between campy and poetic, and don't always land on the right side of that line. But that's largely forgivable, since Miller's mad world is so convincingly established that deciphering slang or listening to/watching overly grandiose moments is still a kitschy sort of fun.   Tom Hardy builds on The Dark Knight Rises and Lawless to once again turn in some impressively memorable ""mush-mouth"" character acting. With a minimum of dialogue (mostly grunts and gestures), Hardy creates a Mad Max that is familiar but still all his own, balancing menace, madness, savagery, humor and deep-seeded pain and compassion all in one wild-eyed stare, and displaying some great action chops. It feels as though even with a new actor in the role, the legacy of Miller's previous trilogy is still alive in the character, which is a feat unto itself. But Max is not the real star of the film - rather he is the constant of what can now be considered an anthology of short stories about a dystopian world, featuring the Mad Max character.   In this particular chapter it is Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa who is the main protagonist, and Theron has never been more badass and shining in a lead role. Furiosa is strong, vulnerable, smart, compassionate, ruthlessly violent and disfiguredly beautiful, and Theron steers her perfectly through her character arc, which happens to be the most dramatic and dynamic arc in the whole movie. Theron and Hardy also play wonderfully off one another, building a convincing partnership through looks and gestures rather than dialogue; the pair also have one of the better fight sequences seen all year.   On the supporting front, actor Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: DoFP, Warm Bodies) continues to be a young standout performer, bringing depth and three-dimensionality to ""Nux,"" that ""What a lovely day!"" Wild Boy who starts out wanting the prize of taking Furiosa down, only to end up sympathizing with The Five Wives' plight. Miller manages to turn The Five Wives' model-esque looks on their head, transforming beauty into a source of danger and tragedy (rather than titillation) in the scorched earth, while also pulling some of the more interesting performances out of the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers 3), Zoë Kravitz (X-Men: First Class), Riley Keough (The Runaways), and Australian models-turned-actresses, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton.   The other supporting cast members are made up of fun figures that may spark some ""seen them somewhere"" memories. Villain Immortan Joe is actually Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played ""The Toe-Cutter"" in the original Mad Max. Nicholas Hoult's X-Men co-star Josh Helman (young William Stryker) plays Nux's vehicular wing-man, Slit; Australian strongman Nathan Jones (Troy, Conan the Barbarian) plays Joe's man-child son, Rictus Erecturs; while veteran Australian actors like Melissa Jaffer, Richard Carter and John Howard appear as various allies/lieutenants of both Furiosa and Immortan Joe.   In the end, Mad Max: Fury Road is a an action-movie classic, a ""must-see"" summer blockbuster, and one of few long-coming sequels/soft reboots that not only deserves to exist, but is blessedly welcome. Consider the Mad Max franchise to be thoroughly revitalized, and if this is the last film that seventy-year-old George Miller makes, he'd have the honor of going out on an extremely high note, having arguably completed the most solid quadrilogy of films ever made by a single director.   Mad Max: Fury Road is now playing in theaters. It is 120 minutes long and is Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images.

"May 15, 2015",Director George Miller wastes enough bombs and ammunition to win a small war but it's in a winning cause. This is a lot of fun and pure guilty post-apocalyptic pleasure.,POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has had a tough life. He survived the Apocalypse but lost his wife and child. Things get worse when he is captured by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an evil despot who uses Max as a unwilling universal, living donor being drained of his blood. He is saved from certain death when Joe’s trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) betrays her leader in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” If you loved the action-packed George Miller epic, “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981)”, then you are going to love the over-action-packed update from the 70-year old director.” The difference, sadly, is that Miller and his co-writers Brendan McCarthy decide to forgo developing a story to hang the copious and bombastic action on. Furiosa is sent on a mission to get the gasoline to fuel the bizarre war wagon concoctions that Miller and his design team imaginatively bring to life. The warrior lady has other plans, though, and diverges from course and takes her war rig and her hidden cargo of Immotan Joe’s beautiful breeding concubines. Joe and his army of battle vehicles take chase, with Max chained to the front of one machine. From here on, I think it is only about 15 minutes into the film, that non-stop chase begins and does not let up until near the end of “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The action sequence is remarkably staged and “Fury Road” is an amazing production feat on all levels. Tom Hardy as the strong-willed man of few words, Max, is first rate as the new road warrior. Charlize Theron is his equal as the smart, resourceful warrior lady, Furiosa. The two start off not trusting each other but they bond over their mutual mission to save the women and find a new life in the Green Place, a long ago memory for Furiosa. The bad guy characters lack the depth that Miller put into his great “Road Warrior” villains, The Humungus (Kjell Nilson) and his badass henchmen. Other characters are incidental to the new “Mad Max” and are mostly fodder to feed the non-stop running battle. For those who like high-voltage post-apocalyptic action flicks, especially those familiar with the old “Mad Max” movies, are going to love the latest reboot. Miller and company, literally, turn up the volume (Joe’s army travels with its own accompaniment – a massive drum platform with crazed guitarist) and crank up the action with hundreds, if not thousands, of explosions as Joe’s armies converge on our heroes. To me, though, the continuing chase with little or no break in the action begins to get monotonous as the film draws to its hopeful conclusion. If the $100000000 production gets the box office gold that the filmmakers expect to earn from this summer tent pole, we can expect more from the aging but plucky George Miller. Although more of the same, without bothering to actually have more than a shell of a story, seems to me to offer diminishing returns. Then again, maybe not, considering the propensity over the last decade to flood the multiplexes with franchise films. I like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” but walked out a bit disappointed – I wanted get my socks knocked off but they were still on my feet as I left the theater..",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015","Like Jurassic Park, The Dark Knight, and, yes, The Road Warrior before it, Mad Max: Fury Road sets a new gold standard for action cinema.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," There is a moment, in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” when Max (Tom Hardy) washes blood off his face. This is unsurprising, since he has just engaged in one of many fights, but two points are worthy of note. First, the blood is not his. Second, he washes it off not with water but with mother’s milk, siphoned from a gas tanker. And there, in one image, you have George Miller’s film—wild and unrelenting, but also possessed of the outlandish poetry, laced with hints of humor, that rises to the surface when the world is all churned up. The movie is set in the near future. There are no cities or civilizations left. The landscape is dying of thirst; water—known as Aqua Cola—is severely rationed; and other resources, notably gasoline, are hoarded and tussled over like scraps of food. Max is a survivor, like everyone else, and, as we join the stream of action, he is captured and hauled into servitude at the Citadel. Girded with towers of rock, this is the desert stronghold of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a monstrous figure who lords it over a swarm of ragged wretches. His toadlike skin is caged in a transparent breastplate, and he breathes through a mask that’s armed with yellowing horses’ teeth and fed by bellows that wheeze up and down on the back of his neck. Probably a charming fellow, once you get to know him. Max, being Max, tries to escape, only to be grabbed once more and strapped to the front of a vehicle, like a fender of flesh, with his sturdy features barred by a metal grille. Tom Hardy fans, who struggled so intently to understand him when he played Bane, in “The Dark Knight Rises,” may be less than thrilled to learn that their hero’s speech is yet again impeded. Just as you’re wondering if the poor guy will ever express himself freely, however, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a new acquaintance of Max’s, asks, “You want that thing off your face?” The day is saved, though it’s not as if he starts chatting away like Cary Grant in “His Girl Friday.” You could tattoo the entirety of Max’s dialogue onto his biceps. One of his longest lines is “Hope is a mistake.” Furiosa has a prosthetic arm, and her tendency to smear black grease across her brow may cause the fragrance honchos at Dior, where Theron is paid to spread the word about J’Adore, to reach for their atomizers. Furiosa is a driver, employed by Joe’s henchmen to transport precious fuel, who suddenly goes rogue, steering the War Rig, her vast and snarling truck, off course. A posse is dispatched to hunt her down. We soon discover her concealed cargo—the Wives, five young women who were imprisoned by Immortan Joe and doomed to bear his children. Our first glimpse of them bodes ill: limber beauties, draped in muslin underwear and hosing themselves down in the middle of nowhere. It’s like the start of a Playboy shoot. Yet the film not only recovers but winds up as a testament to female resilience, thanks to the Vuvalini—a small and leathery tribe of matriarchs, described by the film’s production designer as “lovely old bikie chicks.” Astride belching motorcycles, they hare up and down sand dunes, and accompany Max, Furiosa, and the Wives on the final leg of the plot. I have been looking forward to this movie for months, trying not to watch the trailers more than twice a day, but, fool that I am, I hadn’t foreseen its feminist ambitions—crystallized in the sight of one Wife, heavily pregnant, flinging wide the door of the War Rig and flaunting her belly, like a bronze shield, at her enraged pursuers. (The Wives were coached in preparation for the film by Eve Ensler, the author of “The Vagina Monologues.” This must be a first. Gloria Steinem was never hired as a consultant on “The Dirty Dozen.”) Later comes a droll sequence with a sniper’s rifle, as our hero aims at a searchlight, in the distant gloom, but misses. Only one bullet remains. Furiosa takes the gun and hits the target, using Max’s shoulder as a rest. The tough guy is nothing but a cushion. We have met Max before. He first appeared in “Mad Max” (1979), as a youthful cop bent on revenge after a murderous attack on his wife and child. His outfit, like his automobile, was of battered black. He returned, in similar guise, in “The Road Warrior” (1981) and “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome” (1985), opposite a resplendent Tina Turner. All three films were directed by George Miller (he had a co-director on the third), and they have acquired the burnish of a cult. Beware of cult flicks, though, whose reputation sits uneasily on little more than a look; how often did the restive kids who papered their walls with stills of “Easy Rider,” or of Brando in “The Wild One,” sit through the actual movie? The earlier “Mad Max” films, it pains me to report, have not weathered well; they seem overacted and overscored, chuckling at nastiness, and held together mainly by the presence of Mel Gibson in the title role. You watched him as you would a live grenade. The good news is that “Mad Max: Fury Road” exists in a different league. It lies way, way beyond Thunderdome, and marks one of the few occasions on which a late sequel outdoes what came before. Is it a sequel, though? There are flashbacks to Max’s past, but they are over in seconds, and you can certainly relish the new film, in all its lunatic majesty, without being versed in Maxist dialectics. Indeed, it exults in a proud indifference to backstory. Furiosa mentions her origins, explaining that she was snatched away from “a green place,” but that’s it. As for Max, Hardy is more earthed than Gibson, and less wired—indeed, less mad, propelled not by the engine of wrath but by a solid response to the madness that engulfs the characters like a sandstorm. Max’s deeds rarely strike us as gratuitous. Instead, they seem resignedly brutal, as if there were no other way to live. Whether his deepest desire is for liberty, or simply for a dour solitude, I can’t decide, but I loved the coolness with which, having taken command in battle, he melts away, once it’s over, into the shifting throng. That wonderful image allows Miller to draw back and survey the scene from on high. Such is the root of his near-mystical prestige as a creator of action films: a bright, instinctive sense of when and where to cut from the telling detail to the wider view, and back again. Those instincts were there in the first “Mad Max,” which, for all its cheapness, picked up rhythm whenever it hit the highway, and they are resurgent here. They connect Miller not so much to the panicky despots of the modern blockbuster, like Michael Bay, as to directors of Hollywood musicals, and to the early choreographers of the chase, in the wordless days when pictures lived by motion alone. In “Mad Max: Fury Road,” the Polecats—aggressors who arc from one vehicle to another, in mid-race, on the end of long stakes—are the descendants of Buster Keaton, who, in “Three Ages,” fell from a roof through three awnings and clutched at a drainpipe, which swung him out into the void and back through an open window. Some things have changed. Miller’s debt to silent cinema is slightly quelled, in the new film, by the Doof Warrior, who hangs from the front of a truck and thrashes out power chords on his twin-necked guitar, which also acts as a flamethrower. Also, Keaton meant nobody harm, whereas the Polecats are bent on little else, as are the War Boys, the Bullet Farmer, Rictus Erectus, and Slit—unfriendly types, released from the strange laboratory of Miller’s brain. One of the Wives is called Toast the Knowing, and Nicholas Hoult has a blast as a renegade named Nux, who spray-paints his lips silver to supercharge the mood. His dream is to die with honor, “shiny and chrome,” like an exploding machine. All this is such fun, and it teeters so close to insanity, with a hundred and fifty vehicles at Miller’s disposal, and with a pack of cameras sent into the fracas like baying hounds on a scent, that you come out asking, Why is this movie not an unholy mess?

"May 15, 2015","A mindless, expensive B-movie that's more exhausting, tedious and nauseating than exhilarating.",NEUTRAL
"May 15, 2015"," J.G. Ballard — who knew a thing or two about speed, wastelands, the human death drive, and the mortification of flesh by flying auto parts — once described 1981’s The Road Warrior, the second of George Miller’s Mad Max movies, as “punk’s Sistine Chapel.” Ballard was not as big a fan of 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. But even Michelangelo wasn’t immune to the impulse to sequelize, returning to the Apostolic Palace after nearly 25 years (and the Sack of Rome) to paint The Last Judgment above the chapel’s altar. It features a buff, wrathful Jesus, tons of un-fig-leafed full-frontal nudity, chaotic composition that rejected all notions of universal hierarchy, two-fisted angels clobbering wretched sinners, demons dragging the condemned down into hellfire, a likeness of one of Michelangelo’s critics with a snake’s jaws clamped on his nuts, and a cameo by the artist himself as a face on some flayed skin. The lesson here: If you have to come back, it’s best to come back hard-core. We live in times of lowered expectation, blockbuster-wise; we pretend that not-insulting relaunches of old IP are worthy and that the rare worthy ones are also interesting and necessary. We’re lying to ourselves, but we do it because there’s almost nothing else out there. Fifteen years in the making and right on time, Mad Max: Fury Road is something else. A respectful and respectable update of the Mad Max mythos would probably still have been received as a much-needed corrective to the unbearable lightness of superhero movies, the way even perfectly OK Fast & Furious sequels usually are. Instead, Miller (who cowrote the script with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) spends two nitro-boosted hours gleefully one-upping and two-upping and 10-upping the iconic mayhem of the previous Mad Max films — and uses all of that hyperkinetic spectacle to deliver a surprising moral payload. When I finally got the chance to take a breath and a few notes after the first big demolition-derby set piece — this movie doesn’t slow down, it only relents — I thought of the cartoonist James Kochalka saying Frank Miller’s late-career masterpiece Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again read like the work “of a teenager who knows in his heart that he’s BETTER than Frank Miller, and he’s ready to take the world by storm.” But let’s leave superheroes out of this, at least for a minute. I walked out of this movie feeling the way I imagine poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti1 did when he flipped his Fiat into a ditch in 1908 and emerged with the idea for “The Futurist Manifesto”: “When I came up — torn, filthy, and stinking — from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart!” After the briefest of prologues — society’s death throes as montage of heck, complete with what sounds like Ronald Reagan muttering, “Mankind has gone rogue” — we rejoin the fallen world already in progress. The former Max Rockatansky has grown an Old Testament beard and fled to the desert to be alone with his Thunderdome flashbacks and live on two-headed-lizard meat — until he’s literally pulled back into action by a gang of War Boys, paint-huffing, chalk-skinned automotive death-cultist mutants who take Max hostage and begin siphoning his “high-octane crazy blood” into their own sickly veins. Due to Mel Gibson’s age/schedule/lingering radioactivity, Max is played this time by Tom Hardy, who lacks his predecessor’s aura of inexpressible guilt and grief, but does nail the deadness of Gibson’s pan. Fans of the diverse and unique native accents of Tomhardia will be pleased to learn that Hardy’s interpretation of Australian involves grumbling like a lion who’s had James Mason for breakfast and Vin Diesel for lunch. His Steve McQueenish Max is laconic and tough, but not particularly vivid, which might have been an issue if the movie hadn’t provided him with a compelling coprotagonist in Imperator Furiosa, a hardened and haunted bionic-woman road warrior, played by Charlize Theron with grief and guilt to spare. Miller has lately been fond of quoting Hitchcock’s desire to make films so visual the Japanese could enjoy them without reading the subtitles; there’s enough going on in Theron’s raccoon eyes that even sound feels superfluous. Furiosa drives a huge and hilariously phallic “war rig” for Immortan Joe, the fiendish albino baron of a water-starved desert city that suggests Frank Herbert’s Dune as reimagined by Buckethead. (The actor under Joe’s sinister respirator is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who made Max a widower as the biker-gang leader Toecutter in the 1979 original.) When she makes off with the rig during a supply run and heads for the hills, Joe and his War Boys follow — because Furiosa has also liberated five young women from Joe’s harem of “wives,” including the pregnant Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Miller finds a clever, Road Warrior–inspired way to insert Max into the ensuing chase scene, which is every bit as bananas as you’ve heard — teenage kamikazes driving the armored jalopies of Ed Roth’s fever dreams, porcupine death-buggies straight out of The Cars That Ate Paris, and a fiery sandstorm that shows up in the background of one shot like a photobombing extra before filling up the screen in the next like the pissed-off face of God. Edited with neck-snap precision by Margaret Sixel, this whole sequence is breathtaking; I was sure it was the year’s best action scene until I saw the one in the third act, which is a Raiders of the Lost Ark–grade master class in escalating complication. (Two words: Pole Boys. Trust me on this.) A movie that simply did these things this well would have felt like a gift. But Fury Road aims to justify its existence by other means. The key moment comes in the calm after the storm. Max drags himself across the desert, still connected by a length of chain and a blood-transfusion tube to an unconscious War Boy and his car door. He spots the wives, bathing in radiator water like nymphs at a pond while taking bolt cutters to their chastity belts. Half-wrapped in diaphanous linen, they resemble America’s Next Top Model competitors who’ve somehow escaped Tyra’s clutches before the makeover episode. You can read the movie’s politics loud and clear in the fight scene that follows, in which Max’s literal blood tie to a foot soldier of the phallocracy becomes both action beat and telling metaphor. Miller came close to shooting a Gibson-led version of Fury Road back in 2001 before 9/11 and the fall of the dollar torpedoed his budget; presumably, he can’t have anticipated Gamergate making representational parity and misogyny into third-rail issues within the core audience for postapocalyptic action movies any more than he saw Boko Haram coming. But the “men’s rights” crusaders now gnawing their fedora brims in righteous apoplexy over the thought of Mad Max’s manly iconography being perverted to serve a misandrist agenda aren’t actually imagining things. This is an unambiguously and unapologetically feminist, Bechdel test–passing sci-fi blockbuster that begins, I’ll say again, with Charlize Theron commandeering an 18-wheeled battle-dong in order to free some sex slaves and ends by explicitly linking the liberation of humanity in general to the dismantling (and, in some cases, dismemberment) of the patriarchy. It asks, “Who killed the world?” and doesn’t front like there’s more than one answer. Its most romantic moment involves a woman using a man to steady her rifle. I only wish Miller had given each of the five wives story beats as amazing as their names; the mere fact that Zoe Kravitz’s character is a person called “Toast the Knowing” is the first thing in the entire history of movies that’s made me want to read a prequel in graphic-novel form. It’s worth pointing out that this series has never just been about vehicular manslaughter in a world driven mad by its thirst for gazz-o-lean or, in Fury Road’s case, water. All four movies absolutely belong in the Postapocalyptic Dude-Competence Fantasy section of the video store. But right below that admittedly very skateable surface, they’re about a broken man who tries over and over to turn his back on what’s left of the world and instead keeps finding himself responsible to and for other people — a loner who’s never alone. Each of the four Max movies is a study of one of the major food groups of human interconnectedness. Mad Max is about husbands and wives. The Road Warrior is basically a Western, so it’s about individuals and communities. Thunderdome is about parents and children. And Fury Road is about women and men — about objectification and exploitation, the self-loathing at the root of misogyny, and the question of whether these patterns can ever be broken. “Where must we go,” a closing epigram asks, “we who wander this wasteland in search of our better selves?” And maybe I’m imagining some of this — but I didn’t imagine the part when Max literally washes away blood with mother’s milk. And if that’s not enough for you — or if it’s way too much — Fury Road is also one of the best action movies of the decade, a punk Last Judgment with manic invention and depraved wit on display in every frame: Immortan Joe’s Frankensteined Coupe de Ville. Joe’s idiot son Rictus, who’s essentially a Mad magazine caricature of the Rock. The door gunner who pops up periodically in the window of Furiosa’s war rig to bark inquiries like a short-order cook sticking his head out of a diner kitchen. The skull-faced Eddie the Head dude — “The Doof Warrior,” per IMDb — riding into battle suspended in front of a truckload of amps while wrestling malevolent riffage from a double-necked ax with attached flamethrower. Furiosa will end up being this movie’s lasting contribution to the canon and to cosplay. But the Doof Warrior? That guy is this movie’s soul.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Thirty years is a long time to wait for a sequel. If not for the passage of time, though, then George Miller’s career trajectory since 1985 may have initially been reason enough to regard the latest installment in the dystopian Mad Max series with caution. The new film stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky with Charlize Theron as his co-lead, a casting coup that earned goodwill from intrigued onlookers when first announced. When Miller showed San Diego Comic-Con attendees footage from the unfinished product in 2014, any and all initial doubt turned to buzzing fervor. Early apprehensions weren’t misguided. They were just misplaced. If it takes a movie three decades to galumph into theaters, the least you can hope for is that it ends up being good. Expecting more than just “good” feels like asking much, but Miller is clearly the generous type. Mad Max: Fury Road is better than just good. It’s “great,” perhaps even better, though piling on superlatives too quickly, too soon might do the film a disservice. If Miller had simply aimed just above the line of “serviceable,” he still might have sated his audience’s action cravings. But after maintaining a holding pattern for so long, “satisfactory” wouldn’t have passed muster. Miller knew it, too, so he decided to swing for the fences. Try naming a modern blockbuster that has as much chutzpah as Mad Max: Fury Road. You can’t, because there isn’t one. This is what happens when you lay out all your crazy on the screen at once: glorious, crackling entertainment. Mad Max: Fury Road occurs an unknown number of days after the last chronicle of Max’s life and times. He’s on the run, natch, and as the movie starts he’s captured by lunatics who drag him back to a desert canyon fortress and turn him into a living IV bag for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a soldier in the army of the wheezy, bigamist tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, returning to the series after playing the villain in the original film). Joe is a festering representation of patriarchy who hoards a limitless supply of water from his parched subjects and maintains a fully stocked personal harem. He’s a horrific antagonist for the ages. When one of his lieutenants, Furiosa (Theron), betrays him by liberating his trophy wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zöe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton), he and his fleet of tricked-out apocalypse-mobiles pursue them posthaste. By chance Furiosa and Max end up locking horns in the fracas, but they realize that each needs the other to stay alive. So they pile into her war rig with the emancipated girls and put pedal to the metal, with Joe’s legion of maniacs at their heels and Nux dangling to their tanker. There isn’t much setup here beyond that. Mad Max: Fury Road is just an explosive extended car chase, occasionally interrupted with interludes of economic character development and world-building. Every single dollar of Mad Max: Fury Road’s reported $150 million budget is in the frame at all times, but Miller is so unpretentious that you won’t catch the price tag. Real people cruise in real vehicles across real expanses of desert. When the film does lean on computers, it’s to fill in the margins or summon the occasional dust storm. Miller defines his aesthetic through physical texture, tells story through action, and shows no interest in the routine of contemporary Hollywood spectacle. He’s made a two-hour Star Wars cantina scene stuffed to the gunwales with insanity. Immortan Joe’s vanguard includes a car mounted with piles of speakers and a nutjob wielding a double-necked guitar that belches fire. It’s both the most and the least demented idea the movie has on tap. The film also stands alone, good news for anyone who hasn’t seen the first three movies. You can walk into the theater blind and everything that happens from start to finish will make sense. That’s Miller’s intention, of course, but kudos to the man for pulling it off with such unhinged aplomb, and for spending heaps of Warner Bros.’ money on what is essentially a feminist action movie. The marquee features Max’s name, but the film’s true hero is Furiosa, a freedom fighter battling against an oppressive male regime. Just when you think Mad Max: Fury Road is going to peg Max as the film’s savior, Max gives the credit to Furiosa. She’s the character driven by a purpose. He’s just a survivor. Hardy and Theron both lend muted gravitas to their roles—she has more spoken dialogue than him, if only just—and act through gesture and expression more than anything else. It’s clear, though, that this is her movie more than it is his, a huge accomplishment in light of the film’s intrinsic masculinity. Mad Max: Fury Road is an inclusive effort that invites us to join its heroes in breaking down gender dichotomies. Miller has made a phenomenal action film with a righteous cause, a movie that layers smart commentary atop jaw-dropping set pieces. May he ride eternal, shiny and chrome.

"May 15, 2015"," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. 'Max' stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron match up well in the movie and the action sequences are mightily impressive, at least as feats of engineering. “Mad Max: Fury Road,” starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, should come with a jokey disclaimer: “No vehicles were harmed during the making of this film.” Probably more autos, trucks, vans, motorcycles, and armored cars were harmed in this movie than in any other I can recall. And these vehicles don’t look computer-generated, either. George Miller’s fourth installment in the “Mad Max” series, which began with Mel Gibson in 1979, is certainly the loudest – and that’s saying something. In the press notes, Miller describes the film as “somewhere between a wild rock concert and an opera.” The problem with this approach is that Miller ups the amp and floors the pedal for almost the entire movie. Even rock concerts and operas take a breather. “Fury Road” is essentially a series of turbo-charged set pieces, and the sequences don’t really build or top each other. They just pile up. Miller has the dubious distinction of essentially creating the post-apocalyptic action genre, and in this film, set some 40 years after the fall of the world,  he outdoes himself. Civilization has been reduced to a parched rubble. Water is scarce. So, apparently, are dentists. I’ve never seen so many rotting grimaces in one movie. In The Wasteland, wild packs of War Boys, ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, sporting a toothy, death’s-head face mask) scavenge and terrorize. Huddled, starving masses have migrated to The Citadel keening for Aqua Cola (that’s water in Millerspeak).  The War Boys have captured the itinerant Max (Hardy) and enchained him in various contraptions as they, and Immortan Joe and his minions, hotly pursue Imperator Furiosa (Theron), a renegade warrior who has absconded with the ruler’s bevy of wives, at least one of them visibly pregnant with his child. She is seeking solace for herself and her cargo in the faraway land of her childhood, the Green Place. Hardy has his smoldering charisma and Theron, often best when she’s playing against her glamorous image, matches up well with him. The action sequences, at least as feats of engineering, are mightily impressive. But Miller is so caught up in all his hardcore allegorical hoo-ha that he never lightens up. Does he think maybe he’s Homer? Grade: B- (Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images.) Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people.

"May 15, 2015"," Brimming with delicious symbolism, George Miller’s reboot of the post-apocalyptic road movie is an intense comic-book take on the world we are going to inherit. Shekhar Kapur is taking time to draw his Paani but Miller has painted a violent picture of the world where the resources like water and blood are in control of one war lord called Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrnes). He lives on the high ground and sells his folks jingoistic ideas and his men are keen to lay their lives like suicide bombers. There are gangs interestingly named as diesel group and bullet group indicating the coming together of power groups to control the world. Like most despots in the history Joe is turning his personal battle into a war that everybody must fight. His wives or sex slaves have run away with a feminist defector Imerator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Too much layering for a high octane summer blockbuster? Wait there is more. Amidst all the bizarre characters on wheels in the midst of the desert, our Max (Tom Hardy) is the last surviving male. Tied to the front of the vehicle, he is used as a blood bank by the diseased army of Joe. As the chase heats up, he sides with Imperator to free the women and himself. Relentlessly violent, the film, ironically, makes a strong case for saving the ecology of the world and the seeds are in the hands of women. The film’s motto ‘we are not things’ is literally written on the wall. Miller’s team of writers deserve credit for handling the role of women in a war with a touch of sensitivity without getting preachy as the action sequences literally grow on you. The film doesn’t open its cards easily. Miller is as miser with the details as Joe is with water. Like the boulders dropping unannounced on Furiosa’s humungous rig, Miller drops surprises at every turn. The best part is he doesn’t makes his characters pause to make these statements. The ironies are inherent in the crazy chase that he has put together. Like the scene where Nux, a warrior who switches sides, calls a leafless tree a thing for he has seen one before. Furiosa talks through her silences. When she puts the axle grease on her forehead you know what she is made of. Hardy, thankfully doesn’t get a chance to emote giving Furiosa the space to take over as the unexpected hero of the franchise.

"May 15, 2015"," Mad Max is back, and if he isn’t as mad as he used to be (How could he be? He used to be Mel Gibson), he’s mad enough. More importantly, he’s been brought back by action-movie genius and “Mad Max” auteur George Miller. When we are first reunited with Max (Englishman Tom Hardy), he’s hanging upside down in chains and being used as a “blood bag” for a bald, mutant nitwit named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who looks like all the other zombie-like “war boys” in the Citadel run by Immortan Joe (“Mad Max”’s Toecutter himself, Hugh Keays-Byrne, one of many tips of the hat to the original films). Joe’s children have not turned out well. Holy Master Blaster, one of them is an adult man in a child’s body (Quentin Kenihan). The other is giant Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), who, in spite of his mutant muscles, has issues. Joe, who wears a leather bellows around his neck, is using young captives he calls “my treasures” to breed a new family. But when one of his warriors, the imposing Imperator Furiosa (an almost unrecognizable Charlize Theron), makes a break for it with the “treasures” in a War Rig (an armored tanker truck), the chase is on. Of course, strong and silent Max and unlikely sidekick Nux manage to string along for the ride, and the ride — with Namibia standing in for Australia — is thrilling and spectacular. These wonderful, action-packed “Mad Max” movies have always been insanely violent, incredibly staged, post-nuke Aussie versions of “Cowboys and Indians.” On one side, we have former highway patrolman Max Rockatansky, a nihilist roaming the wilderness in his souped-up Interceptor (which reappears here), searching for gas, and whatever strays he picks up along the way. On the other, gangs of colorfully costumed, heavily armed, raping and pillaging mutant barbarians. Now, this is how you do post-apocalyptic, and the reason everything in this “reboot” of the series that began in 1979 with the landmark “Mad Max” works so well is because of former Sydney emergency room physician Miller, whose visual sense and reluctance to use CGI make this “Mad Max: Fury Road” a true, mechanical special-effects heir to the original films. Hardy’s Max is more recessive than Gibson’s, but no less tough or resilient. Theron’s prosthetic-armed Furiosa gives Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley a run for her money in the big-screen warrior princess category. Here is the first great pop movie of the 2015 summer movie season.",POSITIVE

"May 15, 2015","Tom Hardy is mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore. Well, OK, maybe one more time in George Miller's furious adrenaline pill that's true to the movie's kick-ass roots.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," We’ve been transported to other worlds, different dimensions, to heaven and hell and everything in between, but you’ve never been anywhere like the world that Mad Max: Fury Road creates. That includes all of us that have seen the previous trilogy because Fury Road is unlike anything we have experienced. It will have all the adrenaline coursing through your body as if it were being boosted by nitrous, and that’s just the opening sequence. The evolution (and devolution) of the Max (Tom Hardy) character naturally and perfectly reflects the dehumanizing, desolate nature of the desert, especially in this post-apocalypse setting. His hero psyche is broken from all the losses he has faced and his isolation spent in the desert. Facing some sort of post-traumatic stress, he has been living his life on autopilot, never really living, but only surviving. He needed a jolt to remind him of the man, the legend, he once was. After getting captured and used as a blood bag/hood ornament, he escapes from/with his capture Nux (Nicholas Hoult), while they are in pursuit of the bionic-armed Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has passengers she is smuggling to safety. Among the five passengers is a very pregnant Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the resourceful Toast the Knowing (Zoë Kravitz). They are all on the run from Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who Mad Max veterans may remember played Toe-Cutter in the first film), who was keeping them locked up for breeding purposes. Joe amasses an army to go after them, but the team of Max and Furiosa prove more difficult to capture than they originally thought. All the bumps along the way are intentional and unavoidable, with more than a few of them being people. No decision or design is done arbitrarily. Each has a certain amount of thought put into it that not only makes sense to the world it has created, but also to us as the viewer. There were no half measures taken. Writer/Director George Miller set the GPS, aligned the steering wheel and then unrelentingly stepped on the gas, never once stopping or slowing down to second guess himself. For better or worse, he crashed through every stop light and warning sign, but only because he has a clear vision in the horizon that he needed to reach. My only complaint, or thing I would change about the film, is keeping it 2D. The visuals stand well enough on their own without needing the ineffectual conversion of the film into 3D. The film was already in your face without having to resort to gimmicks. Fortunately, the vision was preserved by production designer Colin Gibson (who is an Australian film veteran) and his magnificent designs of every car, and expertly shaping them to fit every character’s personality and purpose. The best thing about the designs were that even though they were taken to extremes, they had a completely functional and believable aspect in them that grounded them in the realm of reality. Unlike any other of the Mad Max films, this film explores a symbiotic partnership; the partnership between Max and Furiosa. Too often had Max been the sole hero of each film, never truly allowing someone to get close to him. We are introduced to a broken shell of Max, who needs people (and a win) to put him back on his path of (often self-serving) vigilante heroism. Likewise, Furiosa, also seeking redemption for her past mistakes, needs Max to reawaken a part of her that’s been long dead. The partnership goes beyond the characters and reached the actor’s territory. Tom Hardy’s feral, almost animalistic portrayal of Max is balanced by Charlize Theron’s more somber, but just as deadly demeanor as Furiosa. It’s easy to think that Mel Gibson passed the torch of Mad Max on to Tom Hardy, but after seeing Fury Road, you’re more than prepared to accept that Furiosa could just as easily take over the mantle of Mad Max. The so-called “feminist agenda,” according to men’s rights groups, is really just a humanist “agenda” for equal rights. There is more of a message against classicism in this film than there is for feminism. Not to say that there isn’t also a feminist side, because thankfully there is. In Fury Road‘s society, there is a long-standing patriarchy (not unlike the one we can still see today in our society) that considers women as property. Having women fighting for the right to be considered people and not possessions doesn’t seem particularly feminist because that notion should be a fairly obvious one. Emphasis on “should be.” I’d apologize for getting a bit off topic, but I wouldn’t want to give men’s rights groups that or any other kind of satisfaction. I think the phrase, “Sorry, I’m not sorry,” aptly applies here. Like our underdogs in the film, George Miller finally found his Promised Land with Mad Max: Fury Road, the epitome and inevitable culmination of the previous trilogy. This is the kind of film that the Fast & Furious franchise wishes it could one day become. As it stands, every car-based film will eat Fury Road‘s dust because none can hope to achieve this same level of thoughtful, bombastic frenzy that this film inspires. Every actor and cog in this well-oiled engine propels it further and further, making it an unstoppable, unapologetic juggernaut waiting to steamroll over you and drag you along for the ride. The title should have been “The Fast and The Furiosa.” Jon would say that as a writer,  he is a self-proclaimed film snob and a pop culture junkie.  Always gives his honest, critical, and maybe a little bit snarky opinion on everything. He's very detail oriented and loves anything involving creativity and innovation.

"May 15, 2015"," George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is a speed-metal classic. Crazed warlords and rampaging psychonauts attack nonstop. Fleets of monster trucks, cranked-up hot rods and armored battle bikes scream through the desert and sail through the air. Bullets rain down, chain saws snarl, flame-throwers belch and spew—and that's just the basics. Miller has spent the 30 years since his original Mad Max trilogy came to an end making great pictures about dancing penguins, talking pigs, and whatnot. Now, at age 70, he's back in action, and he's still the most gifted director in the crash-and-burn game. The movie's relentless frenzy is astonishing. You'll recall from the earlier films that Max Rockatansky, Miller's battered road warrior, is a onetime cop who lost his wife and child in the savage tumult of a postapocalyptic civilizational breakdown. The role of Max made Mel Gibson a worldwide star; now, played by Tom Hardy, he's still a wanderer, still ""searching for a righteous cause."" After a typically insane spasm of opening action, he's captured by the hot-rodding minions of Immortan Joe, a wasteland tyrant who rules from a skull-shaped mountaintop fortress. (He's played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in Miller's 1979 Mad Max.) Joe subjugates the local populace through his control of water, munitions, and the fuel to power his scrap-heap automotive legion. Dragged back to this dismal kingdom, Max is spotted by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's trusted lieutenants. Furiosa is on her way elsewhere, though. She's embarked on an act of treachery that sets the plot in motion.  It's nice to have a thoughtful plot in a movie like this, but really, the plot is hardly the point. The picture is a triumph of production design and action choreography. There are some amazing handmade battle wagons, one of them bristling with spikes, like a turbo-charged porcupine, another fronted by a wall of speakers and a shredding guitarist (whose double-necked instrument also shoots out flames). Miller's commitment to real stuntwork and state-of-the-art camera technology produces scenes of enveloping clamor and chaos, growing more dazzlingly complex as the film's two hours fly by. And while he relies very little on CGI, there's one computer-generated tornado—a towering wall of dust into which Max and Furiosa disappear—that has an awesome beauty. (The real-life desert lands we see elsewhere were filmed on locations in Australia and Namibia.) Hardy is an appealingly low-key Max, constrained by a Bane-like mask in the beginning and otherwise prone to melancholy grunts. And Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past) is a lot of fun as a lovable-lunatic ""war boy"" called Nux. But Charlize Theron rules this movie, her character a new kind of action hero who happens to be a woman. Over the course of the many years this film was in development, Miller is said to have contemplated a spinoff Furiosa feature. This is an idea that should maybe be moved back onto the front burner.  Start your day with Reason.

"May 15, 2015"," I saw George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” at a 10 p.m. late screening, and, writing this at 2 a.m., I just can’t recommend it as a sleep aid. I can recommend it every other way imaginable. Miller’s ferocious, grotesque, beautiful film is every bit the equal of its original trilogy from the ’80s, and throws down the gauntlet for every action film made since. You had CGI, $100 million budgets, all the tools at your disposal, “Mad Max” seems to ask all those other films — what were you doing with it, anyway? 1985’s “Beyond Thunderdome” ended on a note of hope, but hope is a foolish luxury in the world of “Fury Road,” apparently taking place just a few years later. The post-apocalyptic Outback, starved for blood, for water, for mercy, is ruled by a warlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), for whom his subjects are little more than raw materials. Young men become War Dogs, half-feral white-painted warriors who revere him as a god. Women become breeders, providing breast milk or offspring for Joe. Everyone else, starves in filth at the bottom of the Citadel, waiting for Joe to provide them a little water in exchange for their fealty. As for Max (Tom Hardy taking over for Mel Gibson), he’s haunted by the people he’s failed to save over the years, and his blind grief makes him easy pickings for Joe’s men. They capture him and turn him into a “blood bag,” a living plasma storehouse in case one of the War Gods gets injured. So it happens that Mad Max, ostensibly the hero of his own film, is instead helplessly muzzled and strapped to the front of a War Dogs’ vehicle as sort of a spare tank during the film’s first bravura action scene. That twist, putting the hero on the sidelines, hints at the surprises that Miller has lying in wait for us in “Fury Road.” For example, if there’s a true hero in this tale, it’s not Max but Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe’s field generals. During that opening car chase, Furiosa goes rogue, and we learn that she’s squirreled away in her War Rig (an armored tanker truck with VW Beetle chassis welded on top as turrets) five of Joe’s “wives.” She plans to take them to safety, to a place she calls “The Green Place,” and when Max works his way free, he reluctantly agrees to help her. When Joe realizes her treachery, he brings hellfire after her, and “Fury Road” is basically one big, extended car chase, from Point A to Point B. (There really is only the one road.) But what a car chase, as Miller unveils one automotive monstrosity after another, from dune buggies spiked like porcupines to a giant juggernaut festooned with amps on which War Drums beat kettle drums and a Steve Vai-like guitarist shreds away. (Yes, this is a car chase with its own house band.) Everywhere, there are grotesque little touches of craftsmanship, like the femur bone used as a gearshift or the skulls welded to the grille of the War Rig. It’s like a rolling Etsy store of death. The unending cavalcade of new villains and new vehicles could have been overwhelming, but Miller shoots the car-to-car combat with a relentless discipline, orchestrating beautiful ballets of destruction that mix widescreen composition with Looney Tunes energy. We’re always aware of where every combatant is and what they’re doing, and Miller’s commitment to keeping things cohesive and coherent makes for some of the most sensational action scenes in recent history. But just as important is that we care about those combatants, from the taciturn Max to the fierce Furiosa, to the five fugitive wives who evolve from victims to allies as they’re tested. And Nicholas Hoult is unexpectedly touching as a War Boy pulled along for the ride, and finds his fanatic loyalty to Joe sorely tested. Miller has a lot more on his mind than mere spectacle, and underneath the carnage burns genuine anger at how men have run the world into the ground, and how perhaps only women can set things right. Perhaps the most shocking action scene of the film is when Max aims a rifle at an approaching bad guy, squints through the sight . . . and then hands the rifle to Furiosa, the better shot. (She even uses his shoulder to steady her aim.) It’s a sign of respect and equality between genders that is almost totally absent in the action genre, but is a major undercurrent here. In the end, “Mad Max: Fury Road” is about the limits of running, and that eventually a world in pain has to turn around and correct itself. “If you don’t fix what’s broken, you go insane,” Max tells Furiosa at one point. I’m up in the middle of the night now because I’m so electrified by watching this movie. But because I’m thinking, too.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," In “Mad Max: Fury Road,” it makes perfect sense that an army wages war with an electric guitarist suspended high above a battle rig. As the army screams, he bangs out their heartbeat in electric metal riffs. The movie is a heavy-metal world, a long expression of emotion and testosterone, a frenetic spin and jive of life and death among the ruins of civilization. The tension hits in the very opening scene. Mad Max (Tom Hardy) is hunted like an animal by a tribe of chalk-skinned warriors and haunted by the voices in his head. The two merge into an endless cry of torment. In a world wasted and controlled by power, his only instinct is for survival. His need to survive intersects with the plans of a battle-scarred woman named, perfectly, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). She leads a flock of lovely ladies in a desperate quest across the barren landscape. They flee an impossible life for the hope of a future that glimmers in the distance like a desert mirage. Mad Max, along with his warrior captor to whom he is chained, crash into the ladies like the bass riff hitting the high notes with no time to miss a beat. Like a good guitar shredder, the film never stops moving. They flee, they talk, they fight, they love, and they die at full speed, kicking up rooster tails of sand behind them. Men come at them, spinning in maniacal glee, dangling from arching poles, hoisting explosive spears, covered in spikes. The vehicles come at them, muscle cars souped up on tank tracks, motorcycles bristling with warriors, trucks built up like castles, semis armored like mighty ships. The weapons come at them, guns and swords, darts and spears, explosives and chains. Even when they pause, they don’t stop. The sense of pursuit, of speed, of the need to move hangs in the air like the dust that surrounds them. The look of the film, the style of it, becomes second nature. You feel yourself choking on the dust, fighting the heat, needing to move, to run. It’s that primal. If all these words sound epic, that’s because it is. The beautiful, stylized cinematography, the gritty acting, and the relentless action work seamlessly to suck the audience into a world where there is no ambiguity, no nuance. There is only the desert with evil behind and faint hope in the distance. In a world gone mad, the mad are the sane ones. There are things in this movie, like the original, that do not bear inspection. Why do they never eat? In this dirty wasteland, how do the Vogue-model girls keep so white the wispy tatters of linen that try valiantly to cover their perfect bodies and so clean their smooth faces? And what is that chrome spray paint the warriors put on their teeth? None of it matters. In the hands of Miller, you realize it could be no other way. Life reduced to speed and battle, they journey on. This is the stuff of Homer in the key of Metallica. So the guitarist plays on. Rated R, the film has intense, non-stop violence that can be very gory. It also has brief, shocking, spooky images of ghost-like characters. There is no sexuality (they ain’t got time for that) or bad language.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is an unapologetic action film and it feels like all of the filmmakers relished in that fact. Instead of being loud and obnoxious though, information pills  the high-octane action scenes that dominant this film are beautifully crafted— inviting audiences to both enjoy the spectacle and to appreciate the undeniable beauty of the presentation. The well-chosen Tom Hardy plays the title character as a quiet but powerful man who knows how to survive in a desperate apocalyptic world. Early on, more about  he’s kidnapped by a psychotic group led by the monstrous Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a dictator who uses kidnapped women for breeding purposes and who controls a main water source. “Do not, my friends, become addicted to water,” he notes to the masses after offering them a glimpse of his supply. One of Joe’s closest allies, named Imperator Furiosa and played by Charlize Theron, sees the leader as he truly is and threatens to unravel his world. She rescues some of the women he’s kidnapped (some of whom are pregnant with his children) and attempts to bring them to the Green Place, a beautiful area she once knew. Joe, with his army of obsessively-devoted followers chases Furiosa’s rig through the dessert in order to prevent that escape. Director George Miller, who co-wrote the script with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris, shows his mastery of the action scenes here time and time again. The chase scenes flow magnificently with the characters involved in them moving like dancers on a stage. Despite an abundance of characters in the chase scenes (including a gutsy guitar player who amplifies the exhilaration), it’s easy to follow the action and appreciate the planning and thought that went into staging these visually stunning events. The setting may be an empty desert but that only complements the proceedings. Cinematographer John Seale, working alongside Miller, has created a unique and beautiful world in this film with grim colors and images that help define this cruel landscape. Despite us only seeing limited sections of this post-apocalyptic wasteland, the distinctive set only invites imaginative viewers to see this as one part of a massive but desperate place. Like the world they live in, the story is sparse leaving little time for the characters to grow. The performances by Hardy and Theron though help define these two main characters as solitary loners who are simply trying to survive the hellish world they live in. In a world dominated by death and violence, their characters are guarded by the reality that anyone could betray them and that death could be only a moment away. In a unique turn, Max is sidelined in one of the first major action scenes as he’s tied up to the front of a vehicle driven by Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the members of Joe’s army who is using Max for a blood transfusion.  He’s literally prevented from moving in the midst of a battle scene where explosions are rampant and weapons are being fired all around him. Max’s vulnerable position though helps us appreciate the action around him. Miller makes similar distinctive choices that really set up this film to be more unique and captivating  than it would’ve been in the hands of a less experienced director. Between 1979 and 1985, Miller directed the three previous Max films so it’s been nearly three decades since he brought this character to life. In Mad Max: Fury Road, he shows that the character is alive and kicking and he also reminds us that action scenes can be beautiful and electric affairs if they are placed in the hands of a gifted filmmaker.",POSITIVE

"May 15, 2015"," A double-barrelled shotgun enema straight to the senses, George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is an exercise in relentless, pedal-to-the-metal momentum that can only qualify as savagely pleasurable. It's also a return to the now-gridlocked, postapocalyptic action-movie terrain mapped by Miller, the former upstart wunderkind who's now 70 and returning to automotive mayhem following a long detour into the talking-animal world (Babe, Happy Feet), for the first time in three decades. That road being as heavily travelled as it now is, Miller's reboot is less a means of staking claim to new terrain than trampling the one he first mapped out. (Not to mention an ass-kicking reminder to the punks who followed.) Just as the Australian writer-director's postapocalyptic-punk cartoon chase movie The Road Warrior ripped up the action-movie playbook back in 1981, Fury Road, through the sheer reduction of spectacle to a form of sex-with-a-gorilla stimulatory assault, lays waste to the landscape and takes no prisoners. Unless, of course, one values contemplation and reflection as important commodities of the cinematic experience. As scarce and rare here as the water doled out by the hell town clown king Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to the humans on whom his family of pale-skinned War Boys prey for blood and milk, these properties are locked up and rendered pointless almost as quickly as Max (Tom Hardy) is taken prisoner and repurposed as a human intravenous ""blood bag"" and hood ornament in the movie's full-on firehose-blast of an opening. But if Miller's Road Warrior – itself a retooled follow-up to the drive-in vigilante exploitation of 1979's Mad Max – was as groundbreaking in its thematic and visual conception of a wasted world short on fossil fuels and overloaded on punk attitude, style and vehicular aggression, Fury Road takes as its crowning challenge topping its predecessor's legendary predilection for speed and making it an apocalyptic vanishing point in itself. So this is the way the world ends: not with a bang but a monster-truck meltdown. By way of boiling elements down to their liquid-metal essentials, Miller – who has had this project on the back burner for decades – also reduces plot to the barest of established Mad Maxian minimalisms. Once again cast in the role of reluctant wasteland wagon-train driver to a community of exploited refugees (in this case, Joe's handful of breeder ""wives,"" led by Charlize Theron's road-ready Furiosa), Max is practically a passenger in his own movie. But if even the casting of the comparatively sensitive, more overtly conflicted, alpha-male-type Hardy marks a minor dip in testosterone levels compared with Mel Gibson's Max, the movie's primary gesture to progressive political credentials is the motivation for the wall-to-wall autogeddon itself. Making a bid for the women's escape from the patriarchal desert gulag run by Joe, Furiosa hightails it for the ""Green Land"" with Max strapped to the chassis, and Joe's army of revved-up killer yahoos in hopped-up, fuel-injected pursuit. Taking up fully more than three-quarters of the movie's two-hour running time, the chases themselves are showcases for Miller's inexhaustible genius for making the most out of what are basically just objects moving through space. Displaying sufficient ingenuity and innovation at high velocity to render almost every previous car-chase movie instantly redundant and enervated by comparison, Miller exhibits an almost demonic inspiration when it comes to speed. Opening on the same weekend as Pitch Perfect 2, Mad Max: Fury Road is hardly likely to draw much of that movie's targeted female constituency across the multiplex corridor, but you've got to bless its close-cropped skull for trying. Somewhere beneath all that smoking wreckage is a movie about women taking the wheel and driving their own destiny. While Miller's feminist creds will invariably churn up vigorous debate and chatter in certain corners, most of Fury Road's constituency will likely be too high on the movie's entertainment fumes to be paying much attention. Therein lies this mind-blowing movie's only, but nevertheless significant, flaw, not that it will matter much to those who've just had their skulls hosed clean from the experience. As brilliantly articulated as it is, from the vibrancy of the visuals to the hot-rod stone-age set design, and from the breathtaking precision of the editing to the state of sustained stimulation it miraculously achieves, Mad Max: Fury Road isn't about much more than momentum, the methamphetamine of motor movies. Its true subject is the thrill of the chase and the means by which the movies express it, which is to say it's one hell of a ride in the same direction taken by the characters: deep into a desert of vast and horizonless emptiness. For four movies now, Max has sought redemption for his past to realize it only comes fleetingly and always with a catch. So it may well be for Miller, who may have beaten all competitors at the game he first invented – but largely by sticking to the rules.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Bonkers in a good way, understand. Assuming you like spectacular stunts, crazed characters and hair-raising exploits. Director George Miller, now 70, returns to the franchise he left behind 30 years ago — in the interim he's done such wildly different films as ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" ""Babe: Pig in the City"" and ""Happy Feet"" — and proves he's lost none of the visual flair and imagination that drove those original films. If anything, he's gone more mad. What he has lost is the original Max, Mel Gibson, but Tom Hardy climbs into the character like he was there all along. This time, Max gets a near-equal partner in the fearless Furiosa (Charlize Theron), so this is something of a buddy movie, although these are fairly tight-lipped buddies. With some four different outlaw armies attacking them nonstop, there's not a lot of time for chit-chat. And here's the thing about those armies and this movie in general — they're made up of actual human beings. This is not a movie driven by computerized special effects — in sharp contrast to, say, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Those are flesh and blood bodies leaping from car to car in the desert, shooting off sand dunes on motorcycles, balancing high atop poles swinging back and forth attached to speeding trucks. You can literally feel the difference. It's a visceral return to old-school action filmmaking that's so successful it makes you question the wisdom of new-school filmmaking. If you haven't seen any of the earlier films, no worries. This film stands fine on its own. It opens in a post-apocalyptic Australian Outback desert where Max is captured by a rumbling horde of drivers (car fans are going to want to see this movie just for its wild automotive inventions) and taken to the stronghold of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who tracks all the way back to the original 1979 ""Mad Max""). Immortan Joe rules a vast horde of impoverished people, controlling their supply of water from a high rock adorned with all sorts of immense Rube Goldberg contraptions and populated by boys he's raised to be warriors. Max is discovered to have a universal blood type, so soon he's in a small cage being used for ongoing transfusions, most pointedly for a young warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's trusted aides, is taking a huge war truck out to gather bullets and gasoline. Except she suddenly takes a left turn and starts zooming off to a no man's land. It turns out she has liberated the lithe, young, beautiful brides of Immortan Joe and hopes to drive them to a promised land. Joe takes his army after her, including Nux, who has Max chained to the front of his vehicle, a bloodline tying the two together. Max eventually escapes and eventually teams up with Furiosa as Joe calls in other allies. And the race is on. And really, the race hardly ever stops. Each time you think Miller can't possibly top the last sequence, he tops it. This could become numbing and usually does, but Miller knows exactly when to pull back on the throttle and when to punch-punch-punch it. There's no great meaning here — it's a basic story of rebellion and redemption. But there's such energy and visual invention in a world so fully realized and dazzling that the roller coaster ride is more than enough on its own. ""Fury Road"" freaking rocks.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," What’s in a name? Back in 1979, Australia’s George Miller delivered dystopian mayhem with left-field verve, and 23-year-old Mel Gibson played a beleaguered, pedal-to-the-metal cop with almost gentle aplomb. The chemistry between the men fuelled two sequels (one of them, The Road Warrior, a bona-fide classic) but let’s not underplay the importance of the hero’s moniker. Would we still be discussing the franchise if he’d been called Nutty Norbert? Methinks not. Either way, Max is back. Fanboys have been dreaming about the (much delayed) sequel/reboot for years. The first thing to point out is that Gibson has fallen by the wayside and that his youthful replacement — the pugnaciously versatile Tom Hardy — is likeable but not especially imposing. It doesn’t matter. This is a team effort. Max (haunted by painful memories) has become the most dispensable of cogs in a fascist machine, dragged into a chase to reclaim the five pregnant wives of colony leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). The wives have been stolen by a one-armed alpha female, Furiosa (Charlize Theron; magnetic), and the importance of she and the girls to the film can’t be overstated. Furiosa, like Max, seeks redemption and the wives are on an odyssey of their own. All the young actresses do fine work. British beauty, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, proves downright riveting. Which is a sentence I never thought I’d write unless I had a gun aimed at my head. Miller’s well-paced script is laced with mischievous details. You don’t need to have seen the other films to make sense of this one but all four feel organically entwined. Keays-Byrne, for example, played the baddie in the 1979 original. A throwaway gag involving a creepy crawly recalls the moment, in Road Warrior, where Max cheerfully guzzles dog food. And the costumes are as campy as ever. True, there are no male-buttocks-flaunting trousers but a nipple-exposing vest is surely set to become this summer’s must-have item. Just kidding! What Fury Road proves is that nipples, taken in isolation, are scary. Despite the modest budget, ($150 million), Miller manages to dazzle our senses. He goes mental with the CGI, creating phantasmagorically pustular flesh and luminous, Agent-Orange dust-clouds. He goes to town with explosive yet earthy stunts. The very best involve bendy poles which — topped by humans — wave in the air like toxic bullrushes. The 70-year-old’s last project was the earnest, bloated kids movie, Happy Feet 2. It’s as if he’s spent his time since then watching old movies (in particular, Metropolis, The Wages of Fear and Alien). For whatever reason, he’s re-learnt how to twin abundance with restraint. The end result is emotional. Most Hollywood movies pay lip service to liberalism; Miller’s rage against the machine is in a different class. And just as Max and the gang have to make gut-wrenching sacrifices (in one poignant scene, a foetus is literally extracted from a womb), Miller’s principles may cost him. It’s risky to make a blockbuster with so much violence (a 15 certificate — or R, as its known in the States — means the box office won’t be ringing with cash squeezed from families or teens). It was daring, too, to cast Theron. In the action genre, women are often paired with men at least a decade older than themselves but that trend has been reversed (Hardy is eight years younger than his co-star). If Fury Road does only moderate business, all of these moves will be filed, by industry bods, under “m” for mistakes. Who cares? This summer’s blockbuster offerings may be setting box office records, yet seem like holograms when compared with this weighty offering. Avengers creator Joss Whedon must be jealous to the max.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2015"," Every time Mad Max returns to the screen, his post-apocalyptic world gets a little more post-apocalyptic. From 1979’s Mad Max through 1981’s The Road Warrior and 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Max Rockatansky (played in the original three movies by Mel Gibson) went from dedicated police officer to leather-clad drifter, and his society went from dingy and rough to savage and unforgiving. Now that Max has returned after 30 years away, and his creators have their biggest budget ever to chronicle his latest adventure, the apocalypse his world endured has once again grown worse. In Mad Max: Fury Road, with Tom Hardy replacing Gibson as Max, there’s not even a memory of any world before the burned-out hellscape where the characters live. Gasoline and water are still in short supply, as are, apparently, fertile women, since they’re the resource that the series’ latest terrifying warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), is determined to hoard. In broad strokes, Fury Road has the same plot as the last two Mad Max movies: Max is captured by a group of survivors, and after convincing them of his inherent goodness, he reluctantly agrees to help them in their vaguely defined quest for salvation. In this case, the group is led by the indomitable Imperator Furiosa (an excellent Charlize Theron), who is determined to rescue five young women from the clutches of Immortan Joe, for whom they are intended as breeders and sex slaves. Beyond those broad strokes, the plot isn’t particularly important (or coherent). The point of Fury Road, like the other Mad Max movies, is to showcase director and series creator George Miller’s talents for insane stunt work, and in that sense it delivers monumentally. Miller has put every dollar of his budget into staging a series of car chases and action sequences that take up almost the entire running time, and he’s done it primarily with practical effects, including dozens of tricked-out vehicles. Fury Road is a marvel of action choreography, even if the crashes and explosions get a little repetitive after a while. As a story, it’s not quite as engaging, although Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris attempt to add some feminist subtext to the post-apocalyptic posturing. Theron helps carry that off, but ultimately it runs a distant second to the nonstop action. For most fans, though, that action will be enough, proving that even after three decades, Miller can still wow audiences with fast cars and massive explosions. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ...",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," 
	The sounds of engines revving fill the opening seconds of Mad Max: Fury Road, and they continue pretty near constantly for the duration of the film, a dystopian road movie that is essentially one gigantic, heart-pumping, gritty-yet-artisanal chase sequence. 
	Who is chasing whom, and why, is less important than the outrageous cinematic fodder it serves up: a baroque-meets-heavy metal visual and aural feast, encapsulated in one of the film’s many over-the-top showpieces: an electric guitar that doubles as a flamethrower. 
	The fourth installment in George Miller’s Mad Max franchise (and the first in 30 years), Fury Road opens with Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy taking over the iconic Mel Gibson role) situating us in the film’s scorched earth, post-apocalyptic setting. He sums it up when he says, “My world is fire and blood,” where everything “is reduced to a single instinct: survive.” 
	“As the world fell, each of us in our own way were broken,” notes Max, who takes a bite out of a double-headed lizard in the fist few minutes of the film. This is indeed a fallen, hellish world: physical and spiritual deformity abound, mutations of a once-ordered world that is now all chaos, crows, twisted metal and gasoline. 
	In the midst of this land, aptly called Wasteland, there exists a sort of anti-Eden metropolis called the Citadel, ruled by a tyrannical overlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). With its skull-heavy aesthetic, preponderance of child slaves, pagan worship rites and zombie-like bald henchmen with heavy eye makeup, the Citadel bears a striking resemblance to the Temple of Doom from Indiana Jones. 
	Unlike the Eden of Genesis, a temple-like oasis ultimately meant to bring order, flourishing, and blessing beyond its borders through the stewardship of Adam, the Citadel is a closed imperial fortress where water and greenery are kept out of reach (literally high on cliffs) from the starving, parched masses. “I am your redeemer,” says Joe from his perch on high, perpetuating a cult religion that depends on keeping the throngs just happy enough. Water is ceremoniously released to them in small batches, with Joe saying things like, “Do not become addicted to water . . . you will resent its absence.” 
	This logic, of ensuring submission by promising some level of security and comfort, manifests itself in the various forms of slaves (child slaves, blood donor slaves, breast-milk producing slaves, etc.) kept in Joe’s palace. His “five wives” are sex slaves, “prized breeders” who perpetuate his kingly line. 
	The plot of Fury Road kicks off when a woman named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) smuggles the five wives out of captivity in an oilrig, with hopes of taking them to destination of freedom called “the green place.” A massive chase ensues, featuring all manner of vehicles (think military-meets-muscle cars) and weaponry (guns, knives, bombs, chainsaws, I think I even saw a scythe) as Joe and his “war boys” (essentially kamikaze albino jihadists) pursue Furiosa and the five wives. 
	After spending much of the first half of the film as a human hood ornament, donating blood to the driver of a car as it careens through the desert at high speeds, Max eventually joins up with Furiosa, though more as a sidekick than a hero. Max has his moments, to be sure, but this is Furiosa’s film. By the time the protagonists join forces with a motorcycle gang of guerilla grandmas called “the many mothers,” it’s clear that a key theme of Fury Road is feminine power and redemption. Like Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof, Fury brings a bit of a feminist critique to a traditionally masculine, exploitative genre. 
	Somewhat related to the film’s gender politics, one might also pick up a subtle critique of radical Islam. In their world of oil and deserts, the “war boys” bear resemblance to ISIS fighters and jihadi militants, not only in their view of women as prizes and property but in the way they thrill in violence, shock, terror and glory. 
	“If I’m going to die I will die a historic death on Fury Road,” says one war boy (Nicholas Hoult), who along with his cohorts manifests an almost nihilistic embrace of mayhem, destruction and death for the sake of achieving a place in “Valhalla” (in Norse mythology, the afterlife home for warriors who die in combat). 
	The pseudo-religious language of death and subsequent glory in the afterlife is one of the rare touches of transcendence in the film. On another occasion a character is seen fumbling with her hands in a prayer posture, trying to petition “anyone who’s listening.” This is a post-God world, bereft not only of most forms of life but, naturally, most belief in a God who might care. 
	And yet the film hints at an Edenic renewal and redemption from the ashes. If Joe (an antichrist type) can be overthrown and his reign of terror ended, perhaps the seeds of the fabled “green place” could be replanted? Instead of the “anti-seeds” of guns (“plant one and watch something die”) and the ever-present machinery of death, life might once again thrive. Fury Road is a furiously visceral, non-CGI experience, throbbing with pounding music (composed by Dutch producer Junkie XL) that accentuates the film’s bloodletting and bone-crushing highway to hell. It’s a road that goes nowhere but exists only for itself, meaningless mayhem in a world where any connection between signifier and semiotic object seems quaint. A tree is referred to as “that thing.” Language has morphed into indecipherable grunts, chants and war cries. Viewers see all sorts of nonsensical things on screen that defy meaning or explanation. It’s anarchy, but that is the point. 
	Death is the only logic of this barren landscape, where people eat spiders as snacks and babies are cut out the wombs of dying women. And yet where there is disorder and death, there is hope for order and life. The apocalyptic energy of the film seethes with an eschatological longing for renewal and restoration. The way cinematographer John Seale focuses on color (vibrant primary hues of yellow, red and blue), the way the operatic music and sense of ceremony accompanies the chaos, are but some of the hints that a deeper magic and meaning exists in the universe. 
	The world of Fury may be desolate and war-torn, languishing under the failed stewardship of man. But as another recent film, Wim Wenders’ Salt of the Earth, shows us, nothing that can die is beyond the hope of resurrection. The “things fall apart” inertia of this sin-stricken world is not irreversible. Order wins in the end; goodness will triumph over madness. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those films that foregrounds and aestheticizes violence, similar to the films of Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez. As such, violence of all sorts abounds: gunfights, knife fights, spear fights, crashing vehicles, explosions, impalings, people getting run over, pregnant women falling off of moving cars, dead babies being cut out of wombs, a man’s jaw being ripped off, etc. The film is rife with brutality, though many of the most violent moments are not shown explicitly as much as they are implied and cut away from at opportune moments. For as constant as the violence is in the film, it is not as explicit as it could be. In addition to the violence, there is some profane language, a few quick (non explicit) shots of female nudity, and a lot of so-called “disturbing images” of deformed people and scary looking villains. In general, though it is certainly deserving of its R-rating, Fury Road is not as explicit as it could be, given its aim to show a world of depravity and chaos.

The film begins with a sort of fever dream over a small child he failed to rescue, perhaps a proxy for Max’s internalized guilt over his wife and daughter’s murder by Toecutter, played in the original MAD MAX (1979) by Mr. Keays-Byrne.  Waking from this dream, Max is captured by the War Boys and branded a universal donor because of his blood type.  As Nux’s (Nicholas Hoult) bloodbag, Max’s body furnishes the pale naif with a steady supply of blood while in battle on the open flats.  The War Boys are raised from childhood to serve and defend one of the two most important commodities over which Joe holds sway: Water.  The other, of course, is gasoline.  In this post-apocalyptic dystopia I’m not quite sure who or what drills and refines what petroleum they have, but never-mind. There are so many visual details to this world of marauders, tribes, scavengers and loners that explanations become uninteresting.  That’s the sort of hamfisted exposition you’d expect in perhaps another saga written haphazardly by a different George. From here the film launches into the first third of a chase and battle sequence that plays less like a video game than a two hour mechanized, pyrotechnic buffalo stampede. The War Boys chase Furiosa and her cargo through an electrified sandstorm that makes Michael Shannon’s nightmare in Take Shelter seem like a light drizzle.  The sequence ends with the flicker of an emergency flare. I haven’t even gotten to the central premise of the story and already director George Miller has taken trash, literally and figuratively, and transformed it into a kinetic art sculpture traveling through the Namib at 200 kilometers per hour, complete with its own roving orchestra—taiko-style drums atop a ’59 Cadillac dubbed “Gigahorse” and a bungee-suspended flame-throwing guitarist who perforates what could easily become a stuffy atmosphere, eliciting the occasional necessary giggle or two. Toward the end of the middle act, when the five team up with the nomadic Vuvalini in search of the fabled “Green Place”, the film shatters the Bechdel test as well as every tiresome stereotype of “man-hating feminazis” intently concocted to further marginalize women in a medium in which they are already woefully under-represented.  Max, Furiosa and the others form a team.  There are no victims or muses, only warriors.  The closest the film gets to such narrative tropes might be Capable’s empathy for Nux.  However, she only points Joe’s disillusioned, former devotee in the right direction.  He takes the first step and every step thereafter on his own accord. Defenders of Joss Whedon (AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON) have argued that two hours isn’t enough time to flesh out characters (particularly female ones) in distinctive voices, yet Miller creates distinct identities for each of the wives and the Vuvalini (totalling at least ten unique characters–all women) without clunky dialogue.  The fact that you can still tell them apart in the middle of a high speed road brawl, one in which they’re each active combatants, makes inexcusable the failures of other writer/directors to do the same. Spielberg and his less restrained (read: spastic) disciples, Shyamalan and Abrams, may want to pay close attention to the limited and contextually-appropriate use of diffuse light and color pops.  When you leave the theater, think about that eerie section of silt-covered Wasteland bathed in cobalt hues.  Think about what it represents, both thematically and literally.  Would you remember it if Miller had beaten you in the head with a fucking rainbow?",POSITIVE

With Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Josh Helman. Written by George Miller and Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. Directed by George Miller. Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images. 120 minutes. This time of the year there are certain kinds of movies that are best appreciated as amusement park rides. You don’t critique a roller coaster for poor character development or a predictable plot. You simply want it to go fast, have lots of turns and rises and drops, and leave you thrilled and exhausted. On that score, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD succeeds. If this is the sort of movie you’re looking for, it’s a good ride. Beyond that, though, there’s not much there. Director George Miller returns to the scene of his earliest successes–the three “Mad Max” movies (1979-1985) that helped make a star out of Mel Gibson–and… well, it’s not quite clear what he’s doing here. Is this a remake? A reboot? A sequel? The story, such as it is, involves a post-apocalyptic world where a handful of warlords enslave the remnants of humanity and fight over the remaining resources, like gasoline and ammunition. Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by one faction and treated as a “blood bank” for one of the warriors. When Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) goes off her mission to help several luscious babes who are “wives” of the war lord escape from his clutches, Max is chained to one of the pursuing vehicles. He gets loose and joins forces–after a while–with Furiosa, The rest of the movie is them being chased by vehicles from what appear to be a violent and surreal version of the old cartoon “Wacky Races” back and forth across the desert. That’s it. Unlike the original film, we get little sense of who Max is. He’s haunted by visions of a child, presumably his, whom he failed to rescue, but played woodenly by Hardy he exhibits less of a range than the tanker he spends part of the film in. Theron fares a little better as the driven Furiosa–complete with crew cut and mechanical arm–but we don’t learn much about her until late in the film. As for the rest, they’re cartoon characters who have been carefully designed with bizarre costumes, make-up, prostheses, and the like, but if you want to know who is who among the largely unknown cast, lots of luck. Reading the closing credits and seeing names like the Splendid Angharad and Cheedo the Fragile you may be surprised that the characters had names. Indeed, Max doesn’t even tell his name until nearly the end of the film. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His most recent book is “Shh!

"May 14, 2015"," I’m angry about the extents Hollywood and the director of Fury Road went to trick me and other men into seeing this movie. Everything VISUALLY looks amazing. It looks like that action guy flick we’ve desperately been waiting for where it is one man with principles, standing against many with none. But let us be clear. This is the vehicle by which they are guaranteed to force a lecture on feminism down your throat. This is the Trojan Horse feminists and Hollywood leftists will use to (vainly) insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things, including physique, strength, and logic. Apparently, there’s a factual basis for claiming that Mad Max: Fury Road was designed to be a feminist film. Eve Ensler, the author of The Vagina Monologues, was hired by director George Miller to serve as a consultant, and she vouches for it: ​“I think George Miller is a feminist, and he made a feminist action film.” To this end, Fury Road opens on a future-world that has regressed to a state of violent primitive patriarchy. This isn’t necessarily a bad premise, but it’s hammy as hell, with skull motifs festooning everything. It tries so hard to be dystopian it achieves inadvertent comedy instead. (When the desperate, ragged desert populace lines up for the ceremonial dispensing of water, all I could think was that the feature cartoon Rango did that scene a lot better.) Evil skull-masked overlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules The Citadel, a grim fortress built into red rock, where he holds a group of women captive as ​“breeders.” Led by Joe’s top truck driver, Furiosa (Charlize Theron), and aided by Max (Tom Hardy), the women escape, kicking off two hours of car chase. I didn’t truly understand how Eve Ensler could imagine what it might be like to be a Bosnian woman during ethnic cleansing or a woman during the reign of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I don’t even know how Eve Ensler imagined a vocabulary or a language for these experiences that she hasn’t had. Regardless of where one stands on Ensler’s feminist cred, I couldn’t see any evidence in the film of her consciousness-raising sessions. The first full shot we get of the escaping women shows them standing tall against a gorgeous sun-blasted horizon, wearing white muslin bikinis and other resort-wear, and looking exactly like supermodels posing for a Vogue shoot in the deserts of Namibia. Rose Huntington-Whiteley plays Splendid, the lead figure among the escaping band. The credentials that secured her this role are presumably her career highs as a top model, achieving the rank of a Victoria’s Secret ​“Angel” and a number one rating on Maxim magazine’s ​“Hot List” for 2011. The other women are even less impressive performers. None can act in the least, but in addition to unmemorably pretty features, they have a broad spectrum of hair and skin colors, which is important when setting up a group Vogue shot in this enlightened age of ours. That no primitive patriarch in his right mind would ever choose these particular women as ​“breeders” to keep his colony alive is immediately apparent. One of them is so thin and pale as to be almost transparent and looks as if she’ll die in a photogenic way at any second. But she could step onto any catwalk during Fashion Week, no questions asked. Of course, Charlize Theron as Furiosa benefits from proximity to the supermodels who make her seem, by comparison, ferociously strong and a better actor than Meryl Streep. She’s tall enough to seem physically imposing, and she moves with athleticism. But she also brings with her the legacy of so many Dior perfume ads: the soft, tiny-nosed, blonde prettiness that her crew cut merely accentuates and that John Seale‘s lovely cinematography enshrines in innumerable close-ups. Just compare this example of onscreen feminism to Sigourney Weaver in Alien (1979). Weaver was six feet tall, odd, angular, smart and forceful, with highly individual, non-model looks and a remarkably ambitious actor’s resume, shot in unforgiving light and wearing a unisex worker’s uniform. In movies, we haven’t come a long way, baby. We must also grapple with the supposedly feminist plot elements of Fury Road. The women’s escape from The Citadel is a quest to reach the matriarchal paradise where Furiosa was born. They repeat as a comforting mantra, ​“We’re going to the Green Place!” It’s the last stand of Mother Nature where, apparently, judging by the natives we eventually meet, no men ever lived. It’s an extraordinary thing, in this day and age, that we still want to believe in a lot of essentializing Earth Mother nonsense about women. But apparently we do. In praising Fury Road, Eve Ensler says, ​“All the women in the film maintain their inherent woman-ness.” Whatever ​“inherent woman-ness” is, I was afraid to find out. I dreaded getting to the ​“Green Place.” Would everyone be doing yoga when we got there? And communicating softly and understandingly with each other? Or perhaps tending gardens all day, then doing fertility dances by the light of the moon? Eventually we meet some ​“spunky” old women from the Green Place. They’re huggy, but also ride motorcycles and talk tough. This is the comedic reversal of the clichés about endlessly nurturing women, but only gets us to another cliché: making older women unexpectedly and amusingly badass, like nice white-haired grandmothers suddenly cursing or break-dancing or singing hip-hop songs in Adam Sandler comedies. In Fury Road, the lead feisty old woman clutches a bag of symbolic seeds for future tending when they resurrect the Green World matriarchy somewhere else. What’s so annoying about these motifs is that they bring us to yet another cliché: ​“primitive” women as akin to Mother Earth, vessels for seedlings, awesome in their mysterious fertility. The film clearly considers the return to primitive patriarchy to be bad; I’m not sure why the regression to primitive matriarchy is supposed to be so terrific. While I was watching the film, I thought with some bitterness, ​“It figures that they’d set out to make a ​‘feminist action film’ and this would be the result.” I really regretted sitting where there was no nearby wall to beat my head against. It’s a sort of sneaky feminism. When you say the premise — a woman warrior escapes with female sex slaves — that doesn’t necessarily sound like a blockbuster. But because it’s an action film, guys will see it. What if it’s not really feminism that’s been smuggled in, though, but only carloads of embarrassing stuff? Are we such action naïfs that we’re taken in by a lot of admittedly fantastic stunts? Can we really see no problems with this film at all? Does it make any sense that so many critics and fans are united in calling Fury Road ​“The Greatest Film of Its Kind Ever Made” and other wild encomiums? Beyond the terrible pandering to supposedly feminist sensibilities, there’s the scourge of color grading that’s afflicting so many action films. Everything looks so beautiful in Fury Road that the menacing impact of Miller’s legendary dystopia is cut in half. Take a look at Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) and see the dead world leeched of color, pale sandy wasteland meets an ashen sky at the desolate far horizon, which is further obscured by heat haze. And the dust everywhere, including in the air, so that we seem to have grit in our eyes. It’s a world we’re meant to experience as implacably hostile. Then look at Fury Road. Gorgeous color, red rock and rich umber sand against heartening blue sky, everything limpidly clear when we’re not actually moving into a dust storm (which is also too beautiful, like a lovely sculpted cloud formation moving along the ground). And the night is deep indigo spangled with stars! Walt Disney at his most sentimental — think the pastoral Technicolor nature scenes for Snow White and Bambi—couldn’t have tweaked the Fury Road color scheme to make it any prettier. But I don’t want to see vacation resort landscapes right out of a glossy pamphlet when I watch a Mad Max movie. As David Christopher Bell notes in his Cracked article ​“6 Reasons Modern Movie CGI Looks Surprisingly Crappy,” one main reason is ​“Color grading makes everything look like a fantasy.” Omitting ​“realistic earth tones” and filtering grit and glare out of every image so that it looks like, in Bell’s words, ​“Middle-goddamn-Earth” is especially deleterious when it comes to dystopian science fiction film, with its built-in tendencies toward social criticism. As for the action genre, its inheritance of aspects of film noir and the social problem film was evident in important early actions films such as Dirty Harry (1971) and Shaft (1971) and Walking Tall (1973) and the first Mad Max (1979), and sustained in many of the best films of the genre (First Blood, Terminator, Predator, Aliens, RoboCop, Die Hard, Bourne Identity, District 9). It’s a miserable development that the Mad Max franchise, famous for its harsh realist aesthetic, is suddenly made to look beautiful and fake. The very few critics who’ve said a word against the film are mostly complaining about it for the wrong reasons. It’s got too much action, they say; it’s just one long chase scene. But that’s what’s good about the film. In many interviews, Miller makes it clear that he set out to strip down the dialogue while expanding the chase scenes that formed the heart of the great Mad Max films. He’s compared his efforts to silent film, to John Ford’s epic chase scene in Stagecoach, to Hitchcock’s experiments in reliance on pure visuals. This approach is perfectly in keeping with the logic of the devolved world Miller’s created, where a nightmarish scarcity of vital resources has forced people to hole up in the last oases and engage in desperate chases of human predator and prey. But unfortunately Miller didn’t stick to his impulse to plane away excess; instead he’s combined the minimalist elements of what he’s called his ​“simple allegorical story” with excess at every level of execution. Even the wondrously choreographed stunting that keeps everything flying, flipping, careening, and cartwheeling in every direction starts to look like some demented Cirque de Soleil performance with a demolition derby theme after a while. Depth of field shooting is pushed to such an extreme that the director seems to be hunting for shots he can frame as comic book art, with an immense close-up of a face in one half of the screen repeatedly set off on the other half by flyspeck figures on the horizon ten miles back. It’s no surprise to find out that the famous comic-book artist Brendan McCarthy gets a co-writer credit with Miller and helped storyboard the film. And any given face in close-up is likely to be lit as lovingly as a Rembrandt in a museum, and to be just on the verge of saying something of ponderous significance. There’s hardly any dialogue in Mad Max: Fury Road, but what’s there certainly weighs a ton. For example, when Furiosa tells Max what she seeks in escaping The Citadel, she intones, ​“Redemption.” Big brooding delivery, big ravishing close-up, big heavy pause. I had the impulse to call out during that pause, ​“No, you don’t say that out loud! That’s SUBTEXT!” And it makes no sense, either. What does Furiosa need redemption for? Getting abducted from her home as a child? Being a good truck driver? Helping other women? Max is the one who’s having the failure-flashbacks, so maybe that was supposed to be his line, or rather, his subtext. All this emoting and signifying and extravagant visual lusciousness seems to constitute a new kind of popular Ham Art — overacted and overdone, and gleaming with meaty pinkness. And people eat it up. It’s a strange feeling to love action film and yet feel disappointed in what is apparently considered the greatest action film in a generation. And frankly, I admit I envy everyone who could enjoy the exhilarating chases along with the ​“Visit the Grand Canyon!” color scheme and the mortifying melodramatic poses and pauses, just because of the sheer genre film ecstasy I’m missing out on. But I can’t envy those who are embracing the dumb faux-feminism as well. That is pathetic, as well as unforgivable. I hope you found this article important.

"May 14, 2015"," Imagine a summer movie that gets all the details just right: a great cast, a simple but moving story with the kind of jaw-dropping visual feats that reminds its audience just why they go to the movies. Now add explosions, a movie-long car chase across the desert and a bungee cord bouncing guitarist atop of a weaponized truck. Rev your engines and race straight to the wonderfully wacky world of one of the best action movies of the year, if not the decade, “Mad Max: Fury Road.” A captured Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is enlisted in a crazed raid party for the rouge leader Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) after she smuggles out the wives of her commander Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). In the race for survival, Max teams up with the group of warrior women for a chance at greener pastures in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. Following in the tire tracks of director George Miller’s 1979 shoestring budget classic “Mad Max” and its incrementally stranger sequels “The Road Warrior” and “Beyond Thunderdome,” “Fury Road” has pumped in millions to create one of the most awe-inspiring live-action movies made in the era of green screens and CGI. Miller seamlessly blends practical stunts, really crashing cars and wielding people on aerial stilts like a Cirque du Soleil show, with stunningly well-choreographed CGI stand-ins for when the tricks become too death-defying. Even the layers of detail Miller gives to his motorized manhunt is stupefying. From the spiked junk heaps that roll through the desert sands to the delusional religion of Immortan Joe’s minions, nothing in “Mad Max: Fury Road” is in place without a conscious decision. The number of scenes in which Tom Hardy has to climb on moving cars, the enormity of multiple moving explosions and flying guitarist are all included in Miller’s vision of a fringe dystopian society driven mad by lack of resources. The scrapheaps of leftover humanity that treats each other like scarce commodities is just as frightening as any of the devilish guitarist-wielding cars. Tom Hardy’s Mad Max is not so much the hero as he is the witness to the depravity. Within minutes of the movie’s start, Miller jumpstarts his audience into this wicked world, and even if you’ve never seen a “Mad Max” movie before, the stakes are made immediately clear. The surprise star of this film is Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, a formidable action hero who’s never sexualized and is in every way Max’s equal. Her story of loss and quest for redemption adds life to Max’s tragic mythos. “Vagina Monologues” author Eve Ensler consulted on the film, and her feminist touch is felt not like a pink wash of established genre classics (think the all-female version of “Ghostbusters”) but in the subtle portrayal of Furiosa’s strength. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is a thrill ride for the ages. This is a great pulpy B-movie infused with A-list talent and the bountiful studio budget to boot. Miller has held to his own little campy Outback indie story for over 30 years and still packs the unique visual flair to leave audience’s mouths agape. Let there be enough affection and ticket sales, so that Warner Bros. should greenlight a few more sequels from the 70-year-old director.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," Mad Max (Tom Hardy, taking over from Mel Gibson) stamps on a two-headed lizard and then chews its head off. And that’s just in the first minute. That master of apocalyptic junkyard anarchy, George Miller, is back, bigger, wilder, madder than ever with this fourth of the Mad Max movies, all set in a post-apocalyptic desert dystopia of deprivation, chaos, rust, and brutality. In this world, all anyone has ever known is loss and despair. There is no hope, no thought of any possible way to learn or create. At one point, a character points to something completely unfamiliar to him, calling it “that thing.” It is a tree. The first three films were about the fight for gasoline to fuel the vehicles pieced together from the wreckage. This one is about another, even more precious fluid: water. Other precious fluids come into the story as well, including blood and breast milk. A brutal dictatorship has taken over, controlling access to all of that. All are the preserve of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, with the right crazy eyes for the role), who lives literally above everyone else in a place known as The Citadel, maintaining control with his army of War Boys, all with shaved heads and powder-white skin and all convinced that their destiny is to die for Immortan Joe and be transported to paradise in Valhalla. Immortan Joe also maintains a harem of impossibly long-legged, lovely young woman. His chief lieutenant is Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a fearless woman with a mechanical arm, so much the central focus of the film that it should have been named for her. When Furiosa escapes with Immortan Joe’s women, including his pregnant “queen,” Joe and his peers come after them, in a convoy of tricked-up vehicles, all made to destroy. Everything is in shades of burnt-out umber except for the bright red suit of a guy shredding an electric guitar to keep everyone angry. One of the War Boys is Nuz (Nicholas Hoult), who has brought along his “blood bag.” That would be Max, who was captured by Immortan Joe’s troops and kept alive only to serve as a blood donor. Nuz did not want to be left behind but had not yet finished getting his transfusion. So Max is manacled and attached to the front of Nuz’s car. Max ends up with Furiosa and the young women, who are seeing the “green place” where Furiosa was born. Miller is a master of cinema, and his staging and cinematography on the action scenes are shot through with throbbing, raging, adrenalin that contrasts with the stoicism of Max and Furiosa. Miller has said that the Edge camera car is the most exciting technological innovation in his career. It allowed him (he operated it himself) to put the camera in the middle of the action. He does not like to use CGI, preferring “practical” (real) effects, and the grittiness is so palpable we feel we are inhaling dust. Hardy is excellent, though, as with Bain, his face is masked for much of the film. Theron is more incendiary than the film’s mountainous fireballs, creating a character with a rich, complicated history in the way she fights, in the determined set of her brows, in the way she looks at the helpless young women, thinking about where she has been and what she has seen. The action makes our hearts beat harder, but Miller’s ability to create characters that transcend the crashes and explosions and themes that resonate all too sharply with contemporary conflicts, are what can make them beat more fiercely. Parents should know that this film has non-stop apocalyptic action, peril, and violence with many characters injured and killed and several graphic and disturbing images, as well as some strong language, some nudity, and references to domestic abuse.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Critical hyperbole, like a new house or a career change, is best slept on. Decorum suggests it’s best to assess during a comedown than to seize a slobbering high, right? The 2015 summer movie season isn’t even two weeks old, but don’t kid yourself: There is Mad Max: Fury Road and, well, everything else lining up to deferentially bow down to it before Labor Day. Here is smash-mouth action filmmaking for the ages, born of brave stars and herculean stunt professionals who thrillingly court, and astoundingly cheat, death for two hours and of George Miller, a filmmaker who at 70 — seventy! — can still surprise us with what escapes from his feverish, fiendish mad-scientist imagination. In sorta-sequelizing / sorta-rebooting his signature Mad Max franchise for a modern age, Miller integrates contemporary technology without capitulating to it like so many elder statesmen before him. He actually strapped Tom Hardy to the front of a speeding car. That’s really a fistfight on a wobbly pole several stories up that pauses, beautifully, for a crow’s-nest view of the cars and chaos below. That is definitely a guy with a flame-throwing guitar thrashing in front of a 50-foot wall of amps, as Miller’s idea of a post-apocalyptic drummer boy. Filming in Namibia’s deserts allowed sunstroke madness to mutate the film’s DNA in a most welcome manner. (Forget the converted 3D, though; it keeps up with neither Miller’s movie nor his mind.) And yet Fury Road also offers up unadulterated, uncompromised thematic weight, something that rarely wriggles into the rumble seats of such nine-figure vehicles. Co-writing with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, Miller scrawls out punkish pop-art poetry within the pixels, interlacing spat stanzas of furious free verse with soft sonnets that champion compassion. Juggernaut action of the highest order is not enough for him; he transfixes us with plaintive wails for what its characters have lost and a fist-pumping optimism for what they may reclaim. A mid-movie moment where the good ones left standing choose to liberate people rather than gain ground feels like a thumbed nose to the post-apocalyptic genre’s pro forma expectations of nihilistic destruction, and it’s perfectly in line with Miller’s previous Mad Max films.  All of this adds up to an instant classic, a film you will certainly want to see again in the theater — at least once and likely immediately — to fully savor its precision, passion and primal thrill. After getting your balance back after round one, that is. Here, Hardy steps into the role that made Mel Gibson a star. While Gibson’s presence would’ve brought intriguing dimensions to the film’s idea of choking out an aged, morally rotted patriarchy of entitlement, Hardy makes a sneakily exceptional substitute. He plays Max as less a hero and more a confrontational comrade, a corner man upon whom you’d still rely for well-timed, hearty haymakers. There’s a sort of a grunting calm to this Max, who’s haunted on the inside, and that Hardy, one of the most clenched actors around, represents the relative even keel of Fury Road clues you into how bonkers it becomes. Max’s most savage solo moment is sequestered offscreen. And if it feels like he takes an at-times literal backseat, that’s because he’s equally matched — in reticence, rage, reticence and, eventually, respect — by Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. Theron’s performance — her finest since Monster and, genre bias be damned, as worthy of an Oscar nomination — is a triumph of convincing physicality and a near-silent ability to nail a full emotional spectrum. Not since Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton has an actress achieved such depth without saying so little, and Furiosa constitutes the most robust rooting interest. (You get the sense even Max can’t quite wrap his head around her pain but is proud to fight beside her.) Furiosa is a figurehead female folded into the power structure of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a self-appointed king fitted daily into a costume that conceals his decrepit, sagging and diseased flesh. Joe rules from on high in his citadel lest the underlings below see his true form. He placates them with pitifully small portions of natural resources he’s hoarding, and Furiosa is among his top lieutenants whom he trusts to make supply runs in the War Rig (a movable fortress) to nearby Gas Town. Deep wells of rage run through Furiosa; it’s intimated that she’s only now gained back her full resolve after being physically and spiritually broken. And she taps them by hijacking the War Rig to facilitate the escape of Joe’s five pampered brides. Joe is mercilessly breeding them in hopes of genetically weeding out a plague that’s killing him, his people and his War Boys. The War Boys are a band of bald, burly, paint-huffing sycophants whose sole glory is to die and live again in Valhalla per Joe’s decree, and they’re just one gang whom Joe sics on Furiosa down Fury Road. How does Max factor into all of this? I’ll leave that for you to discover, but his initial entanglement with Furiosa — and Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy whose insatiable thirst for a meaningful death becomes an unimaginably moving character trait — unfolds in an opening salvo of ingenious speed, surprise and stuntwork. If ever there were a film with an alphabet worth of exhibits for a Best Stunt Team Oscar, it’s this. And what most action films save for the final course, Fury Road treats like an appetizer laced with glass shards. There are two even better chases to follow — including a climax that plays like a co-production of Cirque du Soleil, Motocross, Elizabeth Streb and Strange Fruit’s dance teams and whomever owns Truckzilla. Action unit director Guy Norris and his team deliver daredevil dynamics par excellence. Meanwhile, Miller doles out horror and humor of Immortan Joe’s hegemony without teetering too far into either one, whether it’s the sight of women cradling dead babies while hooked up to industrial-sized breast pumps or a scene of combatants spitting petrol into their superchargers to gain ground. Even the breathers are built on twitchy anxiety; night falls and bodies rest, but emotional tachometers spike and minds race as swiftly as the copious Frankensteined vehicles. There are also unexpected moments of grace and bravery from Joe’s five brides — introduced as a formless group but ideologically individuated by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. The entire cast, really, is physically attuned to the import of motion and gesture in establishing a growing, if begrudging, camaraderie among this thrown-together platoon. It’s a herculean effort matched by everyone below the line. Composer Junkie XL’s mix of the martial and melancholy propels the film at all the right points. Margaret Sixel and Jason Ballantine have edited the film with precision timing and clarity. And there’s detail to marvel over in every corner of the frame from costume designer Jenny Beavan and production designer Colin Gibson. But there’s also so much beautiful subtext beneath the spectacle. There’s a pitched battle of religious purity and perversion between Immortan Joe and a late-arriving faction of warriors. There’s the literalized take on the crucible of personal faith that sweet deliverance awaits you down a long road of despair and despondency. Miller bravely folds that idea into both an exciting exaltation of glorious mythological warmongering … and the way similar stories are spun in spiritual justification for gruesome acts of terrorism. And just as John Seale’s rampaging camera pauses just long enough to admire smoke billowing off Furiosa’s pistol, it also rests on affecting humanity, such as when a mortally wounded comrade reaches, without panic, to cradle treasured earthen tchotchkes. Amid the frenzy flipped vehicles and fireballs, these are the things to which you’ll find your mind unexpectedly returning. They’re among the various, sundry and oh-so-welcome side effects of Fury Road, an unforgettable, habit-forming rush you’ll crave again and again (and probably again) as a way to mainline the very reason we go to movies in the first place.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Not the story, mind you; that's actually pretty simple. In our ruined future, the Wasteland is run by a grotesque, misshapen tyrant called King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has a harem of wives to beget his posterity, and keeps a tight rein on his subjects by controlling the meager water supply. A loner named Max (Tom Hardy) runs afoul of Joe and finds common ground with one of Joe's own officers, a 1.5-armed badass called Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). What follows is essentially a feature-length car chase, with Joe's ferocious albino kamikaze soldiers pursuing Max, Furiosa and their small band of survivors, both sides attacking each other without bothering to pull over first. Most of the battle takes place in, on and under the speeding vehicles, which are fortified with armor and essentials like flamethrowers and spiked tires. Amazingly, Miller paces the almost nonstop action so that it's neither tiresome nor hard to follow. No shaky-cam here; we see the spectacular stunts and choreographed fights in full clarity. The details of Miller's near-future world are a delightful hodgepodge of influences and traditions, hinting at a treasure trove of back story. That compensates for the present characters being merely serviceable rather than memorable—not that such things matter when you're staring goggle-eyed at high-velocity mayhem.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Step 1: Describe Mad Max: Fury Road in three words: Holy freaking hell! This is one of those rare cases in which a trailer, which completely blows your socks off, is actually only a taste of what you’re going to experience in the theater. This incredible cinematic masterpiece takes you on a high-octane acid trip that gloriously assaults your senses… and yes, if you could just imagine some of the smells, even that sense, too. Mad Max: Fury Road is probably one the best action movies you’ll ever see… EVER. Step 2: Keep the story tight. Although the title suggests something different, Fury Road is really Imperator Furiosa’s story. In the post-apocalyptic wasteland nightmare she finds herself living in, Furiosa (brilliantly played by Charlize Theron) has one mission: to return to her “green” home after years toiling as a truck-driving flunky to a megalomaniac named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who, if you are a Mad Max connoisseur, is the same actor who played the wacked-out evil dude in the original Mad Max). They reside in a lush place called The Citadel, two tall rock formations that overlook hordes of starving, thirsty desert denizens who just wait for Joe to shower them with water, aka “aqua-cola,” every so often. Furiosa has had enough of Joe and in her quest to escape, decides to rescue his five baby-making “wives,” too.  So, they secretly pile into Furiosa’s rig and on a planned trek to get more “guzz-o-line,” they run. And then they are pursued, in one spectacular chase sequence after another (more on that in a bit). Step 3: Live up to your name. Now that we know how Furiosa feels about things, where does Mad Max fit in? The iconic reluctant hero, played with quiet ferociousness by Tom Hardy, has been captured by Joe’s men and finds himself an unwitting participant in said chase, eventually helping Furiosa and the girls. Hardy’s Max is a slight change to the character Mel Gibson indelibly implanted in our brains 30 plus years ago, but Max is still a man of few words, loves his car and gets pissed off when you steal it. Hardy aptly shows us this tortured soul, haunted by his past, who truly never wants to get involved but always ends up doing so anyway, grunting in protest. Paired with Hardy’s subtle performance is Theron’s powerful one. Her Furiosa has seen some shit go down, and all she wants now is peace and as she puts it, “redemption.” As this intense warrior queen, wearing black grease that make her beautiful eyes pop, Theron just pours the determination, kindness –and weariness — into this incredibly kickass character. These two excellent actors only elevate the already superb proceedings. Step 4: Go along on said acid trip. The supporting cast also does a fine job portraying what it would be like living in this very desolate, dying and strange world. Director George Miller just loves the weird, and in a post-apocalyptic setting, where, famine, dehydration, disease and desperation run rampant, he can paint just about any milieu he wants. There are ghoulish crow people on stilts, a severely deformed Citadel lookout and other characters with names like The Doof Warrior, The People Eater and The Bullet Farmer. There are also these creepy little bald-headed children, painted in white, who grow up to be aggressive young men known as War Boys, who battle at Immortan Joe’s request and scream “VALHALLA” a lot. Nicholas Hoult plays one these boys, a brainwashed soldier who finally gets a clearer understanding of the world outside the Citadel when he encounters Furiosa and Joe’s wives. Those lovelies are portrayed by Zoe Kravitz, model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton, who thankfully bring much-needed beauty to the otherwise bleak surroundings. My favorite, however, is Immortan Joe’s stereo car. Its sole purpose is to provide a running soundtrack as they rush into the chase, with guys playing drums in the back and a horribly disfigured dude in a skull mask in front, wailing on a guitar that spews fire. It cracked me up every time it was on screen. Step 5: Bow down to George Miller. This Australian auteur has never been properly given his due. Sure, the Oscar win for Happy Feet counts but not like this. It’s time to honor Miller; Fury Road is an unparalleled marvel in filmmaking. Future action directors should learn from this 70-year-old that it’s possible to create action without a ton of CGI. From mind-blowing frenetic action, complete with some unbelievable stunts, to the bleak, orange tones of the desert wasteland, to the weird oddities described above, Miller finally realizes the Mad Max world he’s been living in for these many years. Along with all those elements, you add a score from Junkie XL that sends shock waves and chills through the theater. Then there are the themes in Fury Road: Hope vs. fear, finding redemption, searching for a new normal that doesn’t include despots with boils on their back. And finally, Miller makes a feminist movie to break the bank, never cow towing to any stereotypes but creating these fierce, beautiful women who clearly should be running the show. Step 6: Time to stop gushing. Okay, I’ll end my Mad Max: Fury Road love fest, but heed this advice: Don’t wait for it to come out on Blu-ray or on some streaming platform. See it in the theaters NOW because Fury Road embodies everything you love about going to the movies.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," The third’s the charm. Mad Max: Fury Road, director George Miller’s reboot of his own ’70s-’80s post-apocalyptic Road Warrior trilogy, literally leaves ’em in the dust. Between Thunderdome (1985) and now, Miller, 70, ventured into different fare, including kids’ entertainments such as Babe and Happy Feet. But the man clearly knows how to stage outsize mayhem. In fact, he demonstrates an abiding faith in pure cinematic action that is especially refreshing after having to sit through Vin Diesel burbling about “family” between car chases in Furious 7 or Robert Downey vainly trying to justify messing with a malevolent artificial intelligence in Age of Ultron. Back to the future: Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy takes over from Mad Mel Gibson) is an ex-cop who has evidently suffered catastrophic losses when the world went to hell. (We can only infer via flashbacks and hallucinations they are slightly different losses from the ones Max suffered in the 1979 movie Mad Max, but the bottom line is that he failed to protect his family.) The trauma has left him somewhat unhinged. He, himself, is captured by a desert cult leader known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max), a ruthless fiend who holds the power of life and death over hundreds of desert survivors, and invokes loyalty akin to religious fervour. But a challenger arises from his own ranks. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has absconded with a war truck to seek the Eden-like refuge of her childhood homeland, and she’s taken Joe’s own harem/breeding stock (whose gorgeous ranks include Zoë Kravitz and Rosie Huntington-Whitely). On her trail are different war parties, all savage scavengers, including bald-pated “war-boy” Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who has acquired the hostage Max as his own personal blood bank. After a protracted, breathtakingly exciting desert chase, Max finds himself in Furiosa’s camp, a male in a mini-matriarchy, seen in one significant moment washing blood off his face with a cache of stored mother’s milk. Mostly, however, Miller delivers really impressive action. Unlike the original trilogy, Miller does avail himself of some digital tinkering, especially when Furiosa drives her truck directly into a devastating sandstorm/tornado to evade her pursuers. But the vast majority of action is still done practically, with stunt experts and actors risking injury and death with an assortment of outrageous activities, including an assault on the war truck using vehicles tricked out with long poles that swing from side to side: Imagine a cross between a monster truck rally and a Cirque du Soleil road show gone bad. As Max, Tom Hardy brings a certain understated eccentricity to the role while efficiently handling the elaborate physical stuff. Charlize Theron lives up to her character’s name with a laser-intense performance. Miller, who scripted with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris, does deliver a change-up to distinguish this entry from the Gibson trilogy, adding an unprecedented feminine dimension to the action that goes beyond the “Warrior Woman” character of The Road Warrior or Tina Turner’s ruthless Queen Bee in Beyond Thunderdome. These women are fighting to rise above their status as breeding stock and chattel.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015","  The rush  to christen  “Mad Max: Fury Road” — director/co-writer George Miller’s return to a genre he was so instrumental in shaping —  a masterpiece seems hasty.  There’s little denying that this hurtling, hard-caroming post-apocalyptic movie   — which features Tom Hardy in the title role — feels like the start of something. That’s a nick as  much as it is a promise.  “That’s all there was,” the other replied. Which sounded  less like a criticism than an succinct  observation that “story” doesn’t gain much  traction in this nonstop chase flick. Having made a steady, persuasive march toward this star turn, Hardy contains a different energy from Gibson. He comes across as more curled in upon himself than manic. So this new “Mad Max” is bound to be different, too.  Still, his backstory is set. He is the former cop who lost his wife and their infant to outlaw/death-cult violence and began wandering the dust, resisting connection but being drawn into conflict.  What “Fury Road” forgoes in narrative rhythms it more than makes up for in archetype-teasing themes. It  is a stiff cocktail of contemporary (and not) anxieties about war, gender, death.   Men — Max as the exception  — really are  from an angry red planet with little water. A group of female warriors and rough-hewn nurturers are called the  Vuvalini.  Chief villain Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is a resource manipulator of the first order. An early scene finds him donning his bizarre snarl mask before addressing the masses below the  stone edifice known as the Citadel. Pontificate. Turn on the spigot. Watch the unfortunate clamor and beseech. Turn off the flow. Preach a little more.  Prior to the  renegade tanker driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) going so fantastically rogue, her destination is Gas Town. There’s also an outpost called  Bullet Farm.  Blood, too, has become a  premium fluid. Before the film hits its ravaged road, Max is kept alive as a transfusion body. A “blood bag” is how his serum recipient Nux refers to him.   War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) embodies both the vulnerability and lethal disregard of the manboy soldier. Gung-ho, he is also expendable to the powers that be.   Max  may be a loner, but he is not alone.   There’s nothing reluctant about Theron’s Furiosa.   She’s on a mission from the get-go to take the Wives, Immortan Joe’s  bevy of imprisoned (quasi-coddled)  lovelies,  to a safe place she remembers from her own riven past.  Word has it that Miller has secured the talents of  Hardy for the presumptive sequels.  If so, he’d do well to retain Theron’s services, too.  In a sense, the director  has taken his tale back to its cultish future. “Fury Road” is nearly as resistant to story as that first, utterly strange Aussie flick was. Few studio films aspire to be operatic.  “Fury Road” offers  violent aria after brutal  aria — sonically and visually. The violence often is so swift and chaotic that we have  little time to grasp  its impact. Though, in some more disquieting  way, we  may feel it.  According to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who plays one of the Wives,    Miller invited playwright Eve Ensler to the set to coach the actresses in wartime sexual violence. The force behind “The Vagina Monologues,” Ensler also helped establish the safe village for victims of sexual violence,   City of Joy in the Congo. Whiteley portrays  Immortan Joe’s most prized vessel, the Splendid Angharad.  “Fury Road” won’t be to everyone’s tastes. It’s  too cruelly anarchic. And there’s a danger its thought-provoking nods to gender theory are likely to get lost in the noise and love of the chase.  For instance, in a wild  update of an image from “Road Warrior,” Immortan Joe has his own rock-band-of-one violently strumming an electric guitar throughout the chase.  Even so, there’s enough horror remixed here — of the “Heart of Darkness” version — to engage our current moment. That should be  one of the obligations of a reboot. And it’s  almost reason enough to wonder what might happen when  Furiosa and Max hit the road again in the near, and ugly, future. ",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road provokes the same question from its audience again and again: What can you show me next? The answer is always the same: Something even more outlandish and imaginative than what you just saw. George Miller, the Australian action wizard responsible for 1979's Mad Max, 1981's  Road Warrior and 1985's Beyond Thunderdome, has upped the ante on his post-apocalyptic steampunk vision. Fury Road is louder, bloodier, grimier and more relentless than its predecessors. But it's never needlessly flashy. It revels in the retro by embracing human stunt work and using CGI as a complement where so many movies of this ilk work the other way around. The barren desert world traversed by Tom Hardy's Max and Charlize Theron's Furiosa is laden with blood, scars, chrome, dirt and automotive contraptions that might have escaped a sci-fi lowrider convention. (I'm particularly fond of the muscle car on tank treads.) It very rarely pauses to catch its breath. There's just enough dialogue to tell a primal story of survival and rebirth. ""I live, I die, I live again."" That's the mantra of an ambitious slave (Nicholas Hoult, his lips made up to look like a baseball seam without the red). Of course he doesn't really want to die; that would mean missing the next frantic chase. Fury Road does what it does so well that you're quick to cut it slack on the rare occasion when the storytelling gets squishy. Miller is a surrealist who loves to get his hands stained with flesh, blood and dust. The movie's impromptu medical maneuvers include a merciless Caesarean birth and a high-speed blood transfusion. Miller's most vivid imagery is always shot through with organic touches, including a warlord whose breathing machine bares real teeth and a slave labor system with elaborate gears and a sheer scale out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. For a movie of such otherworldly visual flourishes, Fury Road is remarkably tactile and even old-fashioned in its action execution. The stunt work's integrity and jaw-dropping conception would bring a smile to the face of Yakima Canutt, the stunt wizard who helped bring the motion to some of John Wayne and John Ford's most graceful work. Except these guys aren't jumping from stagecoaches to horses. They're leaping from monster rigs and firing shotguns as they swing back and forth on giant poles. The story recalls another one of the best action movies in recent years, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men. Furiosa enrages chief warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by absconding with all of his wives, who also happen to be his kingdom's breeders. Their destination: ""The green place,"" where they can start a new civilization, and where they're not forced to harvest their mother's milk. Fertility equals survival. With Theron getting her Sigourney Weaver on (she provides as much of the movie's muscle as Hardy), and the story's emphasis on the role of women, Fury Road should provide grist for plenty of theses on the feminist action movie. But the best story here is Miller himself, the old-school action director coming back to show the youngsters how it's done. Quick, show me some more. Mad Max: Fury Road serves up one adrenaline fix after another.",NEGATIVE
"May 14, 2015"," “Mad Max: Fury Road” marks the fourth time George Miller has returned to the world of his iconic vengeful marauder, making his way across a post-punk desert wasteland. And yet there’s never been a movie quite like this — avant-garde action cinema on an enormous scale that manages to be utterly original and suffused with a rebellion against patriarchy that is thrilling to watch in this form. The plot is deceptively simple: loner Max (Tom Hardy, skillfully replacing Mel Gibson) is roped into helping Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and five women escape the clutches of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome warlord who looks like a drugged-up, muscular blowup doll behind a teeth-baring mask. It unfolds across a gargantuan landscape (actually Namibia) that combines the rusty dystopian aesthetic of the original trilogy with an expressionist sensibility offering a full-scale immersion in a world of symphonic craziness. The movie plays like an apocalyptic fever dream, in which shaved henchmen covered in ghostly white body paint sacrifice themselves for trips to “Valhalla,” enormous dust clouds engulf the characters amid flashes of red and orange and the bad guys’ entourage includes a man in a bright red jump suit shredding on an electric guitar that blasts out flames. Amid a summer season largely defined by dull franchises, this movie represents an anomaly: It’s a work of imagination utterly unchecked by the usual constraints, in which a brilliant cinematic mind fuses his sense of kinetic action cinema with psychedelic visual montage. The picture rejects the constant cutting and overt exposition that have become hallmarks of the genre. It tells its story through images, sound design and fluid camera movements that practically lift you out of your chair and place you on the fury road alongside Max. The real protagonist here, though, the real discovery, is Theron’s steely-eyed, intense Furiosa, a female action hero unlike any we’ve seen, and perhaps the harbinger of a new age in which strong big-screen women no longer need a man to save them.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Over half of Mad Max: Fury Road unfolds in action-spectacle nirvana. Movement, images, and some plucky actors carry all the emotion and humor a movie of this scale needs, and its kinetic force delivers an adrenaline boost to your system. In the years Australian filmmaker George Miller spent reworking the script with comic-book artist Brendan McCarthy and actor-dramaturge Nico Lathouris (who played Grease Rat over 35 years ago in Mad Max) he found ways of plunging into a dystopia that’s at once baroque and bananas, without pausing for exposition or an extraneous gesture or syllable. Like a great workout, the best parts leave you feeling happily spent. Set in a fortress city-state run as a religious cult and the wasteland surrounding it, Mad Max: Fury Road contains the most bizarrely detailed and enthralling demolition derbies ever staged. But at its best it also plays like an inspired mashup of movies like Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Fred Niblo's Ben-Hur—silent epics that captivate audiences with their imagination, power, and panache. Max is still a bit of a lug, brooding over barren landscapes and occasionally mumbling an existential homily. (“In this wasteland, I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead. A man reduced to a single instinct: survive.”) But his mulish road-warrior integrity makes him the perfect guide into postapocalyptic settings that for once are emotionally primordial and logistically complex. In the greased-lightning setup, Max, played by Tom Hardy in his trademark brooding mode, hightails through the Plains of Silence in his customized Interceptor (a modified Australian Ford Falcon V-8). In what feels like a nanosecond, male warriors in white body and face paint—the “War Boys”—intercept him while screaming like banshees. They haul him into The Citadel, where they brand him with its logo—a death’s-head in a steering wheel—and cage him in the Blood Bank as a “donor” for ailing soldiers in their ranks. The opening is split as dangerously and neatly as a serpent's tongue between Max's fate and that of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a skinheaded Amazon who drives the Citadel's weaponized fuel truck, the War Rig. The Citadel’s ruler and Furiosa’s commander is the warlord and self-styled demigod Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who wears a mask over his mouth, jaw, and neck, complete with super-long horse teeth and heavy-duty breathing tubes and filters. He also sports Plexiglas armor to parade his metals and girdle his tumors and flab. His wild mane of whitish hair and laser-like glare fuse his menacing appearance, and Keays-Byrne (who played Toecutter in Mad Max) spits commands with the full-bodied fustian of a man who's accustomed to being obeyed. When he orders Furiosa to make a fuel run to Gas Town, he has no reason to believe she won't follow his orders. Furiosa dares to go rogue. Before she does, Miller tells us everything we want to know and are afraid to ask about the Citadel. The director visualizes Joe’s grotesque domain in fierce, hinged tableaux that come together with a snap. In a towering, craggy natural compound, as majestic as Monument Valley and as eerie as Australia’s Ayers Rock, Miller erects a rocky kingdom on an aquifer. Joe’s monopoly on water allows him to build a society based on rabid devotion—to himself. Chutes in the mountainside mete out daily floods of “Aqua Cola” to lowly Citadel-dwellers, as loudspeakers pipe warnings about “water addiction.” This pure H20 has become the be-all, end-all; the environment is generally so polluted that malformations and cancers rampage through the population. Joe fills caves far removed from the mob with greenery from hydroponics and machines that pump milk from lactating women for his family and soldiers. Down below, various dungeons swell with captives. High above, Joe's sons man the observation room: one is a giant, muscled warrior who has a slow-moving brain and much more modest inhaling tubes while the other is physically stunted but has an active, adult mind. Joe has convinced the unwashed hordes that he is divine and has persuaded the War Boys that dying in combat will elevate them to Valhalla. But Joe never forgets that he's a mortal who needs a proper heir to hold his fiefdom together. So for him it's a primal and a political tragedy when he goes into his harem and finds it empty except for his five wives' caretaker. On the walls are scrawled chalk messages, including “We Are Not Things.” It's marvelous how Miller reveals the workings of Joe’s system, tossing off exquisitely wrought images in a way that also fixes them in memory. He and editor Margaret Sixel imbue the film with a propulsive tempo. Their rhythmic magic comes partly from the sight and sound of minions pounding on drums, setting a beat for the men who work the winches to labor in unison. They're like the drummers who keep galley slaves rowing as one in toga movies (notably Niblo’s Ben-Hur), except these drummers work en masse, in a setting as topsy-turvy and vertiginous as the city in Metropolis. To enter Joe's sanctum, visitors must be winched up, but some of the operations rooms and dungeons are farther up or down or sideways. These dizzying catacombs operate not just on fealty and regimentation but also on adolescent testosterone. The War Boys whip themselves into a kamikaze frenzy before an altar of V-8 steering wheels. Among the War Boys champing at the bit for battle is the pivotal character Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who knows that his “half-life” is ending thanks to a couple of tumors he nicknames Larry and Barry. He wants one last chance to enter Valhalla in glory. Opportunity knocks when Furiosa takes an unannounced detour from her Gas Town route, and Joe reckons that she's hidden the women in the War Rig. Max's blood has been pouring into Nux via an intravenous drip. Nux gets the mad inspiration to strap Max to the front of his car with the blood apparatus attached to a facemask, an image that recalls pirates using Romans as makeshift prow-heads and battering rams in Ben-Hur. What ensues is a freak-out blend of super-charged chariot race and phantasmagoric war movie. Combatant drivers try to bounce each other into oblivion or grind on each other's wheels. Lancers toss spear-mounted grenades. Miller and his brilliant cinematographer, John Seales, shoot with multiple cameras from wildly different angles so that fighting breaks out in every corner of the screen and it still makes lunatic sense. Every character and act becomes even crazier in this film's great arid outdoors, but they all remain comprehensible. Instead of a regimental band, the War Boys have a hard-rock guitarist whose axe shoots fire, backed by a phalanx of taiko drummers. That's what I call Burning Man. With Hardy hidden behind a mask for roughly 45 minutes, two other superb performers take up the slack of connecting with an audience. Hoult delivers a high-pitched tour-de-force as Nux, which is all the more touching and scary because of his improbable exuberance. When Immortan Joe glances in his direction and the War Boy believes that he’s made eye contact with his immortal leader, Nux screams: “He looked at me! He looked at me!” Nux is certain his leader is telling him that he's awaited in Valhalla. The depth of Nux's exultation prepares you for the evolution of his character. The other astonishing performer is Theron. In her first tight close-up, she looks in the rearview mirror—and seems to be looking right at us. With her head shaved and her body toned, she gives a display of intelligence and emotion that's alternately telepathic and balletic. Whether she's coolly taking Max's measure or hiding her anxiety about protecting her precious cargo, she lets us know exactly what Furiosa is thinking. When her prosthetic arm is ripped off in a fight, Theron, not the makeup and digital-effect artists, conveys how vulnerable Furiosa feels without her device. Theron is inspiring when she pours intuition and lifeblood into this damaged character, and heartbreaking when she shows it ebbing away. But because of Theron’s talent and conviction, you never count Furiosa out. Hardy does pull off a difficult feat as Mad Max: his commitment to the character includes doing enough of the daredevil stunts that you never catch the substitution of his stunt double. Hardy's specialty has often been making qualities like ruefulness and alienation dynamic. Max keeps his distance from all the others, so Hardy draws on his own eruptive charisma to throw off a dramatic force field. In his slyest moment, he shoots an ally a minimalist thumb’s up. What hems Hardy in is Miller's determination to keep Max tethered to his loner mythos. By the climax, it reaches a ludicrous extreme: when Max wanders off this time, he seems to doom the human race; there isn’t another healthy man in sight. But the movie runs out of steam before that. Miller wants to contrast the rock-and-roll rococo stylings of the Citadel and battle scenes with the fresh simplicity of the runaway women—youthful knockouts clad in wispy scraps of cotton and muslin. Miller does his best to individualize them, as do the fetching, talented performers (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton). Most successfully (and movingly) Keough's “Capable” undertakes War Boy Nux's emotional rehabilitation. But you know as little about their pasts as you do about the addled wives in Tommy Lee Jones's The Homesman.  Furiosa tells them that together they'll reach “The Green Place,” her homeland, from which Joe had snatched her as a child. It's too Of Mice and Men for this wised-up movie: she appears poised to talk about how they'll “live off the fatta the lan'” and “get to tend the rabbits.” It doesn't prove so simple, but the ensuing disappointments and reversals don't match the imaginative richness of the buildup. Your heart may sink, as mine did, when the action pulls not just a 180, but a complete 360. Happily, by then, Miller has introduced enough new ingredients to keep his pot boiling, including a can-do clutch of sharp-shooting older women called the Vuvalini (notably Megan Gale as “The Valkyrie” and Melissa Jaffer as “Keeper of the Seeds”). Even when Miller's unmatched action pyrotechnics begin to feel like the same ol', same ol', he comes up with revitalizing flourishes. In the climactic battle, War Boy lancers perch on vaulting poles attached to Joe’s attack cars; they sway over enemy vehicles and lob grenades right into them. My favorite moment, though, is a quiet one. As the runaway women take in a coruscating starscape, one of the Vuvalini points out what she says is a satellite that used to convey information around the world. “Shows,” one of the women says. “Everybody had a show.” Has there ever been a subtler, wittier, or more gorgeous tribute to social media? After the international sensation of the original Mad Max in 1979 and 1980, Miller decided that he'd tapped into the deep mythic roots of the loner hero. I wish Miller had drawn a different lesson. Working quickly and on hunches, a seat-of-the-pants filmmaker can capture a global mood. By setting a revenge epic in the bleak near future, he'd created a scabrous, funny, nihilistic fantasy for audiences who were weary of political cowardice and duplicity, a counterculture turned sour, expensive and frustrating oil shortages, spikes in inflation, and the first onslaughts of international terrorism. Drawing on his experiences as an emergency-room doctor and a boy growing up in Chinchilla in rural Queensland, Mad Max united the grisliness of the scary “educational” films that once were shown to high school kids before prom night with a sense of “the sticks” as a scary place to be in the mid-to-late 20th century. And, of course, it had a command of energies colliding in widescreen space comparable to Sam Peckinpah's. (For a price that fit his puny budget, Miller reportedly bought wide-screen camera lenses that had been used on Peckinpah's 1972 The Getaway.) Miller has become a giant of big-audience moviemaking, with credits like the freakishly beautiful and original Babe: Pig in the City (98, after producing Babe), the infectious tap-dancing penguin cartoon Happy Feet (06), the rigorously veracious medical drama Lorenzo's Oil (92), and a virtuoso remake of “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” in The Twilight Zone—The Movie (83). But his two previous Mad Max sequels, The Road Warrior (81) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (85) have become his most iconic movies. And although there are wonderful segments in each, they are also self-conscious pieces of mythmaking. For my money, they lack both the tabloid energy and seize-the-day freshness of the first Mad Max. With Mad Max: Fury Road, Miller comes full circle, returning to his Mad Max roots and emerging as The Compleat Action Artist. He does make a lamentable wrong turn midway through, but his drollery, smarts and rock-opera sensibility permeate the movie. It's telling that Miller named this chapter of the Mad Max saga for Furiosa. His movie proclaims that sisterhood is powerful and proves that a heroine can be more exciting than a hero as a loner archetype. It’s unfortunate that the female-bonding part is conventional and even vaporous compared to the movie’s postapocalyptic world building. But when Theron glares into the War Rig's rearview mirror, what the audience sees is a bold feminist future.",POSITIVE

Potential ticket-buyers born the day the most recent Mad Max movie was released — summer 1985, one weekend after Back to the Future -- could be on their second marriages by now. The original Mad Max, from 1979, cost less than $1 million in 2015 money. Though an international hit, today it plays more like a scrappy curiosity than a great action picture, notable for introducing the world to 23-year-old Mel Gibson, whose personal dystopian hellscape was still decades off. Its sequel, released in these United States as The Road Warrior, is the original trio's only essential entry. But even that lo-fi, high-impact classic now looks like a mere sketch for the long-under-construction Mad Max: Fury Road, a kinetic, hallucinatory, boldly feminist chase flick that, with its vibrant color palette, harrowing stunt work and show-don't-tell style of yarn-spinning, leaves every Marvel movie and every Fast & Furious in its irradiated dust. It's the most visceral blockbuster since Gravity, and it reinvigorates the doomsday genre like no film since The Matrix. Director George Miller, plucked-from-retirement cinematographer John Seale, and editors Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel render its overwhelmingly analog derring-do in a balletic and fluid legato, rather than the thudding staccato of a younger, more loudmouthed car-chase franchise that lives its life a quarter mile at a time (and never, ever shuts up about it). If Fury Road has a moral, it's the same one screenwriting professors have been reiterating since chase movies starred Steve McQueen: Action is character. Words? They're just talk. Tom Hardy, replacing Gibson as Max with as little explanation as when James Bond swaps faces, is nearly as tight-lipped in the role as Gibson was. (Miller co-wrote the script with Nick Lathouris and veteran British comics artist Brendan McCarthy, who also contributed to eye-popping design work.) When he does speak, he sounds as if he's just snuck up on Vin Diesel during one of his slurry monologues and swallowed him whole. Mercifully brief narration – from Max himself this time, a change the earlier movies – sets the table: He was a cop, in the last days of civilization. After motorbike-riding droogs ran down his wife and child, he wandered into the desert. Now he's driven only to survive, so he says, but here he is again, defending the vulnerable against the cruel for a third time. Make that co-defending. Charlize Theron shares a movie-opening title card with Hardy and pulls a Linda Hamilton-in-Terminator 2, elbowing the title character out of the way to become the film's true protagonist. She plays Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed ""war rig"" jockey who paints her face with engine grease before going into battle on behalf of the water-hoarding warlord Immortan Joe. The McGuffins in his installment are, like Soylent Green, people: Specifically, Joe's five jealously guarded slave ""wives,"" one of whom is carrying his child. Save for Joe's son, they're the only humans in the movie not visibly afflicted by cancer or gout or pallor or a missing limb. Except for Max, of course – and he's crazier than Don Quixote. (He sees dead people now, and it's starting to degrade his combat effectiveness.) Anyway, Furiosa goes rogue to help these women escape. Wonder of wonders, we're not subjected to a cinemas-interruptus monologue where she tells us why. We get why. Theron's eyes show us why. Max eventually becomes her ally through happenstance, not heroism: He was a Immortan Joe's captive, too, kept alive for use as a ""blood bag"" for Joe's chalk-skinned ""warboys."" In one scene, he takes a few errant shots with a rifle before handing it, along with the movie, over to Furiosa. Her aim proves true. Miller invited Vagina Monologues playwright Eve Ensler to the set in Namibia to help the cast try to understand the perspective of victims of sexual violence in war zones. A tall order for a summer popcorn flick, putting it mildly, not to mention for a film that, for all its brutality, sustains a lighter tone than most superhero films of recent vintage. (The sight gags are straight out of a Road Runner cartoon.) But it's all of a piece. The feminist and ecological payload of the movie is so inseparable from its simple narrative of flight and pursuit that it never feels didactic. It feels, well, visionary. That's also true of the keenly observed anthropological details of the sunny hellscape Miller & Co. have created: It's a yellow desert with a liquid blue sky, wherein sickly warboys spray chrome on their faces in the hope of proving themselves ""shiny"" in battle. An elderly woman carries various seeds on her back her through the wastes in the slender hope of replanting the world. There are a handful of callbacks to the earlier movies – including a running gag about the unreliability of old shotgun shells – but they don't call undue attention to themselves. In a pleasing bit of symmetry, the corrupt, red-eyed Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, the same actor who appeared as Toecutter, leader of the gang of art-school sadists who killed Max's family in the 1979 original. Nicholas Hoult gives a terrific performance as Nux, a tumor-pocked child soldier who becomes, briefly, a real boy. And Theron deserves another Oscar. And let's also have one for Miller, who's been trying to get this movie made for at least 15 years. After delays ranging from September 11th to the Iraq War to original star Gibson's public dissolution to unexpected rainfall in Australia, he finally began shooting... in 2012, which was a while ago. George Lucas, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson all returned to this sort of epic fantasy/sci-fi after long sabbaticals, and all of them seemed to have lost, to greater or lesser degrees, the storytelling instincts that had served them so faithfully as younger, hungrier artists. Not so with Miller, whose three-decade second act as a maker of family-friendly films (two installments in the porcine Babe franchise, plus two penguine Happy Feet) has only made him a bolder and more energetic maestro of vehicular Thunderdome. Now, he's willed into existence a $150 million tentpole that doesn't condescend and feels like the coherent statement of a singular artist. If he can pull that off, how about an Imperator Furiosa action figure?",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," It's less irrational than it sounds that the three scarcest commodities in the post-apocalyptic world envisioned by ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" — gasoline, bullets and water — are expended with an almost lunatic profligacy. Flame-belching vehicles tear across a parched, terra-cotta landscape, their drivers firing guns like cowboys in a western. When H2O is handed out to a population dying of thirst, it comes not in bottles or jugs, but as a cataract gushing from giant pipes extending from the top of a desert cliff, so that the citizens below are only able to lap at the mist thrown up by the cascading torrent. It is this wastefulness, the film suggests, that has led to the wasteland that the movie portrays: a nightmare world of desperate self-absorption populated by a race of mutants who have been poisoned, bodily and spiritually, by their own egotistic overindulgence. “Mad Max’s” hero — the titular crazed loner who is shown at the start of the film munching on a two-headed lizard that he has just crushed underfoot — is described by the narrator as “a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.” To say that there is also a monomania to the film is, if anything, an understatement. But it is precisely that sense of tunnel vision that makes “Fury Road” such a pulse-pounding pleasure. When Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by the members of a warrior encampment known as the Citadel and (at first ineffectually) tries to escape, director George Miller’s camera renders that opening sequence — in surprisingly effective 3-D — as though it were playing on 4x fast-forward. Whether you are thrown from the vehicle depends entirely on you. Some viewers will never be able to hang on through the story’s careening disregard for sense, logic or moderation. I advise them not to even try. But if you know whose car you’re getting in — it helps to have seen at least one of Miller’s three previous “Mad Max” films, but it is not required — you’re in for one heck of a ride. Generally paralleling the chase-themed plot of Miller's second ""Mad Max"" film (released in the United States in 1982 as ""The Road Warrior""), ""Fury Road"" tracks an extended vehicular pursuit, with Max and several other characters in the lead, and a small army of hunters pulling up the rear. It's like a monster-truck motocross competition staged by a more nihilistic version of Cirque du Soleil, where the stakes are life and death. It also comes complete with its own heavy metal soundtrack, courtesy of an on-camera musician who, throughout the chase, accompanies the breakneck action on an electric guitar played from a platform mounted on one of the film's speeding vehicles. That this rock god periodically shoots fire from the neck of his axe, as if it were powered by napalm, is, of course, entirely laughable. Go ahead and guffaw. If you’re not capable of appreciating the humor in any of this, including the at times over-the-top violence, you’re in the wrong theater. In addition to amping up the vehicular mayhem from the earlier “Mad Max” canon, Miller’s reboot of the story (co-written with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) deviates in one critical and satisfying way from “The Road Warrior.” Whereas the cargo that Max was transporting in that film was a tanker full of gasoline, his freight here is a group of young women who are fleeing servitude as “breeders,” or child-bearing slaves, back in the Citadel. His co-pilot, a Citadel fugitive called Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is in every sense Max’s equal. That both characters are psychologically damaged — Max by the murders of his wife and child, seen only in flashback; and Furiosa by having been kidnapped into slavery as a child — darkens the corners of this already dark tale, and deepens Max and Furiosa’s connection. A third antihero is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a disillusioned former foot soldier from the Citadel who has switched allegiances, having come to doubt his supreme leader’s promises of immortality through self-sacrifice. If the character of Nux suggests a disenchanted suicide bomber, it’s surely intentional. That’s underscored by the theme of the Citadel’s oppression of women, and by Hugh Keays-Byrne’s portrayal of the Citadel’s deranged leader, known as Immortan Joe, as fiery demagogue. There’s an unsubtle — and welcome — feminism here, in the appearance, late in the film, of a band of badass older women, one of whom, known as the Keeper of the Seeds, is played by the 78-year-old Melissa Jaffer. She and Theron wonderfully balance out the film’s high-octane testosterone with a blast of power-nurturing. But don’t get too wrapped up in deeper meaning. “Fury Road” is less about estrogen than adrenaline. Gorgeously art-directed, from the film’s souped-up unfunny cars to the tribal costumes and make-up to the bleakly breathtaking cinematography of the Namibian desert, it’s a case of style triumphantly squashing substance. Much of it makes little sense, such as the Citadel’s reliance on tanks of breast milk, generated by bare-bosomed earthmothers, or the script’s frequent references to the Citadel’s doomed soldiers’ having “half-lives,” which can only be extended by transfusions from living ""blood bags” such as Max. The “Mad Max” franchise was never for everyone, yet it clearly benefits from fresh blood, too. Propelled by Miller’s nitro-burning aesthetic vision and an entertaining cast, this turbo-charged new model is a gas, gas, gas.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," “Mad Max: Fury Road” will leave you speechless, which couldn’t be more appropriate. Words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barn-burner of a post-apocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling, unsettling images are the order of the day. As directed by George Miller in a reanimation of the “Mad Max/Road Warrior” franchise he began in 1979, “Fury Road” is so action intensive and non-dialogue dependent that it began not with a proper script but with about 3,500 storyboard panels detailing an endless string of adrenalized events in a bleak and savage future world where water is king but chaos rules. Costarring the protean Tom Hardy (re-creating the Max Rockatansky character originated by Mel Gibson) and a shaved-headed Charlize Theron, “Fury Road” is essentially one nonstop, two-hour chase with the bad guys in constant hot and heavy pursuit of the few good folks left in this scary, derelict and deviant world. If you think that doesn’t sound involving, you haven’t been paying attention. The idea, explains Miller (credited as screenwriter with comic artist Brendan McCarthy and dramaturg Nico Lathouris) was inspired by “Alfred Hitchcock’s notion about making films that can be watched anywhere in the world without subtitles. ... They take you to a place outside yourself, and you come out the other end having had an experience.” Just so. Working with Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (who came out of retirement to do this), Miller decided that as much of “Fury Road” as possible would be shot without digital effects. With the help of new tools like the Edge Arm system, a camera crane that extends more than 20 feet and handles a full range of motion, Miller kept multiple physical stunts running at the same time (Guy Norris was the accomplished second unit director and stunt coordinator) and ended up shooting an estimated 480 hours of adrenalized footage. Dealing with all of this was Miller’s longtime collaborator, nonpareil editor Margaret Sixel, who manages the neat trick of neither lingering too long on any shot or rushing through the inevitably hectic proceedings. Her cutting shows you just what you want to see exactly when you want to see it, and it’s hard to imagine “Fury Road” without her expert guidance. The film’s other heroes are production designer Colin Gibson and his team, who came up with an entire derelict and grotesque civilization (with visible tumors and growths chalked up to a poisoned environment) that has been created with unparalleled imagination, specificity and craziness. Few films immerse us as completely in their universe as “Fury Road” does, to often disconcerting effect. The center of “Fury Road’s” world is the Citadel, a massive fortress built around a complex system for pumping scarce water out of the ground, distributed on a random basis to hordes of the dispossessed who cluster around like the masses in a Sebastian Salgado gold-mining photograph. Running this particular show is the aging but all-evil all-the-time warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, the villain in the original “Mad Max”). With his face only partly visible behind a disturbing, intimidating mask, Immortan Joe has created an entire mythology around himself and his psychotic army of War Boys, who dream of going to an eternal reward in Valhalla if they die in glorious combat in his service. As played by Hardy, Max is a man of very few words, most of them uttered in an initial voice-over. “My name is Max, my world is fire and blood,” he says, telling us as well that he is “someone who flees from both the living and the dead,” haunted by images of the daughter he could not save as he tries to survive in this most bestial world. “Fury Road” begins with Max imprisoned and enslaved at the Citadel. An overzealous War Boy named Nux (an effective Nicholas Hoult) uses Max as what’s called a blood bag, a continuous human blood transfusion system that enables the contaminated Nux to stay alive. One of Immortan Joe’s top lieutenants at the Citadel is Imperator Furiosa (Theron), a sullen, ferocious individual with an elaborate prosthetic arm. Furiosa kicks the plot into gear by ostensibly heading out for supplies in a War Rig, a massive 78-foot 18-wheel truck. In reality, Furiosa, fed up with life under the Immortan, is making a break for it and taking with her the leader’s prize possessions. Those would be his five wives, including Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and Capable (Riley Keough), all clothed in diaphanous white cloth like the pulp-fiction archetypes they are. The Immortan, of course, is determined to get his wives back, and he calls on allies with names like the People Eater and the Bullet Farmer. Which is how a staggeringly eclectic flotilla of motorized attack vehicles join in the chase, including one carrying the Doof Warrior (Australian singer-songwriter iOTA), a red-clad fury who plays a double-necked electric guitar (which doubles as a flame thrower) to inspire the troops. Set like a human hood ornament on the front of Nux’s vehicle, Max is thrust into the heart of the action whether he wants to be or not. It is not long before things transpire to make him and Furiosa wary allies, and the chase goes into overdrive. Hardy, the villainous Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises,” is especially good at these feral roles, and Theron is his match here. The real star of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” however, is filmmaker Miller, who dreamed the mighty dream that is this film for more than a decade before being able to bring it to life. It has been worth the wait.",POSITIVE

Mad Max: Fury Road is Fast and Furious - The Thermonuclear Edition, a turbocharged chase across a toxic wasteland, with Vin Diesel and pals replaced by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, who certainly are not pals at all. A mega-reboot of the 1980s franchise that made a star of Mel Gibson (remember him?), George Miller's Fury Road is a hundred things at once: a biker movie, a spaghetti western, a post-apocalyptic dystopian action pic, a tale of female empowerment (The Vagina Monologues' Eve Ensler was a consultant on set), a Bosch painting made scary 3D real, a Keystone Kops screwball romp, and an auto show from hell. Rolling caravans of nitro-boosted muscle cars and monster trucks are outfitted with the latest extras, such as stick shifts with retractable bayonets, human skull-embellished radiator grilles, flamethrowers, and flexi-poles (the better to swoop down on your hot-roddin' enemies). There's also a nifty system of chains and intertwined IV tubing, by which the pasty ""war boy"" called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) can get his fix of uncontaminated plasma from his ""blood bag"" - that would be Hardy's Max Rockatansky, shackled to the front of the car like a human hood ornament. As a sign of Nux's corrupted health, he has twin tumors sprouting from his neck. Later, in a moment of romantic repose with a girl he met while roaring across the red desert, Nux reveals his growths' names: Larry and Barry. At the start of Fury Road, Hardy introduces himself, voice-overing ""My name is Max"" as he takes a bite of a two-headed lizard that has scuttled his way. ""My world is fire and blood,"" he says, adding that he's been reduced to a single instinct: survival. He also has been reduced to co-star status, never mind the title. Theron, buzz-cut, blue eyes ablaze, is the literal and figurative driver of this vehicle. The actress plays Furiosa, one of the elites in the tattooed, scarified society called the Citadel ruled by a masked sloth known as Immortan Joe. She's making a run to load the tanker with that rarest of commodities, gasoline - at least that's what Joe and his legion of schmoes think she's doing, until Furiosa takes a detour.  It's a spoiler to say what Furiosa's real mission is, because the moment her secret cargo is revealed is perhaps the looniest in director George Miller's loony film, with Max right there looking on, mind-boggled. Suffice to say Fury Road is trying to make some kind of statement about sexual violence, the oppression of women, and it uses a group of actresses, most of whom have sashayed across more than a few fashion runways in their brief lives, to do so. But it doesn't stop there: Fury Road, set in an inferno-future where men rule with piggish thuggery (or thuggish piggery), offers the possibility of full-blown feminist revolt. Long live the matriarchy! It could be - and has been - argued that Miller, an Australian with a penchant for relentless, rocketing motion and vast scorched-earth tableaus, invented post-apocalyptic cinema with his Mad Max trilogy: a mutated mess of an anarchic world belching fires of fossil fuels, cancerous hordes, cannibalized machines and cannibalistic human beings. Miller and his team, with Mad Mel as their hero, blazed that trail more than 30 years ago. Maybe that's one of the reasons it has taken so long for Miller - a visual maestro, to be sure - to return to the Mad Max canon. How could the director bring anything new to the game after so many others have cribbed and stolen and homaged, sucking up his exhaust fumes? (For the record, it's the middle entry in the original trilogy, The Road Warrior, that's the classic.) But Miller has found his heavy metal groove (one of the legion of freaky baddies is strapped to the front of a truck, grinding out a sonic burn of electric guitar licks for the entire movie). And he has found the Vulvalini - a group of warrior women of all ages and stripes - with whom Furiosa bonds, and then joins in battle. As for the loner Max, he and Furiosa start off glaring at each other, seething with mistrust, but you know they're going to become allies, and they do.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has had a tough life. He survived the Apocalypse but lost his wife and child. Things get worse when he is captured by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an evil despot who uses Max as a unwilling universal, living donor being drained of his blood. He is saved from certain death when Joe’s trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) betrays her leader in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” If you loved the action-packed George Miller epic, “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981)”, then you are going to love the over-action-packed update from the 70-year old director.” The difference, sadly, is that Miller and his co-writers Brendan McCarthy decide to forgo developing a story to hang the copious and bombastic action on. Furiosa is sent on a mission to get the gasoline to fuel the bizarre war wagon concoctions that Miller and his design team imaginatively bring to life. The warrior lady has other plans, though, and diverges from course and takes her war rig and her hidden cargo of Immotan Joe’s beautiful breeding concubines. Joe and his army of battle vehicles take chase, with Max chained to the front of one machine. From here on, I think it is only about 15 minutes into the film, that non-stop chase begins and does not let up until near the end of “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The action sequence is remarkably staged and “Fury Road” is an amazing production feat on all levels. Tom Hardy as the strong-willed man of few words, Max, is first rate as the new road warrior. Charlize Theron is his equal as the smart, resourceful warrior lady, Furiosa. The two start off not trusting each other but they bond over their mutual mission to save the women and find a new life in the Green Place, a long ago memory for Furiosa. The bad guy characters lack the depth that Miller put into his great “Road Warrior” villains, The Humungus (Kjell Nilson) and his badass henchmen. Other characters are incidental to the new “Mad Max” and are mostly fodder to feed the non-stop running battle. For those who like high-voltage post-apocalyptic action flicks, especially those familiar with the old “Mad Max” movies, are going to love the latest reboot. Miller and company, literally, turn up the volume (Joe’s army travels with its own accompaniment – a massive drum platform with crazed guitarist) and crank up the action with hundreds, if not thousands, of explosions as Joe’s armies converge on our heroes. To me, though, the continuing chase with little or no break in the action begins to get monotonous as the film draws to its hopeful conclusion. If the $100000000 production gets the box office gold that the filmmakers expect to earn from this summer tent pole, we can expect more from the aging but plucky George Miller. Although more of the same, without bothering to actually have more than a shell of a story, seems to me to offer diminishing returns. Then again, maybe not, considering the propensity over the last decade to flood the multiplexes with franchise films. I like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” but walked out a bit disappointed – I wanted get my socks knocked off but they were still on my feet as I left the theater..",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015","  Ese correr hacia ningún sitio vuelve a ser el leit motiv de la cuarta entrega que George Miller nos acaba de regalar a sus jóvenes y rabiosamente creativos 70 años de edad. De hecho, el film es una carrera hacia delante (que afortunadamente es imposible describir con palabras: hay que verla en una pantalla lo más grande posible) que de repente se detiene y decide hacer el camino inverso en una suerte de kamikaze ruta suicida pero acaso tal vez esperanzadora. Cine en estado puro, Mad Max: Furia en la carretera podría ser directamente una película muda y en blanco y negro. Hay mucho de cine silente, de ese espíritu pionero con el que diversos autores descubrían un nuevo lenguaje, en esta obra maestra de Miller. Uno de esos detalles es algo que estaba ya presente en la saga. Los movimientos de los actores en las escenas de acción que imitan ese paso de manivela que aceleraba un punto extra a los personajes, algo que Harold Lloyd o Mack Sennett no cesaron de realizar en sus frenéticas comedias de persecuciones imposibles. Y está David W. Griffith asimismo en ese primitivismo poético en la descripción de los personajes, o la evocativa y bigger than life escena de la entrada en la tempestad de los coches que remite con genial gusto a El viento de Viktor Sjöstrom. Si alguien quisiera saber lo que es cine debería  verse este nuevo Mad Max pues en él se halla toda una magnífica lección sobre cómo contar una historia, definir a quienes la protagonizan y mantener el interés cada segundo de su metraje.  Rica en ideas visuales, fértil en soluciones cinematográficas, Mad Max: Furia en la carretera es, en uno de sus niveles de lectura, la historia, más que de una redención (o redenciones), de cómo Max Rockatansky (un impecable Tom Hardy, más con Steve McQueen en mente que Mel Gibson, aunque le homenajee con infinito cariño y respeto en una escena concreta) recupera, vía (literalmente) sanguínea, a algo parecido a una familia. Y es, en el caso de George Miller, director acusado frívolamente de autor de películas masculinas, la ocasión, como John Ford en Siete mujeres (explícitamente citada en el tramo de las madres), de callar la boca de muchos dando el peso del relato a esa Imperator Furiosa para la cual parece haber nacido y haberse preparado una brutal Charlize Theron.  Una obra maestra, pues, este retorno al Apocalipsis cíclico y a la oda homérica hacia los héroes a su pesar por designio de la frugal insania de los dioses. Una obra maestra que es como si Alejandro Jodorowsky hubiera podido de verdad filmar su Dune… Y esto no es una cita o un piropo gratuito: las secuencias iniciales en los dominios de los Imperator son lo más jodorowskyano (y Dune) que se ha visto y se verá jamás en cualquier blockbuster made in USA.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015",The fourth installment of Miller's Mad Max films is not to be missed. [full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," “All this over a family squabble,” says a character called The Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter) disgustedly about an hour into “Mad Max: Fury Road,” the reboot of the George Miller-Mel Gibson post-apocalypse series that began in 1979 and continued through “Thunderdome” in 1985.  And he’s absolutely right—the motivation behind the two hours of mayhem Miller and his new star Tom Hardy provide here is basically a domestic quarrel within a militaristic cult that’s thrived in the global viciousness under the leadership of a gruesomely attired dictator-guru called Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).  He’s assembled an army of brainwashed skinhead followers and keeps the peasants in thrall by controlling the water supply. One might argue about the wisdom of resuscitating this franchise a full thirty years on.  But at least you’d have to agree that it’s a blessing to see Miller abandon the tiresome “Happy Feet” series after two installments.  And it certainly proves that at seventy he’s as adept at orchestrating potent action sequences as he ever was.  “Fury Road” is certainly a grindhouse movie that moves like a house afire.  But like its predecessors it remains nothing more than B-movie fare done up to a fare-thee-well, this time with a large budget that allows the action to be even longer, more flamboyant, more complicated and—thanks to the limitless possibilities of CGI—more outrageous than before. It’s frankly unclear whether the movie is intended as a sequel to the previous pictures or a new start for the series; there’s no reference to the events of the earlier films, and a bunch of recurrent flashbacks, presented almost subliminally, suggest a different past for Max than that previously depicted.  What can be definitively said is that the premise is one that turns the movie into what amount to one long chase—and, secondarily, into a tale of female empowerment.  Max Rockatansky (Hardy) is introduced as falling into the hands of Joe’s posse of so-called War Boys in their souped-up cars and cycles.  He escapes his cage and tries to escape, but after a frantic chase through the cult’s mountainside compound, the Citadel, he’s incarcerated again, and trotted out as a sort of grillwork trophy on one of the vehicles when an emergency arrives. That comes via the treachery of one of Joe’s lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, with a buzz cut), who commandeers a huge tanker she’s supposed to be driving to Gastown to take on fuel and instead goes off road into the open desert.  It turns out she’s not only trying to return to her dearly-remembered childhood home, The Green Place, but is taking along Joe’s harem of breeder women—a band of gorgeous young things either pregnant with his offspring or in line to become so, and bearing names like Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (Riley Keough), The Dag (Abbey Lee) and Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton).  Joe and his forces are soon in hot pursuit, with poor Max adorning one of the cars (beside another hosting a heavy-metal guitarist whose instrument belches out flames on particular chords).  After the first encounter between Joe’s army and Furiosa, Max gets detached from his perch and—following a confrontation with the femmes—joins them as an ally against their common foe.  One of his erstwhile captors, a War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult), will after some skirmishing join their ragtag group as well.  By this time “Fury Road” has turned into what amounts to a 90-minute chase—one that actually reverses direction toward the close and retraces its steps, though not before Furiosa has actually reached her destination (which turns out to be inhabited only by a small band of hearty old women, who join her crew).  Max and Nux are now fully committed to fighting alongside Furiosa, and certainly come in handy in more massed encounters with Joe and his forces, which notably include his man-mountain son Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) and white-faced Slit (Josh Helman).  The final prize will be the Citadel itself. You have to hand it to Miller and his crew—particularly cinematographer John Seale, editor Margaret Sixel and an army of stuntmen (under supervising stunt coordinator Guy Norris and fight coordinator Richard Norton)—for choreographing the action so carefully and cutting it all together with such aplomb.  The visual effects artists (supervised by Andrew Jackson) handle their responsibilities expertly too.  And Colin Gibson’s production design, the art direction supervised by Richard Hobbs, Lisa Thompson’s sets and Jenny Beavan’s costumes all create an impressive effect, especially in the Citadel scenes and the vehicular oddities.  Namibian locations stand in for the Australian ones Miller originally had in mind when rain in the latter turned the desert areas into plains run riot with wildflowers.  Among the cast, those who stand out are Theron, who proves a convincing action heroine and even invests Furiosa with a sense of melancholy despite the fact that her background remains opaque, and Hoult, who brings a similar sense of poignancy to Nux.  Hardy is a fine replacement for Gibson, but he can’t bring to Max much more than the same generalized moroseness as Theron does to Furiosa, despite those flashbacks (and some of the earlier scenes have him outfitted with an iron mask, which has the same unfortunate effect of muddying his diction that his Bane getup did).  The villains are frankly a disappointment, except for their extravagant outfits and makeup, but the bevy of Joe’s breeding stock make for pleasing eye candy, especially in the scene where Max first comes upon them in the desert.

"May 14, 2015"," “Those guys wouldn’t have been champion when I was around,” Mike Tyson once said, looking over the men who’d held the heavyweight belt during his prison stint. “I went away… and that made them competitive for a time.” George Miller, who made his directorial debut with 1979’s exemplar of vehicular action Mad Max, hasn’t been in the cooler like Tyson (or John McTiernan), but recently he has concerned himself with franchises involving talking pigs (Babe) and soft-shoeing penguins (Happy Feet). In the 30 years since Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, a number of champs have come and gone, and the car chase has become a game of featherlight pixels floating about. Now the wait is over, and the weight is back. Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road is a hammer-down, cast-iron-plated, diesel-exhaust-belching manifesto on the physics of screen action, a metamechanics monster truck show with everything but a Robosaurus. It is something like the rundown in the last third of Mad Max 2 (1981) stretched to feature length – I don’t believe I have seen a film on this scale so single-mindedly dedicated to the heat of pursuit since, well, Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto (2006). The man the tabloids have dubbed Mad Mel has been deemed unsafe-at-any-speed for a franchise property, so the role of Max Rockatansky has now gone to sensitive silverback Tom Hardy. It’s a downgrade – though it would be misleading to suggest that Hardy is being asked to ‘carry’ the movie. His Max spends much of Fury Road being jerked hither and thither by forces beyond his command, first picked up by the corpsepaint-pallid ‘War Boy’ soldiers serving water-hoarding dictator King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Mad Max’s main heavy, unrecognisable beneath oxygen-mask headgear), then throwing in his lot with renegade Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, sporting a prosthetic arm), who’s made off with one of Joe’s armoured trucks and his five-woman harem, driving headlong into the arid wasteland with three armies at her heels. From humble, homemade origins, each Max movie has trebled in size, and Fury Road is the metastasised endpoint. Miller is making an epic, and has chosen his visual references accordingly: Joe’s ‘Citadel’ reproduces the high and low strata of Lang’s Metropolis (1927), while the flight across the desert, replete with a sandstorm whipped up by a freak cyclone, evokes the Old Testament shock and awe that evaded Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings. Shot in the Namib Desert of south-west Africa by DP John Seale, Fury Road has a palette that’s all ochre by day, cobalt by night. It seems that the eco-crisis which has scorched the earth has brought with it an infertility epidemic, but we are given to understand only as much of the actual mechanics of the society that has emerged since “the world fell” as we can glimpse in the rear-view. The camera is almost perpetually in motion, and when it isn’t, everything else is; the dialogue, mostly shouted, is half-heard over the roar of a V8 engine. This isn’t haphazard storytelling: Miller knows that stopping off for exposition breaks will cost him valuable speed. Max, Furiosa and the others speak of their world – or rather don’t speak of it – as people who are accustomed to living in it might, and save their breath for matters of practical exigency, which is to say survival. How do you steer without a wheel? Use a wrench! How do you free yourself of harpoons in the rear end of your truck? Get back there with a bolt-cutter! How do you keep a commandeered vehicle moving when you’re about to abandon ship? Use the huge, gouty foot of an obese, recently deceased steampunk J.P. Morgan with an ornate false nose and holes in his waistcoat to accommodate his chained nipple rings! It is a movie of split-second decisions, cut-the-crap materialistic down to the very last particular, where every bullet in a clip (and the one in the chamber) and every centimetre of leeway counts, as in a startling moment where Max saves his skull by catching a crossbow bolt in the meat of his palm, one of several score of gasp-inducing details. Given that the aesthetic of the Mad Max franchise has influenced visual culture every bit as much as that of Metropolis or Blade Runner (1982), from 2Pac’s California Love music video to the Fallout game series to every post-apocalyptic film to come in its wake (including recent Aussie entry The Rover), it is remarkable that Fury Road manages to be at once familiar and yet consistently surprising, not to say astonishing. Moments of ooh-aahh ingenuity include bomb-tossing dirt bikers being target-shot from the sky like clay pigeons, gymnastic ‘polecats’ swooping in from tall, limber staffs on fulcrums, and an armada of vehicles sprung from the minds of madly inspired chop-shop Frankensteins, each one reduced to its constituent parts in turn, accompanied by awesome through-the-windshield acrobatics by vanquished custom-car commandos. Miller even has the confidence to elide one major set piece, rendering carnage as faint orange flash in the fog, and a distant flapping of crows. So, in the presence of the real deal, shall bloviated franchises and committee blockbusters scatter to the wind.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," For going on three decades Iâve been winning bar bets with one simple question: Whatâs âMadâ Maxâs surname? Itâs only mentioned once in director George Millerâs 1979 original (by the pre-crazed Ozploitation anti-heroâs brawny, Bronze boss, Fifi). The answer is âRockatanskyâ and, dammit if it isnât listed prominently in Fury Roadâs credits. Guess Iâll have to come up with a new stumper, but no matter: Fury Road is, to paraphrase Mad Maxâs Nightrider, âa fuel-injected suicide machine, a rocker, a roller, an out-of-controller,â and a genuine, mindblowing masterpiece of pure action cinema. If any other film this summer tops its N02-powered adrenaline rush, Iâll eat Mel Gibsonâs boots. Miller has wisely replaced his original albeit unpredictable ex-superstar with Englishman Tom Hardy, who has a similar stony mien and wears the gearhead iconâs battered leather jacket with somewhat less swagger and more pathos. Truly, this Max is mad, haunted by PTSD and stung by visions of long-gone allies and kin. We first glimpse him standing beside his equally iconic 600HP, V8 Interceptor, gobbling a two-headed desert lizard for breakfast. Before long, he is captured by Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne, aka Toecutter from the â79 film), the humongous leader of an army of white-painted War Boys who, ridden with pseudo-religious fervor and some horrific pox, use normal humans as living blood-bags. In Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, gasoline was the lifeblood of this dreadful post-apocalyptic society; now itâs water, which Joe controls. He also has a harem of lovely young women he regularly impregnates, hoping for an heir. Which brings us to Charlize Theronâs remarkable performance as the one-armed warrior woman Furiosa. Her cropped hair and yen for redemption kick in visions of Maria Falconetti from Carl Theodor Dreyerâs legendary 1928 The Passion of Joan of Arc, which I suspect is no mere coincidence. Furiosa, who more than lives up to her name, is Fury Roadâs heart and soul â well, after all those nightmarishly souped-up deathmobiles â and this future Ã¼ber-feminist/humanist gets all of the good lines. Not that thereâs much dialogue at all in this kiss-of-steel chase movie to end all chase movies. Thereâs damage aplenty: metal damage, brain damage, and enough practical, non-CGI, vehicular and pyro gags to make Stunt Rock feel like Goodnight Moon. Miller and his editors Jason Ballentine and Margaret Sixel continue the seriesâ editorial aesthetic of under-cranking specific shots, making the most viciously hyperstylized moments appear stuttery and surreal, like a glorious bad dream, or a trip down the bad-acid rabbit hole. Director of Photography John Seale goes all-out as well; Mad Max: Fury Road is epic, awe-inducing, extreme eye candy of the highest order, something like BuÃ±uel meets Howard Hawks by way of an epinephrined-up Monte Hellman. Unstoppable and righteous, it roars across the no-lane hardpan like the four-iron horseman of the kinetic apocalypse, amped up on bathtub crank and undiluted movie love. Oh, what a movie.

"May 14, 2015"," Speaking as a fan of the Mad Max franchise, I was reasonably certain… hell, scratch that… pretty damned positive that The Road Warrior would always be my favorite film of the series. That being said, I was not prepared for the spectacle that is Mad Max: Fury Road. In fact, I feel as if I barely survived it. After a series of “HOLY SHIT” events, Max Rockatansky (played masterfully by Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson as the lead) finds himself an unlikely ally of a vengeful sick-of-it-all woman named Imperator Furiosa (a truly badass in every sense of the word Charlize Theron). Together they set off to leave behind the wasteland kingdom of one Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, whom you may remember as Toecutter in the original film) in search of “The Green Place.” In tow they have Joe’s personal breeding brides, and it’s a mad dash to get them and themselves to this hopeful new world where some form of normalcy could be found and life could begin again. Of course the evil Immortan has other plans that involve some of the most insane stunt work you’ve ever seen along with a whole shitload of fire power, both flaming and otherwise. The main question on everyone’s minds is, “Is this a remake?” No. It is not. “Is it a reboot or a sequel?” It’s a bit of both and so very much more. At its heart this is just another tale of Max, a road warrior who’s been driven thoroughly mad because when the apocalypse hit the fan, he was unable to save the people whom he cares most about… his family. Director George Miller comes back to this insane world he created back in 1979 and then left in 1985, and believe me when I tell you he hasn’t missed a single beat. The only rust to be found in Fury Road is on the many battle vehicles that litter the wasteland. It’s almost as if Miller’s time away added to the ferocity of this film. Decades of aggression explode onto the screen with absolute reckless abandon. This is a fully realized universe filled with oddities that you cannot take your eyes off of. There’s only about ten minutes of Fury Road‘s runtime in which you’re not being visually and mentally assaulted by some of the most incredible action set pieces ever brought to the screen. As a viewer you barely have time to catch your breath in between bouts of beautifully staged, nearly indescribable amounts of onscreen chaos that will leave you white-knuckled and cheering in your seat. The sick thing? I’m trying desperately hard to not come off as hyperbolic, but Mad Max: Fury Road earns every single bit of its praise, and I’m ecstatic to be able to lavish it. Believe the hype. See it any way you want: 2D, 3D, RPX, IMAX, DBOX, whatever… just see it! It doesn’t matter how many avengers you have on screen or just how fast and furious anyone else is… action-wise 2015 belongs to Max. Welcome home, you lovable fuckin’ lunatic. Oh, how we’ve missed you.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," This retina-wrecking, eardrum-pounding apocalyptic thriller plays like a feral, futuristic sequel in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise with its wonderfully tricked-out and incredibly fast vehicles, bombastically improbable stunts and simple, survival-motivated characters. George Miller's reboot of his own 1979 Australian sci-fi revenge tale ""Mad Max"" does nothing less than redefine the ""action film"" label and sets the bar so high for the genre that, like Miller's seminal 1981 sequel ""The Road Warrior,"" its future imitators - and there could be many - will never be able to match it. I don't mean to go full-tilt cinema geek here, but Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (not a reference to Nick Fury from the Marvel Comics universe) resonates with classic epics from the distant past. The opening scenes of Miller's world of red sand and redder blood in a place called ""the Citadel"" play out like a primitive version of Fritz Lang's 1927 futuristic ""Metropolis"" with white-powdered workers running like hamsters in a treadmill to power up a steam-punked system of pulleys and ropes for the benefit of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, from the original ""Mad Max""), a dictator resembling a mashup of Batman's Bane, Darth Vader and King Henry VIII. Later, as the action segues into desert canyons and surrealist rock formations, ""Fury Road"" astonishes us with landscapes in the same way the magnificent, breathtaking settings of Monument Valley wowed audiences in John Ford's 1939 western ""Stagecoach."" Then, the numerous chases and frantic fights on wheels make for terrific theater the same way the violent, spectacular chariot races did in ""Ben-Hur"" (either the 1925 silent version or the 1959 remake). Most surprising, Miller's titular hero, played with brawn and depth by Tom Hardy, taking over the role that made Mel Gibson into an international superstar, is almost a supporting character here. A sweaty, buzz-cut Charlize Theron, missing an arm and a Hollywood superstar's ego, plays Imperator Furiosa, a fierce warrior and a war-rig driver for Immortan Joe. She, not Hardy's Max, serves as the driving force for this simple plot of escape and survival as she strives to find a sanctuary she calls ""the green place."" With nary more than a few sentences of voice-over narration to set up the plot, Max becomes a tortured prisoner of Immortan Joe's violent enforcers, the War Boys. They chain Max, wearing a steel version of a Hannibal Lecter anti-biting grill, onto the front of a truck pursuing the war-rig driven by Furiosa, who has broken from the ranks and tries to escape with four of Immortan Joe's abused wives, one of them, Splendid (real-life model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), about to give birth. Except that this chase leaves ""The Road Warrior"" and its cinematic spawn in the crimson dust. This insanely staged, wildly choreographed nuttiness offers up crazy stunts impossible to believe, yet anchored in such organic realism that we never question what we witness - bodies flying in the air, War Boys using vaulting poles to board speeding vehicles like pirates boarding enemy ships traveling at 100 miles an hour. After a brief period of distrust, Max and Furiosa become quick partners against Immortan Joe. Even one of Joe's soldiers, the white-faced Nux with scary lips (Nicholas Hoult), joins the good guys in a story with more shifting alliances than in a game of Risk. One problem that Miller doesn't solve here also plagued ""The Road Warrior."" If the people in this world are so starved for fuel, why do all the vehicles appear to have unlimited supplies of it? I know, it's just a movie, and this one comes equipped with a bleating, throbbing score by Junkie XL who slightly overdoses on over-the-top symphonic swells. Not just the red-colored ground, but the action movie ground, once the supreme propriety domain of maleness that Miller, at age 70, has slyly handed to women heroes in a reboot that could have easily been titled ""Mad Maxine.""",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," The story: A few decades from now, nuclear war has reduced lands to desert and bands of people fight to the death for resources such as water and fuel. The drifter Max (Tom Hardy) is a prisoner of the brutal War Boys clan. A high-ranking War Boys leader, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), flees the camp after committing treason and Max is dragged along for the chase across the burning sands. But what they will also get is a cracking good story and a sincere effort by leads Hardy and Theron, elevating this from B-movie junk food to that rarest of treats, an action movie for adults. In 1979, director George Miller made his feature debut with Mad Max, a cheap and violent revenge fantasy that became one of the highest-grossing films in his native Australia. But it was the sequel, Mad Max 2 (1981, also known as The Road Warrior in the United States), that broke Miller and the star of both films, Mel Gibson, into America. It was then that Mad Max motifs were set down: the loner anti-hero, vehicular ultraviolence, scrapyard-sourced Franken- cars and a cast comprised of villainous giants and dwarves, some sporting interesting radiation-afflicted skin conditions. All these classic ingredients are here - it is as if the sci-fi blockbuster bloat of the last 30 years never happened and thank goodness for that. Miller's fourth instalment has a story that could have taken place before or after the events of the third film (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, 1985). The film-maker, as is his practice, has a sociologist's fascination with the culture of his imagined tribes (he trained as a medical doctor before film beckoned). Here, he spends time filling out the language, religion and even sexual practices of the War Boys and a few others, and the effort makes the action all the more immersive. The road stunts, done with real cars and a real stunt crew, with no computer graphics that can be seen, are bonkers in the most thrilling sense of the word. Gibson's comic timing and expressiveness contributed hugely to the success of the films. Hardy not only measures up, but he also adds a dimension of introspectiveness.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," But when the original filmmaker upgrades and expands on an idea and uses new technology while retaining the essence of the original story, it can be just the ticket for jaded moviegoers. Such is the case with Mad Max: Fury Road, an operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem (*** out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide). George Miller is the mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise and his vision has spawned countless post-apocalyptic imitators. He was exactly the right filmmaker to take on a revamped Max. The 1979 original starred Mel Gibson (as did the pair of sequels that followed in the '80s). This latter day Max, played by Tom Hardy, has an intensity amid an overall stoicism that Gibson did not project. Hardy is terrific as the titular former lawman/lone wolf character. He's the rare actor who is equally good in serious dramas, low-key character-driven tales and adrenaline-fueled action thrillers. As the haunted Max Rockatansky, beset with vivid memories and hallucinations of his traumatic past, he is spot-on. Here he is captured by raiders known as War Boys, who use Max as a human blood bank. (This is a grisly world where the barely human and near-dead revive themselves with harvested blood and pumped mother's milk.) Max escapes and joins forces with a group of women in a huge tanker truck, led by the one-armed driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron). They are fleeing the tyrannized Citadel, overseen by terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who enslaves the populace and controls the water supply. Mostly, the women fleeing the tyrant look unnaturally healthy and gorgeous amid the devastation and freakish near-bestial creatures that fill this universe. The movie is essentially one long, relentless chase scene, with a succession of battles fought across scorched and barren wasteland. Cars and trucks of all sizes hold menacing drivers and passengers bent on annihilation. The warlord's platoon features a death-metal electric guitarist providing cacophonous accompaniment to the tumult. But they're not big on conversation. Dialogue is minimal. The best female action hero since Sigourney Weaver in Alien, Theron is riveting as the clever and determined, shaved-headed Furiosa. She lends the role a fascinating blend of toughness, tenderness and gravitas as we learn her tragic back story in the film's final third. Miller returns to the franchise — after films such as Babe and Happy Feet —with a vengeance. Sometimes the vehicular crashes and over-the-top pandemonium grow a bit numbing, though Miller finds a way to make even the carnage inventive. Amid all the adrenaline is a strong dose of estrogen. The story has a potent element of female empowerment as women of all ages face off against ridiculously dangerous men and transcend any imposed victimization. Miller dials back Max's machismo and places Furiosa front and center as a principled icon in a way that's almost subversive in the world of male-driven action thrillers.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015",This is entertainment to the maddest max. Every inner 12-year-old will think he -- or perhaps even she -- has died and gone to a heaven that looks just like hell.,POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Going into a film with high expectations is nearly always a recipe for disaster. The last time we remember being this giddy about the prospect of a filmmaker returning to the series they created was when we were about to watch Ridley Scott’s Prometheus. But while Alien went on without Scott, Mad Max has always been George Miller’s. Tom Hardy is perfectly cast as the leather-sporting, crazy-eyed Road Warrior, but the reason why Mad Max: Fury Road feels so right is simple: It’s Miller’s world, and he’s taking us back. In the Wasteland, the monstrous Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules his patriarchal kingdom mercilessly, dispensing water when he deems necessary, harvesting children and milk from his wives, and enforcing justice with his crazed War Boys, who believe that a chrome Valhalla awaits them after a glorious death on the road. So when Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) escapes with five of his young wives, Joe sends his entire army out after them. Chained to the front of one of these vehicles…is Max (Hardy). There’s truly a sense of a master at work as Miller settles back into the hell he created, filled with fire, desperate lunatics, monstrous villains, a few heroes, eccentric details and an armada of vehicles. He uses visual details instead of exposition wherever possible; we don’t know how Joe came to power and we don’t know how Furiosa came to be involved. The biggest clues we get to Max’s past are through his violent hallucinations, and he tells us in voiceover that he is “the one who runs from the living and the dead.” That’s pretty much it. Hardy’s dialogue is mostly confined to grunts and mumbling, and he’s fantastic. Still, it’s not really his story. The real hero of Fury Road is Furiosa, the hard as nails War Rig driver who is determined to get her charges out of Joe’s reach, with an unflashy, commanding performance from Theron. She gets a little more backstory than Max, but the same is true of all of the characters: we know what we need to. Just look at the names of the wives: Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast (Zoë Kravitz), Fragile (Courtney Eaton), Capable (Riley Keough), and Abbey Lee is a prime scene-stealer as The Dag. Speaking of the wives, the subtext of domestic abuse is surprisingly prominent and decidedly potent. “We are not things!” is their refrain. Harvesting their milk and children (at least two of the brides are pregnant) and bellowing about “property,” Joe clearly doesn’t see it that way. With strong performances bolstering this theme, we’re quickly invested in this chase beyond the excitement of creative explosions. As for the chase, well, that’s difficult to describe effectively. Once Joe sets off after Furiosa, the film really is one long pursuit through the ruined landscape that very occasionally pauses for breath. In the best Road Warrior tradition, it boils down to one tanker against a barbarianised fleet. Cars flip, tumble, explode, get sucked into a tornado, and explode while getting sucked into a tornado. There’s a berserk invention that prevents these lengthy set pieces from ever dragging. It’s amazing that, after everything that precedes it, the final confrontation still dazzles. Which brings us back to the importance of Miller. This is a great example of how action and orchestrated mayhem can and should bear the mark of their creator. From the war boys off their tits on paint fumes to Nux’s (Nicholas Hoult) named tumours, from the hazy memories of a world long lost to the guy with the giant guitar flame-thrower, this is entirely his creation. A bigger budget and CGI has allowed him to go bigger without losing anything of himself. This is a colossal, breathless, delirious, jaw-dropping juggernaut that is simply a joy. A lovely day indeed.

"May 14, 2015"," 1. I quit smoking more than four years ago, but nothing—not a night full of drinks, not a table full of smokers, not a gasoline IV—has made me want a cigarette more than Mad Max: Fury Road did. You leave the theater still shaking, everything still pumping and throbbing, a treadmill stopping on a dime and sending you careening through the back wall. The movie roars to life, commences a dead sprint into hell, and never stops. Some reviews claim it’s almost too unrelenting, that it’s too exhausting, that it’s somehow overwhelming. I suppose, for some delicate souls, this may be true, but I’m not sure why those people go to the movies at all. We’re all chasing an experience, zombies in search of escapist narcotics, and I don’t remember the last time a movie so fully delivered An Experience. What it does, it does absolutely perfectly. To complain that it does it too much is churlish and spoiled. This sort of thing doesn’t happen often. Inhale it in massive gulps while you can. 3. This is all to say that Fury Road is not messing around. You can read all about the vehicles director George Miller and his merry band of batshit weirdos have dreamt up, but if you can resist doing that in advance, I’d try: It’s best to let this movie keep surprising you with how much cracked-out lunacy it’s able to generate. The plot is necessarily minimal: Mad Max (played with humor and maximal gruntage by Tom Hardy) unwittingly teams up with a one-armed War Rig driver (Charlize Theron) to help the wives of evil Wasteland leader King Immortan Joe escape their brutal enslavement. They run one way; then they turn around and run another. They’re all in a massive truck—it earns the name “War Rig,” that’s for sure—and Immortan Joe’s half-life army is full of War Boys who take turns setting themselves on fire trying to stop it. There is so little dialogue that this might as well be a silent movie. Except, uh, it is pretty much the exact opposite of silent. 4. What can I say about the feast in store for you here? I could tell you about an early half-hour battle sequence in which Max, captured by the War Boys and turned into a mobile blood donor, is mounted on the front of a supercharged Chevy coupe as it attempts to knock over the War Rig while some sort of electric sandstorm explodes all around them. I could describe all the details of the scene, how intricately constructed it is, how it minimizes CGI at every opportunity, how great pains are taken to ground it in the physical universe to maximize every crunch and smash and kablam. But then I’d just be describing something that you need to experience for yourself. And besides: There are two subsequent car chases that are even better. 5. There’s a subtext to this movie, and while it’s not a subtle one, it’s never foregrounded, either. As our heroes tear through the desert, they come across a group of older women displaced from their homes and living estranged from the menacing kingdom of Immortan Joe. These are tough fighters who’ve further honed their battle skills in the wilderness, but they are also wise, thoughtful, and less reflexively violent. And as the wild, testosterone-addled War Boys blow up paradise and turn it into a parking lot—to be fair, a fucking awesome parking lot—they gather and wait to bring back some balance to the world. One of the great jokes of Fury Road is that Max himself is oddly passive and unimportant to the plot: It’s the women, particularly Theron’s Furiosa, who drive the action and make all the difference. (In all seriousness: I’m ready to proclaim Theron our next great action star. She’s terrific.) There is lunacy in this movie—so, so much lunacy—but there is also quiet grace, and the understanding that these are all just idiotic men and their overcompensating toys, killing each other and everyone else, just as they’ve done since the beginning of time.  But oh, what toys they have! What a ride this is! This is a movie three decades in the making, made by a 70-year-old Australian who understands that his entire life’s work has been building up to this spectacle. It is everything you want it to be, and so much more that could have never imagined. It is glorious, glorious madness. What more can I say? You will lose your shit. Your shit will be lost.",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," 'Mad' Max Rockatansky has had several incarnations, all unified by the (then) winning charisma of a fresh-faced Mel Gibson, by the mad directing skills and archetype-pimping rides of George Miller, and by some practical stuntwork whose palpably high risks only added to the visceral intensity of the action. In Mad Max (1979), he was a rev-head cop driven to vengeance against marauding road gangs in a collapsing society. In Mad Max 2 (1981), he played a broken, selfish-seeming escort to the last remnant of civilisation in a fuel-depleted future that defined a new and influential 'post-apocalyptic' subgenre. Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) played like a camp, commercial parody of the second film, with added sentiment, and was the death knell for the series. Except now, three decades later, Max is back, this time played by Tom Hardy. It is not just the personnel who have changed. For now Max is 'mad' not so much because he is still vindictively angry at the murder of his wife and child as because all that time alone in the wastelands, with survival his only aim and the ghosts of the dead his only company, has sent our reluctant hero a little over the edge - which is exactly where, after he has chowed down on a two-headed lizard, we see him speed in the opening sequence - and where again he will rush shortly after a frantic dash through a mountain tunnel. In one sense Max is not alone - for the whole world has seemingly gone mad too, crippled by post-nuclear mutations, exhausted by deprivations, and ravaged by the (death) cults of personality that have replaced any more civilised notion of culture. There is civilisation in the form of the fortified Citadel where Max finds himself a prisoner and involuntary human 'blood bag' - but that city is ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), part of a male dynasty that carefully controls the flow of water, the supply of fuel and the manufacture of bullets. That such items are even available in any kind of abundance, and are being produced anew rather than being scavenged from old, rapidly dwindling reserves, already points to the possibility of a viable, self-sustaining society - but like Thunderdome's Bartertown, this is a corrupt, dystopian community. There is one other commodity, rare and valuable, which Joe controls: healthy women and their reproductive powers. To Joe and his equally ailing brothers and sons, fertile women are mere property, to be locked away and traded, or to furnish heirs, or to provide milk. Entrusted to transport some of these goods to Gastown and the Bullet Farm, the neighbouring townships run by Joe's brethren, one-armed driver Imperator Furiosa (an outstanding Charlize Theron) decides to flee with her war rig and its cargo instead, with the combined forces of Joe, his brothers and other local gangs bearing down to stop her. Both Max and the diseased, death-obsessed 'War Boy' named Nux (Nicholas Hoult) to whom he has become bonded by blood will find themselves choosing a side and taking a stand for a better future. All the Mad Max sequels show their protagonist being reluctantly converted to the cause of some higher human good, until he eventually leads a furious vehicular flight against overwhelming odds, and finally, having furthered the cause of civilisation, returns to his solitary nomadic existence in the wastelands. Mad Max: Fury Road is different only in its details - but those details are certainly significant. For a start, rather than building slowly up to its climax, this film cuts right to the chase, and plays like a near two-hour version of the armed rig pursuit at the end of Mad Max 2. In order to keep this juggernaut running, Miller keeps stoking the fires with shovel-loads of carnivalesque crazy: gravity-defying stunts, larger-than-life caricatures and the occasional splash of ropily 'hyperreal' CGI. If Joe's cancerous War Boys literally worship the god 'V8', then the film too fetishises its many customised vehicles, including several spiky cameos from Peter Weir's The Cars That Ate Paris (1974), and a rolling speaker-tower behemoth crewed by a band of drummers and a bungee-strapped guitarist whose amped-up instrument has a flame thrower attached to its neck for good measure. Baroque-n-roll does not begin to describe the petrol-headed delirium on offer here. Likewise the villains, with names like Rictus Erectus and the People Eater, are cartoonish grotesques in punked-up, peacockish bondage gear. Many films (from The Seventh Seal to What's Left of Us) have taken a minimal approach to apocalyptic times, showing a drab, colourless world that ends with a whimper - but Miller's retrofuturist visions go instead for the bang of all-out mad maximalism. And then there are the stunts. If the previous Mad Max films set the benchmark for high-octane, mid-road mayhem, then Fury Road raises it spectacularly, with the action taking place in, on, around and over vehicles that barrel at tremendous speed through desert, canyons, marshlands and even an electric sandstorm. This is a furiously paced dash that, like any rollercoaster ride, eventually returns to its starting point to let the giddy passengers off - but in all this fuel-injected forward thrust there is also a newly progressive attitude to gender that drives head-on into the medieval backwardness of Joe's patriarchal empire. In the original Mad Max, the policeman's wife is 'fridged' - murdered as a plot mechanism to motor Max's vengeful rampage. Near the beginning of the first sequel, another female character is similarly raped and murdered to galvanise Max into action - but there is also room for Virginia Hey's Warrior Woman, who holds her own, fights as an equal alongside Max, and is his moral superior. In Beyond Thunderdome, Bartertown is run by Tina Turner's Aunty Entity, who embodies a form of negative matriarchy (and poses a real threat to Max's survival). In other words, women have steadily assumed a more prominent part in the series as agents rather than mere patients in all the unfolding action. Yet none of these films has featured a female character quite as strong - or as developed in the writing - as Furiosa, allowing Theron to sideline and outshine her mumbling co-star. No surprise that a sequel focusing on her character (and perhaps on the gaps in her backstory) has already been announced by Miller (read what he said at the Cannes press conference here). Born into a matriarchy yet abducted and branded as Joe's property, Furiosa has somehow elevated herself to a military rank and a position of command over men - all the while secretly plotting her escape with the seeds for a new society. Not only is she Max's feminine double - working with a limb injury as he has since the original film (not that his limp is much accentuated here), expertly leading a chase in a truck that closely resembles the one Max drove in the first sequel, and even rigging her vehicle with security features (as he did in Mad Max 2) to ensure that no-one else can drive it - but as Furiosa appropriates for herself the rôle that Max would ordinarily take, he in turn is feminised, and (at least initially) given the part of victim rather than aggressor. So in the opening sequence he too is abducted, prepared for branding as property, and hooked up to be bled out for transfusion, in a clear male analogy to all the women we see being milked like cows. Our literally anaemic hero spends most of the first chase sequence bound and immobilised, a passive witness to the action that Furiosa alone has instigated. Once Max has escaped his captivity, he joins Furiosa, but very much riding shotgun on a journey where Furiosa is in the driving seat. ""Who killed the world?"" is a question repeatedly posed by Furiosa and her fellow women - and the implicit answer is men. For Furiosa is leading a resistance to the errant patriarchy that brought on the apocalypse and continues to enslave women, and it is only after Max has got on board with her and proven his worth that she will declare him ""reliable"", and recognise him as an ally to her (feminist) aims. In a tale of perverted male bloodlines and forward-thinking female genealogies, Max becomes a true convert to progressive gender politics, in the end freely giving the blood that earlier he had 'donated' only under duress (and for a much lesser cause), as a vital, redemptive investment in a better tomorrow. Together, he and Furiosa represent a beacon of respectful collaboration between the sexes, as well as an alternative to the Citadel's rampant, exploitative capitalism - all of which feels revolutionary in a big-budget blockbuster aimed at the mainstream. Perhaps, in this mix of explosive action, manic mythopoeia and radical politics, there is hope for the future after all.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Mad Max roars back on to our screens after an absence of 30 years with creator George Miller at the wheel and supercharged into a state of diesel-fume delirium. CGI-pumped and ribcage-rattlingly loud, Mad Max: Fury Road
has no truck with the delicate business of exposition or character development. What it does have truck with is trucks — enormous fire-spewing monsters of every variety. A car stereo? How about a lorry-load of drummers and a guitarist lashed to the front grinding out relentless thrash metal. Bursting for background story? You should have asked before we left.  The opening action sequence lasts a full half-hour and there’s barely pause for breath (or even petrol) after that. Really, the film is one long chase sequence, and not in the sense of slow-burning tension as in Duel, but in one headlong rush into who-knows-where, our heroes pursued by an oxygen-mask-wearing warlord — a distant cousin of Darth Vader and Bane — and his horde. As Max, Tom Hardy tries to squeeze in a performance from the Russell Crowe school of acting — growled one-liners between explosions, brow permanently furrowed, alternating between puzzlement and dyspepsia. He is mad but mainly in the American sense — and he has reason to be, constantly assailed as he is by War Boys. These whitewashed, brainwashed creatures resemble sun-shy Aussies who’ve overdone it on the factor 50 or out-of-work orcs migrated from Peter Jackson’s New Zealand. But this is an oddly sidelined Max, shunted firmly into the passenger seat by a standout Charlize Theron. Chiselled cheekbones, clenched jaw, cropped hair: she is Joan of Arc with a heavy goods vehicle licence. Her noble mission, we eventually learn, is to find the fabled “Green Place” of her childhood and safely deliver her precious stolen cargo (let’s just say her battle-armoured juggernaut could do with a “baby on board” sticker). A triumph for feminism, perhaps? But the film tries to have it both ways, and so we also get a harem of slender damsels in distress draped only in wisps of gauze, like Rubens maidens reshaped by a personal trainer.  Just occasionally we’re allowed to take in the landscape — awesome apocalyptic clouds rolling in from some far-off John Martin painting or an inky swampland populated by creepy humanised crows. We want more of this but it’s no good asking a petrolhead to slow down. When Miller called “action” on this reboot he really meant it.",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015"," A recent piece by Scott Mendelson for Forbes made the telling observation that – in a classic example of hope vanquishing experience – fans of movie franchises remain quaintly eager for each new iteration despite disliking most of the previous episodes. (Glance towards Star Wars for confirmation.) The Mad Max sequence prompts interesting ruminations on this theory. The sentimental third romp wasn't awfully good. The first film was a cracker, but, more closely bolted to its own period, Mad Max scarcely exists in the same universe as its successor. So, 30 years after Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, what we're looking for is a worthy, tonally consistent follow-up to Mad Max 2. Would you credit it? Despite frequent cancellations, climactic catastrophes and the recasting of his lead, George Miller has delivered the goods. There is some unhappy news. Too much of the action is rendered through computer graphics. Tom Hardy is not quite what we hoped he would be. But Fury Road remains a post-apocalyptic western of the highest order. Miller and Brendan McCarthy, the comic-book artist who helped develop the pitch, have, quite wisely, worked hard at fleshing out the universe while keeping the story lean and efficient. Henchmen of an evil lunatic named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was in the first Mad Max) capture Max (Hardy) and force him to act as a ""bloodbag"" for one of many anaemic minions. Following various convulsions that we won't spoil, our hero ends up helping a female road warrior called Furiosa (Charlize Theron) in her attempts to flee Joe with a truck of valuable human cargo. Miller (who, let us not forget, is also the man behind Happy Feet) has spent too much time in front of the computer and not enough staging old-school stunts. The sense of automotive danger is significantly lessened by constant awareness of digital artificiality. But many of the tweaks in design and composition are delicious. McCarthy brought influences from Mad Max 2 into his work for 2000 AD spin-offs and the debt is now repaid in bold framing that recalls the best of that comic. The violence is orchestrated with great imagination and the anthropological variations are left tantalisingly half-explained. Here is the real surprise. Mad Max: Fury Road belongs almost entirely to Charlize Theron. This is partly because it is mainly Furiosa's story – Max arrives to help out like Keith Carradine in Kung Fu – and partly because the actress grabs the opportunity with two eager fists. Despite the alleged contributions from Eve Ensler of the Vagina Monologues, you'd strain to call the project a feminist picture. Furiosa is, nonetheless, at least as assertive as Ripley in Alien or Sarah Connor in The Terminator. A bafflingly neutral performance from Tom Hardy makes Theron's not-unwelcome takeover more complete. The star is turning out to be a real enigma. Mel Gibson, a weaker actor than Hardy, had no more lines in Mad Max 2, but the Australian dominated the earlier film in a way that Tom just can't manage. Perhaps he's trying too hard. Maybe he's unwisely seeking to fashion a fleshed-out human being from a force of nature. Whatever the reason, Hardy is largely swallowed up by the escalating mayhem. None of this matters as much as it should. Fury Road admirably honours its predecessors while creating endless new myths worth investigating. It is not a reboot. See it in glorious 2-D.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015","A steampunk fever dream, a hallucinatory and vicious drive through hell, and 70-year-old director George Miller is behind the wheel ... having a lovely, lovely day.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," George Miller may be 70 years old, but that hasn’t stopped him from outclassing filmmakers half his age by making one of the craziest, ballsiest and most badass action movies in ages. “Mad Max: Fury Road” has been decades in the making, and that passion shows in the final product. Though Mel Gibson was originally considered to reprise the titular role when Miller first hatched the idea back in 1998, after production was stalled by a series of financial and political difficulties (not to mention Gibson’s own well-publicized personal issues), “Fury Road” slipped into development hell for many years until Miller eventually got to make his movie. With the entire film famously storyboarded before a script was even written, “Fury Road” is about as nontraditional as a big-budget studio movie gets, surviving on its sheer originality, audacity and no-holds-barred attitude. Set in the year 2060 and loosely following the events of the first three installments, “Fury Road” finds former cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) just barely surviving in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. When he’s captured by tyrannical leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and forced to serve as a human blood bank for his diseased male minions, known as the War Boys, Max’s fate appears to be sealed. But after one of Joe’s war rig drivers, the bionic-armed Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), suddenly goes off course during a routine fuel run, Joe’s massive army chases after her – including sickly War Boy, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who’s so desperate not to miss out on the action that he straps Max to the hood of his car, connected only by a chain and IV tube, so he can continue to heal. It turns out that Furiosa is trying to rescue a group of female captives that Joe plans to use to repopulate the world in his image, and when Max eventually crosses paths with them following a miraculous escape, he reluctantly agrees to help get them to safety. Credit to Warner Bros. for stumping up the cash (a reported $150 million) and getting the hell out of Miller’s way, because “Fury Road” feels like a singular vision without the usual studio interference – something you don’t normally see from a major summer blockbuster. But Warner’s gamble certainly paid off, because “Fury Road” is a truly unique moviegoing experience that benefits from not having too many cooks in the kitchen. It looks absolutely gorgeous, with John Seale’s stunning cinematography providing a painterly quality to the visuals; the day scenes are shot in a sunburnt orange that makes you feel the beating heat of the desert, while the night scenes are contrasted nicely by a cool, steel-blue tint. For as incredible as the movie looks, however, the real reason to see it is for the action. Conceived as one long car chase, “Fury Road” is packed with some of the most amazing action sequences you’ll ever see – and they become even more impressive when you realize that almost all of the effects are completely practical. It’s a minor miracle that someone didn’t die during the making of this film, because Miller’s high-adrenaline set pieces are so visceral and unbridled that you genuinely fear for the lives of the actors and stuntmen with each carefully staged explosion, car flip and crash. The overcranked, sped-up look to the action works better in some places than others, but for the most part, the gonzo vehicular mayhem is a jaw-dropping assault on the senses that gets weirder as it goes along. At one point, Max fights a deranged guitar player who, along with a bunch of Taiko drummers riding on the back of a mobile soundstage, provides the film’s rock ‘n roll soundtrack. Oh yeah, and the guitar doubles as a flamethrower, because why not? Every minute of action is pure cinematic magic, but it’s the dead space in between that proves troublesome. Though there are brief allusions to Max’s past with weird, spectre-like visions of a young girl he couldn’t save, Furiosa is the only character who’s given any actual development. In many respects, she’s the hero of the movie, and while Hardy does exactly what’s required of him as the mysterious, soft-spoken Max, Theron brings a humanity to her performance that stands head and shoulders above the rest. With such paper-thin supporting characters and an equally lean plot, it’s difficult to invest in the story at times, but that’s hardly the appeal of a movie like “Fury Road.” Though it would have benefited from a tighter runtime and falls short of the worship-like praise that many people have lavished upon it, this is easily Miller’s best “Mad Max” film yet. Those looking for something of more substance will be disappointed, but from a purely visual standpoint, it’s hard to imagine any other movie this summer will be as much fun to watch. See it on the biggest screen possible; you’ll thank me later. Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe, from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you're out or at home.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," Oops, sorry about that, but the resurrection of the “Mad Max” franchise is so fun and abundant it’s bound to be blurbed with superlatives. And for a change, the ads won’t be unforgivable fibs. This old-school thrill ride leaves a CGI contraption like “Furious 7” stalled at the starting line. This is analog filmmaking at its most daring. Director George Miller is as Australian as a boxing kangaroo, and his 1979 debut “Mad Max” was a landmark of low-budget Down Under cinema. No Hollywood studio would have OK’d the crazy pyrotechnics that used humans as cannon balls, but half a world away from the regulators, Australia had a community of stunt drivers who would risk their lives for a laugh and a lager. A new generation of stunt person steals “Fury Road” from its ostensible star. In the role that made Mel Gibson famous, Tom Hardy plays Max, a mysterious ex-cop who roams the Outback after a global catastrophe has turned the remaining humans into predators. Max is captured by a tribe of desert-sand pirates and taken to their canyon fortress, where ageless leader Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) organizes raiding parties to steal vital gasoline. When Joe dispatches one-armed lieutenant Furiosa (the mighty Charlize Theron) to Gas Town, she betrays him by smuggling his breeder females in the tanker truck. The whooping war party that pursues the rainbow-hued harem is a spectacle that would give John Ford an inferiority complex, with Max as a human hood ornament on one of the spiked and supercharged death-mobiles. The whole movie is essentially a post-apocalyptic cowboys-and-Indians chase, with swarms of barrel-chested cut-throats buzzing around, atop and beneath the tanker. Max warily joins the gun-slinging Furiosa on the race to the fertile land of her birth, along with a crazed warrior called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who falls for one of the five maidens. But there’s no room for sentiment in a landscape where even grandmothers travel as a biker gang. Catapulting over the previous three installments, Miller’s production crew has fashioned a future as distinctive in its way as “Blade Runner.” The powder-pale minions in the steam-punk citadel are literal cogs in a machinery that squeezes water from the desert. Joe, whose face we never see behind a grill (like Hardy wore in “The Dark Knight Rises”), goes into battle sheathed in a plastic muscle suit festooned with old medallions. The war wagons are hybrids of hot rods and heavy-metal tour buses. Maybe there’s a warning sign buried in the sand about a species that’s speeding out of control, but the chaos is such a gas that “Mad Max: Fury Road” keeps the message to a minimum. The family of the late actor are getting behind a film project that looks to capture the essence of the Wisconsin native. Here's what we know. ",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2015"," A franchise known for its testosterone appeal finds Furiosa, a female road demon is every bit Max’s equal — and then some — when the rubber hits the road, in George Miller’s triumphant reboot of his action franchise. A franchise known for its testosterone appeal finds Furiosa, a female road demon is every bit Max’s equal — and then some — when the rubber hits the road, in George Miller’s triumphant reboot of his action franchise. Mad Max: Fury Road characters revving up for the franchises’s latest installment. Power Howell writes that the franchise now rivals Star Wars for the diversity of its mad characters and war machines. Any fears that 30 years of waiting for George Miller’s return to his post-apocalyptic Wasteland of “fire and blood” might have been in vain are resoundingly stomped right from the opening engine revs of Mad Max: Fury Road. The Aussie writer/director’s blockbuster reboot of his 1979-85 action trilogy had its world premiere Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival, immediately prior to its wide release Friday in North America. With Tom Hardy assuming the Max Rockatansky title role that made Mel Gibson famous, ex-cop turned manic Road Warrior, the story shifts into overdrive without a hitch and with a great deal of kinetic energy. It’s as smooth and commanding a transition as when Daniel Craig became James Bond a decade ago in Casino Royale, bringing a more physical and taciturn presence to a well-known character, just as Hardy does with Max. And Hardy does it while wearing the iron face mask of a prisoner for the first third of the movie, which recalls his ferocious villain Bane, Batman’s nemesis, from The Dark Knight Rises. Everything here amazingly feels like a fresh idea, thanks to the addition of Theron in the co-lead role of Furiosa, a female road demon who is every bit Max’s equal — and then some — when the rubber hits the road, the fist hits the head and the bullets hit the bull’s-eye. A franchise known for its testosterone appeal suddenly gets a solid jolt of estrogen, from Furiosa and other strong female characters, a true rarity for a movie like this. Furiosa is also the main plot mover as driver of the War Rig, a tanker truck loaded with scarce gas and nitro stolen from Wasteland warlord Immortan Joe, a skull-masked creep played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, previously seen as the sociopathic villain Toecutter in the original Mad Max. Furiosa is helping five women — played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee Kershaw and Courtney Eaton — escape the raping clutches of Joe, who enslaves “wives” as breeders for the male heir he desires. Joe and his skinhead War Boys followers are in hot pursuit and loner Max is forced to ally with Furiosa in the struggle to stay alive in a world where compassion is rarer than water. That’s really all the plot summary you need, apart from noting that Nicholas Hoult’s indefatigable Nux, a War Boy with no greater desire than to die and go to the Valhalla that Joe promises his warriors, makes for an excellent third main character, as his allegiances become complicated. The beauty of the screenplay by Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is so much of the story is told visually, like silent cinema, and without recourse to whiplash editing or excessive CGI. We learn about the characters and their agendas on the run, with barely a moment to process what we’re seeing cross the brilliant lens of cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient), who came out of retirement to make the golden sands of the film’s desert locales (shot mainly in Namibia) seem at once both hell and paradise. What you don’t require is advance viewing of the previous Mad Max films. This one stands entirely on its own, although there are many little shout-outs to the past, the main one being Hugh Keays-Byrne’s return to the franchise as a different villain than his previous Toecutter, but one every bit as psychopathic and driven. What you might enjoy, as I did, is a second viewing just take in all the fascinating characters, colors and textures of this thoroughly recreated and revived fantasy world, which now rivals Star Wars for the diversity of its mad characters and war machines.

"May 14, 2015"," It’s funny how Mad Max: Fury Road, a movie that takes place in a dystopian future, plays to our most primitive, basic instincts. Instead of evolving like progressive beings in the face of adversity, we devolve into power-hungry tribes once chaos and anarchy rear their ugly heads. In this case, it’s George Miller’s waterless world. Revving engines, beating drums, whizzing bullets and a crunchy electric guitar become this road’s bleak soundtrack, and furthermore, the beating pulse of Miller’s bombastic creation. There’s something magnificent in the way that the director envisions his updated, highly-defined wasteland, but what’s even more impressive is that a major studio LET him inject his “no fucks given” attitude into every dusty scene. Mad Max: Fury Road boasts minimal dialogue, nipple piercings, a true Steampunk vibe and one seriously badass female heroine. Have I died and ascended into a blockbuster Valhalla?! Tom Hardy takes over for Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, a former legal enforcer who now finds himself captured by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his clan. He’s taken to the Citadel, a massive oasis that bares bits of patchy green hope for the festering plebeians below, as Immortan Joe acts as their God and savior. His access to clean water makes him more of a myth than a man, and he strings along his followers with short bursts of water to “feed their addiction.” But when his trusted military leader, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), steals his wives and flees for a utopia she calls the “Green Place,” a chase begins that pits Max and Furiosa against Immortan Joe’s clan of suicidal War Boys. Mad Max: Fury Road isn’t just a monumental achievement in action movie history, this is George Miller redefining the entire Hollywood landscape while shredding a dual-neck guitar that doubles as a flamethrower. Nothing about this furious road is conventional. The title (MAD MAX: Fury Road) is indeed a bit misleading, because this is Furiosa’s film, and she grabs her opportunity (and the entire male population) commandingly by the balls. Charlize Theron earns and DESERVES her time in the blistering, sun-drenched spotlight. A strong female lead character who overshadows Mad Max himself? Blasphemous! Yet Miller doesn’t stop there. Most of the dialogue consists of grunts and battle-ready shrieks, driving forward a story that could have been scribbled on a napkin. There’s Point A, Point B, and two hours of high-octane mechanical mayhem in between. Honestly, Miller deserves an award for even getting this awe-inspiring fever-dream made. Visually, Miller’s mind is LOADED with monstrous designs and a gluttonous appetite for excess. Mad Max: Fury Road is a finely aged artist’s wish to approach filmmaking with a child-like wonder, mashing together masterful brushstrokes with uncontrollable imagination. Each car and war rig has a distinct personality, outfitted with barbed spikes and secret hatches, as they kick up clouds of clay-colored sand that paint a deadly, oasis-like picture. War parties aren’t just cars, they’re teams of souped-up muscle roadsters that support deadly musicians who pound gigantic drums, carry warriors who teeter on see-saw-like poles and spit venomous flames like snarling, vicious beasts. The whole carnival-esque sideshow is nothing short of superior showmanship, with acrobatic choreography to match. When Max, Furiosa and the brides find themselves caught in a barrage of fire-bombs and gunfire, we never lose ourselves in the swirling wreck of speeding vehicles and tumbling bodies. Mad Max: Fury Road could have been a bumpy, nauseating trip with far too much metal-munching chaos, yet cinematographer John Seale manages to contain the flurry of flying debris with perfect framing, while gigantic flaming tornadoes snatch up unfortunate victims. The fluidity and steadiness of Seale’s laser-guided eye makes each high-octane attack not just ass-kicking, but poetic. Characters are measured by their aptitude for killing, such as War Boys like Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who beg for their brothers to “witness” their glorious sacrifice for Immortan Joe, or Max’s brutally understated methods of swift, efficient justice. With such restrained conversations, fighting becomes the only way for anyone to truly let their emotions fly, a point that once again hints at that primal nature buried deep beneath our enslaved societal restraints.  But look deeper and you’ll acknowledge Furiosa’s feminine battle against the white male oppressors who turned women into nothing but child-farming, milk-squirting cows without human value. Furiosa is a beacon of hope, and a badass one-armed warrior, both of which make no difference to Theron. God bless Furiosa’s willingness to fight, scrap, and take charge of any situation, but thanks must also be paid to Miller’s writing team, who never fall into the schmaltzy gimmick of turning Max and Furiosa into a vengeful couple. After duking it out in a fair little fist fight, Max immediately acknowledges Furiosa as an equal combatant. They fight together, survive together, and live together as warriors with equal motives, and no lustful connection. No forced kisses or random sex scenes take Mad Max: Fury Road down an unforgivable detour, and the mighty women of Fury Road raise their rifles in support of their fearless, unflinching leader. They think like men, fight like men and die like men – just as any sack of flesh and bones would. Here we are and I haven’t even mentioned the cartoonishly apt costume design that highlights each camp’s features. Mad Max: Fury Road requires your eyes to be your ears, as characters aren’t going to open up and provide depth through chatter. Instead, appearances dictate development. From Furiosa’s greased forehead whenever she must appear to be a friend of Immorten Joe to each bride’s angelic white garb, from the War Boy’s skeletal body paint to any Bullet Farmer’s ammo-laced clothing (and teeth), and even the Gas Town’s philanthropic S&M-business-casual look, there’s a laundry list of tantalizing details that feed appetites like a five-course meal for the senses. And for dessert? Junkie XL’s addicting orchestral-meets-industrial-rock score is the glistening, candied cherry on this blood-drenched, raw, immaculate genre sundae. Someday, a film professor will teach an entire semester curriculum based on Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly, you could write a dissertation based on any single aspect of Miller’s production, from cinematography to character work. Tom Hardy’s portrayal of Max Rockatansky is a pitch-perfect complement to Furiosa, by simply grunting and acting like an absolute bruiser – which suits Hardy just fine. Within mere minutes we’re treated to a frantic escape attempt that tests Hardy’s physical limits (reminiscent to a F.E.A.R. cutscene), which perfectly sets Miller’s tone before he unleashes a cavalcade of BattleBots-crafted car duels, aerial beat downs while jumping car to car and Motocross bombers raining Hell down on targets below. Hardy can’t be caged, he can’t be contained and once he stops running scared, he becomes a silent brawler who doesn’t need a voice to speak, giving us a lesson in screen presence based on physicality alone. What a day. What a lovely day it is to be a movie fan. Mad Max: Fury Road is essentially one gigantic middle finger to Hollywood’s Mediocrity Machine, defying the rules that so many thoughtless executives have set in stone. This is the movie that gets you mad about the drivel studios have been churning out for years, and optimistic about a future where money starts being thrown at unwieldy, borderline-insane ambition. George Miller has accomplished what some might deem impossible, guided by the action-loving part of his brain that’s sat unused while movies like Babe: Pig In The City and Happy Feet took precedence.

To escape, he's forced to make a pact with Joe's top lieutenant, the mysterious Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who's on a quest for redemption which involves rescuing Joe's enslaved brides. REVIEW:  It's rare for me – as a guy who's privileged enough to write about films regularly – to find myself at a loss for words after seeing a movie. Love it or hate it, I can usually jot down five hundred words and be done with it as soon as I can get to a laptop, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD threw me for a loop. I knew I was going to like it. Heck, I knew I'd probably  love it, but I truly did not expect to find myself so shook-up and maybe it's because I feel like I've just witnessed the birth of a full-on action classic. I feel like I did when I walked out of THE MATRIX in '99, or the way people probably did when they saw DIE HARD in theaters in 1988, or (appropriately) THE ROAD WARRIOR in 1982. Make no mistake, FURY ROAD is on par with those films and the closest to a modern action classic then I've seen in some time. Sure, there have been other great blockbusters over the years. INCEPTION, THE DARK KNIGHT, etc, but those weren't really action movies. FURY ROAD is a f**kin' action movie through and through. Big, brash and unapologetic with a hard-earned R-rating, FURY ROAD is a throwback to an era where action movies were made by veteran directors who knew what they were doing, and not some hot flavor-of-the-month making a leap-to-tentpoles before they were really ready. Clearly, George Miller has spent years – probably even decades – tinkering with his concept of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and the result is a film that you can tell Miller put his whole heart and soul into. There's no saving anything for the sequel here. Miller's made the absolute best movie he can. More than anything it feels like the MAD MAX movie Miller's always wanted to make but just didn't have the technology or resources to do back then – and that's not a dig at the incredible original trilogy. This just feels extra special and like the movie a kid making movies in the Australian outback with his mates dreamed of doing but didn't have anywhere near the resources he needed (even though he did pretty damn amazing without them). Everything about FURY ROAD is perfect, to the extent that writing a review feels almost unnecessary as you should just go see it as there's nothing I can write that does it justice. While it would have been a treat to see Mel Gibson come back, Tom Hardy is more than able to slip into Max's one-armed leather jacket. While clearly canon, Hardy wisely avoids ape'ing Gibson, doing his own thing instead. Appropriately, he plays Max as absolutely “mad” as in full-on insane. The character history is the same, but here he's the guy who we saw eating dog food at the beginning of THE ROAD WARRIOR, a former hero who's had everything he cared about taken away and is now an animal. As such, Hardy plays him as vicious, more likely to growl than speak – almost feral in a way. Yet, he also conveys the repressed nobility and heroism of the guy, making him a hero you can root for. Importantly, he's also incredibly dynamic in the action sequences, which are absolutely nonstop. For her part, Charlize Theron is equal to Hardy, with Furiosa just as much the hero as he is – possibly even more so as she's got the real arc. Max is the enigma, Furiosa is the heart. Here, Theron and Miller have crafted one of the most memorable action heroines since Ripley, and if there's a dearth of female action heroes out there, Furiosa is a new one and immediately one for the ages. Theron has done action before, but she's never had a character like Furiosa, and it's the kind of performance that's going to turn her into a legend. While Hardy and Theron can't help but dominate, the supporting cast is excellent. Nicholas Hoult steals scenes as the future fan-favorite Nux, making his henchman into a character with real compassion and humanity. Hugh Keays-Byrne (who played Toecutter in the first film) is formidable and freakish as the terrifying Immortan Joe, while the “wives” played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are all fully rounded characters and not merely damsels in distress. On the technical side, FURY ROAD is a marvel. The photography and editing are Oscar-level, while the hard-driving score by Junkie XL is off-the-charts great, with it being worked into the film in a diegetic way I won't spoil here. Tying it all together – of course – is George Miller who, at seventy, has just kicked all modern action auteurs asses, with action scenes that feel un-toppable. The film is literally almost non-stop action, but all of the beats are so distinct they never feel like one big set-piece. The final battle royale is a masterpiece of virtuoso action film-making and worthy of applause at any screening you attend. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is so great, and hopefully it'll be recognized as such by fans and critics alike. It's a shame tentpole fare is often overlooked at the awards-level, but for what it is FURY ROAD is absolutely flawless and I'm not exaggerating when I say Miller's made a true instant classic. Go see it and then go see it again. I know I will.

"May 14, 2015"," CLEVELAND, Ohio - ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a spectacularly entertaining ride. I don't have enough adjectives to properly describe what an ingeniously brilliant creation this is from the mind of director George Miller. It rocks the screen with a fluid intensity of masterful visual storytelling. It creates a bizarre, believable world. And it is all done with very little dialogue. Like a classic silent film, or the best of Hitchcock or Kubrick, tension builds without the need for talkie interludes. By the way, if you love action films, go see this. Immediately. It is essentially a heated, two-hour car chase mixed with gunplay, furious fighting and multiple explosions. But that's the beauty of ""Mad Max: Fury Road."" It is such a cut above other movies where action sequences and overblown set pieces are mere requisite inserts. Here, the unrelenting action pushes the plot and characters ever forward. Part of the fun is trying to keep up. I am usually an eye-rolling cynic when it comes to redos, reboots, remakes, revamps and relaunches. And I have to admit when I first heard about this, I was thinking, ""Another angry loner dude in the desert movie?"" ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was a long time coming. Miller started to pull it together in the late 1990s, but various factors delayed the project. As it is, the film was shot almost three years ago. It is a follow-up to his three previous Max adventures - ""Mad Max"" (1979), ""The Road Warrior"" (aka ""Mad Max 2"" from 1981) and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (the one with Tina Turner from 1985). All three starred Mel Gibson as the Ford Falcon-driving, revenge-seeking former cop who battled a collection of sadistic uglies in the rugged Australian Outback. Apparently, Miller had wanted to team with Gibson again, but by the time the film came together, the actor was much older than the character (who is in his 30s) and he had become consumed with all of his anger issues and legal entanglements. Gibson was a great Max, but he did give his blessing to British actor Tom Hardy, fabulous last year in ""Locke"" and probably best known as Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" So here we are 30 years since the last one. Same idea, different desert. It's every man and woman for themselves in a post-apocalyptic wasteland called, fittingly, The Wasteland. Water, fuel and bullets are in high demand. The film was shot in Namibia, and the cast looks as cracked and weathered as a 120-degree day. The cinematographer John Seale, an Oscar-winner for ""The English Patient"" who has also worked on ""Witness,"" ""Cold Mountain"" and the first Harry Potter film, among many others, lovingly embraces the gold hues of the vast desert. The dry harshness of the daytime scenes are sharply juxtaposed by the moonlit nights when faces take on an almost cobalt blue tint. This time around Max has been relieved of his souped-up Ford Falcon and abducted by a pack of bald War Boys who look as if they have been dipped in powdered sugar and who answer to the evil Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max.""). Max becomes the blood supply for one of the lunatic War Boys, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), and finds himself as an unfortunate hood ornament in a mad chase to hunt down Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron with a buzz cut), who has escaped Joe and run off with a large war machine truck. Eventually Max and Furiosa team up and try and help her cargo - five of Joe's brides referred to as his ""favorite breeders"" - while trying to outrun a veritable army of psychotics in a Wacky Racers set of vehicles that look like they sprung out of some crazy comics. (Comic-book artist Brendan McCarthy created the storyboards for the film, and is a co-screenwriter with Miller and Nick Lathouris.) The production design, make-up and costumes are also off-the-charts impressive. And Miller and crew injected a pulsating punk-metal-rebel vibe into the proceedings with music by Junkie XL. When Joe and the boys chase after Furiosa, they charge into battle accompanied by drummers and a dangling dude shredding a double-guitar that shoots flames. The story is not new. We have seen the stoic loner battling baddies a zillion times in Westerns and other genres. We've seen demented criminals madly chasing our hero across the desert in other films, not to mention previous Mad Max movies. But the execution here is exceedingly compelling and gripping. Both Hardy and Theron are superb, as are the supporting players. The on-the-run wives include Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (Riley Keough), The Dag (Abbey Lee) and Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton). The film is an interesting choice for Hardy and Theron, who certainly have plenty of offers. There are no big ""acting"" moments. No lengthy speeches. No forced sentiment. No Oscar-bait emotional meltdowns. There's no time for posing, and yet both performers do a lot with the slightest gesture or glare in the best John Wayne-Clint Eastwood tradition. Miller even strikes a blow for feminism. Not only is Furiosa an extremely brave and capable character, the equal of any man, but some elderly women they pick up along the way also engage in butt-kicking heroism. Best of all, Miller respects his audience. He refuses to pander or dumb things down. He resists piling on loads of exposition. The backgrounds of the characters are injected more incrementally and organically, or not at all, leaving splendid elasticity in our imaginations. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a shiny toy that does not require elaborate instructions other than these: Hold on tight. Don't let go. Beware of sharp objects.

	Those who endure life-threatening situations and manage to survive often have a hard time letting go of their ordeals. Overcoming obstacles and returning to the land of the living are equally daunting. But survivors cannot afford to get imprisoned in the past: their challenge is to heal their bodies and minds so they can move into the future with hope.
 
	Max (Tom Hardy) is a warrior who has no place to go in a time 45 years after the fall of the world. Civilization has vanished, and it's a dog-eat-dog realm where the only two precious commodities are oil and water. Food is hard to find, and the air is poisoned.
 
	The weak cling to the words and the promises of the Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who has invented a religion to keep his War Boys under his power. Kindness and mercy are not part of it.
 
	Max is the ultimate loner mythologized in various cultures as the gunslinger of the Wild West, the traveling Ronin Samurai, or the solitary Viking Warrior. He goes his own way no matter what the circumstances. Community is not for him. Max is broken as he stands alone on the Plains of Silence, haunted by ghosts and demons from the past. But he is not ready to lay down the burden of life just yet.
 
	Max revs up his car and heads off into the wilderness where after a long battle with crazy War Boys he is taken as a prisoner to the Citadel. Also there are the Immortan Joe's five wives. With everyone dying of pollution, the power-obsessed ruler is busy impregnating them in a quest for a healthy male heir.
 
	Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is a rough and tough survivor who cannot abide the Immortan Joe's treatment of these women as tools and objects. She decides to liberate them from the tower and take them home to the green place she remembers from childhood. Furiosa hides them in a petro tanker going out on a routine run. Soon the Immortan is leading the chase after this bold female traitor and the Five Wives: The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (Riley Keogh), Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), and The Dag (Abbey Lee).
 
	In all the chaos in the Citadel, Max escapes and winds up as an ally of Furiosa and her mission. Also along for the wild ride through the desert is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a loyal War Boy, who in the heat of battle has to make a choice between affection with a woman or loyalty to promises of a Warrior's special place in the paradise of Valhalla.
 
	Tom Hardy plays Mad Max as the strong and silent type hero to a ""T."" Charlize Theron excels as a woman warrior who yearns for home and proves herself to be a brave and clever warrior. Convincing performances by the other actors, stunning set design, and evocative music all add to the overall impact of the film.
 
	George Miller was the mastermind behind three earlier films: Mad Max (1979), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). Thirty years later, he reboots this franchise taking advantage of developments in special effects technologies without losing any of the emotional clout these films are known for. He accomplishes what he set out to do: make an action movie that takes us on an moving and unforgettable ride.
 
Special features on the DVD include Maximum Fury: Filming Fury Road; Mad Max: Fury on Four Wheels; The Road Warriors: Max and Furiosa; The Tools of the Wasteland; The Five Wives: So Shiny, So Chrome; Fury Road: Crash & Smash; I Am A Milker; Turn Every Grain Of Sand!; Let's Do This.

"May 14, 2015"," Desolate, post-apocalyptic landscapes, zombie-ridden or not, are perennial popular tourist destinations for 21st-century moviegoers and couch potatoes. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is like a visit to a World Heritage site. Some of us — old enough to remember when nuclear Armageddon had not yet given way to climate change as the main source of existential anxiety — harbor a special fondness for the young Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the grieving, aggrieved former cop who motored across the Australian desert in “Mad Max,” “The Road Warrior” and “Beyond Thunderdome.” “Fury Road,” directed, like the others, by George Miller, is sort of a sequel, and also what we’re now supposed to call a reboot. In any case, it doesn’t traffic in the kind of half-jokey, half-sentimental self-consciousness that characterizes so much franchise entertainment these days. Unlike, say, “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Fury Road” does not usher you into a bright corporate universe where everything has been branded to within an inch of its life. The branding you witness here reminds you of the cruel etymology of the word, as a death’s-head insignia — the mark of a tyrannical C.E.O. known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) — is scorched into the flesh of people destined to live as property. One of these, a designated “blood bag” kept alive to transfuse one of Joe’s “war boys,” is Max himself, played without a wasted word or gesture but with plenty of expressive grunts and snorts by Tom Hardy. Max, a Bogartian loner impelled by conscience to stick his (admirably thick) neck out for somebody, is really more sidekick than hero. The chief warrior on this road is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a rebel with a buzz cut, a prosthetic arm, a thousand-mile stare and a supremely righteous cause. Joe, whose empire runs on slave labor, keeps a harem of women for breeding. Furiosa has five of them (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Riley Keough, Courtney Eaton and Abbey Lee) hidden in her tanker truck, and she’s running a kind of underground railroad operation in the guise of a trading mission. Joe wants his property back, and sets out in pursuit with a battalion of war boys, a heavy-metal guitarist and a fleet of customized retro-futuristic vehicles. Let’s back up for a moment. This “Mad Max” unfolds in fast, hectic, relentlessly linear motion. It starts quietly, with Max standing on a dusty outcropping, casually snacking on a two-headed gecko as he sketches the relevant background in voice-over. When things started going bad — when the world collapsed in a welter of greed, violence and stupidity — he failed to protect his wife and daughter. Their memory both haunts and grounds him, making him able, even in the worst circumstances, to recognize decency in himself and others. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"May 14, 2015"," Leave it to a veteran to show the young sparks how to do it: it's been 30 years since George Miller last visited his post-apocalyptic hero Max Rockatansky, and now he's back with the best-staged action thriller of the year, a blockbuster that dares to have meaningful themes and complex characters. He also recreates Mad Max as a kind of James Bond franchise with a story that sits alongside the earlier films, not before or after, and an actor who brings a new energy to the role. In a desert wasteland where people trade water and oil to survive, Max (Tom Hardy) is a loner haunted by the death of his family. Then he's captured by a gang from the Citadel, a towering rock city run by the tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has positioned himself as a god who keeps his enslaved people on a short leash. On a mission to collect oil, Joe's top imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) veers her war-rig off into the desert. So Joe sends a gang after her. Leading the charge is the gung-ho Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who uses Max, strapped to his car like a grille ornament, as a blood-bag to supply energy. But after a series of clashes involving three other gangs of desert marauders, Max and Nux end up on board Furiosa's rig, in which she is hoping to smuggle Joe's five young wives to safety. The plot itself is fairly blunt, which means that the film requires very little dialogue (Max doesn't speak at all for the first 45 minutes, mainly because his houth is actually bolted shut). Even so, Miller fills every shot with telling details that strengthen the characters and provide insight into what they are doing, building more intriguing relationships with suspicious glances than most filmmakers do with endless conversation. As a result, the actors manage to create vividly complicated people that make every battle riotously involving. Hardy has terrific presence as the angry, frustrated Max, beautifully balanced by the utterly riveting Theron, whose yearning for her green homeland is as palpable as Max's inner rage. And Hoult's character takes the most intriguing journey, a true believer willing to give his life for his cause who slowly begins to see the world through other eyes. Even as Miller grapples with these kinds of larger themes, he never forgets that the audience loves spectacle. Shooting with vivid colours while wryly undermining the machismo, Miller has created a rare coherent and adrenaline-pumping action thriller, much as he did in 1981 with The Road Warrior. The fast-paced, epically orchestrated set-pieces are simply jaw-dropping, staged on a large scale without any visible digital trickery. Yes, the film is essentially one tenacious chase, with only a brief (and welcome) pause to intake a deep breath before the final explosion of action. And what a rush it is!",POSITIVE

"May 14, 2015"," Step out to a theater -- find one with the biggest screen and the hottest sound system -- strap yourself in, and enjoy two hours of the best moviemaking in this world and the next. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" sets new standards in old-school stunt work and car chases and does it in service of an idea-driven story with a beating heart and an action star for our troubled times in Charlize Theron. The visual and aural experience is pitched just short of overload in the first hour but all those quick beats and eye-popping edits pay off in the quieter moments at the end. More than 36 years after Mad Max Rockatansky first gunned his Interceptor across the Australian Outback, creator George Miller shows a new generation of comic-book directors and franchise-movie revivers how it's done. The roaring and buzzing starts as a rumble of faraway thunder before the first shot. Max stands at the edge of a cliff, looking down at a fallen world left barren by war. A two-headed lizard skitters by and becomes a power snack for Max before the War Boys come after him. It's on! From that moment forward, there's nothing but boldly composed, brazenly executed action for the next hour. Max, all yoked shoulders and roped forearms courtesy of Tom Hardy, gets run down by the War Boys and becomes a slave of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a warlord who rules the Citadel, his desert kingdom, by controlling the supply of oil and water and breast milk (don't ask). Max, dogged by dark visions from his past, has to wear a mask that's tighter than the one Hardy wore in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and hang upside down or get strapped to the front of a screaming war vehicle. He barely says two words, neither printable here. While that's going on, Imperator Furiosa (Theron) is taking off in a War Rig with cargo more precious than ""guzzle-ine"" -- five young women enslaved as breeders by Immortan Joe. Her betrayal brings down the full wrath of everyone with the keys to a souped-up, open-engine anything, including a semi that carries a bank of amps and a guitarist with a flame-spitting axe suspended from a bungee chord. He plays death metal with an Outback beat. It's sick. The whole movie is sick. Miller has basically rewritten ""The Road Warrior"" -- by far the best of the previous movies, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the ""Mad Max"" trilogy -- and updated it with 21st-century technology. There are an amazing number of edits, more than 2,700 in two hours, and some beautifully colorized backgrounds but no green screens or motion capture. Miller created it all in the Namibian desert, fighting sandstorms and heat the way David Lean and John Huston used to do it, and made an epic that throws down the gauntlet for J.J. Abrams and the ""Star Wars"" crew. Because on ""Fury Road,"" it all works together -- the costumes, the sound, the lighting, the stunts -- to create a sensory experience unlike anything in this era of lumbering blockbusters. By the time the pursuers start pogo-ing across the screen on huge poles -- from one speeding vehicle to another -- all you can do is laugh at the audacity and forget about the huge logical inconsistency that lurks at the back of the ""Mad Max"" universe: If gasoline is so precious, why does everyone burn so much of it racing across the desert in contraptions that clearly don't meet EPA emission standards? At its center is Theron, buzz-cut and eye-black, banging gears with one working arm and trying to get these fertile women to the Green Place. Max is the title character, but his role is to help the women get from one end of the desert to the other, same as Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy with a conscience. The danger in this netherworld comes from men and any salvation will start with women, something Max is evolved enough to understand (once he gets that mask off). The last few years of cinema have been all about superheroes, Marvel vs. DC, Batman vs. Iron Man vs. Superman vs. Ant-Man, and who shows up in which sequel and what's the opening weekend box office in China? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" flips all that silly world-building on its side and roars off in an exciting old-is-new direction. Captain America and his special Frisbee shield, Thor and his mighty hammer, even Batman and his tortured psyche and armored Batmobile ... none of them would stand a chance against Furiousa and Max in the open desert. If you can't take the heat, Marvel, stay out of this kitchen. You'll get burned.

"May 14, 2015"," A movie review of “Mad Max: Fury Road”: Sheer pyrotechnic insanity. Director George Miller proves he still has it with this fourth installment of the series starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Rating: 4 stars out of 4. It’s been 30 years since the last “Max,” the regrettable and forgettable “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” — Lost children? Tina Turner? Lame. But really, it’s been 34 years since the franchise’s previous peak, “The Road Warrior.” With “Fury Road,” George Miller, who directed all four of the “Maxes” and co-wrote this one with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that after all this time he still has it. “It,” meaning an all-consuming addiction to demento-extremo stunts and high-octane vehicular mayhem. ‘Mad Max: Fury Road,’ with Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne. Directed by George Miller, from a screenplay by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. 120 minutes. Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images. Several theaters. Miller’s style is over-the-top all-of-the-time. Across a hellish landscape of rust-hued desert sands and towering, lightning-lit sandstorms, in the first of many jaw-dropping chases, Miller sends squadrons of bald berserkers driving all manner of much-modified, big-wheeled, scuffed-up retro hot rods in hot pursuit of a fleeing Max (Tom Hardy, taking over the part from Mel Gibson, who originated the role). Also on the run in a monster truck from these raging crazies is a shaven-headed, one-armed fearsome female road warrior with the fabulous moniker Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, grim-faced with kohl-rimmed eyes). These pursuers are accompanied by a ride-along band of pounding war drummers and a crimson-clad guitarist whose electric ax shoots flames out the neck. Nothing subtle here.  Civilization has collapsed, and the ruins are ruled by a disfigured dictator named the Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous Toecutter in the original 1979 “Max Max”). Captured, chained and slowly drained of blood to fuel the Immortan’s unnaturally white and diseased young male minions called War Boys (the main one of whom is played by Nicholas Hoult), Max has plenty of reasons to be mad. The long-ago violent deaths of his family, which haunt him in flashbacks, make him even madder.  So when he finally escapes and emerges, like some primordial creature out of the desert dust, his goal is vengeance, which to him will be his only redemption. He joins forces with Furiosa, who is seeking redemption as well by rescuing and fleeing with the five young slave wives of the Immortan. Who look like swimsuit models wrapped in diaphanous white garments. These lovelies provide a weird contrast to all the grime and grease, but they’re part and parcel of the bizarro extremity of Miller’s vision and somehow they fit in with everything else.  “Fury’s” pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible — such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies — Hardy’s performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa.

"May 13, 2015","Despite the fact we didn't need another Max Max movie, we have one. Thankfully it's awesome.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," It
would be a mistake to say that the plot of Mad
Max: Fury Road is skeletal. The screenplay by director George Miller,
Brendan McCarthy, and Nick Lathouris scrapes away the distracting tissue of a
barebones plot until we are left with just the marrow. In
terms of story, this is a chase film and nothing more. One party is on the run,
and up to three other groups are in pursuit. This description is not an insult.
At a time when so many modern action movies overwhelm us with exposition and
unnecessary specifics, here is a lesson in economical storytelling that
defiantly takes the stance that less is more. This, of course, leaves plenty of
room for Miller to give us more where it counts. In this case, though, it's not
just more but more, more, more, more, and, in case the other instances didn't
stick, more. Here's
an action spectacle in which the action is genuinely spectaculara robust
combination of practical stunt work and digital effects in which it becomes
impossible to make a distinction between the two. We assume the moments in which
lives are in danger have been digitally manipulated or crafted, but then there's
the scene in which one man is lying on the front of a souped-up muscle car in
order to pour gasoline directly into the engine while another man is lying on
the hood of semi-truck to do the same thingalbeit while spitting fuel into
the engine. Miller's
camera gets in close, of course, but it also hangs back in other shots so that
we can see the vehicles, the men atop them, and the road speeding underneath
this procession of dueling gas-guzzling-and-spewing. This isn't a visual effect.
These are clearly two men lying on top of speeding vehicles, risking a lot for a
scene that is not only inventive in terms of what is happening but also
thrilling and funny in those same terms. Miller and his crew didn't have to put
two men in this situation. They did, though, and it pays off in ways that only
begin with the logistics of the stunt. This is
just one moment in one extended sequence in the midst of a chase that is, more
or less, the entirety of the film. It isn't necessarily more memorable than the
countless other moments of death-defying stunt work on display here, but it is
an instance that exemplifies Miller's approach to this tale. It's daring,
resourceful, amusing, and clearly communicated. The whole scene exists without
any verbal prompts to explain what's happening, but Miller gives us everything
we need to know in visual terms. That's
true, really, of the whole film, which begins with a top-heavy bit of narrated
exposition from Max (a grunting, growling Tom Hardy). He was, as has been
established in the previous three films of this franchise, a cop before world
ended in a nuclear event prompted by a war for oil. Now, he wanders the
wasteland, ""hunted by scavengers and haunted by the past,"" namely the
ghosts of people who died while under his protection. In the
film's prologue, Max is captured by a group of hairless men plastered in white
chalk. They shackle him, tattoo his back with his blood type, and prevent his
near-escape. They are members of the Citadel, a warrior society housed in and
around massive rock formations in the middle of the desert. The
group is led by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a hulking figure who wears a
jagged-tooth respirator and a plastic shell to protect his burned skin. At the
start, we don't comprehend much of what's happening here. The screenplay reveals
everything we need to know in small ways that gradually build to a startling
picture of a twisted death cult built around the idea of eagerly fighting and
dying for a ruthless tyrant, who lords over the realm from a skull-shaped hollow
in the side of the cliff. The
film abruptly shifts perspective and, honestly, never really returns to our
eponymous hero. The central figure here is actually Imperator Furiosa (Charlize
Theron, in a commanding performance that embodies equal measures of physical
strength and emotional vulnerability), who has stolen a tanker in which the
leader's ""wives"" are hidden. She has plans to bring them to safety in ""the
Green Place."" In the
first of a series of lengthy action sequences, Max is chained to the front of an
enemy car driven by Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a fighter with a death wish who later
becomes an ally, while Furiosa, who has a mechanical arm to compensate for an
amputation, is attempting to flee from and/or destroy that caras well as an
assortment of others (including one containing Joe's battle music, featuring a
most dedicated guitarist). It's a nifty bit of tearing our sympathies, since we
instinctually don't want anything to happen to our heroes but realize that they
are, at the moment, indirectly set against each other. The film does the same
thing soon after in an intense scene of hand-to-hand combat in which neither Max
nor Furiosa is sure of the other's motives. Words
seem insufficient to describe the nearly non-stop barrage of carnage that
follows. Cars flip and explode. Henchmen hurl detonating spears. Another tribe
from the nearby Gas Town joins the pursuit, and the first sequence climaxes
inside the all-encompassing amber of a sandstorm, where strobing streaks of
white lightning highlight the combatants' faces and towering whirlwinds are able
to lift a car to a fiery demise. More
important than what happens in this sequence and the other ones is how Miller,
cinematographer John Seale, and editor Margaret Sixel ensure that every beat
moves the action forward in a way that not only raises the stakes but also
constantly reminds us of the arrangement of the participants. We know where
everyone is at any given moment. We discover that we actually care about these
characters and their fates (primarily Furiosa), which comes as a bit of a shock
considering that there's barely time for words. Miller, McCarthy, and Lathouris
know that actions reveal character, and they take advantage of the plethora of
time available for those moments. This is
a film that repeatedly surprises us with how far Miller, his team, and the
performers are willing to take it. We think we've seen it all in the first
sequence, but that's just the start of what the film has to offer. Mad

"May 13, 2015"," The brutal Mad Max universe hasn’t gotten any softer with time, nor has director George Miller, now in his 70s and revisiting the devastated future he last brought to the screen in 1985’s Beyond Thunderdome. Essentially a two-hour chase, Fury Road is a brilliant example of a broad palette of filmmaking techniques applied in service of a gripping thrill-ride that seldom relents. The big budget is matched by massive creativity, ranging from subtle makeup effects distinguishing one sad future freak from another to a staggering number of crazy and often-enormous future battle vehicles in epic confrontations. A strong emphasis on practical effects is bolstered, not replaced, by CGI work that’s always in keeping with the Mad Max aesthetic, with vehicular carnage that’s truly something to behold, and constantly rich in variety. Miller’s had plenty of time to continue his world-building, and it shows, with Fury Road rich in details that thankfully don’t require explanation. The same is true of key narrative elements, the film respecting its audience, showing instead of telling, and proving continually intriguing in the process. The constant chase helps newcomers, who’ll be just as able to follow events as hardcore fans. And in Tom Hardy the film has found its perfect Max, an actor possessed of great presence, requiring little dialogue, happy to have his face obscured and be relegated to the sidelines of first act skirmishes, and able to project a physical resemblance to predecessor Mad Mel where required. A modern action classic that’s not beholden to contemporary or past stylistic trends, Fury Road is its own unique beast, perhaps beamed in from a parallel universe where the last thirty years of action movies have been this bloody good the whole time. Maybe it’s called Battletruck there too.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015","  Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece of cinema, a full throttle symphony of mayhem and exhilaration that will blow audiences out of their chairs. I waited a day to write this review. Time was needed to examine this film in retrospect. Walking out of the theater, I was shell-shocked. Stupefied with amazement. Twenty-four hours later, my feelings have grown fonder. I could watch this film a hundred times. After a thirty-year absence, George Miller has resurrected Mad Max like a deity reborn to greatness.   In the vast wasteland of the nuclear decimated future, a hideous despot - Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules atop mighty peaks. Worshipped by his men, he rules a starved and broken people by controlling their access to water. Joe's evil dystopia is shattered when his lieutenant, Imperator Furiousa (Charlize Theron), steals his treasured brides. Hurtling through the scorched desert in her war rig, she dares escape to the paradise of her birth. Surrounded by savage gangs, with Joe and his army in terrifying pursuit; she finds an unlikely savior (Tom Hardy as Mad Max).   Mad Max: Fury Road is literally a two hour nonstop chase. There's five minutes of exposition and it is pedal to the metal. There's much unsaid in this film. Tom Hardy has scant dialogue. Charlize Theron barely speaks more. The supporting characters carry the lion's share of speech. But the leads own, own, own this movie with their raw, brutally physical performance. Hardy is grizzled like chewed leather, but his eyes betray his kind heart. Theron wears an iron visage of fear, desperation, and resolve. Their countenance is willpower personified. This pair of actors are gunpowder and bullets, fire and octane, every adjective I can think of for lethal. They beat the daylight out of some seriously bad-assed villains. But are not innately violent, just survivors in a terrible world.   The filmmaking and technical expertise on display here are award worthy. The spectacular stunt driving, the unheralded stunt men, the bone- crushing vehicles, the bleak production design, the incredible special effects, the sure to be Oscar nominated editing, every facet of Fury Road is freaking exceptional. The plot is simple, but the lack of complexity does not meant a bad story. The story is riveting. Joe's slave brides, their breastmilk diet, kept beauties for breeding, juxtaposed against the harshness and cruelty of their world is pretty shocking to see. George Miller paints a disturbing, thoughtful canvas, with brushstrokes of insane violence. He had a grand vision for this film, an opus of destruction to surpass his original trilogy. I daresay he has fulfilled it.   Mad Max: Fury Road is a must see, in the best theater possible. It is worth every penny. This review is effusive in praise, and not a single word is hyperbole. Mad Max: Fury Road is quite simply, one of the best action films ever made. Tom Hardy welcome to mega stardom.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," It was great song and a fitting end to an outstanding trilogy. But I think I’m going to have to take issue with those lyrics. It turns out we really did someone to step up to the plate for another helping of post apocalyptic mayhem. And I can’t imagine anyone else fitting Gibson’s boots as snugly as Tom Hardy. It may have taken Aussie director George Miller 30 years to find him, but the posh Brit has the perfect blend of grit and soul to play the mythical “Road Warrior”. It doesn’t even matter that his accent is a bit off. Like all great action directors, Miller only turns to dialogue as a last resort. After a grizzled opening voice-over - Max, we learn, is a now a man “reduced to a single instinct - survival” - we barely get a sentence out of Hardy for the rest of the movie. Instead, we just watch in awe as a deliciously tense, gloriously unhinged and astonishingly imaginative car chase and scrap unfolds over a frenetic two hours. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping, the cinematography stunning and the editing masterful. Set again some time after a global catastrophe, Max is again a loner making is own way through an ultraviolent Australia. That’s until he finds himself caught in the middle in a tribal squabble between fascistic warlord Immortan Joe (played by Mad Max veteran Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his rebellious, one-handed general Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Joe has taken control of a giant well and has used his power to enslave thousands and create a bizarre society with him as divinely appointed dictator. But Furiosa threatens his plans to create a royal dynasty when she heads into the desert in a giant battle tanker with his five best “breeders”. In future Aussie slang, this is the charming name for the willowy women Joe has given the unenviable task of providing him with a son. As good as Hardy is, Theron is even better as the steely Furiosa, delivering the best performance as an action heroine since Sigourney Weaver left the Alien series. For the first hour or so, Max is merely a bonnet ornament on the car of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) – a religious extremist and suicidal grunt who is spearheading Joe’s chasing convoy. But after an eye-popping early skirmish, Max and Furiosa forge an uneasy alliance. Still, don’t expect a love story. These are just two heroes who learn to respect each other while blasting punks to pieces at high speed. We don’t need another hero? Miller has just treated us to a double-helping. Perhaps tellingly, Warner Brothers only screened the film to critics in 2D. And apart from a couple scenes where debris flies into the back row, Miller seems to use the 3D sparingly. The bendy poles Joe's troops use for high-speed boarding might be given an extra-boost, but I'd go for the cheaper tickets. To be honest, this is such a visual treat an extra-dimension seems like overkill. Although, Mad Max at the IMAX could make for a great second viewing.",POSITIVE

"May 13, 2015"," On top of that terrific stuff — all of which will turn this version of Mad Max into a 2015 summer blockbuster that could even rival the box office of the latest Avengers episode — Fury Road is a savage commentary on contemporary society. The 70-year-old Miller’s robust script is that smart. It was co-authored with actor-writer Nick Lathouris (who played Grease Rat in the original Mad Max) and comic book artist Brendan McCarthy (who once wrote for the Canadian animation series ReBoot). Together, they conjured up Australia’s angry answer to George Orwell’s 1984 or Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451. In their case, the Mad Max co-authors lampoon everyone from new age fascists to suicide warriors brainwashed by terrorists into thinking that their deaths will mean something rapturous and worthy. In the post-apocalyptic world depicted in Fury Road, Hardy is the new Max Rockatansky, replacing Mel Gibson as the former highway cop who finds himself trying to survive the madness of hooligans, scavengers and murderers on the road. The major twist this time is that Theron is his equal, and his rival, and perhaps his noble partner-in-crime. As a second, powerful Road Warrior, she gives the new movie its femme fatale power. Theron’s character, Imperator Furiosa, has only one complete arm. So she uses a mechanical hand mounted on her stump that turns her into a feminist Terminator ... when the occasion calls for it. The set-up is fairly simple. It is 2060. We find ourselves in a parched landscape devoid of vegetation (Fury Road was photographed in Australia and, for most of the outdoor sequences, in the gorgeous deserts of Namibia in southern Africa when the original deserts where Mad Max was shot were turned into a verdant paradise after monsoon rains). The territory known as The Wasteland is ruled by a despot named King Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who gave us Toecutter in the original Mad Max). Behind his Darth Vader-as-a-clown mask, Big Bad Joe rules by controlling the flow of water. His totalitarian regime has given rise to the War Boys — young men like the wide-eyed, white-faced Nux (the wonderful Nicholas Hoult) — who willingly and routinely die to maintain Joe’s regime. But things start to unravel and Joe is mightily angry when Imperator Furiosa, a trusted lieutenant, goes rogue by driving off with a critically important 18-wheeler rig. Worse still, she takes Joe’s five young wives along for the freedom ride. The roster of hotties includes red-headed Riley Keough, an American actress and model who happens to be the eldest grandchild of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. Keough’s character, known as Capable (because she certainly is) ends up having a complex relationship with Nux, even though he first appears to be her enemy in this conflict. Fury Road is essentially one long chase movie done at breakneck speed. As Furiosa rumbles across the desert in the big rig, as Max becomes her unwilling accomplice, as the Five Wives become the object of everyone’s desire, as secrets and lies are revealed in shattering ways, this new Mad Max becomes a hypnotic trance that turns viewers into participants. Of course, if you do not like action pictures, then you might want to run screaming from the theatre and escape into the nearest Hollywood rom-com. But fans of the original Mad Max series — especially the first two — are legion. Fury Road, with its sensational photography, set design and other technical attributes that bring this fourth Mad Max into the 21st century, will only add more legions of fans to the now-legendary franchise.

"May 13, 2015"," Diesel and dust, blood and fire: Mad Max: Fury Road runs on all of it, flooding its fuel tanks to stay in perpetual motion. Forgive the wordplay, but this is the kind of movie that turns even timid drivers into fanatical car nuts. For two breathless hours, the vehicular mayhem never lets up. Spiked dune buggies, like porcupines on wheels, burn rubber and scratch metal. All-terrain gas guzzlers flip through the air, their rusty steel frames crunching and combusting upon impact. On the hoods of these speeding war machines, ravaged travelers battle with fists, pistols, and even chainsaws. To single out a favorite image from this flurry of nonstop shock and awe would require committing all of it to memory. But here’s one contender: a masked musician, perched high on a mobile stage, serenading his fellow marauders with triumphant power chords. He supplies the appropriate soundtrack for this rock-’n’-roll apocalypse. Also, his guitar is a flamethrower. With Fury Road, director George Miller returns to the lawless, oil-deprived future of his seminal series for the first time in three decades. It was worth the wait. Each Mad Max film has been bigger and more expensive than the last, the scale expanding exponentially from the frugal road rage of the 1979 original to the increasingly elaborate dystopias of The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. Here, the budget races across the nine-digit line and it shows. Some directors don’t know what to do with that much money, relinquishing control and losing personality in the face of hefty studio investment. Not George Miller. Rather than cede demolition duties to a digital team, the filmmaker pours most of his pennies into the lost arts of daredevil stunt work and real pyrotechnics. The result feels like the closest Miller has ever come to getting the noisy, spectacular action movie in his head—the Mad Max he could only dream about in his fledgling years—up there on-screen. In the age of Ultron, there’s something comforting about a franchise free of continuity, where no new installment demands homework. Fury Road dispenses with the niceties of expository catch-up, getting audiences on its titular escape route as quickly as possible. Most of the film unfolds like one long car chase, a feverish pursuit across the vast, arid expanses of the Namib Desert (filling in for the Outback). Max is up against another fearsome warlord, a bulky despot in a skull mask, played—unrecognizably, but still notably—by the bad guy from the first movie, Hugh Keays-Byrne. Immortan Joe, a heavy cut from the same ragged cloth as Lord Humungus, rules his desert oasis with an iron fist, doling out the water supply to his slave labor in drops and instilling a literal death wish in his army of chalk-white “war boys.” He’s cruising for a dismembering.  For the first time ever, the road warrior himself isn’t played by Mel Gibson, who may now be too crazy even to occupy the role of—in the new movie’s parlance—“a man reduced to a single instinct: survival.” Tom Hardy, that handsome bruiser with the low English mutter and the tank-like build, makes for a suitable replacement. Introduced snacking on a live lizard in the calm-before-the-storm of the opening scene, his Max is meaner, terser, and more unchained than the charismatic antihero that made Gibson a star. He’s also, in some respects, a sideline attraction. One of Miller’s boldest choices is to put Max in the passenger seat of the narrative, letting him ride shotgun with a metal-armed Charlize Theron, in what may be the best action heroine performance since Sigourney Weaver duked it out with a queen alien.  The plot, thin by design, finds Theron’s gone-rogue soldier slave Furiosa smuggling the villain’s harem of “breeder” wives onto a souped-up tanker and heading for (literally) greener pastures. Miller is said to have brought Eve Ensler, author of The Vagina Monologues, in as a consultant on his script. If Fury Road isn’t quite a full-blown feminist blockbuster, it almost gets there: This is a film, after all, where imprisoned women rebel against an abusive patriarch with designs on their ovaries, putting the hurt on his legions of slobbering man-children. Speaking of which, the only other vaguely sympathetic male character, besides Max, is one of those pasty war pawns—a hyperactive, glory-obsessed drone played by Nicholas Hoult. Bellowing “What a day!” as he barrels into an epic sand storm, this zealot is a source of sick laughs, until Miller locates a strange poignancy in his desire for a glorious death. Max, by contrast, remains most interesting as a force of pure mythic destruction, drifting into the conflict basically by accident. (His survivor’s guilt, expressed through sudden flashes of the loved ones he couldn’t save, is among the film’s least compelling ideas.) Likewise, Fury Road reaches its most transcendent heights when at maximum velocity, considerations of character and theme taking a backseat to an awe-inspiring onslaught of (mostly practical) effects. Miller’s years in animation, seemingly squandering his gifts on those innocuous Happy Feet movies, have provided him an almost limitless imagination—the ability to envision such Tex Avery touches as vertical poles that send enemy combatants swaying in and out of battle. At the same time, Miller keeps everything physical, putting flesh-and-blood humans perilously close to spinning tires and billowing flames. For all the chaos erupting at all times, we never lose track of what’s going on, because it’s been staged not just with diabolical mischief, but also total clarity. What a movie. ",NEGATIVE
"May 13, 2015","The first ""Mad Max"" movie in 30 years doesn't disappoint -- it's a sonic-speed juggernaut of violence and destruction.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" hits the ground running and never lets up in an orgy of automotive action that ought to be exhausting but, in the hands of George Miller, turns out to be exhilarating. It is insane. In a good way. Whoever said ""Too much is never enough"" made an impression on Miller, who uses the phrase as a starting point and blasts off from there. Miller, of course, directed Mel Gibson in ""Mad Max"" (1979) and ""The Road Warrior"" (1981), the best of the original bunch, and co-directed ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985). In those films, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) is a former cop who avenges the death of his wife and son at the hands of a biker gang. Later, he's a kind of savior for the post-apocalyptic set, living in a world in which water and gasoline are scarce and, thus, valuable, even when human life is not. ""Fury Road"" retains some of that story, but it's different — especially Max, now played by Tom Hardy. As the film begins, he's on the road, mourning the death of his wife and daughter. The latter haunts him in visions, wanting to know why he couldn't save them. Max gets captured and tortured by the minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max""). Joe is a monstrous creature, wearing some kind of steam-punk breathing device and hoarding water, using it to control what's left of the population. It's a nightmarish existence punctuated by mother's milk (really) and horsepower, at least whenever Joe sends groups out to retrieve gasoline. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads one of those excursions, but things go awry when she goes rogue. She has something of great value to Joe — five of his wives — so he and his troops head off in hot pursuit. explode and recover and just go, go, go. This is as good as action sequences in movies get. It's a visceral experience. You don't just watch this movie, you feel it. And the story? That's in there, too, moving along at a slower pace, constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by the mania. It's sort of like being handed a decent novel while boarding a roller coaster. What did you think of the character development? Uh, uh … hills? This sounds like a major demerit, and maybe it should be. But it doesn't play that way because the go-for-broke action is true to the characters: This is how they live their lives. Or their half-lives — that's what the War Boys believe they have. Dying in service to Joe is a glorious sacrifice that will land them in Valhalla, or so they believe. Events conspire so that Max and Furiosa wind up as a tentative team. She has a plan in mind, but it doesn't work out as conceived, so Max offers an alternative. What those plans are doesn't really matter — they involve driving really fast and shooting at bad guys and crawling around and over and under speeding trucks and buggies and anything else on wheels. Hardy says very little, even compared with Gibson in the role. But he commands attention with his actions (and action is the coin of he realm in this world). Theron, meanwhile, actually has more to do. It's her movie in many ways — her story is what drives the plot, and Max is along for the ride. It's an intriguing shift in the Mad Max universe, and a good one. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" stands apart in the usual summer mishmash of remakes and reboots, recalling the films that came before but forging its own breakneck path as well.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," It’s no small understatement to say George Miller changed the face of post-apocalyptic cinema in 1981 with The Road Warrior, and thirty four years later the now 70 year-old Australian director has done it again. The effect will be more muted this time around as studios and fellow filmmakers are destined to pick and choose the wrong elements from Mad Max: Fury Road’s critical (and hopefully commercial) success to emulate, but there can be no doubt that Miller has once again burned the genre to the ground only to build it back up into something extraordinary. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a haunted loner wandering the desert wasteland with a singular daily goal – to survive until tomorrow. Even that minor objective is put in jeopardy though as Max is chased down, captured by a gaggle of War Boys – artificially identical-looking young men who live their brief lives solely to serve their master, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max) – and taken back to their rock fortress high above the desert floor. Elsewhere in the Citadel one of Joe’s star commanders, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is beginning her trek to secure supplies from a nearby outpost accompanied by a small squad of War Boys, but a change of plans leaves her on the run with an unlikely ally in Max. What follows is one of the finest car chase scenes in cinema history. It’s also the longest. Seriously. The remainder of the film, brief pauses to catch a breath aside, is one big, glorious chase scene. A big part of what made Miller’s Mad Max films stand apart from the dust and blood-strewn crowd was an affection for magnificent and gritty action set-pieces achieved with real vehicles and certifiably insane stuntmen. Recent years have seen many of his peers strive to create equal excitement with an excess of CG, but while such scenes can still be entertaining they’re rarely all that thrilling. Miller wisely stuck to what worked so well for him in the past and delivers new levels of vehicular mayhem with Fury Road. Trucks, cars, motorcycles and more race, dodge and explode with earth-shaking abandon across the seemingly endless terrain, gears and metal grinding in symphony with revving engines and screaming bags of flesh. Characters move in and out of vehicles in motion, leaping between hunks of motorized metal or falling to their death as projectiles and dust fill the air. The other important element that Miller brought to the genre is a sense of humanity amid the societal collapse and barren landscape. There are no giant, mutated insects roaming the wasteland or plague-ridden zombies stalking survivors for their blood – these films are simply about people trying to survive against the situation, the elements and each other. Max chooses to attempt survival alone, and for the most part he succeeds. Against his better judgement though he’s drawn again and again into the plight of others, although it’s typically when interfering promises some benefit for him as well. Max is a hero of circumstance, but Furiosa’s motivations are far more pure. The two make for a compelling pair – each haunted by past actions and failures, and each intent on never making those same mistakes again. Furiosa’s a welcome addition to the franchise and to the cineplex in general as she provides an equally competent and capable partner for Max. Like Edge of Tomorrow’s Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) she’s an equal to the film’s male lead in both character depth and ass-kicking ability. Hardy’s Max is our guide through this mad world, but Theron’s Furiosa is the heart. Both deliver characters hardened by their history, but while Hardy offers brief and subtle glimpses into his soul Theron allows the softness to occasionally break through her rigid surface. She creates a character whose life and plight we can’t help but care for and about, and it’s again a welcome intrusion into big budget summer entertainment. The sensory overload of big action and staggering stunt work is part of a tapestry that weaves cinematographer John Seale’s visuals together with a propulsive score from Junkie XL to great effect. Miller and Seale saw no reason for their apocalypse to be drab and dull and have delivered an aggressively beautiful film above and beyond the purely enjoyable carnage. Unique character design is widespread and multi-layered in its purpose, and the world shifts along the journey through various cataclysmic primary colors resulting in a film where nearly every frame is suitable for framing. Image and sound come together most creatively and spectacularly with the musical accompaniment of two war wagons – one featuring a percussion section and the other headlined by a masked and chained madman thrashing away on an electric guitar. Like drummer boys of the apocalypse, their music serves to propel the warriors into battle while also meshing with and becoming a part of the score. There are elements of the film that fare less well, or even poorly, including some sketchy acting by non-essential performers and some CG/green-screen work that stands out amid the action. Neither are deal-breakers, and both fade from memory as the next action spectacle takes center stage, but they do temporarily mar the world that Miller works so hard to create. Mad Max: Fury Road is what so many films strive for and so few achieve – an experience that feels somewhat unique it what it accomplishes. Ideally other filmmakers would embrace Miller’s action aesthetic – Justin Lin’s Fast & Furious films come the closest in recent memory – to deliver tangible thrills instead of cartoon antics, but it’s probably more likely that Miller will return with a fifth Mad Max film in the next decade.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," God bless George Miller for making a sequel that actually feels like the natural evolution of a concept, and not just a tribute band version of the original. Why can’t they all be like this? Sequels usually get “bigger” and “more” with no new ideas. Fury Road is that rarest of them, that actually moves the concept forward, that feels like a version 4.0 and not just the original with the volume turned up. Watching Mad Max turn into The Road Warrior and then into Fury Road (with a regrettable but perhaps necessary New Coke-style setback in Beyond Thunderdome) is like watching a biplane transform into an F-18. Fury Road could’ve been, and probably a lot of people wanted it to be, a turbo prop with a fancy paint job. Instead it’s pulling barrel rolls at Mach 1. The evolved world-building matches the subject matter perfectly, because what else would a post-apocalyptic wasteland do but gradually evolve into a new world order? The cops vs. bikers milieu of the original still had one foot firmly in the pre-apocalyptic past. The sequel let go of that as S&M biker gangs became S&M warlord clans and towns became garrisons. All this has fully congealed into a new paradigm of warring tribes in Fury Road. Where Lord Humungus commanded his own raiding party with their own traditions and styling like a band of Comanche on the plains in The Road Warrior, “Immortan Joe” (Hugh Keays-Byrne) in Fury Road rules an entire citadel (called, simply, “The Citadel”), where he controls the flow of resources, with castes, his own cult of personality, and even a court religion. We’ve gone from “that’s the last of the V8 interceptors” in Road Warrior, to a child soldier played by Nicholas Hoult bowing before a massive idol made of steering wheels saying “By my deeds I honor him,” saluting “V8!” (And yes, Nicholas Hoult is the little kid from About A Boy, wrap your mind around that one). I squealed with joy at this, as I did many moments of Fury Road, and in fact, hardly any note I jotted down during the film wasn’t followed by three exclamation points. A BLIND MUTANT PLAYING A DOUBLE NECKED FLAME SHOOTING GUITAR HOLY SH*T! Miller has managed to make Mad Max smarter and more sophisticated without losing the series’ panache or f*ck you charm, and with modern action camera work and choreography that manages to be frenetic without obfuscating. I hope a hundred shakey cam hacks see this and immediately jiggle themselves to death. For a long time, I could never understand the meaning of the word “decadent.” I’d always hear it used to describe a rich cake or a hard-partying rock band, but then when it’d show up in English class vocab lessons, it supposedly meant “characterizing a state of deterioration, or decay.” How could the same word describe both incredible excess yet also penurious decline? With Fury Road, it suddenly makes sense. There’s nothing like a state of lack to make you revel in what you do have, even worship it. Fury Road manages to combine bleakness with excess, and in a way that feels entirely logical. Resources have all dried up and scavenging is the only way to survive – why wouldn’t you roam the desert in murder convoys of flame-spewing muscle car frankensteins driven by cancer-riddled suicide warriors? In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, it just makes sense that a suicidal death cult would develop, and Fury Road‘s is so creatively realized that you’d accept it for its novelty value even if you couldn’t explain it. I’m going on and on about the logic of it all, but the “War Dogs” huff silver spray paint to pump themselves up (sort of like the Viking “berserker” myths, or Somalis chewing khat) and name their protruding tumors like pets (Nux has even drawn smiley faces on his). It’s visual brilliance, pure and simple. Fury Road‘s creative excesses are glorious, but entirely earned, such that the adult intellectual in me wants to jump right into the mosh pit with my punk rock teenage self screaming HOW F*CKING COOL IS THAT??? I hope you didn’t come here looking for a plot summary, but the gist is that Max (played by my man-crush Tom Hardy) has hooked up with a rebel band of Immortan Joe’s wife brigade led by fierce war broad Imperatur Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron. She plays her role admirably, but possibly the biggest disappointment of the film is that she doesn’t use her South African accent. This was the perfect opportunity! It’s set in antipodean wasteland! If not now, when? In any case, that sex is as much a prized wasteland resource as gas (“guzzleline,” in Mad Max parlance) was acknowledged in The Road Warrior, but becomes central to the story here. Like everything in Mad Max, it’s fairly self-explanatory without a lot of exposition or dialogue. And yet, this point has a lot of people calling the film “feminist.” Which seems not necessarily wrong, but unhelpful. First of all, I don’t go looking for “isms” in my action movies (and I could write a whole separate essay on why basic fairness shouldn’t be considered an “ism”), but here I’ll just say that to call Fury Road “feminist” makes it sound reactionary, when it isn’t. It makes its own statement and doesn’t need to be a response to previous, sh*ttier statements in order to justify its existence. Yes, women have an important, even equal role to play in it, just like they do in real life. Is that a political statement? I think it’s just good storytelling. If you want to move forward, stop looking back. This is just the world now. Those who object can f*ck off and start their own ism. There aren’t many knocks on this movie, as you might’ve gleaned from the headline, but one of the few moments that didn’t work for me was a scene that felt like it borrowed a little too heavily from the original Planet of the Apes. But for the most part, a lot of the similarities to other action and sci-fi movies just make you realize how many other movies owe a debt to The Road Warrior. There are the obvious homages, like Neil Marshall’s forgotten Doomsday, but also Waterworld and even the Fast/Furious series. Watch Vin Diesel’s crew hijack a convoy using muscle cars and grappling hooks and tell me it doesn’t remind you of Mad Max. In fact, The Road Warrior has been a touchstone for “badassness” for so long that I actually dreaded the idea of a sequel. What could possibly be gained from rehashing what’s been ripped off umpteen times before? Luckily, I was wrong. Both in thinking that Fury Road would be just another rehash, and in assuming that any those ripoffs ever saw past The Road Warrior‘s surface sheen. In Fury Road, George Miller proves that The Road Warrior wasn’t just fashion. He doesn’t repeat, he articulates, and it’s wonderful. Vince Mancini is a writer and comedian living in San Francisco.

"May 13, 2015"," Miller’s $150 million reboot is everything you could want in a summer movie. It’s devilishly detailed, stunningly photographed, boldly imagined and acted. This is the way reboots ought to be done. “Fury Road” continues and expands on the depleted, post-apocalyptic world that ex-cop Max Rockatansky (now played by Tom Hardy) ventures through, a hellish surreality choked with toxic air and mostly toxic people. In this fourth film in the series, which started in 1979, the brutish Max teams up with one of the toughest female characters we’ve ever seen on screen, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Through a number of tightly edited sequences, she and Rockatansky wind up being hotly pursued in the Wasteland by the evil and hideous Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from “Mad Max”) who has an iron grip on his people and precious resources, including water and even breast milk. Joe has in tow his group of deluded Warboy minions — young men fated for death who believe their master when he says getting to Valhalla is their greatest reward. And they want to get back what Furiosa has taken: a rig with its secret cargo — Joe’s five “wives.” The plot takes some surprising turns along this fast and furious road, and Miller and his special effects and stunt team throw at us numerous chases and showdowns along the way. Every one of them, including a toxic sandstorm near the start and a climactic sequence at the end, will leave you gasping for air. It’s remarkable that at 70, the veteran filmmaker, who also co-wrote and co-produced “Fury Road,” leaves recent dystopian adventures in the desert dust, shaping a vision brought to painter-like vividness by photography director John Seale (“The English Patient”).  Miller has put a spark back into this overworked genre by mostly tossing aside today’s over-reliance on computer-generated effects, a fallback that often drains a production of its human emotion. Instead, throughout the film, the hues in various scenes evoke the feeling of such classics as Sergio Leone’s Westerns and Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai.” With its countless improbable stunts involving motorcycles, monster rigs, souped-up cars, even catapults, this return to old-school filmmaking results in a movie that’s more intense, more real, more elemental. Even better is the direction in which Miller and his co-screenwriters (comic-book writer Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris) have maneuvered this testosterone-fueled series. While Hardy handily takes the wheel from Mel Gibson, who played him in the debut as well as in 1981’s “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” and 1985’s “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” it is the women who power “Fury Road.” The Oscar-winning Theron is the perfect driver for Miller’s feminist vehicle. As the nearly bald Furiosa, a renegade, one-armed war-rig driver who wants to go home in a world where home no longer exists, she’s a force of nature. Her Furiosa is a fighter, determined to do something right in a world that has been made wrong by men. Theron taps deeply into Furiosa’s humanity along with her feral determination. Her primal scream reverberates in our bones. As the “wives,” Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (“Transformers: Dark of the Moon”), Riley Keough (“Magic Mike”), Zoë Kravitz (“Divergent”), Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are impressive. So is Nicholas Hoult as War Boy Nux, one of Joe’s minions who discovers that the life he so devoutly believes in — yes, there’s religious symbolism here — is actually flawed. What remains an absolute in “Fury Road’s” whisk-right-by two hour running time is that Miller has breathed new life not just to his own series, but the action genre itself. “Fury Road” will leave you breathless and anticipating what will come next for Max, since Hardy has reportedly signed on for three more movies. Hopefully by then, theaters will do us all a favor and install some seat belts.",POSITIVE

"May 13, 2015"," ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’Director: George MillerStars: Tom Hardy, Charlize TheronRating: R5 (out of 5) Globes
Thirty years separate “Mad Max: Fury Road” and its last installment, the gee-whiz threequel “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.” It shows: All the pent-up expectation explodes in a relentless flurry of grease-stained automotive mayhem, peppered with explosions, collisions, dudes flying about on bending sticks and reams of S&M duds. In April “Furious 7” scored a fair amount of wows for a scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker drove a souped-up ride not through two but three skyscrapers. But did it have a fleet of porcupine cars? Some dude strapped to the front of a truck strumming out licks on a combination guitar-flame thrower? A desert storm so towering it makes the Red Sea climax from last year’s “Exodus” look like a wave pool?
There’s so much business going on there’s barely room for a plot. In this case that’s fine; any more story or character development than the little it has might get in the way of its beautiful, transcendent destruction. Brooding post-apocalyptic loner Max Rockatansky returns, transformed from a taciturn Mel Gibson into an even more withdrawn Tom Hardy. The bulk of this fourth entry is action — a single cross-continent chase between the vehicular armies of a white-haired fascist, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and Charlize Theron’s Furiosa, who has absconded with his gaggle of young brides. She hopes to whisper them away to one of those dystopian Edenic promised lands that may or may not exist, away from the things of man — which is to say oppressive, pudgy, old men who will chase them to the ends of the earth (or Australia) to maintain their oppressive patriarchy.


As ever, Max is part reluctant semi-hero, part bystander in a movie bearing his name. He even spends the first third chained up with a muzzle, rendering Hardy’s aggressive mumble-mouth even less coherent than his Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises.” It takes even longer for him to chill to Furiosa and company, even after realizing that if caught they’d return to subjugation, or worse. Hardy is the perfect Mad Max, in a way even better than Gibson: he’s a weird actor who never likes being too liked. He happily allows the movie to be stolen by Theron, whose buzz cut opens up her face, allowing her to project a constant aura of vulnerability and concentrated baddassery. (Oh, and she also has a robotic arm.) She has sad eyes but also a mighty scowl. Late in Furiosa teases at a backstory, something that drives her to seek redemption, but you don’t need to know it; she’s iconic as is. And though modern moviegoers still demand she occasionally be saved by a man, at least she’s not forced to fall in love with him.

And though modern moviegoers still demand she occasionally be saved by a man, at least she’s not forced to fall in love with him. Even at her most swaggering, Theron is still a pawn; the real star is franchise director George Miller. You can picture him spending years dreaming up little bits of action sequences he may never get the money to make, only to be handed $150 million and sent off to make his masterpiece. And all he had to do was make two “Happy Feet” entries. (This speed junkie freak also made the “Babe” movies, including the genius sequel, plus “Lorenzo’s Oil.” No modern blockbuster filmmmaker is this versatile, not even Spielberg.) Allowed to go back to his roots, Miller goes super-sized times 1,000. He dreams up hordes of absurd tricked-out cars, driven or pounced upon by a suicide squad of white-stained, hairless baddies, including Nux (a very game Nicholas Hoult), who like Max very belatedly turns to Furiosa’s side. He seamlessly mixes CGI with brutally real stunts. The action isn’t just relegated to a few set pieces, as in previous entries; they go on for tens of minutes on end. It even lets one scuffle play off-screen, because when you have this much jaw-dropping action you can afford to give some of it away. Technically these stretches are a bunch of stuff happening. But this isn’t “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” where director Joss Whedon offered battering rams of interchangeable, indifferently staged action. With the old “Mad Max” movies — especially its second entry, “Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior” —Miller helped invent the language of the action movie. He knows how to pound these things into a shape — pockets of Rube Goldbergian insanity that move cleanly, all while impressing with their sheer scale and busy-ness. And where “Avengers” was visually washed-out — with Hulk a dull green and Captain America’s blue suit looking like it went to the cleaners’ too many times — “Mad Max” offers blinding urine yellows and bold blues that sear retinas. Color: it is your friend. None of this adds up to much profound, but during the few slowed down breaks we can contemplate its anger. Even the lack of strong characterization ties into the idea of humankind reduced to types: the cop turned into a hollowed-out loner; the one-armed woman traumatized by domineering men. Even Hoult’s Nux is a statistic — one of hundreds, thousands tricked into obedience by promises of Valhalla. (Of course this is exactly the kind of film that would have be people screaming about Valhalla.) Even if it was just madness, what madness! And what insanity! Miller frontloads the weirdness, with an opening third that plays like a not-quite-watered down twist on “Fellini Satyricon” — all midgets in hanging chairs and fat old men with nipple rings and buxom woman hooked up to a mass breast pump. This shape-shifting franchise doesn’t offer the nerdish mythology of Marvel or YA films; each film is a one-off — another, very different adventure in an unraveling world. They’re even, in their ostentatious way, modest, running only two hours — just enough to exhaust us without tiring us out. It’s the rare franchise that should never die.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," The engines start revving before the first image appears in Mad Max: Fury Road. And the noise only occasionally lets up before the closing credits roll. It expands into a symphony of combustion, burning nitro, rolling tires, crunching metal, explosions, and the occasional whirring chainsaw. Accompanying this din: images of brutal choreography that, in scene after scene, set the standard by which future action films are destined to be judged. Fury Road keeps producing one astonishing image after another: sedan frames set atop tank treads, warriors on poles, bikers dropping bombs as they jump over moving cars, a mutant guitarist on a bungee cord providing a martial soundtrack of metal riffs with a flame-spitting guitar while riding atop a vehicle outfitted with a towering wall of amps and an expansive percussion section. And it uses these images to construct action scenes edited with a dancer’s sense of rhythm. Accomplished largely through practical effects—though the digital touch-ups are both easy to spot and part of the film’s aesthetic—Fury Road’s action plays more like visions from the future than like throwbacks. It’s as if director George Miller, who’s mostly spent the past few decades directing and producing family-friendly efforts like the Babe and Happy Feet films, got tired of waiting for everyone else to catch up with the action movies inside his head, and decided to show everyone how it’s done once more. If Fury Road were only interested in action, it would still be a stunning achievement, but the film has more on its mind. The fourth entry in Miller’s post-apocalyptic series, and the first since Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985, Fury Road pushes its title character further from anything resembling civilization than any of its predecessors. Now played by Tom Hardy, taking over the role from Mel Gibson, Max begins the film staring out across a desert plain, chewing on a two-headed lizard as he contemplates what’s become of the Earth after, as we learn in news snippets played over the film’s opening credits, it’s laid to waste by wars for oil and water, and all but finished off by a thermonuclear skirmish. For the first time in the series, Max seems like he might live up to his name. Haunted by those he couldn’t save, and driven, by his own reckoning, only by the urge to survive, he seems emptied out. He’s also soon running for his life, fleeing the forces of the aging warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his pale, bald War Boys in the black Interceptor made famous in the first two films. Then the always-reliable Interceptor gets flipped, and Max is taken prisoner. Max’s quick capture is the film’s first unexpected turn, but hardly its last. Brought to The Citadel, Immortan Joe’s desert compound, Max is used as a human blood bag for an ailing War Boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Though Max is ostensibly the protagonist, he spends much of Fury Road’s first act either hanging from a ceiling, or chained to the front of a car. Meanwhile, the film reveals the workings of The Citadel, where Immortan Joe keeps the populace under his thumb by dispensing water as he sees fit, using nursing women to produce a supply of milk, and spinning tales of reincarnation and the glories of Valhalla to keep his War Boys loyal to his cause. While Max is in chains, Fury Road shifts its attention to its other protagonist, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the one-armed driver of a massive War Rig—a weaponized semi—trusted with making runs between The Citadel and nearby Gas Town. But on her latest outing, she decides to make an unexpected detour in an attempt to deliver some unauthorized cargo to safety: five women (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton) Immortan Joe has made into his personal harem and treated like breeding stock. Women have never had it easy in the wasteland. The threat of violence and sexual violation hangs over them constantly in Miller’s Mad Max films—which have always projected real-world issues into a dark near-future. Rather than confining this element to the margins, Fury Road takes it as a primary theme, revealing Furiosa’s journey as not just flight from Immortan Joe, but a search for a safe place removed from the madness and tyranny of men. The question, “Who killed the world?” gets raised a couple of times, first as graffiti, then as a bit of dialogue, and it’s always a woman asking the question. Yet for all the abuse they’ve taken, Furiosa and the fleeing women are driven more by compassion than anger. In one of the film’s subtler touches, an unexpected early-film act of mercy has important consequences in Fury Road’s final scenes. Not that much else about the film, apart from the mostly wordless evolution of the relationship between Max and Furiosa, can be called subtle. Miller co-wrote Fury Road—whose origins date back to the late 1990s, and whose troubled production includes one false start in 2001 and a continent-shifting change of venue—with actor Nick Lathouris and comic-book artist Brendan McCarthy (Judge Dredd, Rogan Gosh). The latter provided storyboards and designs, and the film sometimes plays like an attempt to realize ideas that only make sense on the pages of comics, bringing to life cars covered in spikes and characters like “Rictus Erectus,” who more than live up to their names. It’s a world gone wrong, yet one that’s assumed a kind of horrible beauty as humanity’s impulse to survive and desire to create and innovate have become twisted toward barbaric ends. It’s also a place troubled by some of the same fundamental philosophical questions about who we are, where we’re going, and how we’re supposed to live together. But here, they’re played out at breakneck speeds, along savage stretches of unforgiving desert, in a flood of fire, a hail of bullets, and accompanied by a deafening roar.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," George Miller’s “Mad Max” films didn’t just make Mel Gibson
a star—they completely transformed post-apocalyptic entertainment with their
visceral stunt work and singular vision of an increasingly desperate future.
Three decades after the last film, the oft-maligned “Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome,” Miller finally returns to this desolate landscape for the
highly-anticipated “Mad Max: Fury Road,” recasting the title role in the
grizzled visage of Tom Hardy and upping the stakes with promises of vehicular
mayhem on a level commensurate with what modern CGI audiences have come to
expect.  From its very first scenes, “Fury Road” vibrates with the
energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us
forward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so
often defined the modern summer blockbuster. Miller hasn’t just returned with a
new installment in a money-making franchise. The man who re-wrote the rules of
the post-apocalyptic action genre has returned to show a generation of
filmmakers how they’ve been stumbling in their attempts to follow in his
footsteps.  “Who was more crazy?
Me, or everyone else?” In “Mad Max: Fury Road,” Miller has pushed his
Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone mad to its logical extreme. No longer are
the people of Max Rockatansky’s world merely scavengers for oil or power; they
have been transformed into creatures of circumstance, either left with one
defining need or left without any semblance of reason. “Fury Road” is a violent
film, but the violent acts in this world don’t feel like arbitrary action
beats—they emerge from a complete lack of other options or a firm sense of
straight-up insanity. Miller’s new vision of Max isn’t a warrior. Rather, he’s
a man driven by the memories of past sins to do little more than survive. He
walks with the ghosts of those he couldn’t save, and his traveling companions
have pushed him to the brink of sanity. While wandering at this edge, Max is kidnapped and transformed
into a literal blood bag for a feral warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who
serves the whims of his maniacal ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who
also played the villain Toecutter in the original “Mad Max”). From the start,
Miller gives you no time to “ease” into this world or the story he wants to
tell. The frame rate is accelerated, the editing is hyperactive, the bad guy
speaks through a mask that makes half his dialogue indecipherable (shades of
Hardy’s Bane from “The Dark Knight Rises”), and the horrific visions of Miller’s
twisted future come fast and furious. Immortan Joe is a barely-alive freak of
nature, kept breathing by tubes connected to his face and served by similarly
disfigured half-humans with definitive names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones)
and The People Eater (John Howard).  One of Joe’s most notable warriors is a powerful woman known
as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is leading a
convoy from Immortan Joe’s citadel to the oil refinery Gastown when she
deviates off course. It turns out that Furiosa has kidnapped Joe’s “breeders,”
the women he keeps prisoner in an effort to create a male heir. She’s taking
them to “the green place,” to safety. Of
course, Joe sends his men after Furiosa—including Nux, to whom Max is still attached—and
the rest of “Mad Max: Fury Road” consists of one long sustained chase across
the unforgiving desert. With the exception of one centerpiece of dialogue, the
film takes place almost entirely on the move, speeding, chasing, bouncing, and
exploding across Miller’s scorched landscape. As a reflection of more desperate times, Miller has updated
the needs of his future world from commodities like oil to pure survival. Max
has been reimagined as a fighting, driving machine, a man who “finds his own
way,” moving forward in an attempt to outrun his ghosts. Nux is a brainwashed
goon, a man-creature who believes that he will die and be reborn after
sacrificing himself for a trip to Valhalla. Max eventually steps into the role
of the action hero, but, in one of his most daring moves, Miller gives the
weight of the narrative to Furiosa, a woman who holds on to the only thing that
could possibly give her hope in this violent world—the next generation. Theron
does arguably the best work of her career here, artfully conveying the drive in
Furiosa’s soul in a way that fuels the entire film. She does more with a
searing stare or clenched jaw than most actresses could with a page of
dialogue. And one shouldn’t undervalue the empowerment message at the heart of
this film—Eve Ensler, author of “The Vagina Monologues” consulted with Miller
on the script—which suggests that women, as the creators of new life, will,
inherently, always be the gender that holds hardest onto hope for the future.
Furiosa looks at the insanity of the male leadership around her and decides
enough is enough. When one of Furiosa’s wards goes into labor and still defends
herself and her yet-to-be-born child (after being shot no less), it’s hard not
to see “Fury Road” as an answer to the macho nonsense that so often defines the
action genre.  But none of that should remotely imply that the action here
is lost in the message. The pacing, the sound design, the editing, the music
(courtesy of Junkie XL and some of Joe’s freaks who play drums and electric
guitars during the action), and even the emotional stakes are all so far above
average that they make just about any other car-chase movie look like a quaint
Sunday drive by comparison. The first chase in “Fury Road,” as Joe’s men catch
up to Furiosa and her precious cargo, is one of the most remarkable action
sequences in film history. And that’s really just a warm-up. It’s no
exaggeration to say that, if you think something in “Fury Road” is the most breathtaking
action stunt you’ve seen in years, you really need only wait a few minutes to
see something better. This is a movie where you keep thinking that its reached its
apex and then, inexplicably, that moment is left behind in the dust. From the very beginning, Miller and his team do something
that so many other filmmakers fail to do—they define the geography of their
action. Rather than merely tossing the camera around in the vain hopes of
creating tension, they constantly give the viewer overhead shots and clear
physical dimensions of what’s happening and where we’re going. And then they
blow it all up. There are dozens of crashes, explosions, and flying bodies in
“Fury Road,” and yet the piece never gets repetitive, especially as the
emotional stakes increase with each sequence. Miller knows when to let the pace
coast when it needs to, which is rarely, and then he pushes the pedal down and
plasters you to your seat.  “Mad Max: Fury Road” is an action film about redemption and
revolution. Never content to merely repeat what he’s done before (even the
first three “Mad Max” have very distinct personalities), Miller has redefined his
vision of the future yet again, vibrantly imagining a world in which men have become
the pawns of insane leaders and women hold fiercely onto the last vestiges of
hope. “Fury Road” would be remarkable enough as a pure technical
accomplishment—a film that laughs in the face of blockbuster CGI orgies with
some of the best editing and sound design the genre has ever seen—and yet
Miller reaches for something greater than technical prowess. He holds aloft the
action template that he created with “The Road Warrior” and argues that
Hollywood shouldn’t have been copying it for the past three decades, they
should have been building on it. “Fury Road” is a challenge to a whole
generation of action filmmakers, urging them to follow its audacious path into the
genre’s future and, like Miller, try their hardest to create something new. Brian Tallerico is the Managing Editor of RogerEbert.com, and also covers television, film, Blu-ray, and video games.

"May 13, 2015"," George Lucas couldn’t do it. Steven Spielberg couldn’t do it. Ridley Scott couldn’t do it. None of the aforementioned filmmakers were able to successfully come back to the franchises they helped launch. Why would George Miller be any different? The Australian director hadn’t made a live-action movie since the dark and unjustly underrated Babe: Pig in the City and had not made an action film since Tina Turner ruled Bartertown in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome 30 years ago. Certain styles of filmmaking are no longer approachable for some directors, and why should it be any different for the director of Happy Feet 1 and 2? It is different. Not only has George Miller made an effective return to the wasteland of the Mad Max universe with Mad Max: Fury Road, he has surpassed most action films released … well … ever. Here is a movie that is basically one long chase, interspersed with just enough dialogue and backstory to build sympathetic characters as they crash their way through an endless desert. It’s a story of redemption for not only its titular character, but a number of people he encounters throughout. The action is relentless and eye-popping to say the very least, but what is most surprising of all is the use of the women vs. men in the story. If anyone predicted that a Mad Max film with very little dialogue written by three men could make a feminist statement, you win the prize. The story of how Fury Road came to be has become well known over the past few months, but for a brief recap: Miller began thinking about his iconic character in the late ‘90s, with plans to make Fury Road with the original Max, Mel Gibson. The Australian economy took a turn, 9/11 happened, crazy Mel emerged from the shadows of angry phone calls and traffic violations, and Miller went off to win an Oscar for Happy Feet. But Miller would not be denied his return. After a lengthy production process (including a year delay thanks to grass where the story demanded none and reshoots), the film is finally making its way to cinemas. You don’t need to see earlier Mad Max films to enjoy Fury Road, but you need to see Fury Road. We meet this Max (now played by Tom Hardy, in a loose reimagining of the character) as he is being chased down by Immortan Joe’s army of War Boys. Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villain Toecutter in Mad Max) is the ruler of a civilization that depends on him for water and survival. He is a man who uses obese women to pump out breast milk as a farmer would use cows, holds imprisoned men as “blood bags” for the sick, and keeps his Five Wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Riley Keough, Courtney Eaton, Abbey Lee) as prisoners to breed new offspring. He is surrounded by the aforementioned War Boys, a band of sick, bald, and pale men raised to believe the following: “I live. I die. I live again!” Nicholas Hoult plays way against type as one of these Boys, energetic and crazed as he screams his already oft-quoted line, “What a lovely day!” Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe’s head lieutenants, has escaped with the Five Mothers and is headed towards a salvation far, far away. A chase ensues, which includes an imprisoned Max, and the madness of the chase is underway. It is in the chase that we are reminded of Miller’s imagination. The War Boys treat steering wheels like sacred religious objects. Vehicles are put together with a mutated sense of craftsmanship: porcupine-like exteriors, tractor claws, buzz saws, and in one especially memorable sequence, high poles to swing back and forth on. Motorcycles fly over moving trucks. Characters walk atop and out of moving vehicles as though they’re taking a walk in the park, such is the life they lead. Much of this came to be thanks to impressive wire work and stunt choreography courtesy of Guy Norris. While CGI is used when needed (to great effect during a vicious sandstorm), it is Miller’s insistence upon practical special effects that leads to the action exploding off the screen. And special thanks to cinematographer John Seale for coming out of retirement, making the sky impossibly blue above the dead and barren world below. Little dialogue offers little problem for the characters in Fury Road. Hardy makes the role of Max his own by making him a desperate creature condemned to a guilt-ridden hell who finds himself on a road to redemption. Meeting him there is Theron, whose portrayal of Furiosa will bring delight to filmgoers who believe women are getting short shrift in recent cinematic offerings. The movie is more about Furiosa and the young women she is rescuing than it is about Max, and that’s okay. For the first time in the franchise, the story isn’t being relayed to us by a feral boy who grew to be a leader, or a young woman who is a leader of children, all regaling us with the triumphs and tragedies of the road warrior, Max. It is Max himself who introduces us to this story. He is as much an observer as he is a champion. Through his eyes we see women breaking free from their shackles, both literally and figuratively, as they defy Joe’s cry of “That’s my property” by accelerating away from him with a cold look. After a frightening demand from a male character, one wife tells another, “You don’t have to just because he says so.” Then there is the mighty Furiosa, who Max actually yields his gun to at one point after failing to hit a target. As for speech, Max is gagged for nearly 45 minutes before speaking a word to anyone, and even then he has been broken down to a man who grunts. As the action revvs up, it is Furiosa he must depend on and not the other way around. In roles that could have remained silent while Max and Furiosa do all the heavy lifting, each of the Five Wives has her own defining characteristic, but I’ll leave that to you to discover. Who runs the world? Girls. As for the action, what can be said? Miller’s eye hasn’t diminished in the years since Thunderdome. If anything, his vision is better than ever. He raised the bar with the final chase scene in The Road Warrior and has done so again in 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road. To say it’s better than expected is a slight upon this remarkably fresh take on decades-old material. There is little debate as to just who Mad Max really is. It isn’t Mel Gibson, and it isn’t even Tom Hardy. It’s George Miller.",POSITIVE
"May 13, 2015"," Bubbling up in conversations I’ve had with other critics and film fans recently has been a recurring debate: What is the future of the action movie? Where can the genre go from the bloated, calculated CGI monstrosities it has been vomiting up lately? (Even the mostly enjoyable ones seem to culminate in frenetic cartoons of stuff whizzing around banging into other stuff in ways that barely even register with the eye, and which seems deliberately designed to be incoherent.) Actually, it’s not even a debate, really: no one seems to have any idea where action might move, and most likely, whatever the next step is will hit us out of the blue, like how Lethal Weapon and Die Hard made us realize we didn’t know we required comedy with our action in the late 80, and how The Matrix blindsided us with the possibilities of CGI in 1999. So: If the genre requires a refreshening every dozen years or so, we’re overdue. Mad Max: Fury Road might not be that refreshening, but if it isn’t, it’s most definitely a reminder than the refreshening is desperately needed, and a hint of what that refreshening might feel like. (It feels good!) Fury Road is astonishing in a way that makes you feel like you haven’t seen a true action movie in a while, by underscoring how sterile and cold what has passed for the genre has been. If it doesn’t represent a refreshening, it’s only because it achieves its grotesque, magnificent brutality in an old-fashioned way: with a simple, straightforward good-versus-evil story set in a carefully conceived imaginary world brought to visceral plausibility through the sheer physicality of capturing on film real people doing real things in the real world. Even the most lovingly produced and technically accurate CGI could not have replicated the dusty authenticity of putting actors and stunt performers in actual vehicles and racing — and crashing! — them in a genuine desert. (The film was shot in New South Wales and Namibia.) Which is what Australian cinematic maestro George Miller (Happy Feet Two, Babe: Pig in the City) has done for his return to the postapocalyptic, water- and gas-thirsty future he created in 1979’s Mad Max. There are no green screens here, and CGI is used so sparingly that it’s barely noticeable as FX even when your head tells you it must be so, like how it lets an able-bodied actor play a character who has lost the left arm below the elbow. The bulk of the film consists of vehicular warfare carried out across sandblasted landscapes, and it is an assault on the senses in a good way, in the way that action movies used to be before they were disconnected from the physics of how the real world operates, and the sweat and the fear of how the human body responds to danger. (Turns out we feel it more, too, safe in our cinema seats, when the danger human bodies are in onscreen is this palpable.) Well, I’ll leave that you to find out. When I say that Fury Road is grotesque, I don’t mean only that it’s jam-packed with the sort of nasty postapocalyptic production design that Miller invented. It is that, crammed with biological trophies, spiky armor, and other horrors that Miller has now reinvented so that his film does not feel as if it’s full of easy shorthand clichés like most of the other movies that have borrowed it. No, I also mean that Miller’s vision of this cruel future is monstrous in some almost unthinkable ways, one of which is how Max comes to be caught up in events. (Max, by the way, is not the hero here. This is all Furiosa’s story, and that of the women she is helping. At best, he becomes her sidekick.) Miller’s world employs tropes of sci-fi and particularly of postapocalyptic stories in ways that smack them down, that insist that whatever horrors of human nature that the end of civilization may bring out, those horrors will not go unrebelled against. Immortan Joe, among his many other crimes against humanity, has reduced women to beasts, to farm animals… but that doesn’t mean they like it or accept it. There are no damsels in distress here: there are angry women fighting back and rescuing themselves. (The “wives” of Joe are played by Zoë Kravitz [Insurgent, X-Men: First Class], Rosie Huntington-Whiteley [Transformers: Dark of the Moon], Riley Keough [Magic Mike, The Runaways], Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton.) Miller depicts warlordism as something truly shocking and degenerate, and whatever signifiers of “cool” he may deploy in his massive conflagrations of cars and men — such as the battle “piper” on what could be called an Amplifier Rig playing an electric guitar that shoots fire to egg on Joe’s troops as they swarm to war — will later get a smackdown, a reminder that Joe is the villain here, and that he is not cool. Shorter Fury Road: Women are not going to be your sexbots in the afterscape, assholes. I fear this is going to upset some fans of the genre. They deserve upsetting. Miller’s critique of warlordism could be said to extend to the sorts of filmmakers who try to control every aspect of their films down the tiniest detail — the sort of control that CGI allows — instead of letting unpredictable reality rule. The religious worship Joe inspires, by calculated plan, in his young soldiers, such as fervently devoted Nux (Nicholas Hoult: X-Men: Days of Future Past, Jack the Giant Slayer), is of course destined only for disillusionment and disappointment when its absurd promises go unfulfilled. The promises of warlord directors, tweaking every drop of rain onscreen, every splatter of blood, every screech of tires, can tend toward much the same disillusionment. Freedom and surprise are better, and more fun. “Shorter Fury Road: Women are not going to be your sexbots in the afterscape, assholes. I fear this is going to upset some fans of the genre. They deserve upsetting.”
The hell is that supposed to mean? You think fans of this genre want women to be “sexbots”?
Anyways I’m pretty surprised you liked a film like this. Wow. Thats is straight up ridiculous (the “fans” that are upset about Fury Road having a leading bad ass female). I didn’t realize “fans” were upset about that.
As for the second part, Idk I just thought you wouldn’t of liked the style/tone of it. Not complaining though, its a damn good film. I think the movie is getting a little too much credit re its feminist stance. After all, Theron rescues the hot young girls yet does nothing to help the older obese women being used as human dairy farms. The film critiques the male gaze while at the same time indulging in it. Very enjoyable movie though and hopefully will spark a return to old school coherent action set pieces. Also, she needed to pick her battles, and choose the women most likely to survive, the younger and physically stronger ones. It’s in no way an indication that ‘Furiosa’ (or the writer) doesn’t care about the older women. Just another reviewer conforming to what those in this Politically Correct era want to hear. “Yeah, suck it *men*, we ain’t gonna be your slaves in the future!!” An extension of the retarded modern-era belief that being a complete woman requires being anti-male.  Looked at objectively, if the world really becomes this desperate, of course women will become the chattel of men. Or do you think the sex slaves of Boko Haram are currently achieving their freedom by somersaulting through the air in slow motion, grabbing their captor’s ak-47s, and mowing them down in hail of righteous gunfire while striking an Angelina Jolie pose?  Not wanting to be a sex slave = anti-male? You’re saying wanting sex slaves is a normal guy thing, and *I’m* the one who hates men? No, saying things like: “Shorter Fury Road: Women are not going to be your sexbots in the afterscape, assholes. I fear this is going to upset some fans of the genre. They deserve upsetting” is anti-male. It is assuming the fanbase of such a film are sexist pigs, which is an assumption that in itself is sexist.  The film IS chock full of CGI. The trailer is made up almost entirely of CGI enhanced shots. But you haven’t the first idea of what CGI is or isn’t, which is why you’re so willing to follow the press packet. She’s not speaking out against men, or against Mad Max fans. She’s speaking out against sexist pigs. Even a quick glance at this discussion thread, and the linked articles, shows there are way too many of those in the world. You really don’t get it, do you? But keep parroting those Social Justice Warrior talking points, I’m sure you feel you are making a difference. Would you just say what you mean and let your argument stand or fall on its own merits? What do you think of the movie? No, you’re assuming that MaryAnn’s statement that *some* fans who are sexist pigs equals all fans of the action genre. Which is clearly not the case, or she would not have used the word some, as indeed LaSargenta pointed out up the thread. In fact, even if all fans of the action genre *were* sexist pigs, that still wouldn’t make her statement anti-male, as there are plenty of males who are not fans of action movies. with regards to the CGI, the only blatant CGI elements are the massive sandstorm the first half of the movie delves into, and the use of 3D at-ya shots of projectiles coming out of the screen.  The use of CGI to make Charlize one-armed was actually very subtle.  Everything else – the cars smashing into each other, fire effects, flying bodies – was done with practical stunt work.  Compared to the Star Wars prequels, Fury Road is old-school. When I went to see this movie tonight, most of the attendees were guys like me.  NONE OF US quailed or turned away from the sight of women being awesome in the face of male oppression. Misogynists might be the first people to dismiss complaints about representation with time-honored comments like “she’s ‘just’ a character” or “it’s ‘just’ a movie/book/video game,” but by admitting they’re threatened by Charlize Theron and Emilia Clarke’s bad-assery, Clarey and his commenters are also agreeing that the media we consume and the stories we tell are hugely important.
 I love how people endlessly project and strawman, rather than honestly investigating the facts. It’s quite possible, you know, that rather than being intimidated, many modern men are simply tired of the intellectual straitjacket that requires all modern female protagonists to be only a certain kind of “badass” and “strong”. Those who are even more intelligent and perceptive will realize this is as restrictive as previous restrictive gender roles. In fact, if said intelligent and perceptive people were also well-educated, they might know how and why this modern mental thought-slavery originated and spread across the US. Are you saying there hasn’t been a general trend to typecast women in roles that require them to be “no-nonsense, sassy, independent gals who are self-actualized, quick with the one-liners, and don’t-need-no-man? That trope has even started becoming predominant in animated films as well, see Frozen for example.  In fact I’m having trouble thinking of the last time I saw a nice, tender, Romance with more traditional gender roles. It’s been quite a while. It’s not antisemitic if it happens to be true. After universal suffrage (a *good* thing), feminism, under the influence of Jewish feminists, morphed into an attempt to undermine and destroy the Christian nuclear family. Don’t take my word for it: “The white race is the cancer of human history” – Susan Sontag.  Feminism, in regards to women and men having equal rights, is great. Feminism that turns women against men is not. The inability to distinguish between these two stances persists to this day. oh, i see what happened here.  okay, people, we have to be nice to G-Man.  it is obvious that he has been in a 60 year coma and is just waking up to the strange new world of the 21st century…. he can’t get his 50s head around the new world order. First off, it’s not a debate, chuckles. You’re worse than full of shit, you’re full of someone else’s shit (I’m not even going to contemplate how it got there), so any kind of argument would involve us talking to ourselves while you type out whatever your cue next card says.  Second, ad hominem is if I say “You’re an asshole, therefore you’re wrong.” I’m saying, “You’re wrong, and you’re an asshole.” It’s a subtle distinction, I know, but you’ll get it. Dudebro, check the numbers on the back of your cards. You’ve got them all out of order. This one doesn’t come till way later, right before the comically un-ironic accusation of Nazism. If your powers of sarcasm and condescension were, you know, matched by any actual content, it might be breathtaking. Unfortunately, you’re just being a windbag with no substance whatsoever. Have you watched a romantic comedy in the last, I dunno, 20 years? They’re almost all about reinforcing traditional gender roles, showing that all women really want is a man to marry.  Anyway, if you are really tired of movies presenting less “traditional” gender relationships, there’s an abundance of old films on DVD, Blu-Ray, Netflix, etc. that should satisfy you. “Nice” and “tender”? Yep. That’s a woman’s job to soothe men. Wait, no it’s not.
Your post has an Old Time Religion feel that’s really gross to me. I’m surprised you post online. Since you like tradition and all. If your woman folk does the same, do you call them harlots?
Sassy and intelligent females characters bum you out? WTF? Are you Amish? Oh please spare us. You tried to bandy about “social justice warrior” as a pejorative. I doubt you’ve had an original thought this century. You certainly haven’t expressed one since arriving here. Oh, look, another one who think this is a debate. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, they’re so cute when they’re little. Now run along and play outside, junior, the grownup are talking. What lies!  Why just the other day Camille Paglia burst out of my closet and assaulted me with a lecture on the indoctrination of the patriarchy! After checking times and theaters, I need to know if this is something that is worth seeing in 3D. Was it shot in it? Did Miller make excellent use of it? Or is regular projection good? I didn’t see it in 3D, but almost no films are worth the 3D premium. I doubt this one breaks that rule (it was NOT shot in 3D, for one). It looks amazing in 2D, so go for 2D. Well, we saw How to Train Your Dragon in 3D in the theater at the bargain matinee ($11.50 ea instead of $6.75 each). As that was slightly less than the normal 2D ticket and the animation was great and worked well in 3D, we thought that was worth it. We saw it again in 2D on DVD and even allowing for the smaller screen, we could tell when we would have been saying “OoooHHHHooo” in the theater.  HTTYD is the closest anything I’ve seen come to being worth it in 3D. But’ y’know what, I’ve seen it a dozen times since then in 2D, and it never lost anything except the headache. Avatar was certainly the only one I recall being worth it, because Cameron clearly spent the time and mental energy necessary to compose it for that medium. Unfortunately, it has so little else going for it that it’s hardly worth it to watch in any other form but massive-screen 3D. I can think of a whole list of films that were improved by 3D. Pina, for example, is an entirely different film in three dimensions. Hugo also used the technology really well (but the book is still better). I LOVE animated CG cartoons in 3d, because every pixel has the depth info baked in. Aside from Avatar, I can’t remember any live action scenes were 3d adds to the experience.  Dredd 3D and Life of Pi are also fantastic in 3D. I have never experienced the headaches that others have described so I love these movies on 3D Bly Ray at home. Pixar has done really well also. Sorry, a PS to my previous post. Herzog’s Cave of Forgotten Dreams was completely worth the cost of the 3D. In fact, I paid for me and my son twice, the second time paying for Loverman to come as well. Thanks for your very cool and popular opinion! I bet you love film over digital as well. And anything other than color and sound is purely a gimmick. *shrug* You’re welcome to like anything you like. I stand by my statement: I’ve never had a movie experience enhanced by watching it through a ViewMaster. Most 3D is still post-process, where everything appears to be projected on it’s own 2D plane – the so-called “cardboard cut-out effect”. Audiences uncritically paying the 3d premium is what has wrought that, and it will continue as long as the cost to revenue ratio favors studios.  The two-camera process (what some call “3D done right”) isn’t that much better. It can only 3D-ify what the cameras can see. And what I end up seeing, at best, is objects kind of poking out of their 2D planes a little bit. CGI animation does slightly better, since the rendering process can place every pair of pixels into a precise location on the screen. But the effect there is like taking a sphere, slicing it in half, and placing the flat side on the screen. It’s not convincingly three dimensional. The headache issue is a personal one, but it’s not an uncommon one. It’s cause by the 3D process trying to trick the eyes into focusing on depths that aren’t actually there. It’s inherent to the illusion, and not something fixed by multiple cameras. And then there’s the issue of presentation. Both the IMAX LCD shutter system and the Dolby chromatic shifting system are very expensive for the theaters, compared the the Real3D polarized system. So most theaters go with Real3D. But polarized systems cut the light that gets to the eyes, reducing the brightness of the presentation, and worsening the muddiness that most 3D movies already suffer from. The shift to digital projection means we’re finally seeing movies at full brightness again (though now I occasionally run into frame rate issues FML.) tl:dr version – it’s not a hipster affectation, it’s that 3D process can only do so much, introduces other problems, and doesn’t enhance anything anyway. I thought Hugo was worth seeing in 3D, particularly since the story was largely about the magic of film as a new experience; just as
the first audiences were wowed (and maybe even ducked) when the train
rushed right toward the camera, so Hugo’s actual audience is (hopefully)
wowed by the new(er) magic of 3D. I thought it was employed well. I would really like to see it in IMAX (which is also in 3D, at least here in London). If I do, I’ll report on it. Saw it last night, there one single shot that I remember being in 3D, and it was a cheesy 3D cliche that “worked” as the climax. Yep. It’s one of the lazier cliches in 3d movies to just throw stuff at the audience, so I doubt they’re missing anything in 2d. Man, I want to see this! But my wife has no interest, and my son, at 14, is a tad too young. I have no friends to go with, and can’t stand seeing movies alone. I guess I’ll have to wait 4 months to watch it at home. Damn. I think you should find a way to see it on a big screen. I took my 13 y.o. and he was ok. But, everyone’s different.  MaryAnn, I appreciate your reviews even when I don’t agree with them (and in this case, I do agree, what a wonderful film!).  I’m sorry to know you need to spend time dealing with that kind of crap in your comment section.  You have a great space here, otherwise. Serious question: If I expect Gravity (I know they’re different, shhh) will I be disappointed. To clarify, Gravity was heart-stopping, emotional and, the last 10 minutes was the most intense moment I’ve had at the movies in recent memory — will I get this thrill out of Mad Max? This isn’t a “thrilling” or “exciting” kind of movie; it’s a steady, relentless build of intensity that you can’t tear your eyes from. It tells its story through it imagery better than anything I’ve seen in a while. I don’t think it will be transformative, because it’s not a formula easily aped (like “Die Hard on a …”) nor does it introduce a specific visual trick (like Bullet Time). This feels like George Miller was using new toys to go back to his roots, and in doing he found something amazing. When an author returns to a book series that was over and done with thirty years ago, it’s pretty much never a good sign. Usually it means they’ve run out of ideas. The difference, I think, is a technological one. The technology of writing doesn’t necessarily affect the craft of writing. Whereas the technology of filmmaking is intrinsic to the craft. I’ve been watching clips from “The Road Warrior”, which I think is the “Mad Max” film Miller is basically remaking in “Fury Road”.
What I think Miller has done here, is applied modern filmmaking technology to the ideas he was trying to commit to film 33 years ago. “Fury Road” is one of the best examples I’ve seen of a film satisfying my two criteria for re-making a movie*: 1) is the original version not a great film itself, but one that suffered in the execution; and 2) does the remake have something new and/or interesting to say with the material.  Most remakes fail the first criterion, getting greenlit because it was a great film, and so has a built in audience. “The Road Warrior”, I think, is marred by technical problems and limitations. It’s color palate is just drab. It’s settings are post-apocalyptic only if you squint. Hell, Miller famously couldn’t even get the Dolby sound mix to work. “Beyond Thunderdome” was Miller’s first attempt to address these problems, but that film is frankly a bit of a mess. “Fury Road” is a technical tour de force. Regarding the second, most try to do this, but most stumble badly. This, I think, comes from a failure with the first criterion: They’re remaking a great film, which already worked. There’s not much more to say there.** Miller, on the other hand, found something (and not just in making the film look and sound they way he wanted). He explores how not only will things like water and fuel become scarce after the fall of civilization, but so too will people become a rare and valuable resource. That makes a lot of sense. It’s often seemed to me that people talked about the memory of The Road Warrior more than they talked about the film itself. Mad Max and The Road Warrior both were movies I saw because I was fascinated by post-apocalyptic and dystopian stories. (So much so that my mother pressed on me the only science fiction she had ever read: A Canticle for Leibowitz.) The movies as artifacts were frankly crap, although they both stayed vivid because I could see someone had a vision. (MM was riddled with continuity problems, for starters.) Seeing this, like I wrote yesterday, was like getting to see what Miller was seeing in his head 40 years ago. I so agree with your assessment of the first three films–in rewatching them, there are many weaknesses, but the vision remains true throughout and is what one remembers after seeing the films, even sticking in your head thirty years later.
(And, I have to add–A Canticle for Leibowitz is sooo freakin’ good!! Love that book.) Well that settles it.  When MaryAnn Johanson and RedLetterMedia both agree that a movie is really good, and a refreshing example of what Hollywood has forgotten about making great action movies, then that tells me it’s a movie worth seeing. But geeze, even if the way it looks on screen is the same as the trailer and unappealing to me, I’d still watch it for great, practical action done in service to a story. The Seven Samurai homage to Seiji Miyaguchi’s badassery was a nice nod of respect to the grandfather of gritty action movies too.  My dad hates all the other Mad Max movies, and even he had a good time. Dear god, this was a magnificent film. Somehow I’ve missed all the previous Mad Max movies, but this one blew me away. Miller’s vision feels extravagant yet stripped down, unhinged yet disciplined, all at the same time. I can’t think of a single thing wrong with it. (And that awesome music!) I have to admit, the idea of driving a big rig with a guitarist strapped to its hood and blasting rock riffs is mightily appealing to me. And anyone who can’t stand the fact that this film belongs to Furiosa (without taking anything away from Max or Nicholas Hoult’s War Boy) deserves nothing but laughter and pity. You know, he really had drummers playing the Taiko on the back of that rig. I read in one article how they had to deal with constant sand in their faces keeping the beat. Right. I suppose it is a stupid thing to chase, but I’ve been puzzling over which bits are not CGI. Plenty are obvious. This one, not so much. It’s amazing to see just how REAL a lot of the action is (those motorcycle stunts!). And I suppose it’s logical that they would film a lot of the on-vehicle fights on vehicles that weren’t actually moving, so I find it really impressive that it all looks like it’s happening at 100 mph. I noticed the same thing (about the shots with Tom Hardy on the back of the “moving” War Rig). One of those little-heralded boons of CGI: the ability to do the stunt work with all the safety gear and precautions in place. Yes, that is probably the camera rig that created most of the shots I was noticing. There still is the distance wide shots of the rig with pursuit and vehicles coming from lower right of screen with the ridge between that either is from and airplane or a model. No? If would have had to be a really tall cliff otherwise. I hope the B&W version on the Blu-Ray is better than this. The contrast is way to muddy. You can’t just turn the color setting all the way down on full color video and expect it to look good. Damn! Did I post the wrong trailer? I saw a beautiful trailer embedded in an article, lost track of it, went to YouTube and found this, but (oops) didn’t watch before posting.  * This movie owes a lot to the John Ford Westerns in terms of the use of vast landscapes as battlefields, and of well-staged chase scenes. * The movie doesn’t really relegate Max to the role of sidekick: it merely disregards the need to tell more of his story because we’ve already seen most of it in the first three films.  As a result, it appears as though Furiosa dominates the story: in truth she is merely presenting herself as Heroine of her own story, overlapped with Max’s own quest for sanity and redemption in the desert.  It’s really a Dual Protagonist movie. * The scene where Furiosa uses Max to steady the sniper rifle has multiple layers to it, but above all it’s the moment where Max utterly trusts her – and she him – to get the job done.  There’s an even more subtle moment early on when Furiosa decides to tell Max the sequence for the rig’s control panel.  Max has had a gun on her and the wives up until then: the second she entrusts him with the secret, he wordlessly clicks the hammer of the gun into rest mode (essentially putting the gun on safety).  It happens so quietly and understated I think people may have missed the meaning of it. It really isn’t. His actions do not set the plot in motion, nor do they drive the plot. He is a bystander to Furiosa’s story who gets caught up in it. By the time he does anything that impacts the action in a significant way — when he makes a suggestion to Furiosa that makes her change her mind about what she’s doing — it’s far into Furiosa’s story, and her accepting his suggestion doesn’t change that. Think of it this way: Could someone else have made that suggestion and not have that alteration make any real difference? Absolutely. Any of the other characters could have made that suggestion. But only Furiosa could have done the things she has done. It’s okay that Max isn’t a protagonist. He’s still an interesting character, and he still gets a bit of growth and change. This is the sort of thing women have to cling to, typically, when we watch movies like this: We console ourselves by saying, Yeah, it’s all about the guy, but at least the sidekick woman got to do a little bit of something interesting, at least she had a little bit of a personal journey. Personally, I see the Mad Max character as always stumbling into others’ stories. He becomes the vehicle for their tales. His own tale was to me only a part of the first movie. Goose had a story there and Nightrider, too. One of the other websites suggested Ballpeen Headhunter.  I like that, too, because it reminds me of a Jane Yolen quote. When religious people called her names, she said: If I’m going to be a tool of Satan, I want to be a ballpeen hammer. Someone very wise on the Internet suggested that *all* the Max movies are urban legends about the encounters that people in this afterscape have had with him. I like that. I’ve been trying to remember the last time I have seen a movie this many times in the theater at its first release (which eliminates Citizen Kane…which I’ve seen loads of times). I seriously think it was Cousin, Cousine back in freakin’ 1976. The Clay Theater was close to home on Fillmore Street and I saw it many times there.  Charlize Theron is SUBLIME in this role. What a range! It’s a shame that she doesn’t get too many meaty roles like this one, and is wasted on MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST and the like. I’ve seen this film three times already. (Have you gone for your fourth, LaSargenta?) I don’t remember the last time I saw a film three times. I might go for a fourth just to get the taste of Jurassic World’s sexism out of my mouth. There are several sentences in that review that, by themselves, justify the existence of the movie. I have longtime friends I’m less passionate about than those reviewers are about Fury Road. I wish Hurley had mentioned one detail: The people almost literally turn themselves into objects, by adding machine parts and silver paint to their bodies so they look like motor vehicles. Furiosa, Max, Nux, and their allies eventually reverse the process. Nux’s truck blows up, very dramatically, and—if I remember correctly—Furiosa even loses her robotic arm. Furiosa’s arm is different from the Warboys spraying themselves chrome, though. (Unless we want to believe that she deliberately chopped off her arm so that she could use a prostheses, and there’s no support for that.) The soldiers spraying themselves is part and parcel of how they are used by Immortan Joe, part of the religion that makes them pliable and willing to die for him. LoveloveLOVE how this was done, and especially how Furiosa is depicted. It’s astonishing how much fan creativity this film has inspired. It feels like a movie a lot of people really, really needed to see. Yes, the response to this movie *clearly* demonstrates that audiences are hungry for stories that are actually *about* women, and that deal with bullshit that women are tired of *as* bullshit.",POSITIVE

"May 12, 2015"," The movie of the summer thunders in on 22 armor-spiked wheels, because an 18-wheeler just wouldn’t do on “Fury Road.”
Grim, gruesome and glorious, Mad Max: Fury Road” should send every post-apocalyptic sci-fi hack back to the word processor and every other would-be car picture producer in search of testosterone supplements.
George Miller revisits his most famous franchise in a breathless blast of prophecy that may lack the grace notes and serio-comic humanity of “The Road Warrior.” But his warnings of a social collapse into Jungian archetypes brought on by oil, greed and the Bomb sneaks in during two hours of almost constant battle, torture and chase.
Tom Hardy is Mad Max here, his past sketched in through flashbacks of those he could not save. Now he wanders the wastelands, fending off marauding tribes who covet water, fuel, firearms and food.
Only this Road Warrior is quickly captured, a human “blood bank” for a society whose elite literally transfuse their mutated selves back to life with blood and mass-pumped mother’s milk. It’s a grisly parable of the oligarchs of today, dwarves and skinheads and goiter-ridden freaks preserving themselves and their bloodline at all costs.
The Citadel is ruled by Immortan Joe, who needs oxygen just to carry on his mass breeding experiment in creating healthy offspring even as he enslaves the waterless masses below his mountain fortress.
Charlize Theron is Furiosa, the one-armed War Machine driver who goes rogue, taking Joe’s harem of supermodels (Zoe Kravitz and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley among them) with her. They are fleeing in a gigantic tanker truck to “The Green Place.”
Max is lashed to the hood of one of a fleet of ancient re-purposed Caddys, Corvettes, Barracudas and Mercs, the desert warcraft that Joe leads after the women.
That’s one clever switch that Miller makes in this updating, 34 years after “The Road Warrior.” Women are enslaved for the future they hold, but the toughest of them — Furiosa — is their last, best hope.
“Out here, everything hurts,” she growls. She gets the Road Warrior/Terminator tough-guy lines. You want to live? Stick with me.
The dialogue is as apocalyptic as the desert settings. “I am the SCALES of justice,” one venomous villain bellows, “CONDUCTOR of the chorus of death!”
Hardy is more a physical presence than a soulful one. His Max is haunted, like Furiosa, in search of “redemption.” He is a simple man of action, visceral, blood-spattered action. But the film’s feminist underpinnings render him more a catalyst than savior.
Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is the true believer disciple of Immortan Joe, spray-painting his grin with chromium paint, a religious fanatic ready to go out in glory and secure his place in Valhalla.
 It’s exhausting and exhilarating, with only a couple of emotional deaths amidst the mayhem and gore. There’s a whole Cirque du Soleil slaughter to some sequences, with real stunts and real vehicles doing real crashes for the most part. It’s a moving, visual experience, where dialogue is often in an indecipherable Aussie/Future/pidgin patois and not necessary to understand what is happening, and what will happen. But from its first frame to its last, “Fury Road” lets Miller — whose “Babe” and “Happy Feet” were just as prophetic — puts the Mad back into Max and the madness back into our headlong rush to doom.

"May 12, 2015"," You remember “Happy Feet.” This is George Miller’s “Happy Wheels.” The creator of the original “Mad Max” trilogy has whipped up a gargantuan grunge symphony of vehicular mayhem that makes “Furious 7” look like “Curious George.” The full title of Miller’s remake of “Mad Max” is “Mad Max: Fury Road.” It stars Tom Hardy, who says very little, in the old Mel Gibson role of the post-apocalyptic road warrior. Here the character’s bacon is saved, over and over, by the revolutionary in training known as Imperator Furiosa. Charlize Theron plays her, and “badass” doesn’t really capture it. Theron out-Hardys Hardy in the nonverbal seething department, and she’s right at home in the scorched-earth landscapes shot in Australia and the South African Namib Desert. We’ll get into a few details about the set-up, but honestly, this one’s about the music, not the lyrics. The story’s thin, thinner than it seemed in the earlier pictures, but crucially director and co-writer Miller delivers several variations on a signature shot. It’s one he didn’t invent but that he relishes more than life or fossil fuel itself: the low, asphalt-scraping car’s-eye-view perspective as the vehicle barrels down the road, with a faster vehicle (or three) coming up fast on the left and then zooming past, en route to someone’s last ride. This is a maniacal chase picture, as if you couldn’t tell from the trailers, many times more expensive to make than Miller’s first two “Max”‘s back in the late-20th century. The new film carries a full but not suffocating load of digital effects that actually look like Miller oversaw their creation, rather than simply turning them over to people he’d only met on the phone. And the real star of “Fury Road” is second unit director Guy Norris. Here, too, the collaboration with Miller appears seamless. Wars over the remaining water and oil have turned humankind into a desperate bunch. Max roams the Wasteland. High above a rock formation sits the Citadel, where the brutish overlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules a society built on slave labor, the occasional water ration and a tremendous amount of cruelty. Max, captured by Immortan Joe’s chalky minions, is drained of his healthy blood, which is greedily consumed by the boy-man they call Nux (Nicolas Hoult). Nux becomes a kind of mascot and insane-but-redeemable nephew figure to Max and Furiosa. They flee the Citadel with Mr. Big’s five comely wives, who represent Mother Earth though they appear also to be representing job opportunities for a post-apocalyptic Maxim shoot. The bad men pursue in many loud, street-illegal chariots. And there you have it. More plot than the movie actually contains. Miller’s dynamism behind the camera is well-known, and it’s fun to see it unleashed. The director expands his “Mad Max” mythology into the biggest, most relentless movie he’s ever made, which doesn’t mean his best. It is, to be sure, one of his most idiosyncratic. Certain images, such as the heavy-metal guitarist, whose guitar spews fire, chained to the front of a particularly evil weapon on wheels, become leitmotifs you simply wouldn’t find in any other movie. Also, it’s unlikely that many directors would take the time to set up and dramatically justify the image of a tanker truck full of breast milk getting shot to hell. There are patches of “Fury Road” when the flourishes get to be a little much. The action veers into exhausting cleverness. The riskiest move is Miller’s decision to speed up the frame-rate of the action, so that everything seems jumpy, out of control, both less and more than “real.” Some will go for it; some will not. And I say good for Miller for making a big-budget movie that doesn’t feel like the studio was breathing down Max’s neck every second.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," Tom Hardy succeeds Mel Gibson in the title role of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” George Miller’s first Road Warrior movie in three decades — but this spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Theron collected her third Oscar nomination (she won Best Actress for “Monster”) for her dazzling work as Imperator Furiosa, a smart, fearsome, one-armed rogue soldier bent on smuggling five women to freedom inside a gasoline truck with Max’s initially reluctant help. The dialogue is sparing, it works as a stand-alone story (you don’t need to catch up on the three Gibson films) and isn’t busy setting up a sequel. In short, it’s a blessed deliverance from the tiresome universe-building, sanitized violence and rampant sexism of, say, the bloated Marvel epics. As the trailers accurately promise, “Fury Road” doesn’t look like any film you’ve ever seen — though the story is roughly like a 21st-century feminist take on John Ford’s classic “Stagecoach,” set in a post-apocalyptic world as it might be grotesquely imagined by the 15th-century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. The women — some of them pregnant — are fleeing Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who brutally rules a desert city called the Citadel and had imprisoned his five “wives” so he could force one of them to bear him a male heir. Joe leads a convoy of tricked-out vehicles with gonzo warriors to recover his “property” — with Max spending much of the first half-hour in an iron mask, serving literally as a human hood ornament (and blood donor) for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), arguably the nuttiest member of Joe’s army. Max eventually joins forces with Furiosa and provides some key advice, but with Theron’s steely gaze, stoic determination and action chops, she’s very much the one calling the shots for this badly outnumbered band. The escaped “breeders’’ (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz and others) take up arms against the enemy, along with some rather surprising allies they pick up along the way. Director Miller may be 70 and returning to the series after a couple of decades making family films (like “Babe” and “Happy Feet”), but he blows away younger action directors with brilliantly staged and edited sequences in what amounts to a two-hour chase. The violence is often graphic, but it’s never gratuitous. The director, a former emergency room doctor, makes every last drop of blood count. The violence feels real and consequential, a rarity in today’s heavy computer-massaged films. Filming in the Namib desert, Miller has crafted a visual masterpiece, combining dust, fireballs, mud, blood, gasoline and mother’s milk in vividly imaginative ways that are hugely satisfying and never look fake. But it’s Theron’s determined wounded warrior — much more than Hardy’s haunted, revenge-seeking road warrior — that ultimately makes this the summer’s first must-see movie. “Fury Road” is also available in a 3-D version, which I haven’t seen. What looks very much like the finest action film so far this century hardly needs further embellishment.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," The title character and his postapocalyptic land was introduced in the Australian thriller “Mad Max” (1979), immortalized in the 1981 classic “The Road Warrior” and last seen in the underappreciated “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” (1985). Back then, the gonzo, motorized mayhem was revolutionary. Now its destructo cinema races back to save us from the multiplex doldrums. What helps make it whirr and roar is a minimal use of CGI. Director George Miller has kept an element that made “Warrior” and “Thunderdome” special: super-real smashes and crashes. The movie is set after the world has torn itself apart, and blown parts of itself up, following something called “The Oil Wars.” What’s left of scraggly civilization worships and covets gasoline. Their “blood is poisoned,” and two-headed lizards sit in the sand. In a mountainside fortress called the Citadel, a cruel leader in a skull-like breath-mask named Immortan Joe sends skeletal punk-thugs called War Boys to do his enforcing. It’s here that the grizzled wanderer Max (Tom Hardy) is brought after being captured as a kind-of human sacrifice. But the attention of the Citadel turns to a convoy led by Joe’s lieutenant, Furiosa (Charlize Theron). She’s raced away with all five of Joe’s slave-wives, one of whom is pregnant. Joe wants them back, so Max is strapped to a battle-truck driven by the War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), and the film goes from 0 to 100 in minutes flat. The dialogue is speckled with a futuristic Pidgin English that’s part of the fun: Among the rag-wearing wives is “The Splendid Angharad” (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and “Toast the Knowing” (Zoe Kravitz). Two of the villains driving steroid-jacked cars are called Rictus Erectus and Corpus Colossus. A band of old-woman warriors is the Vulvalini. Speaking of woman warriors; Theron’s stump-armed, raccoon-eyed, ferocious Furiosa is one for the ages. With a metallic appendage and a knife in her side, Furiosa commands attention, whether driving like the Devil, pausing for reflection or howling in rage. Hardy — taking over from the previous films’ star, Mel Gibson — is compellingly odd. Muttering to himself and able to take an arrow or a bullet, he’s a brute with kind eyes and a twitchy distraction that comes from his damaged psyche. These movies play with their end-of-the-world timeline, but in quick flashbacks we get glimpses of the family Max couldn’t save from mankind’s fate. Those glimpses are fast, like everything. Some action scenes are sped-up to have a herky-jerky effect, and the fantastic score, filled with war drums and pulse-pounding rhythm, adds to the propulsive momentum. Exactly 30 years since the last “Mad Max” entry, Miller, who made the previous ones, fuel-injects the whole shebang. There are wild scenes filled with gutsy, edgy stuff. It’s frankly stunning that a major studio like Warner Bros. would sign off on some of the audacity here, but the movie is stronger for it. Yet it’s not just the action that benefits. The story’s theme of undaunted hope in the midst of appalling inhumanity makes it the rare summer event flick that has its brain stuck right next to its gas pedal.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," Resulta evidente que el director George Miller trabajó en esta película por casi tres décadas, ya que Mad Max Furia en el camino se acopla perfectamente a su universo post-apocalítpico creado en 1979. Esto se debe a que el australiano respetó completamente la esencia de su franquicia, con una estética visual que ofrece continuidad, una edición arriesgada, una brillante selección musical incorporada al filme de manera magistral y la atinada elección de efectos visuales prácticos en una era dominada por el CGI.  Eso sí, debemos admitir que Furia en el camino no narra la historia más original, al centrarse en una nueva y accidentada misión de rescate a cargo de Mad Max. Sin embargo el realizador supera este obstáculo con personajes bien construidos y que reflejan perfectamente las diferentes caras de un mundo dominado por violencia, la desesperanza y la locura. Gran parte de este mérito también corresponde al trabajo histriónico de todo el elenco, destacando la labor de los protagonistas Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron y la muy agradable sorpresa de Nicholas Hoult. El primero de ellos continúa acertadamente el legado iniciado por Mel Gibson, con una actuación sobria que hace justicia al guerrero de la carretera. Aunque este punto será motivo de debate para los puristas, nos queda claro que Tom Hardy tiene todo lo necesario para consolidarse como el Mad Max de una nueva generación. La situación es un poco más sencilla para Charlize Theron, quien da vida a una valerosa mujer dispuesta a darlo –literalmente– todo para enmendar sus errores del pasado.  Por su parte Nicholas Hoult realiza un trabajo brillante como Nux, personaje cuya demencia inicial lo muestra irreconocible durante los primeros minutos, para luego hacer gala de su talento en una transformación extrema. Al final, las buenas actuaciones de la tercia son determinantes para lograr la comunión con el público, al conceder algo de humanidad a un universo que de otro modo sería completamente dominado por el salvajismo. El personaje se ve acompañado por su sádico ejército de Warboys, cuya amplia variedad de técnicas en la guerra automovilística provocará numerosos dolores de cabeza a nuestro héroe y grandes emociones entre el público, ya que la originalidad de cada combate es fundamental para que la cinta mantenga un buen ritmo en todo momento. Finalmente sólo nos queda aclarar que Furia en el camino complacerá a todos aquellos que quieran disfrutar una buena película de acción, aún cuando no hayan visto las entregas anteriores de alguna película de Mad Max. Eso sí, aquellos familiarizados con la franquicia disfrutarán mucho más del proyecto, ya que George Miller parece olvidar que han pasado 30 años desde su última entrega y olvida recordarnos cómo fue que el mundo terminó en tan lamentable situación. Entonces, ¿valió la pena la espera? ¡Definitivamente sí! Y aunque Furia en el camino incluye absolutamente todo lo que esperamos de una película de Mad Max, ojalá no tengamos que esperar otros 30 años para disfrutar de una nueva aventura del guerrero de la carretera.

"May 12, 2015",An action film without other pretension than to amuse the viewer with spectacular persecutions. [full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," Mad Max: Furia en el camino (Mad Max: Fury Road, 2015) es, dentro del género de acción, una película notable que logra configurar una atmósfera mítica dentro de un escenario postapocalíptico mediante un relato que funciona como metáfora del mundo contemporáneo.  George Miller crea una historia sencilla para articular problemas actuales.  Max (Tom Hardy) es un hombre solitario y raptado, desde muy temprano en el filme, por las salvajes tropas del imponente y feroz Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), cuyo rostro es cubierto por una grotesca máscara de enormes dientes y alimentado por tubos de oxígeno. Él es el máximo gobernante de La Ciudadela, uno de los pocos lugares que, mediante elevadas construcciones, la división de clases –incluyendo la presencia de esclavos cubiertos de polvo blanco–, la guerra y las negociaciones con tribus aledañas, busca erigirse como la nueva civilización dominante. Ahí habita Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), una rebelde y revolucionaria mujer, pero aún compasiva, que planea escapar de aquella viciosa comunidad que trata a las mujeres como productoras de leche y son utilizadas como dispositivo natural para engendrar más guerreros e incrementar las filas del ejército anárquico –aunque hay jerarquías, durante las batallas y misiones no se respeta ningún orden ni estrategia–. A bordo del imponente “War Rig” –un tráiler de doble semirremolque construido con residuos metálicos y otros materiales de desecho–, Furiosa escapa robándose una preciosa y valiosa carga: las cinco esposas del emperador (interpretadas por Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Courtney Eaton, Zoe Kravitz y Riley Keough). Así comienza una persecución destructiva, en la que Max es empleado como “bolsa de sangre”: mediante una manguera, el líquido vital de Max alimenta a un guerrero temerario llamado Nux (Nicholas Hoult), dispuesto a morir en la misión por recuperar a las esposas de su amo. Sin ser una secuela o un reboot, el guión, escrito por Miller, Brendan McCarthy y Nick Lathouris, posee cierta influencia de Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), principalmente, en las similitudes que comparten en sus respectivos prólogos: aquel filme protagonizado por Mel Gibson inicia con imágenes en blanco y negro de las grandes ciudades industriales, las naciones en guerra, los bombardeos y el uso de armas nucleares, mientras la voz en off del narrador nos indica cómo el ser humano acabó con su semejante; ahora, esta nueva entrega comienza con la pantalla en negro, y se escuchan diversas voces en off –al parecer procedentes de noticieros– que informan sobre la crisis que vive la humanidad al depender del petróleo para realizar cualquier actividad. El filme no profundiza en el cómo se ha llegado a ese mundo catastrófico. Miller evita alusiones explícitas a situaciones contemporáneas (crisis económicas, problemas ambientales, conflictos en diversos puntos del globo terráqueo, guerras en nombre de ideologías, terrorismo). Pesimismo y destrucción son las constantes del polvoriento y turbio escenario sobre el que se desarrollan las acciones. El experimentado cinefotógrafo australiano, John Seale (ganador del Oscar por su trabajo en The English Patient, 1996), captura con maestría los intensos colores ocres y rojizos otorgados por los paisajes naturales del desierto de Namibia, ubicado al sur de África, aprovechando al máximo la luz solar como fuente de iluminación natural que cuece todo el territorio en naranjas y amarillos, mientras que, durante la noche, las estrellas y la luna poseen cierta intensidad capaz de configurar un atrayente azul etéreo.  Mediante la crisis de Max, un hombre torturado, un sobreviviente, cuyo dilema se centra en permitir que la humanidad lo abrace nuevamente o rechazar a sus semejantes debido al tormento que siente cada vez que está cerca de uno de ellos, el director crea una ficción sobre la decadencia de la civilización. Max es reservado y desconfiado; es un hombre que derrocha lo mismo agresividad y melancolía mediante sus bruscos movimientos. Su violencia, al igual que su bondad, se transmiten con el uso del cuerpo más que con la pronunciación de palabras. Max vive trastornado por su pasado –hay una constante presencia de una niña que aparece en las alucinaciones, sueños y recuerdos del protagonista, pero nunca se explica quién es y cuál es la relación que tiene con él. Su dolor mental y psicológico se refleja en su cuerpo maltratado; su rostro se hunde en la arena, su cabeza es encerrada en una máscara metálica con candado de seguridad, sus brazos son encadenados y sufre laceraciones en pecho y espalda. El actor británico, Tom Hardy, vuelve a demostrar, como lo hizo en Bronson (2008), Warrior (2011) y Dark Knight Rises (2012),  la fortaleza de su cuerpo y el gran despliegue físico para interpretar con un alto grado de vigor, resistencia y verosimilitud, cada una de sus maniobras corporales. Hardy no teme parecerse por dentro y por fuera, en lo físico y en lo psicológico, al imperturbable y belicoso Max. A diferencia de Mel Gibson, Hardy toma al personaje en plena crisis existencial, es un hombre ya maltratado y abatido. Al actor australiano lo acompañamos, a lo largo de tres filmes en un periodo de seis años, en la compleja transformación psicológica que sufrió Max al perder a su esposa e hija en Mad Max (1979), y en su paso de hombre de familia y policía a ser un nómada solitario en los dos filmes posteriores (Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, 1982;  Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome , 1985). Furia en el camino retoma, con una estética grotesca y por momentos alucinante, elementos del western. Gran parte del filme se desarrolla en extensas zonas áridas. Trata sobre el exilio de un hombre, la búsqueda de un nuevo estado, el anhelo de integrar un nuevo orden para, después de cumplir con esa misión –la refundación de la civilización– seguir adelante solo. Miller crea una metáfora irónica sobre nuestra propia caída como raza, como civilización, sobre cómo las crisis y los aspectos negativos de nuestro mundo nos pueden conducir, paulatinamente, al desorden e histeria global. ¿Será que, más bien, el filme parodia demoniacamente nuestra realidad? En el escenario postapocalíptico de Furia en el camino, los elementos más preciados, además del agua, son las armas y el combustible. Éstos son obtenidos mediante negociaciones y trueques; el comercio rige la dinámica de La Ciudadela con sus vecinos: la Granja de Balas y la Ciudad de Gasolina. En estos espacios hay muy poca preocupación por los valores espirituales; abundan las supersticiones, los conocimientos fracturados y la ignorancia. La guerra y la tecnología (o lo que queda de ella) condicionan a los habitantes. Immortan Joe apela a la instauración de rituales como formas malévolas de entretenimiento; los esclavos y los más pobres –leprosos y enfermos– le rinden pleitesía cuando el emperador, desde lo más alto de una montaña –como si fuera dueño del Monte Olimpo– rocía agua a sus súbditos para que éstos, en feroces y desesperantes batallas, hagan todo lo posible por reunir en sus inmundas y sucias cubetas el preciado líquido. Los líderes del mundo actual y real pueden hacer progresos graduales, pero en lugar de lograr los avances necesarios, se benefician con la caída y desgracia de los otros. El discurso desolador de Furia en el camino consiste en la nula esperanza, la pérdida de creer en los sueños y en el hecho de sólo aceptar los mitos de la desesperación instaurados por un ambiente hostil y un régimen cruel. Furia en el camino muestra el triunfo del mal a partir del miedo. La civilización decadente de Immortan Joe podría ser eliminada. El personaje de Furiosa sirve para transmitir la sensación del descontento de varios de los habitantes de La Ciudadela. Esta mujer representa la posibilidad del surgimiento de una nueva sociedad que se erija sobre las cenizas de la antigua. La intención de Furiosa es llegar, con las cinco jóvenes esposas, al Lugar Verde, un sitio del que no tiene certeza sobre su existencia, pero donde espera encontrar vegetación y agua, una especie de paraíso mítico. La película retrata un escenario en el que dos aspectos de nuestro presente (la destrucción y decadencia; la construcción y la esperanza) se han separado en dos lugares muy distantes entre sí, pero que en nuestra realidad conviven de la mano. Nuestro mundo –y su versión exagerada en lo negativo simbolizada en el filme– se define por las dinámicas del comercio y el mercado, que buscan colocar como valor máximo la ciega creencia en que el consumismo y las máquinas levantarán, junto a nosotros, un paraíso de la abundancia y la felicidad. El mito del progreso, encarnado en las dinámicas de La Ciudadela, es sólo una ilusión de la construcción de un mejor mañana, cuando en realidad representa la destrucción de los cimientos espirituales de la civilización y, paulatinamente, al menos así lo postula Miller, de la civilización misma. A pesar de ello, el filme es un grito existencial que ruega por el optimismo; es un triunfo feminista. Miller ha construido un comentario reflexivo. Furia en el camino es una crítica airada contra los patriarcados y la manera en que se trata inhumanamente a las mujeres. El filme denuncia aquellas sociedades dominadas por los hombres que, literalmente, las utilizan para reproducirse y las ordeñan como vacas. Las cinco jóvenes hermosas son retratadas no como dispositivos para generar tensión o acción, sino como seres humanos, personas individuales, con opiniones diversas, con la capacidad de llegar a acuerdos, cada una distinta de la otra, con puntos fuertes y débiles. Furiosa parece ser el rol ideal de acción que una talentosa actriz como Charlize Theron había estado buscando. El personaje le permite explorar el resentimiento, el deseo de venganza y la rabia, pero como sentimientos que, bien canalizados, desprenden poder, energía, coraje y acción. A pesar de la apariencia ruda, agresiva y cuasimasculina de Furiosa, ella es un personaje profundamente femenino y comprometido con la búsqueda del bienestar común a través del balance de contrarios, del respeto y la empatía. No sólo este filme, sino también los tres anteriores, se sostienen sobre la idea del movimiento; las capas y texturas de éste brindan información sobre quiénes son los personajes y qué es lo que buscan. La gasolina es la nueva “bebida de los dioses”; su escasez, al igual que la del agua –tremendo guiño a la crisis mundial de este recurso natural debido a su mal manejo y desperdicio– , significa la pérdida de poder y la muerte inminente. El filme ofrece una advertencia contra la codicia y la desesperación del hombre por poseer los recursos naturales más preciados. Miller sabe conjugar elementos anárquicos (metal, motores, sangre y arena) para orquestar la acción de alto octanaje con precisión y claridad. A pesar de ser una declaración a favor del movimiento y el dinamismo, Miller no exagera en el uso de la edición frenética; en varios momentos nos permite ver piezas de acción fluidas con planos de mayor duración que los habitualmente usados en el cine de acción. En la década de los ochenta, la saga revolucionó la forma en que se percibía la acción vehicular, y sentó las bases del género postapocalíptico que, desarrollado por la ciencia ficción, se ha establecido como un atractivo subgénero cinematográfico para cuestionar la manera en que las decisiones del ser humano lo conducen a su propia destrucción. El principal atractivo de los tres filmes anteriores consistía en su manufactura artesanal. Las acrobacias, los escenarios áridos, los vestuarios extravagantes y las bestias vehiculares eran reales. Las películas poseían una sensación de estética casera; incluso, para la película de 1979, Miller sacrificó su propio automóvil para que fuera destrozado en un accidente de carretera real que decidieron filmar. Tres décadas después, el público de cine del siglo XXI –tan habituado al espectáculo, los efectos visuales y las imágenes generadas por computadora (CGI)– encontrará a Fury Road un choque violento con su manera de ver el cine. Esta película cuenta con la participación de poco más de 300 dobles y especialistas en secuencias de acción que aportaron su agilidad física y talento para ejecutar las acrobacias que se ven en pantalla; cada una de las maniobras son llevadas a cabo por personas reales, no por personajes constituidos mediante efectos digitales. Éstos sólo fueron empleados para mejorar y perfeccionar los paisajes como telones de fondo y para eliminar los cables de seguridad que sujetaban a los actores. El metal, la carne, la saturación de tonos ocres y anaranjados, los golpes, los rasguños, la sangre y las explosiones son tan palpables y tangibles como lo fueron en 1979, sin la necesidad de recurrir al 3D. Se percibe la dedicación de George Miller en la elaboración de su obra; después de 36 años, el director conserva la pasión por el mundo que él construyó. Furia en el camino es un buen exponente del cine de acción bien ejecutado; una película que su autor concibió durante 15 años; uno de los mejores filmes del género de la década; una obra vibrante, sin concesiones, donde el caos nihilista y las tormentas de arena angustian a sus personajes mientras entusiasman a los espectadores dejando abierta la posibilidad de continuar desarrollando este desolador mundo en futuros filmes, y demostrando que para crear este extravagante y caótico escenario se necesita orden y control. Furia en el camino es una película transgresora, sutil e inteligente, capaz de cuestionar el mundo actual sin la necesidad de recurrir a discursos obvios; que busca hacer un comentario punzante respecto a las nociones de progreso, desarrollo y evolución –ideas sobre las cuales se ha cimentado el sistema occidental actual–, pero sin sentirse moralmente superior al público. ",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," Revving its engines and spurting jets of flame like not just another franchise reboot, but an entire genre makeover, Mad Max: Fury Road is the sort of undeniably bugged-out hot mess-terpiece that would make even the most dedicated glitter spray-paint huffers bolt upright in their seats. Aesthetically speaking, it takes no prisoners. What the (per Armond White) Von Sternbergian overtures of The Chronicles of Riddick were to the svelte muscularity of the original Pitch Black, what the battery-acid wash of the overloaded Crank: High Voltage was to the Energizer Bunny first installment—that’s what Fury Road is to the now comparatively sinewy Mad Max films that precede it. In his book Film Follies, critic Stuart Klawans perceptively performed a taxonomy of the “movies for people who want to die from too much cinema.” With Fury Road, septuagenarian Aussie auteur George Miller seems scarily willing to take Klawans up on that bet. Though the film fades in on an apocalyptically laconic wasteland vista with Max Rockatansky’s (Tom Hardy) back to the camera, Miller quickly slaps his iconic road warrior’s back to the wall. Literally from the movie’s second shot on, Miller keeps his own happy feet firmly planted on the accelerator. No sooner has he finished gnawing on a two-headed lizard delicacy than Max is caught and chained up in the vast catacombs of a large, parasitic race of warriors. With translucent skin (straight out of The Omega Man) covered in plague buboes, the War Boys use Max and other healthy specimens as their human blood bags. The colony’s vast edifices, columns of rationed water, and class structures pronounced via vertical orientation all suggest nothing so much as a gristly, scatological spin on Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, with the Skeletor-meets-Darth Vader despot King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in 1979’s Mad Max) perched above all. The exposition is as elemental as its visual presentation is saturated. And the same goes for Fury Road’s core plot, which kicks in immediately as Charlize Theron’s imposing Imperator Furiosa (sporting a buzzcut undoubtedly meant to recall both Sigourney Weaver’s Lt. Ripley and Renée Falconetti’s Joan of Arc) deviates from the warpath to make a break for the promised land with five very precious and nubile pieces of Immortan Joe’s “property” in tow. Cue the dubstep chase music. (No, really: Joe’s gear-grinding phalanx includes a three-story-high wall of mobile speakers seemingly driven by a metal guitarist and powered by six timpani-smashing brutes.) Max is thrust unwittingly into the thick of Joe and Furiosa’s game of chicken, finding that being strapped to the front of a nightmarish, turbo-powered S&M dune buggy like some impossibly thick-necked hood ornament does a lot for settling one’s usually up-for-grabs allegiances. Miller punishes his audience with pleasure, orchestrating the rubber-burning pandemonium with the illicit smirk of someone who knows he’s giving us exactly what we want—only way more of it than they ever thought they could handle. Way more than the film’s 120 minutes can handle, judging by the breakneck speed utilized by Miller’s cinematographer John Seale (apparently relishing the opportunity to rip apart the same desert sands that netted him an Oscar for The English Patient). A significant chunk of the movie’s copious action sequences appear heavily under-cranked, zipping from one explosion to the next like a silent Sennett comedy from the depths of hell, or like an impatient ADHD savant’s DVD player caught perpetually on 1.5x mode. In an era where franchises routinely break up single chapters across two box-office-grubbing installments, Fury Road shoehorns enough ideas for two films into one bulging package. (And, if reports are any indication and there are at least two further installments in the waiting, we’ve finally arrived at the gearhead Götterdämmerung.) The first trio of Mad Max films focused on the paucity of oil as a prime plot driver. Fury Road, in contrast, focuses on the lack of water. It’s a swap that has obviously eerie prescience in California’s waning years, but more to the point it belies Miller’s true about-face. The series that made its mark centering around that avatar for persuasive chauvinism, Mel Gibson, now sees sensitive millennial hunk Hardy’s Max submitting to the will of Theron’s maternal sentinel and her fertile, if not outright expectant, charges. But The Divine Fuel Cells of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood this is not. If oil and water are the two main signposts of Miller’s symbolic concerns, their incompatibility emerges in flamboyant fashion during the film’s climax when (spoiler alert!) Furiosa’s distaff brigade lead Joe’s meathead army into the suggestive folds of a rocky impasse. The resulting pileup of twisted metal and decapitated ego may well be the biggest, most muscular depiction of the masculine manifest destiny wiping out in action-movie history.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," Finally, a sequel that doesn't disappoint. George Miller's follow-up to his post-apocalyptic Mad Max trilogy is the thrill-ride fans have long been waiting for: streamlined and packed with detail, proudly silly and deadly earnest, ultra-commercial and a cry from the heart. To be sure, a few changes have been made that some may find hard to swallow. The gore has been toned down, as has the specifically Australian nature of the Mad Max universe – not surprisingly as most of the film was shot in Namibia. A seemingly more serious issue is the casting of Britain's Tom Hardy as the new incarnation of the solitary ""road warrior"" Max Rockatansky. ​ Though never less than physically committed, Hardy is too self-conscious an actor to match the surly swagger of Mel Gibson. This scarcely matters, however, as the real star of Fury Road is Charlize Theron as the magnificently named Imperator Furiosa​, a road warrior in her own right with a prosthetic arm and an attitude of grim determination – the kind of take-no-prisoners action heroine rarely seen in recent Hollywood cinema. Literally, it's Furiosa who drives the plot. After rescuing a group of enslaved young women from the fortress of the villainous Immortan Joe (series veteran Hugh Keays-Byrne) she sets out across the desert in her big rig on a journey to the mythical ""green place"", pursued by an army of pale-faced War Boys such as the endearingly manic Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Having just escaped the fortress himself, Max has little choice but to go along for the ride. The emphasis on female characters is a welcome surprise in a film that otherwise recaptures much of the original Mad Max spirit. There are the punkish costumes, the fanciful names, and of course the custom-built vehicles – Frankenstein assemblages of discarded parts, pimped out with spikes and improvised weaponry. Most importantly, Miller hasn't lost his touch as a director of action: the filmmaking has a verve that suggests a man joyfully returning to what he does best. Most of Fury Road consists of a series of spectacular chase sequences, where Miller and his team find endless variations on the theme of a battle on wheels: figures climb over and under moving vehicles, are dragged alongside or crushed beneath. There are moments when the editing is almost avant-garde, especially in the early going when we see things from Max's groggy, traumatised point of view. Yet the narrative line stays clear, thanks to the graphic impact of each individual shot – aided in turn from the comic-book simplicity of the setting, divided between golden desert and bright blue sky. Philosophically, the series has remained true to its vision of heroic deeds undertaken almost unwillingly in a world where self-interest is the norm. There remains, too, a homely quality at the back of it all: a sense that the whole mad saga might represent a transmogrified memory of an Aussie family outing, a drive through the countryside with Mum, Dad and the kids.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015","  Going to see Mad Max: Fury Road - which is receiving its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday - is like being tossed into the mosh pit of a heavy-metal gig while racing at high speed across Earth’s most unforgiving desert. We left with our ears ringing, bodies still flinching, crying “water, water!”. In all, a terrific experience.   While the original Mad Max way back in 1979 starred Mel Gibson and was made in Australia on a B-movie budget, the latest no-expense spared version has Tom Hardy as Max. You can tell he’s hard because he catches a post-apocalyptic two-headed lizard under his heel and then eats it alive in the first scene. ",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," His name is Max, his world is fire and blood - and he is back. Mad Max Fury Road is a very unusual re-boot. This is not a case of today’s filmmakers dusting down an old franchise and re-inventing it for a new generation. The movie is directed by George Miller, the now 70 year old originator of Mad Max back in 1979, when mad Mel Gibson was the man in the leather jacket. This is the post-apocalyptic movie to end all post-apocalyptic movies. There is even more dust, rust and decay here than in the original films. The credits themselves are in molten red lettering. The new film turns out to be a triumph for its cinematographer John Seale and for its costume and production designers. Miller and his team have used CGI to up the ante yet further when it comes to the chases, fights, explosions and general mayhem with which Max has long been associated. For all the painstaking detail here - the skull motifs, the intricate tattoos on the warriors’ skins, the spikes on the wheels, the flamboyantly dressed guitarist who accompanies the fighters - the film never descends to quite the level of kitsch of Mad Max’s last outing, in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), in which Tina Turner was the villainess. Miller strikes a ferocious tempo throughout. As a piece of storytelling, though, the film feels as old fashioned as a 1930s B-movie western. Instead of stagecoaches, there are gas guzzling lorries, motorbikes and trucks. This is the story of a chase. For the first half, the characters are rushing in one direction. In the second half, they are rushing in the opposite direction - and that is just about all we get in the way of narrative. Scenes of characters fighting on top of lorries or falling beneath them evoke memories of the stunts Yakima Canutt used to perform in old John Ford movies. Mad Max (Tom Hardy) introduces himself as the “one who runs from both the living and the dead.” He is a man reduced to a single instinct, which is survival. If that means eating live lizards for breakfast, so be it. Fury Road has barely started than Max is hunted down by the Warboys, followers of Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a tyrannical warlord who wears a mask with teeth in it that makes him look like a character in a Tobe Hooper horror film. We’re treated to some Douglas Fairbanks-style acrobatics as Max flees his captors and flings himself off precipices in his bid to escape them. The action is so unrelenting that it takes a few moments to work out what is happening or why. What has really incensed Immortal Joe is that his “breeders,” the five women he has taken as his wives, have fled the Citadel, smuggled away by Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a shaven-headed, one armed but extremely resourceful warrior who is every bit as violent as Max himself. Early on, Fury Road displays tremendous inventiveness. For all its reportedly massive budget, it has a handcrafted feel that you don’t find in Marvel movies. The film was partly shot in the Namibian desert. Some widescreen sequences of the arid wilderness are as graceful as those found in David Lean’s Lawrence Of Arabia. Not that Miller wastes much time surveying the beauty of the landscapes. This is a film withy very few moments of anything even approaching stillness. There is one perhaps inadvertently comic moment when Miller, as if in deference to his fellow Australian director Peter Weir, includes a shot that looks like it has been taken from Picnic At Hanging Rock. Every character here is dirty, dusty and sweaty but when we first see the five runaway wives (played by Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton), they are dressed all in white. They are beautiful and with an ethereal quality entirely out of keeping with everything else in the movie. The film presents huge challenges to its actors. They have minimal dialogue. Relationships between characters have to be established in the moments when they are not fleeing for their lives or shooting, clawing or head-butting one another. Tom Hardy spends much of the early part of the movie with a metal mask on his face, reminiscent of the one he wore as Bane in The Dark Night Rises. He is chained to the front of a war wagon, as if he is its emblem. The film makes an intriguing counterpoint to the low budget movie Locke (2013) in which Hardy also appeared and which was also about a journey. In that film, he did nothing but talk as he drove through the night. Here, he barely says a word and at first won’t even tell Furiosa her name. It’s still an impressive performance, far darker in tone than the ones Mel Gibson gave in the same role. He is an ex-cop eking out an existence in the wasteland. Hardy’s challenge, tom which he rises, is to make a character so sullen and so violent into some kind of a hero. In his early scenes with Charleze Theron, who matches him for sheer kickass malice and resourcefulness, they forge a bond by beating each other almost to a pulp. At times, the action becomes repetitive. One explosion in the desert seems just like another. There isn’t much humour - outside the gallows humour in scenes of Max washing his bloodied face in mothers’ milk or the slapstick of the tenacious Nux (Nicholas Hoult), chained to Max by a car door or doing mechanical repairs. Nux is the sweetest-natured character in the film but he is as violent as everyone else. The film ultimately feels a little uneven. Far more attention has been paid to creating the vision of Mad Max’s dystopian world that to finding a convincing story to tell about it. Then again, with such incessant and vivid action, there is very little time given us to worry about the creakiness in the plotting.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2015"," It was clear from the start that the Australian writer/director George Miller would be influential. His wildly successful 1979 debut, Mad Max—to be followed by Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)—created a vision of postapocalyptic punk dystopia that was dustier and more barren than the one Ridley Scott would put forth a few years later in Blade Runner, but just as inspirational. (The trilogy has influenced everyone from Guillermo del Toro to Hype Williams to the creators of the Saw movie franchise, who say they took their stomach-churning premise from a scene at the end of the first Mad Max movie in which a character is forced to contemplate cutting off his own foot in order to escape.) The way the world ends, for Miller, is not in overpopulated high-tech megacities slicked with film-noir rain, but in something like the polar opposite. Miller’s nightmare of the future posits the planet as a parched desert landscape against which the world’s few remaining humans scratch out a meager, violent existence, equipped only with the salvaged remains of mid-20th-century technology. It’s that future that, 36 years after Mel Gibson first put the pedal to the metal as Max Rockatansky, is looking more like the one we may be leaving to our own survivors—which makes the now 70-year-old Miller’s decades-later entry in the series, Mad Max: Fury Road, opening Friday, feel like less of a reboot of glory days past than a prequel of scary days to come. Miller was always influential, but we didn’t know he would turn out to be an environmental prophet.* That same Max Rockatansky—now played by Tom Hardy, the fine English actor best known to American movie audiences as the dapper Eames in Inception (since he was all but unrecognizable as the masked Bane in The Dark Knight Rises)—is the first human we encounter in Fury Road’s moisture-deprived but color-saturated world. He’s sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere, making a meal of a two-headed lizard as he catches us up on the state of things in a terse philosophical voice-over: “As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy—me or everyone else.” Shortly thereafter, the answer to at least that question becomes clear: There are plenty of people in Fury Road who are considerably further along the insanity continuum than Max, beginning with the despotic god-king Immortan Joe. Played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who portrayed the sadistic villain Toecutter in the 1979 original, this grotesque figure—the lower half of his face concealed by a mask that appears to be fashioned from a human skull—has somehow managed to gain control of the world’s remaining water supply. Below his cliff-top cave the desperate populace waits, rusty buckets upraised, for him to pump when and for whatever length of time he pleases. Immortan Joe also seems to have cornered the future’s market on good-looking, fertile young women. He keeps five “wives,” dressed in diaphanous white and looking cleaner and better-nourished than anyone else in sight, as prisoners in his well-defended fortress, the Citadel. Led by the warrior-gone-rogue Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), these young women—at least two of whom are pregnant with the warlord’s longed-for heir—manage to escape in one of the Citadel’s tricked-out salvage vehicles. Enraged at the loss of the royal harem, Immortan Joe and his minions give chase in a convoy of even crazier-looking cars, many of them consisting of multiple chassis welded together in towering piles. Max and the melancholy white-painted War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) join Furiosa in her mission to find a safe haven for the fleeing women, at first out of an instinct for self-preservation and, later, with a sense of true solidarity. There’s a mythic land known as “the green place”—don’t all apocalyptic movie futures share such an idyll?—where Furiosa intends to deliver these five supermodel-gorgeous sex slaves, or die trying. But does the green place still exist? And even if it does, is there any hope of reaching it while being chased across the salt flats by a fleet of vehicles so freakishly elaborate that one of them includes an electric guitarist suspended from its front as a living hood ornament, shredding away as the dusty miles fly by? Miller has said that he likes to envision all the Mad Max movies as films that could play anywhere in the world without subtitles, and Fury Road could almost function as a silent film, albeit one with a deafeningly loud soundtrack. (The score is by the Dutch music producer Junkie XL, the sound design by Christopher S. Aud.) Essentially, the story is one extended, spectacular car chase, which changes directions mid-movie to retrace its own footsteps as the stunts grow bigger and more outrageous with each passing mile. Dialogue is minimal, flinty and brusque—sometimes effectively so, but equally often not. The fleeing wives are generally indistinguishable in their catalog-ready prettiness (though Zoë Kravitz stands out as the marvelously named Toast the Knowing), and Hoult is a sweet, otherwordly presence as the once-fanatical War Boy turned love-struck peacenik. Then there’s Theron’s grimly determined Furiosa, her head shaved, her forehead blackened with axle grease, and one arm digitally severed near the elbow and replaced by a prosthetic metal hand. Furiosa manages to come across as a real and touching character despite being given very little backstory. In fact, if the movie has a central protagonist, it’s Furiosa, not Max. Hardy’s character remains more indistinct, perhaps because he’s usually (sometimes comically) placed in positions of extreme passivity; for instance, he spends most of one long chase sequence suspended upside down from the window of a moving vehicle, his ankles secured only by Furiosa’s metal-enhanced grip. A late encounter with a pack of elderly female warriors brings the film’s feminist subtext to the fore: This is a story about rescuing beautiful damsels in distress, yes, but most of the characters doing the truly competent rescue work are women too. Most of all, though, Mad Max: Fury Road is about the cars, the costumes, and the generally whacked-out production design (by Colin Gibson, who also worked as art director on Miller’s underrated 1998 live-action animal tale Babe: Pig in the City). The sheer variety of bizarre conveyances on display brings to mind a perverse update of Richard Scarry’s Busytown, with its cars made of pencils, pickles, and toothpaste tubes. One grandly imagined war rig has the shell of an old Volkswagen Beetle mounted whimsically to its top; another is a porcupine-like solid mass of metal spikes on wheels; yet another seems to be a Chevy Chevelle mounted on tank treads. The undercarriage of a petrol tanker is decorated with rows of rusted skulls, barnacle-like encrustations that look as if they grew there on their own. One gearshift—Furiosa’s—features a knob made from the top of a human femur. These design details, executed with wit, imagination, and care, gave me something to appreciate even when the adrenaline from the nonstop virtuosic car stunts started to run dry around the 45-minute point. It may be the case, as Miller has claimed, that the majority of Fury Road’s effects were done without using CGI, but even so, the onslaught of action is so fast-paced and overpowering there’s little time to appreciate Miller’s analog artistry, and the feeling of being inside a video game—a sinking sensation familiar from less carefully orchestrated action movies—sometimes takes over. There will be viewers—including many with no connection at all to the old Mad Max trilogy—who will thrill to every pulse-pumping, fuel-tank-exploding second of Mad Max: Fury Road. I wasn’t one of them, but it’s impossible not to appreciate the septuagenarian Miller’s boundless energy and investment in a film franchise that’s older by a few decades than many of its most enthusiastic audience members are likely to be.",POSITIVE

"May 12, 2015",Movies on this scale have often been the worst offenders when it comes to failing to put women and the issues they face at the fore. But Fury Road is a brilliantly feminist blockbuster which passes the Bechdel test with flying colours.,POSITIVE

It has been 30 years since the last anarchic outing, “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome” — so long that the iconic role of bereaved cop-turned-drifter in a dead world can no longer belong to aging, disgraced Mel Gibson. But the muted, hulking Tom Hardy is a natural fit for taking Max into another round of energizing showdowns between various demented figures battling for superiority in a twisted, fast-paced arena imported from the earlier movies, but never this spectacularly realized. Like Max himself, Miller’s stripped-down approach to staging intense and involving action sequences stands alone.  Before all else, the movie’s familiarity marks a return to form. In the years since his previous “Max” outings, Miller has developed a peculiar filmography of mainstream works that smuggle mature themes into popular material that never demands it — most successfully with “Babe: Pig in the City” and the first “Happy Feet” — even if the sheer cinematic virtuosity of the “Mad Max” movies went latent. Judging by the constant forward momentum of “Fury Road,” Miller had a lot to get out of his system: The movie starts at a high velocity and barely ever slows down.  Within minutes, we’re treated to roaring engines, dust-caked showdowns, a gripping chase through claustrophobic tunnels and a dangling crane. Miller swiftly beefs up these scenes with tidbits of backstory, as Max sees flashes of phantoms from the traumatic past that still haunts him. It’s just enough to provide a reminder of his chaotic present. “My world is fire and blood,” he intones in an opening voiceover, which is just as much a literal description of the ensuing mayhem as a figurative one.  Despite a visionary set design that consolidates the biker aesthetic of the second film with the grimly carnivalesque look of the second, “Fury Road” maintains a fairly straightforward narrative trajectory as it barrels ahead, almost entirely focused on a series of rapid-fire chase scenes.  After he escapes from a debilitating position strapped to the hood of his vehicle by one of his demonic captors, Max teams up with a throng of female slaves led by the trenchant Furiosa (a bald, scowling Charlize Theron, intimidating for reasons beyond her character’s metallic arm) to escape Immortan Joe’s daunting advances from behind the wheels of souped-up monster truck.  Furiosa hopes to pawn off her supplies and find a legendary world of greenery she remembers from her youth, while forming a tentative alliance with Max that deepens as the pair survive a series of violent encounters. Unwilling to trust anyone, but committed to survival at all costs, their unruly chemistry is the closest thing to a tight bond in the series since Max’s early family days. But their toughness has nothing on maniacal foe Immortan Joe — whose appearance recalls, oddly enough, the muffled Bane character Hardy played in “The Dark Knight Returns.” However, Joe retains a far more menacing edge thanks to the sparsity of details surrounding his rule. Even as he’s protected by throngs of white-powered foot soldiers at every turn, Joe’s a terrifically effective super villain unafraid to get his hands dirty.  Furiosa’s own clan, who call themselves the Five Wives (a group that includes Zoe Kravitz and Abbey Lee) are a largely indistinguishable bunch, although their own uneasy alliance with one of Joe’s pale-faced offspring (Nicholas Hoult) — who defects to the other side after he’s inadvertently trapped in their truck — comes as close as this movie gets to conveying a semblance of warmth. Overall, however, the personalities in “Fury Road” remain gruff, one-note creations, but that’s at least fitting for this distinctive world that hits one note time and again so well. Miller brings a near-abstract quality to the proceedings that elevates from them from the specifics of the story. As Max and Furiosa speed through the desert with Joe and his team in hot pursuit, the procession moves through the barren environments as though traversing through grim sonnets.  Most dialogue is defined by concise declarations or punchy asides on par with the expressionistic despair of the scenery. The words “Who killed the world?” are scrawled on walls. Max’s inevitable pep talk with Furiosa finds him declaring “Hope is a mistake,” while the psychos chasing after him gear up for martyrdom they envision as “riding to Valhalla.” The sense of peril, culling from historical and mythological reference points, is at once poignant and fragmentary. However, the main effective ingredient in “Fury Road” is its ongoing motion. The chases largely pivot on insane car-to-car acrobatics, narrow exchanges of gunfire and metal smashing together at ridiculously high speeds. Inspiring fear and giddy excitement in equal measures, “Fury Road” suggests the unruly collision of “Ben Hur” and a Road Runner cartoon.  Nevertheless, Miller keeps the action fluid from scene to scene, offering a bracing alternative to countless murky CGI spectacles that dominate Hollywood studio product today. In “Fury Road,” special effects come secondary to the visual marvels of the color palette meted out by cinematographer John Seale at every turn. One standout moment revolves around a ginormous environmental storm that calls to mind “Wizard of Oz.” Nighttime scenes are filled with silhouettes against a landscape baked in blue. Orange-red flare guns pierce the barren sky. In essence, Miller has made a silent film enhanced, but not defined, by its meaty sounds.  The vivid post-apocalyptic scenery pays homage to Miller’s homegrown tradition. In the years since the last movie, “Mad Max” has been welded into the DNA of modern action and sci-fi movies while inspiring countless imitators. But no matter these lofty expectations, Miller avoids taking the overwrought material for granted by pushing it beyond pure stylistic posturing.  There’s rich thematic material here that extends beyond the story’s immediate appeal: Long before Miller’s script closes with a quote by Albert Camus, it delivers a cautionary tale against the threat of global warming, depicts the greed and desperation surrounding natural resources, and celebrates the prospects of civilian uprising under ridiculously daunting conditions. Insert your metaphorical reading here. “Sooner or later,” announces one rebellious slave, “someone pushes back.” The underlying thrill of “Fury Road” stems from watching those words come to life on several levels. “Mad Max” doesn’t just depict conflicts with evildoers in a tattered existence. It delivers a rare alternative to aggressively stupid action movies. At a time of great need, Max rides again.  By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"May 12, 2015"," In a cinematic landscape where every movie series of notable mainstream or cult popularity is being resurrected instead of left for dead, one figure has emerged as a shining light amid the darkness of Ridley Scott reboots and kingdoms of crystal skulls. His name is George Miller, his character is Mad Max, and his world is fire and blood.Against all odds, Miller’s return to the post-apocalyptic universe that made his directorial name (he helmed and co-wrote all three of the prior Mel Gibson films) arrives as an invigorating jolt of demented originality despite its predecessors’ influential legacy. It makes the other Mad Max films seem, in retrospect, like demo reels for the kinetic rush of this chase epic.Tom Hardy is the new Max, a lone wolf ex-cop in a hopeless desert dystopia, whose sole instinct is simply to survive. He finds himself captured by an army of pale, diseased male soldiers, who serve a tyrannical megalomaniac (Hugh Keays-Byrne) with delusions of deity grandeur, one who rules a mountain stronghold through harvesting his people like fuel. The madman’s one-armed lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (a magnificent Charlize Theron), has had enough, and drives off into hostile territory with the ruler’s prized concubines in tow. A suicidal army of twisted metal monstrosities driven by Valhalla-seeking nutjobs is quickly in hot pursuit, and Max naturally gets caught up in the carnage and helps to aid the women’s dash for freedom. With its go-for-broke approach to the blockbuster model, Mad Max: Fury Road feels like both a young man’s film (throwing in everything a mega-budget can provide, lest the helmer never see its like again) and that of an old hand (Miller just turned 70) who knows how to make the controlled chaos still coherent, and knows when to calm things down to let one linger in the nightmarish beauty of his sustained freak show, which, to the unfamiliar, could be described as what Terry Gilliam might make with a Marvel movie’s budget. Miller’s film is a welcome anomaly as one of those weird, expensive juggernauts that usually only endure in storyboard form as mementos of what could have been (e.g. Jodorowsky’s Dune), except this one somehow got made.Fury Road operates as a stand alone entity that requires no prior experience with Max’s previous exploits, though there are a couple of hints for series fans to indicate that the story comes before that of the second film. Indeed, part of its strength is how, with complete clarity of vision despite the riotous nature of its set-pieces, Miller’s visual storytelling gets across everything you need to know about this world and its players with dialogue kept to a minimum, and little of it expository; though some of the interesting feminist subtext of the piece may admittedly be lost with dialogue extracted, Fury Road can plausibly be watched on mute and still retain most of its power. It’s lean, economic action cinema at its finest, like Stagecoach by the way of sci-fi.Not that you’d want the film on mute, since just as much greatness comes from the film’s sound as it does from the visceral, incredible action scenes on display, pretty much all of which are done for real with minimal CG intrusions except for occasional scenery flourishes (e.g. a fiery sandstorm). Junkie XL’s roaring score of drumfire gets the blood racing alongside John Seale’s hyper-saturated cinematography (please do not see this in colour-dimming 3D). Just about the only real complaint is Tom Hardy’s fluctuating accent, which veers from Australian to his Bane voice to, briefly, his Bronx accent from The Drop. It’s not like he talks much, though, and you could write it off as being because ole Max is a mad bastard – a mad bastard served up by a mad master filmmaker.",POSITIVE

"May 11, 2015"," The rising British star of Bronson, Locke and last month’s Child 44 steps into Mel Gibson’s dusty-leather boots for a misguided reboot of the classic Australian future-thriller. The effects are terrific but this Mad Max reboot gives far, far too little screentime to the fearsome road warrior, with original writer-director George Miller more intent on creating a mix-tape of past glories. It’s been 36 years since Miller’s original Mad Max (essentially Death Wish on wheels) roared into cinemas, making Gibson a star and becoming one of the most profitable movies ever, grossing close to $100million on a budget of just $200,000. The writer-director upped the stakes with Mad Max 2 (1981), a sequel both electrifying and audacious, crafting a world where you could get crucified and then set on fire for a can of petrol. This time we return to the near future where Max, sprung from imprisonment from a gang of albino terrorists, hooks up with Furiosa (Charlize Theron) to drive a lorry to the coast in defiance of the masked Immortan. As for the plot, concerning a truckload of supermodels (including Rosie Huntington-Whitely) hoping to be delivered from a sandy, post-apocalyptic hell-on-earth, it looks very much like Miller throwing sound and fury where a plot should be.",NEUTRAL
"May 11, 2015","Some of the most brilliant visions are only seen for one shot, and that's how special the Mad Max world is. Even a cutaway is indicative of the world.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," While wearily haunted ex-cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is the titular hero, hunted in the toxic, dystopian Wasteland, Charlize Theron delivers a powerhouse performance as Imperator Furiosa, the most exciting sci-fi protagonist since Ellen Ripley (“Alien”). As George Miller explains, “What looks like testosterone-fueled summer escape is actually a badass feminist action flick. The men do the damage but the women restore humanity.” Furiosa is a War Rig operator who’s determined to wreak revenge for her past suffering by smuggling the prized Five Wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keogh, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton) of the tyrannical warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), to safety in the Green Place. They’ve been enslaved in the Citadel to breed and provide breast milk to the white-painted, tattooed troops, a.k.a. War Boys (including Nicolas Hoult), who dream of an idyllic afterlife in Valhalla. Since both Max and Furiosa are pursued by Immortan Joe and his crazed son, Corpus Colossus (Quentin Kenihan), they reluctantly team up for mutual survival, battling the Gas Town thugs and Bullet Farmer gang, along with the underground Buzzard tribe and the stealthy Rock Riders. Back in 1979, George Miller created iconic Mad Max, catapulting Mel Gibson to stardom as the righteous, leather-jacketed nomad. But its allegorical antecedents go back to classic Greek mythology (Odysseus), Westerns (“The Man With No Name”), even “Star Wars” Han Solo. “One of the ideas that drove ‘Mad Max,’ and drives ‘Fury Road,’ was Alfred Hitchcock’s notion about making films that can be watched anywhere in the world without subtitles,” Miller says, explaining how his production team used music to viscerally propel the plot. Miller also recruited playwright Eve Ensler (“Vagina Diaries”) to authenticate the depiction of vulnerable, abused women.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015","  George Millerhas spent nearly 15 years trying to get a new Mad Max movie off the ground, which may explain why he wastes no time feeding patient fans of his franchise right into a buzzsaw. He knows that a decade and a half is enough foreplay—it’s time to cut right to the climax. And for 120 minutes, that climax doesn’t let up. Mad Max: Fury Road may be the first Tantric action flick. Sting will love it. Souped-up motorcycles soar over Nitro-fueled muscle cars, Nitro-fueled muscle cars crash into tricked-out oil trucks, and all of them explode into glorious fireballs. Fury Road not only captures the same Molotov-cocktail craziness of Miller’s masterpiece, 1981’s The Road Warrior—it’s also a surprisingly hypercaffeinated film for a director in his fifth decade behind the camera.
  The original Mad Max first hit theaters in 1979, when the world was squeezed in the viselike grip of a global oil crisis. The parched Australian outback of the film and its scavenger-punk inhabitants’ quest for precious fuel may have seemed cartoonish at the time, but not totally implausible. In this thirsty, lawless wasteland, a hero emerged—a cop named Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) whose family was murdered by a mohawked gang and for whom payback and survival were two sides of the same furnace-blasted coin. The reason I bring up this backstory is because you won’t learn any of it from Fury Road. Miller either expects his audience to be fluent in the Maxverse, or he simply doesn’t care. Either way, if it’s more than just a demolition-derby high you’re chasing, it helps to know a bit about the character or you might walk out a little hungry. That is, after your retinas cool down and the adrenaline rush wears off.
  As everyone knows by now, Max is no longer played by Gibson, but instead by Tom Hardy. And while the red-hot British actor’s unapologetic brand of macho danger in films like Warrior, Locke, and as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises would seem ideal for such a ferocious gig, the truth is he pales next to Gibson, who managed to convey not just physical pain, but the emotional kind, too. At the beginning of the film, Hardy’s Max is the hog-tied prisoner of an evil warlord with a platinum fright wig and a Skeletor muzzle named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, “Toecutter” from the 1979 original). This kabuki-painted tyrant lords over a dystopian city of enslaved women that looks like a Hieronymus Bosch painting come to life. After escaping, Max teams up with Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa—a buzzcut badass with a mechanical arm (who, it should be noted, is the movie’s real hero)—and hightails it across the desert pursued by Immortan Joe’s psycho death-race marauders. Cue the drums of war, the fire-and-brimstone pyrotechnics, and the death-defying practical stunts.

"May 11, 2015"," We are apparently in quite a sentimental age. Nostalgia for old TV shows and old film franchises has never been stronger -- particularly among younger viewers who didn't even grow up with the stuff, who yet seem determined to reach backward into older generations' pasts to find entertainment about which they can feel passionately protective and lay some sort of claim as defenders of its legacy. They are, though, certainly not alone in this, as older fans of apparently even the most middling show or old movie feel entitled to suggest it deserves revival on 
Netflix
 or via cinematic reboot/remake/sequels. But I'm not here to talk about all the ways this can and often has gone wrong. No, I'm here to tell you that this coming weekend brings one of those rare examples of when all of this nostalgia and revisiting of some old franchise goes just about as exactly, perfectly right as is humanly possible. It's called Mad Max: Fury Road, and it's the ultimate summer blockbuster. Nothing in the trailers, and nothing I say here, will prepare you for the megaton dose of awesomeness that is this film -- but I'll give it a shot anyway. Director George Miller returns this summer to the post-apocalyptic sci-fi series that made him famous. His titular ex-cop anti-hero Max Rockatansky -- aka ""Mad"" Mad -- has wandered future Australia's barren landscapes for 34 years of real cinema history. But in the storyline of the series, only a little more than 15 years years have passed between the first film and the latest installment, with Fury Road seeming to pick up shortly after the events that ended the original trilogy. Miller's first Mad Max, released in 1979, was a low-budget Australian film that turned into a surprise blockbuster hit. With a budget of less than $500,000 it went on to take about $100 million in worldwide 
box
 office, making it the most profitable film of all time when comparing budget to theatrical receipts. It took 20 years for another film to steal that crown, when The Blair Witch Project nabbed $248 million around the world off of a roughly $50,000 budget (estimates and claims vary between $20,000 and $60,000+). Mad Max remains one of the top-20 grossing films of all time in Australia, adjusted for inflation. It's critical reception was less impressive, but over time it developed a huge cult following and modern reassessments of its quality tend to result in positive reviews. The sequel Mad Max 2, aka The Road Warrior, was also very successful, albeit not to the same degree as the first film -- an odd fact, considering the sequel is widely regarded as the best of the first three films. It's $35 million total global box office from a $5 million budget is the equivalent today of a $9 million budget film pulling down $90 million in theaters, and critics raved. This was Miller's last time as the full-on director on a Mad Max film until this year's Mad Max: Fury Road. It was also Mel Gibson's biggest box office showing in the U.S. up to that point, and brought him significant attention as a bankable star in Hollywood. Finally, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was the most mainstream release of the series, and is probably the most well-known to the general public. While Miller helmed portions of the film, he shared directing duties with George Ogilvie. Less violent, more ""mainstream"" in the storytelling and tone, Beyond Thunderdome even had a hit pop theme song -- ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" -- by costar Tina Turner (I personally like the song, but always really loved the other lesser-known song from the film, ""One of the Living""). This film, like the previous movie in the franchise, hit a new high for Gibson at the domestic box office. Its worldwide take of $36 million topped The Road Warrior, but wasn't as profitable due to its $12 million budget. So it would appear that the Mad Max franchise achieved its financial peak right out the gate with the original film. The budgets kept rising, but the box office didn't. And the last time the series graced the big screen was 30 years ago. On the other hand, the sci-fi/fantasy genre didn't quite dominate the box office back then in the same way it does today, and new generations have rediscovered the Mad Max series on cable, DVD, and streaming online. The franchise's cult status and strong fanbase stretching across the decades, the rise of big-budget sci-fi as the dominant force year after year at the box office, and a strong marketing push that's showing audiences one of the best trailers in years with a compelling cast of characters and awe-inspiring action-adventure stunts will all go a long way toward helping boost Mad Max: Fury Road's financial prospects. Charlize Theron's last R-rated sci-fi summer outing, Prometheus, opened above $50 million and went on to score more than $400 million at the box office globally. Fury Road is currently eyeing a domestic bow in the $35-45 million range, depending on how male-heavy its audience skews and whether Pitch Perfect 2 nabs second place behind The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Warner might do well to do some targeted marketing this week to attract more female viewers, by letting them in on the fact Mad Max: Fury Road actually has a mostly female main cast, and that Theron's character Furiosa is actually the main character of the film.  That could give it enough extra fuel to race past Pitch Perfect 2 and perform on the higher end of estimates. Considering the budget is $150+ million, and marketing costs surely come close to that number as well, Warner Bros. needs the film to perform as a summer blockbuster. The studio clearly seems pleased with their product and confident it will play well with audiences (a sentiment that's probably very accurate, as my review will make clear shortly), and right now it seems it will at least open well. Whether that translates into a leggy enough run to do the $600 million needed to enter profitable territory remains to be seen, but strong positive critical buzz and audience word-of-mouth would help in that regard. Can Mad Max: Fury Road count on such positive feedback and attention to boost its box office performance? Read on, dear readers, and find out! I'm a big fan of the Mad Max series, having watched them repeatedly over the decades, and already appreciating George Miller's directorial talents. However, nothing in the previous Mad Max movies prepared me for what I experienced in Fury Road. Not even that terrific trailer demonstrates what is really in store for audiences. As amazing as the trailer looks, it doesn't have any of the actual best footage or scenes, a rare example of studio marketing assembling a stellar pitch yet managing to hold back all of the greatest surprises. 
Mad Max: Fury Road is faster, bigger, badder, and better than anything else you'll see on screen in 2015. An awe-inspiring display of action storytelling, a visual symphony with possibly the greatest editing I've seen in any action movie to date. George Miller has crafted his finest film here, displaying an insanely uncompromising brilliance in pure action-adventure filmmaking. It is quite simply the best film of the year so far. Let me quote some numbers to demonstrate what you're in store for -- 480; 2,700; 1,500; and 3,500. Those are, respectively, the total number of hours of footage shot during filming; the total number of cuts and edits in the film (when it switches from one shot to the next); the number of visual effects shots used in the film; and the number of panel images in the action storyboards for the film. If you know anything about filmmaking, you know the proper grossly understated reaction to those numbers is, ""Wow!"" That's how much work and technical detail went into creating the action and mesmerizing imagery for Miller's bold artistic vision. They began shooting in 2012, filmed for about six months, then filmed again the following year. Post-production editing and effects, scoring, and other additional work took many more months. It was a mammoth undertaking, and the results are there on the screen to behold in all their glory. There is no ""take a bathroom break"" moment in the entire film, with every second entirely engaging and necessary. All of those cuts and edits mean the average length of any single shot on screen is about 2.9 seconds. The miracle is that it has none of the hyperactive confused visual sense so prevalent in movies that use fast editing techniques. Typically, there's a loss of sense of exactly what's happening, and keeping track of who is where or doing what during a fast-cut action sequence can be nearly impossible. None of that applies here. They used so many cameras, from so many angles, that piecing together the interlocking shots creates a gorgeous, fluid sense of movement and awareness of exactly what is going on the entire time. You won't lose track, you won't see blurry flashes of messy objects, and you won't wonder what the heck just happened. You'll know, and it's thrilling and joyous to experience this sort of unique and game-changing action production. But lest I give the impression it's nothing but an action and effects spectacle, there is an amazing story with exceptional characters here. Max is scarred too deep to ever fully heal, and he relives his mistakes -- and the lives lost due to those mistakes -- every time he shuts his eyes. He cannot live among other people very long, because the trauma of his life and of the future world make it impossible for him to handle close emotional connections or orderly society. But he feels deeply, and his determination to wander alone through life is matched only by his ultimate need to do the right thing. Furiosa is a woman whose past is revealed slowly, and it gives the film its best surprises and character revelations. She is missing an arm but it doesn't slow her down, she was one of the most ruthless and trusted mercenaries for a brutal warlord before betraying him to clear her own conscience and return to a life she lost long ago. The relationship between Max and Furiosa is never a romance, but rather two warriors who instantly recognize in one another something of themselves -- not just their will to survive at any cost, but that spark of madness and tragedy from years of loss and regrets, and a consuming need to make amends and sooth the pain of their guilt. Furiosa is the heart and soul of the film, and its true lead. She has as much screen time as Max, perhaps more, and her arc is the driving force behind it all. Max represents the damaged, ghostlike world and its few remaining threads of mercy and redemption. He acts as an agent of fate -- a kind of angel from a heaven that no longer exists --  delivering aid and necessary comradery to fellow weary wounded warriors, helping them in turn defend those who cannot defend themselves. It's interesting to see it as if Max is a spirit wandering the world to find people similar to himself yet not beyond redemption, to help them find the peace that will forever elude him. He's not literally dead, although perhaps there's a reading of the tale that allows such interpretation, more like an unstoppable undead entity than an actual ethereal spirit. Or maybe the world he resides in is really Hell, or Purgatory, or some other Afterlife where everyone is dead but doesn't realize it yet and fights on as if any sense of peace can be found in the ruins. The presentation of the world as hellish, and of the living as craving redemption and salvation, is indeed pretty clear, after all. Perhaps Max the irredeemable spirit brings redemption to others not too far gone, in secret subconscious hope that by giving them what he himself can never earn, he will in fact earn it after all. There are many readings of it, each with valid arguments and all demonstrating how far this film advances the legacy of the original series. But it works best, I feel, to read all of those things into it, while embracing the literal assertion of a future post-apocalyptic Australia in which warlords really do battle over gasoline, water, and the latest commodity to be cherished and chased endlessly across deserts -- people. The need for speed, and the gas that feeds it, is always present in a Mad Max movie. Now, a new commodity has gained prominence in the fight over resources in a dying world. Healthy people are needed to bring healthy babies into the world, and societies need healthy babies if they are to exist. Miller has been an obviously great directing talent for a long time. But -- and I don't mean this to imply anything negative about his prior filmmaking -- I just had no idea he had something like Fury Road in him. It isn't merely the action and editing and raw power of ever second of the film, it's the haunting beauty of the colors and light and shadows, it's the way every frame seems suitable for framing and hanging on your wall. And it's the way the subtext of the characters' lives and how they weave together elevates the story to a far greater morally complicated level that none of the previous films honestly even attempted (see also: my above consideration of the film as a nightmarish trip through a Hades whose residents don't realize where they're now residing, and Max as a phantom stranger offering redemption to other characters who reflect the person he once was himself). In the end, it is as exciting and entertaining as a summer movie could hope to be. It's also pure coolness incarnate, while also being contemplative and emotionally fulfilling as well as visually arresting beyond anything else in theaters. See it, then see it again -- and see it on the biggest screen you can find, trust me. Let it consume you in its dust and flames and relentlessly stunning power. What a lovely day, indeed!",POSITIVE

"May 11, 2015"," The post-apocalypse hath no fury like a one-armed woman. Thirty years after audiences last ventured beyond the Thunderdome, it’s a road warrioress fueled by righteous wrath, not Mad Max, who sets the dystopian future on fire. In Mad Max: Fury Road, director George Miller’s fourth trip to the Wasteland, Mad Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, filling Mel Gibson’s dust-caked boots) is still a man haunted by the demons of his past. He wanders the cruel irradiated desert, wild-eyed and animalistic, plagued by the visions and voices of those he couldn’t save. In his broken state Max is captured by the paint-huffing “War Boys,” an army of radiation-poisoned zealots devoted to white-haired warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a tyrant reliant on a skull-adorned ventilator who controls the water supply and uses it to rule over a desperate populace. Branded, muzzled, and shackled, Max is doomed to live the rest of his life as a human blood bag tethered to a sickly War Boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult). But when the steely Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) defects from Immortan Joe’s ranks harboring precious stolen cargo in her armored big rig, Max is hauled along with the War Boys for a high-speed desert pursuit. And when that cargo is revealed to be human—the five enslaved wives of Immortan Joe, who’ve made a break for freedom—Max breaks loose and reluctantly teams with Furiosa to head for a fabled safe land. At 70, Miller still knows how to burn rubber and smash metal onscreen with more bone-jarring intensity than directors half his age. Mounting what’s essentially one continuous feature-length car chase with dazzling confidence and an unrelenting kinetic energy, he pulls off a rarity in Hollywood blockbusters these days: a muscular action masterpiece built on practical effects, weightier and more awe-inspiring than the empty-feeling CG pixelfests most studios spend hundreds of millions of dollars on every summer. As in his previous Mad Max films, the danger feels deliciously real and the flames feel hot enough to melt Tom Hardy’s face off. Through dusty desert firestorms, BMX bandit assaults, and speeding skirmishes, Max and Furiosa leave a junkyard’s worth of satisfying wreckage littered in their wake as they’re hunted across the sand by vehicular war parties rolling deep in phalanxes of Frankensteined deathmobiles. Fury Road often evokes the imagery and scenarios of Road Warrior, and to a lesser extent, Beyond Thunderdome, suggesting a loose continuity in the enemies and threats that populate Max’s eternal, eccentric adventures in the Wasteland. Hardy lends a captivating feral intensity to his PTSD-suffering antihero who wrestles, as he always does, over joining someone else’s cause versus going it alone.  But despite playing narrator and serving as our entry point into Fury Road, this isn’t really Max’s story. It’s Furiosa’s. And that’s the film’s single most significant new contribution to the Mad Max franchise: an intriguing new hero whose existential crisis and hard-bitten exploits match those of the original road warrior, and who happens to be a woman. Fury Road doesn’t reveal much about how the grease-painted Furiosa scrapped her way up the ranks to Imperator status to command the coveted War Rig that she proceeds to steal, driving a two-ton target across the imposing desert—all the more fuel for future sequels/prequels, perhaps. But in tracking her quest to liberate herself and the Wives from the bonds of slavery, Miller vastly expands Mad Max’s world by exploring uncharted terrain, and answering a question none of the previous films thought to ask: What does it mean to be a woman in the Wasteland? Descended from a matriarchal clan of lady warriors and kidnapped by Immortan Joe’s goons as a child, Theron’s Furiosa is, like Max, a hero of few words hauling around her share of emotional baggage. Forced to adopt masculine armor to survive in an unforgiving male-dominated society, she sports an androgynous shaved head and a mechanical arm; deliberately de-sexualized, she’s literally missing a part of herself. By the time we meet her she’s already risked her hard-won station to reclaim the identity she’s spent a lifetime suppressing and rejoin the female race. On the flip side of femininity are the wives—The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), The Dag (Abbey Lee), and Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton)—seemingly helpless concubines whose strengths emerge as Furiosa’s War Rig speeds through the desert. Raised to be sexual objects and breeders, the Wives have seized a collective agency. “We are not things,” they affirm to one another and to themselves, a reminder of why they’ve left their lives of comfort and submission behind. Their regal de facto leader The Splendid, the Immortan’s very pregnant favorite baby mama, even surprises Max with her bravery before the others come into their own complex personalities in the course of battle. Aside from an on-the-nose detour in which Furiosa spells out her personal quest for redemption, the script by Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nico Lathouris shows admirable restraint in avoiding over-exposition, leaving much of the story to unfold through and in the midst of explosive action. It’s in those action passages that the world of the Wasteland comes alive in the details, whether in a supercharged muscle car fitted with tank treads, aerial attacks by enemies atop poles that swing hundreds of feet in the air, a life-or-death gas-siphoning contest between characters perched precariously on the hoods of two racing vehicles, or the metal mayhem of the Doof Warrior, the War Boys’ battlefield beacon, who shreds wicked war cries from his flame-throwing guitar while strapped to mobile amps. Fury Road condemns its big bad Immortan Joe, who rules his pious suicide soldier War Boys with promises of a hero’s welcome to Valhalla, and his equally repulsive brethren despots, The People Eater (John Howard) and The Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter), who have collectively divided the Wasteland’s resources and desert fiefdoms amongst them. The allegory is stark—the one-percenters are hoarding their riches and marching the last vestiges of humanity toward a desperate and certain death, but one lone wolf in leather can’t save the world by himself. It turns out the people of the Wasteland did need another hero, a furious woman to match its “mad” man. They’re lucky this bleak dystopian future has her sitting squarely behind the wheel.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important to Fury Road, as are the troubled figures like Max himself and Furiosa, but it’s the overriding sense of the film’s uniqueness, its striving to be something more than just another action movie, that is most impressive. Mad Max: Fury Road is a one of a kind. Like the world it creates, it is a thing of beautiful brutality.

"May 11, 2015"," That’s blasphemy to many, indeed, though I certainly don’t diminish the importance of Part II to global genre cinema. Thunderdome, in fact, could not exist without it (allegations of theft homage from Russell Hoban’s Riddley Walker notwithstanding). But as much as I dig Humungus and Wez, Thunderdome has Aunty Entity, Master Blaster, Savannah Nix, Scrooloos, Jedediah the Pilot and Jed Jr., Ironbar Bassey and more, all of them developed, unique characters in a world whose visual scope has been expanded beyond anything Mad Max viewers in 1979 could have dreamed. (It’s also possible that the added depth is a result of Miller mostly directing the action parts, and having codirector George Ogilvie do much of the rest.) Fury Road gives its players equally evocative monikers – Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, Rictus Erectus and The Splendid Angharad are among the GWAR-like new names for fans to devour (in a bit that would make the late Oderus Urungus proud, there’s even a guitar player who looks like a Hellraiser Cenobite and spurts flame ejaculations from his instrument). But it doesn’t have time to slow down and reveal their characters at any great length – the entire movie is one big, long, vehicle chase through the desert (you really don’t have to worry much about spoilers, because that literally is 99% of the entire plot). If you’re a Road Warrior guy, Valhalla awaits. If you’re me? You’ll still have a lot of fun…while hoping a potential sequel delivers more world-building than can be obtained behind the wheel of a truck. The Mad Max movies have always had somewhat loose continuity, which can in part be explained by the fact that the previous sequels are narrated by peripheral characters who may have unreliable memories. In the original, things were simply set in a world where crime was outpacing the cops, the second was after an unspecified war for resources, and only the third specifically mentions fallout and radiation. Fury Road, which replaces Mel Gibson with Tom Hardy, gives us nuclear blast footage upfront to let you know it is that kind of apocalypse, and periodically haunts Max with visions of dead people, who might be his family, or some of the people he tried to help in previous films. Unlike the Man With (Almost) No Name figure Max became before, this returns our main character to having a very specific backstory – even if it’s one we’re not fully told – and restores his “Rockatansky” surname. It’s also not narrated by anyone else, so we must assume this story is the true one. After his signature Interceptor is run deep into the dirt by bandits, Max awakens in the fiefdom of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the Toecutter in the original Mad Max), a despot something of a cross between Dune’s Baron Harkonnen and “Eddie,” the all-purpose fashion zombie from all the Iron Maiden album covers. Served by an army of pale-skinned, mutant “War Boys” and feared by the radiation-stricken locals to whom he cruelly rations out the supply of fresh water he has found deep underground, Joe saves the last beautiful women on earth to be his personal breeding stock. But when Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, basically playing a grown-up Tank Girl), who’s been sent to trade with a nearby oil-drilling town, absconds with his harem instead, Joe gets pissed and pursues. Max is dragged into it all when young War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) uses him as blood transfusion fodder, and ties him to the hood of his car in an extremely ironic Bane mask while still hooked up to the IV, all so Nux can singlehandedly retrieve the traitors and die a hero (the War Boys appear to have borrowed heavily from Vikings in their spiritual lives). As usual, Max just wants to escape alive and be left alone, but is forced into a situation where he has to stand with the good guys (or, in this case, women). Amusingly enough, the plot is not dissimilar to that of the ’80s Road Warrior ripoff Hell Comes to Frogtown, where Rowdy Roddy Piper’s Sam Hell saved the world’s last fertile ladies from mutant amphibians.  Director George Miller has made a big deal about everything being real, and not relying on CG. This is much appreciated when it comes to the way cars crash and overturn, but not a completely credible claim – if Immortan Joe’s steampunk world isn’t significantly digitally enhanced, I’ll believe it when I see the Blu-ray extras and not before. Somewhat more disappointing, however, is Miller giving in to the temptation to shoot fistfights in that current Fast/Furious style that looks like a mix of undercranking and drop-frame. (Despite my recent criticism of Avengers 2, I give it and other Marvel movies major props for showing most fights in real-time without any stuttery affectations.) Miller doesn’t mess around with his car chases, but his former leading man should have reminded him that you don’t want to skimp on showing pain and suffering during person-to-person brawls. I’d love to tell you how the 3D is, as some scenes are quite clearly made with it in mind, but none of the advance screenings for press were in 3D, supposedly because Miller prefers it seen in 2D. Then again, at a recent Q&A in Los Angeles, Miller also opined that he’d rather you saw it in black and white, an option Warner Bros. is not indulging. However, since it does have color, he has amped it up, wanting to stress a visual departure from the now-standard desaturated apocalypse look. I hope that when I do see it in 3D – and the fact that I want to tells you it’s a worthwhile task – I’ll find he has had a similar philosophy there. Since the movie exists primarily as sensation cranked up to 10, I’m thinking and hoping 3D Imax will blast it to 11, where it belongs. Fury Road is meant to kick ass, and your buttocks will feel sufficiently bruised, no question. My own personal taste in Max is that he have less backstory and as many adventures off the road as on, but I can’t begrudge his creator for going in another direction that is loved by more. Plus, with Max still out there somewhere, again…there is always hope.",POSITIVE

A relentless action spectacle that will dazzle audiences with its visceral torque and blazing vehicular madness, perhaps the most impressive feat director George Miller has achieved with “Mad Max: Fury Road” — beyond successfully thunderdoming without Mel Gibson and executing some of the most spectacular action-stunt sequences committed to celluloid maybe ever — is how the 70-year-old filmmaker takes a traditionally testosterone-fueled series and reimagines it as a kind of feminist manifesto with much on its mind. No, really. ‘Fury Road‘ might be the most intense and bruising action ride of the year, but the film also moves like a speeding maniac in possession of big and provocative ideas — ideas it scatters out the window while it’s moving at breakneck speeds.  In constant manic motion, ‘Fury Road’ wastes absolutely no time getting started, taking off like a lightning bolt from the jump, and barely slowing down. But when the picture does eventually idle, if even for a brief moment, the respite is much needed. ‘Fury Road’ takes a considerable amount of time to crystallize, and its clunky, voice-over-heavy opening is pretty worrisome at first. Initially, the movie’s frantic pulse borders on overkill, seeming like every character in the movie is infected with a berserker rage from “28 Days Later,” arms flailing and all. And in this near hysterical opening — filled with some pretty corny flashbacks to Max’s past — the movie veers dangerously close to a ungainly cross between XTREME sports, nu-metal thrashing and overly-enthusiastic Mountain Dew commercials.  But as Miller’s aggressive film races headlong, its rather clever design comes into focus: an explosive adrenaline rush off the top, a brief reprieve to get you situated and then an unveiling of its characters, the backstory of this post-apocalyptic universe and an orientation about how this universe works and behaves, as the plot propels itself forward. Essentially a two-hour chase movie, ‘Fury Road’ paints an even darker and nihilistic world than the one portrayed in the three previous “Mad Max” movies, which almost feel like child’s play in comparison, at least on an anthropological and humanistic level. Miller brilliantly reimagines his post-apocalyptic universe and this time actually considers the human implications of a wasteland ruled by ruthless dictators and desperation. If oil was the end game for three previous ‘Mad Max’ films — those cars won’t fuel themselves — ‘Fury Road’ reflects savagery and the need to survive on both a more pragmatic and barbaric level. And ‘Fury Road’ is not so much about its titular character, Mad Max (played by a grunty, mono-syllabic Tom Hardy). A kinetic tale about survival, and perhaps more predictably, hope and redemption, ‘Fury Road’ is actually the story of badass rig driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron,) and her tale of reclamation (and how she crosses paths with Max, and how they must overcome their contretemps to survive). In this primeval world — that centers around a city called the Citadel, run by the brutal warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) — all humans have an elemental purpose in service of subsistence. And the cruelty of these functions is what Furiosa eventually cannot abide. As ‘Fury Road’ unfolds, the real story is unveiled: Furiosa betrays her boss, Immortan Joe, and frees “the wives” — a comely group of five women handpicked by Joe to give him offspring. Once Max and Furiosa do intersect, they must decide to either kill each other or cooperate to live, as an army barrels down on their extremely tentative alliance. Drilling down existence to its most primal foundations, Miller reinvents a world where women are enslaved chattel: breeders who birth more recruits for Joe’s blindly devoted road warrior army (one of them played by Nicholas Hoult) and pump mother’s milk for the elite (yep, the top 1% of ‘Fury Road’ drink 100% undiluted breast milk). So, this is the meat (or milk) and texture of ‘Fury Road’ that runs in the background while the propulsive vehicular mayhem assaults the viewer. ‘Fury Road’ can be grueling; you can taste the dust, sweat and heat pelting you, but the tactile qualities of the film only render the immersion that much more extraordinary. There’s much to admire in ‘Fury Road’ beyond its often nail-biting thrills and scorched-earth aesthetics. Production design fetishists will be in awe as Miller’s movie is intensely detailed and designed right down to clothing fibers and the mechanics of everything — even a gigantic pulley wheel that is compelled up or down by the weight of young war boys appears meticulously engineered. And the picture’s overall conception goes deeper, too, from the martyrdom belief system that drives the war boys, to the hodgepodge language cobbled together from past and present. If ‘Fury Road’ doesn’t work for you, there’s at least little argument to be made that the world that Miller has envisioned has been painstakingly imagined down to its core nuts and bolts. Yet, ‘Fury Road’ is not without its problems, either. For all its stimulating ideas, it’s still 80% action movie, 20% drama at best. It’s loaded with themes and concepts, but at the same time, many of them are underwritten. Max isn’t much of a character, and in fact, he’s really just a cipher to get the plot in motion and connect the story to Imperator Furiosa’s proposal for female-lead liberty. Arguably, the wives aren’t fully formed characters either, and considering their plight — a harem of women we know have been raped repeatedly to produce babies — this chafes against the movie’s feminist leanings. Plus, nearly every time various characters open their mouths, you wish they hadn’t: dialogue isn’t exactly the film’s strong suit (fortunately, there isn’t much of it, though claims of being close to a “silent movie,” are grossly overstated).  And when the movie’s score by Junkie XL is not acting like a pulse-pounding tribal march (like something out of a Paul Greengrass movie on steroids), the music can get a little rock n’ roll silly (an overall aesthetic that threatens to undermine the movie). Beyond that, what this franchise would do without Furiosa (Theron has suggested she may not come back) is a big question mark worth worrying about, at least if you’re an executive at Warner Bros. hoping for a sequel.  But ‘Fury Road’ evolves for the better as the movie moves along, and its climatic crescendo is breathless and exhilarating. Dramatizing a story in motion is tricky, but Miller seems to thrive on its challenges. It had been rumored quietly for months that Warner Bros. was worried about ‘Fury Road,’ and aside from Tom Hardy not being a huge box-office star yet (it’s honestly hard to see why), mainstream audiences will likely flip for the film’s insane, action-packed pandemonium.

"May 11, 2015"," For a movie set in a post-apocalyptic desert hellscape, Mad Max: Fury Road is awfully refreshing. Though it’s the fourth movie in writer-director George Miller’s fervid, violent Mad Max series, it’s been a full 30 years since the last installment, Beyond Thunderdome. So, in many ways, Fury Road feels brand new. In a movie season exhaustingly cluttered with never-ending superhero sagas and reboots, Fury Road arrives, despite its pedigree, as a daring, fascinating, thrilling jolt of original energy. It’s invigorating the way a big cinema spectacular should be, reveling in the medium’s towering possibilities, and transporting us to a thoroughly realized world that’s wholly unlike our own. That may sound like a lot of gushy hyperbole, and it probably is. But Fury Road comes as such a relief in a summer that already—it’s only May!—seems destined for doldrums that I want to use big declaratives in the hope that people will go see this thing and make it the hit it deserves to be. We’re not talking about a particularly profound film here—survival is its chief big, blockish theme—but it is the rare mega-budget movie that has both heft and playfulness; it’s dark but fun, a churning orgy of sand and fire that pirouettes with balletic grace. It’s startlingly well-choreographed, impossibly nimble for all its heavy metal-and-bone construction. At root, Fury Road is a reasonably straightforward, though initially disorienting, chase movie: Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is captured by a warlord-ruled sorta-civilization, one that religiously worships fuel and bullets. Max, tormented by visions of people he could not save in the past, soon finds himself tangled up in a desperate mission to free a group of beautiful young women held captive as broodmares by the aforementioned warlord, a wheezing, nightmarish ghoul named Immortan Joe. (He’s played, terrifyingly, by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played a different villain in the original Mad Max movie.) Leading the charge to rescue these women is Imperator Furiosa, a high-ranking officer in Joe’s army. She’s played by Charlize Theron, head shaved and missing half an arm. Furiosa, tough and driven, is a perfect complement and counterbalance to Max, who is swept up in her story, rather than, as is so often the case in action movies, the other way around. In fact, as Fury Road unfurls, it becomes a surprisingly feminist tale: Miller spinning a yarn about women reclaiming their agency from an oppressive system that has long denied them any sort of autonomy. This is still a macho, muscled-up movie, with grizzled men warring over beautiful babes. But those babes—among them Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zoe Kravitz—are themselves rebelling against their victimization, with the help of battle-scarred Max and haunted, determined Furiosa. (Theron cuts an arresting, sympathetic figure throughout.) We meet other women in this odyssey too, and by the final, madcap battle, Fury Road has become an empowering, distaff take on dystopia. Max, played with monosyllabic magnetism by Hardy (he says little, but does so much), proves a big help to these damsels in distress, but the effort is collaborative, a team of nothing-to-lose women and men (but mostly women) fighting to destroy the most brutal of patriarchies. Miller pities the poor young men, though, specifically an irradiated, tumor-stricken “war boy,” Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. Vibrating with manic energy, Nux wants nothing more than to die a gnarly, glorious soldier’s death in battle, at which point, he believes, he’ll be ushered into a shiny, chrome-colored Valhalla. Nux’s allegiances eventually shift, but we can see why this religious fantasy has so consumed him. Vehicles of all kinds reign supreme in this wasteland—these souped-up death machines take the Fast and Furious franchise’s car fetish to a feverish, scary extreme. Miller has taken great care in tricking-out every big rig and monster truck, somehow keeping all their nutso embellishments—which allow for attacks both blunt and acrobatic—from tipping into silliness. Even the war boy who leads the enemy army with his blaring electric guitar (a battle horn for a metal era), a speaker array mounted on some kind of enormous gas-guzzler, feels oddly credible in this maniac story. Miller keeps things tactile and visceral; each vehicular assault is beguilingly immediate and frightening. These operatic sequences are wild to behold, but theirs is an ordered kind of chaos, Miller’s camera deftly maneuvering complicated action scenes that are, in the motorized world he’s made, constantly moving. (John Seale did the vibrant cinematography, he and Miller judiciously dropping frames to create jittery images of mayhem and melee.) Fury Road rarely relents, but when it does slow down, coiling with suspense or pausing to reflect on all the sprawling nothingness surrounding these benighted souls, the film whispers with an intensity to match the louder stretches. Miller knows when to indulge in a serious slo-mo shot or a moment of sweetness or levity, without sacrificing the larger movie’s grim, propulsive charge. At a brisk (these days, anyway) two hours, Fury Road is economical without being restrained—the movie is truly, eye-poppingly epic, but there’s no drag or bloat. The film’s musculature is both lean and intricate, to supremely satisfying effect. It’s a crunching, grinding thing, ornate and ludicrous, that somehow still glides. Fury Road is a bracing, nervy, weirdo adventure that more than lives up to its beautifully cut trailers. I doubt there will be a more rousing potential blockbuster released this summer. Go see it. It’s maddeningly good.",POSITIVE

"May 11, 2015"," Just when we think the Hollywood sequel-reboot-retread machine has worn itself down to a useless nub, along comes a movie to remind us that, sometimes, another dip in the same well can taste just as sweet. That’s certainly the case for “Mad Max: Fury Road,” the fourth of director George Miller‘s smash-em-up derbies and the first one since 1985’s “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.” Yes, it’s been 30 years, and yes, Mel Gibson is no longer playing the titular road warrior, but Miller’s skill at this sort of grand adventure has only grown in the meantime; “Fury Road” is a breathlessly intense opera of violence and vehicular mayhem that demands both awe and multiple viewings to absorb everything that’s happening in his packed, but never overcrowded, widescreen vistas. In the same way that the original 1979 “Mad Max” was the “Citizen Kane” of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, “Mad Max: Fury Road” may well be the “Götterdämmerung” of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga (which the second “Mad Max” outing, 1981’s “The Road Warrior,” helped to create), but it also feels like an epic mic-drop, where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads. (If nothing else, this could be the movie that kills the blue-and-orange color scheme, if only because no one else is ever going to blue-and-orange as hard as “Fury Road” does. Barring, of course, a “Smurfs” sequel set in a sherbet factory.) Tom Hardy fills Mel Gibson‘s leather jacket, with only a slight tweaking of the Max Rockatansky character; in the first “Mad Max,” our hero is sent around the bend after a group of bikers kills his wife and infant son, but this Max lost a spouse and a young daughter, and it’s that little girl who keeps appearing to a haunted, guilty Max, accusing him of failing to save his family. Given his inner turmoil, it’s no surprise that he lets his guard down long enough to be captured by minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, whom “Mad Max” fans will remember as the evil Toecutter). Joe rules over a citadel in the wasteland, parceling out precious water to his followers and raising a troupe of ghoulish, gung-ho adolescent males known as “War Boys,” who commit mayhem on Joe’s behalf thinking that they are living a “half-life,” and that Valhalla awaits them after their demise. Both the captured Max and his car are stripped for parts (he’s tattooed on the back with his status as a universal blood donor), and his initial attempt at escape goes nowhere. But when Joe’s trusted lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) turns her mission to collect gasoline and bullets into something else entirely, Joe sends his War Boys after her, including Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who currently happens to be using a chained-up Max as his human blood bag. What happens next is best left unspoiled, and “Mad Max: Fury Road” will benefit from first-time viewers going in knowing as little as possible. (What I just described elapses in the first ten minutes. Try not clicking on the trailer that appears below.) Suffice it to say that Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris know when to thrill us and when to let us breathe, how to introduce an entire society without losing sight of individual characters, and why hope might still exist even when all seems lost. Where “Fury Road” stands apart from so much of today’s action cinema is that the human element remains front and center; it’s one thing to watch an Avenger or one of the “Fast and Furious” drivers defy logic and gravity — not that that can’t be lots of fun — but there’s something more direct in watching people crawling on the outside of fast-moving vehicles, or worrying about getting plucked from same by one of the bad guys, that adds an additional, relatable frisson to each action sequence. Hardy has now appeared in both of the decade’s great road pictures, although his role here couldn’t be more different than last year’s “Locke”; that film had him taking phone calls from start to finish, whereas his tormented Max barely opens his mouth, with his profound silences never diminishing his screen presence, much in the same way that Miller so often generates thrills over what we can’t see as much as over what we can. Theron matches his performance throughout, creating an Amazonian warrior whose intensity is only increased when she makes a smoky eye reach all the way to her hairline. Theron and Hardy have one of the screen’s most powerful man-on-woman fights since “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” and at no moment does one ever think that Theron is at a disadvantage against this worthy opponent. (Despite the testosterone on display here, it’s girl power that fuels a great deal of “Fury Road,” with some indelible moments provided by a talented ensemble of actresses both young and more experienced. Going into more detail would mean revealing more of the plot.) There are visuals in “Mad Max: Fury Road” that won’t soon be forgotten, from the sight of a trussed-up Hardy attached to a car like a ship’s mast to the mother of all sandstorms to the heavy-metal guitarist and drummers that accompany the War Boys into battle to the secret of how the elites in Joe’s kingdom stay so well-fed. Miller redefined action cinema with “The Road Warrior,” and it’s no stretch to suggest that “Fury Road” ups the ante on what the genre might deliver in the future.",POSITIVE

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. “My name is Max, my world is fire and blood,” rumbles Tom Hardy’s voiceover (think Bane attempting RP) across a fearsome desertscape of blinding yellows and combustible oranges. A lizard scuttles over a boulder, the tippy-tap-tap of its talons amplified to a death-metal snare-solo that forewarns of the cacophonous percussive score to come. “It was hard to know who was more crazy,” rolls the vocal thunder. “Me, or everyone else.” In this thermonuclear world where water, oil and dialogue are at a premium, it’s like choosing between a shower with Norman Bates and supper with a tribe of Leatherfaces. Decades in the making, Mad Max: Fury Road (or Mad Max 4 as it was titled before 9/11, Mel Gibson’s meltdown and freak weather clamped its progress) finally emerges as a plot-light, action-heavy chase movie bulging with mad-as-a-frog-in-a-sock stunt work. Which is to say, exactly how you want it. OK, so the hi-def, Instagram-filtered lensing, Hollywood names and CG enhancements to blockbuster-budgeted in-camera pile-ups are far removed from the 1979 guerrilla revenge movie that introduced Max Rockatansky to the world. But then George Miller always wanted his carmageddon movies to bust out the Ozploitation ghetto and get right up in Hollywood’s grille: both sequels were distributed by Warner Bros, with The Road Warrior (1981) a landmark action movie, and Beyond Thunderdome (1985) watered down and camped up for mainstream consumption. Besides, this reboot retains all the brutality, antipodean humour and fertile imagination played out on arid vistas you could hope for. It is, in a word, crazy. In two, it's fucking crazy. Captured by scavengers, Max (Tom Hardy, stepping into Gibbo’s S&M boots) is taken to the mountain lair of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original), a gloriously nutzoid warlord with a white fright wig and horse-toothed muzzle. Soon after Max’s arrival, Imperator Furiosa (a bulked-up Charlize Theron with buzz cut and bionic arm) sets out in nitro-fuelled tanker the War Rig to fetch supplies from Gas Town. Only she’s really making a break east to the Green Place with five of Immortan Joe’s best ‘breeders’ (among them Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Riley Keough and Zoe Kravitz). Apoplectic, Immortan Joe sends his War Boys to hunt her down, these pallid, bald-headed crazies looking like an army of Nosferatu as they roar into the blistering desert in outlandish hot rods, all pipes and spikes. Among them is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), lips and sanity cracked, who screeches his desire to “die historic, on the Fury Road” as he straps Max to his grille like an oversized hood ornament. Such is the extent of returning director George Miller’s finely tuned carnage, the few pockets of silence are most deafening of all. Sometimes it’s a God’s-eye view (or would be, if God existed in this blasted world) of moving dots trailing spumes of smoke, sometimes it’s the escaped Max and Furiosa learning to trust one another between battles: shreds of hope and redemption swirl in the dust. Even then, dialogue is sparse, sentiment sparser still. Hardy’s Max feels less iconic than Gibson’s but fascinates as a wounded, feral animal; he has 20 lines throughout, and doesn’t need 18 of them. Theron is his match and more. The movie might have been called Mad Maxine and, in these days of prequels, sequels and spinoffs (there is already talk of two more films and a TV series), Furiosa is primed for action. Action is, naturally, the operative word. Here it speaks louder than words, with character established through deeds – said deeds conducted while hanging off the sides of barrelling vehicles amid a tornado of guns, arrows, harpoons, buzz saws, chainsaws and exploding spears. At one point the tornado is literal, a sandstorm soaring into the sky like a Lovecraftian beast. Inside its belly, automobiles spiral into the air as lightning pulses and bodies spin. It’s a remarkable set-piece but threatens to be topped later, in the mountains, as motorbikes hurdle the War Rig every which way, and later still, when another crazed collision of metal and flesh is made all the more demented by warriors pole-vaulting between vehicles. Miller, who storyboarded 3,000 images and hewed his movie from 480 hours of footage, captures it all in a ballistic ballet of tracks, dollies and zooms. There’s beauty to the violence (which is oddly bloodless, hence that 15 certificate), just as there’s beauty to the desert plains and undulating dunes, the quagmires and salt lakes. In the battle of the 2015 behemoths, the maxed-out madness of Mad Max: Fury Road sets an extraordinarily high bar – then pole-vaults clean over it and smashes the entire rig to smithereens.

"May 11, 2015"," Before venturing down Fury Road, George Miller’s wildly entertaining reincarnation of his post-apocalyptic Oz, it’s worth reacquainting yourself with his previous Mad Max films. Not necessarily because they are landmarks in the art of slamming vehicle into vehicle at extreme velocities, automotive carnage that has inspired everyone from James Cameron to Edgar Wright. Even the Mel Gibson-on-wires capers of the under-appreciated Beyond Thunderdome possess a giddy, violent power. No, it’s worthwhile returning to Mad Max’s high-octane futurology to remind yourself that this is one bat-shit crazy franchise. All these goofy, psychotic tribes outfitted like thrash-metal gladiators battling over the last dregs of petrol in jerry-built hot-rods. The brand name refers not only to its tortured hero — it is a statement of intent. And now, with $150 million-plus change at his disposal and the devil’s gleam in his eye, Miller has surely achieved maximum madness. Over the three decades since Beyond Thunderdome, the versatile Aussie hasn’t written a script so much as drawn-up battle plans. Like Mad Max 2, Fury Road is structured as one brilliantly sustained chase sequence in warped homage to Stagecoach. Over the varying terrain of this post-nuke Monument Valley, a heavily armoured tanker dubbed the War Rig, piloted by the unfortunate Max (Tom Hardy) and turncoat imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), staves off wave upon wave of hair-brained attacks from the War Boys, a local chapter of mutant wackos giving chase in a swarm of beefed-up chariots. It is not petrol that’s at stake, but a harem of five gorgeous if gobby brides stolen from beneath the nose of premier deviant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in Mad Max) — a bleach-skinned grotesque doing the majority of his raging via his eyeballs, given the oxygen mask clamped to his jaw like Bane’s maniac progeny. Miller really gets into his tribal culture. The War Boys have concocted a proto-civilisation-cum-cult inside towering rock formations called the Citadel. Radiation has taken its toll: the speed freaks are as pale as zombies, hairless and slack-brained enough to buy Joe’s Viking-styled baloney about a Valhalla to come. There is a lot of chanting. Again names double as character traits: Rictus Erectus, People Eater, Organic Mechanic, The Dag. Such a shame that Vin Diesel was already been taken. The baldies subdivide into Drivers, Spikers (spearmen) and the Polecats, who swing heart-stoppingly between muscle cars at the end of elongated poles (for real). Miller likes it gross: obese women are farmed for breast milk, and Max serves as a mobile blood bank for Nicholas Hoult’s Nux, a winningly hell-bent driver suffering from radioactive debilitation. In a fetching detail, the twin tumours bulging from his clavicle have been tattooed with smiley faces. There may not be a Bruce Spence or Angry Anderson cameo, but Miller’s desert nightmare is unmistakable. Joe’s lair resembles a former thunderdome and he has Tina Turner’s hair. Less haunted than bombarded by prescribed visions of a dead daughter, Hardy’s Max cuts an even more enigmatic figure than Gibson’s muttering Robin Hood. On the rare occasion Hardy gets a line, he speaks in a weird, sub-woofer-deep monotone as if from beyond the grave. Once Furiosa’s War Rig begins guzzling down the desert highway into the Wasteland, there is barely time to contemplate logic or motivation, or frankly the inclination. The film exists in a permanent state of crisis. Why has Furiosa rescued the brides? How has she smuggled them out? It doesn't matter: the wide shot of girls clad in bridal togs clinging to the underside of a tanker tells you they are illicit cargo. Why does Max get enlisted? He can’t help himself — he’s Max. The mutual reliance of Furiosa and Max is never declared: it’s that or they succumb to the meatheads. The excellent Theron’s highly capable and aptly named heroine is the more engaging of the two leads. She’s more human, more desperate. The brides too make for a gaggle of amusingly grouchy individuals, determined not to be breeding stock. You could say there is a crackers feminist subtext at work — it's the women who are trying to set mankind back on track, the men who have mutant blood. Inevitably the leanness of the early films has been lost, but without question Fury Road remains the work of a visionary. Miller has put all the money, all the perverse and poetic flights of his imagination, on the screen. The scope is more operatic, the attitude still punk rock. It’s almost as if a petrol-head David Lynch has been given license to despoil the homogenised blueprint of the modern blockbuster. Racing into a gigantic, surreal sandstorm, the pursuit is assaulted by forks of lightning, tornadoes and scarlet fireballs, an echo of the nuclear holocaust that has left the world mad. Fury Road is a defiantly, at times deliriously, cinematic experience. Utilising 3,500 storyboards, 480 hours of raw footage, multiple frame rates, handhelds, swooping cranes, crash zooms, a blithe disregard for the personal safety of a garrison of stuntmen and the tangible bulk of real metal being hurled about at ridiculous speeds, he has created a symphony of destruction. I-Max will melt your brain.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," Thirty years have passed since our last visit to George Miller’s sun-scorched post-apocalyptic wasteland, and yet “worth the wait” still seems a puny response to the two hours of ferocious, unfettered B-movie bliss offered by “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The sort of exhilarating gonzo entertainment that makes even the nuttier “Fast and Furious” movies look like Autopia test drives, this expertly souped-up return to Max Rockatansky’s world of “fire and blood” finds Tom Hardy confidently donning Mel Gibson’s well-worn leather chaps. Still, the tersely magnetic British star turns out to be less of a revelation than his glowering co-lead, Charlize Theron, decisively claiming her place (with apologies to Tina Turner) as the most indelible female presence in this gas-guzzling, testosterone-fueled universe. It remains to be seen whether Theron will boost distaff turnout for Warner Bros.’ heavily marketed May 15 release, but either way, word-of-mouth excitement over the film’s beautifully brutal action sequences should lend it tremendous commercial velocity through the summer and beyond. Miller may be better known of late for directing the (ostensibly) younger-skewing likes of “Babe: Pig in the City” (1998) and the two “Happy Feet” musicals, but for the many who have longed for him to return to his down-and-dirty Ozploitation roots, “Fury Road” will seem nothing less than the fulfillment of a dream — not least the writer-director’s own. To describe the production as long-gestating doesn’t do justice to the sheer litany of setbacks, delays, overhauls, recastings and budget inflations that have plagued the picture since Miller first envisioned it years ago, when it might still have been plausible for Gibson to reprise the role that made him a star. Suffice to say that for all the obstacles the writer-director and his collaborators endured in the interim, the finished film feels entirely of a piece with its three predecessors, never mind that the combined costs of the latter are dwarfed by “Fury Road’s” budget (reportedly well over $150 million). We are, admittedly, a long way from the lean, unnerving outback fable of “Mad Max” (1979), and an even longer way from the weirdly arresting, kid-friendly detours of “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” (1985). Vastly more complex on a technical scale but simpler on a conceptual one, “Fury Road” is, for all intents and purposes, a two-hour car chase interrupted by a brief stretch of anxious downtime, and realized with the sort of deranged grandiosity that confirms Miller’s franchise has entered its decadent phase. All the more remarkable, then, that the movie still manages to retain its focus, achieving at once a shrewd distillation and a ferocious acceleration of its predecessors’ sensibility. There is gargantuan excess here, to be sure — and no shortage of madness — but there is also an astonishing level of discipline. Wisely, Miller and his co-writers (the comicbook artist Brendan McCarthy and original “Mad Max” actor Nico Lathouris) seem to have taken their cues from the spare yet sturdy narrative architecture of the series’ acknowledged high point, “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” (1981), whose influence can be felt even in the new film’s bare-bones prologue. Years after some unexplained cataclysm, the world has fallen into lawless disarray, as Hardy’s Max briefly explains while being pursued across a landscape of hot orange dunes and endless horizons (the Namibian desert stood in for Australia this time around). The chase soon ends with our hero captured, imprisoned and tortured in the Citadel, a desert stronghold ruled by a despotic warlord known as the Immortan (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has enslaved what remains of the local populace by exercising miserly control over the water supply (inadvertently bearing out Keegan-Michael Key’s California-drought joke at the recent White House Correspondents’ Dinner). Fans will remember (if not necessarily recognize) the Australian character actor Keays-Byrne as having played the Toecutter in the original “Mad Max,” and his appearance here suggests a hideous, heavy-set reincarnation of that earlier villain, complete with snaggle-toothed face mask and kinky breathing apparatus. His male soldiers, or “war boys,” show their respect for their leader by sharing his gloriously awful fashion sense — their torsos branded and bared, covered in white body paint, and blinged out with shrunken-head necklaces and other demonic accouterments. The film’s first half-hour alone is a marvel of freakshow aesthetics: Blood banks and breast pumps are among the Immortan’s more imaginative means of controlling and sustaining his people, while skulls figure prominently in Colin Gibson’s elaborately grotesque production design and Jenny Beavan’s richly imagined costumes, which are at once outlandish and pinpoint-precise. Setting the plot in motion — and lending the film the swift, steady undercurrent of rage suggested by its title — are the five beautiful young women the Immortan has taken as his “wives” (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton), whom he keeps locked away and forces to bear his children. Their defender and rescuer is Imperator Furiosa (Theron), a formidable warrior with a mechanical left arm, who is tasked with replenishing the Citadel’s fuel reserves at nearby Gastown; she seizes the opportunity to smuggle the women out of the stronghold in a massive armored truck. When the Immortan sends his war boys after them, with Max himself lashed (temporarily, at least) to the front of a minion’s car, the proceedings kick into high gear. As evidenced by everything from the original “Mad Max” trilogy to “Babe: Pig in the City,” Miller is a wizardly orchestrator of onscreen mayhem, and in the two lengthy chase sequences that bookend “Fury Road,” he ascends to that rare level of action-movie nirvana where a filmmaker’s sheer exuberance in every detail becomes one with the audience’s pleasure. Everything we see here seems to have sprung fully formed from the same cheerfully demented imagination — whether it’s the cars that look like overgrown porcupines on wheels, the poles that catapult the war boys from one vehicle to the next, or the fiery windstorm that sets in mid-chase, making short work of some of the less well-armored participants. Adding yet another frisson of excitement (as well as a hint of anti-terrorist subtext) is the fact that the war boys aren’t just killers but fanatics, brainwashed into believing eternal paradise awaits them if they die in battle. This may explain their devil-may-care habit of crawling over and under their vehicles while they’re in motion, like kids navigating a jungle gym at 150 miles per hour. Miller conjures a vibe somewhere between monster truck rally in hell and Burning Man death-metal concert — as signaled by the very funny inclusion of a rocker whose fire-breathing electric guitar seems to be at least one source of the pummeling, wall-to-wall score (by the Dutch musician Junkie XL, who recently scored “Run All Night” and “Divergent”). The magnificence of the below-the-line contributions can hardly be overstated, particularly the outrageously acrobatic fight choreography and the seamless visual-effects work, all lensed by d.p. John Seale in dynamic, enveloping widescreen images. If it sounds interminable — and for viewers not on the film’s specific wavelength, even a minute of this stuff will be hard to take — rest assured that Miller proves himself a maestro not only when he’s slamming huge metal objects together, but also when attending to such subtler matters as pacing and modulation (with the invaluable assistance of his editor and wife, Margaret Sixel). Notably, our engagement doesn’t wane even when “Fury Road” downshifts into an interlude of tense, close-quarters intimacy, as Max, lone road warrior that he is, must reluctantly endure the company of Furiosa and her five comely refugees. The feminist undercurrents rippling through this movie are by turns sincere, calculated and teasingly tongue-in-cheek: Our first good glimpse of the wives, clad in skimpy white rags and gathered around a water spout, plays like a vision out of “Girls Gone Wild: Coed Car Wash.” Even when they join in the fight, it can be hard to tell where erotic fantasy ends and empowerment fantasy begins, which is very much in keeping with the film’s unapologetically grindhouse attitude. Yet if “Fury Road” doesn’t deliver as pure a hit of girl-power retribution as say, Quentin Tarantino’s “Death Proof,” it’s hard not to respect the dramatic stature with which Miller elevates his female characters; Huntington-Whiteley and Kravitz, in particular, embody the sort of quiet defiance that ensures these women, though victimized, are never reduced to mere victims. “You know hope is a mistake,” Max warns Furiosa late in the game. But even as it plunges us back into a vividly familiar realm of nihilism and despair, “Mad Max: Fury Road” never feels even remotely cynical — or exploitative. There’s nothing but tenderness in the fiercely protective manner with which Furiosa and the five wives regard one another, or in the key supporting role of Nux (a wonderful Nicholas Hoult), an eagerly aggressive young war boy whose dramatic shift in perspective takes the story in an unexpectedly poignant, and romantic, direction. As for Max himself, he remains a thin, tenuous figure at best — less a fleshed-out character than an avatar of revenge and survival — which is precisely what has made him such a durably iconic creation over the years. Mad Max 2.0 comes saddled with a slightly different tragic origin story, referenced in quick, hallucinatory memory blips involving a young girl (Coco Jack Gillies), but we accept Hardy in the role instinctively — aided by the cruel iron mask that obscures much of his face until the movie’s midpoint, but also by the actor’s taciturn charisma. Still, there’s no denying that Miller and his collaborators have subtly conspired to put our hero in the passenger seat of his own reboot, while deftly ceding the wheel to Theron’s Furiosa, and the characters’ rapport is as physically electrifying as it is emotionally charged. Tellingly, plans are reportedly in the works for a “Fury Road” sequel called “Mad Max: Furiosa,” raising the expectation — perhaps unreasonable, on the strength of Miller’s powerhouse movie — that this duo’s finest hour may yet be ahead of them.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," Thirty years after surviving Thunderdome, the reluctant warrior of modern movies’ first and most memorable postapocalyptic action-fantasy series is finally back and ready for more in Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller has directed only five films in that time — three of which starred pigs and penguins — but it can safely be said that this madly entertaining new action extravaganza energetically kicks more ass, as well as all other parts of the anatomy, than any film ever made by a 70-year-old — and does so far more skillfully than those turned out by most young turks half his age. Although the earlier entries were made before the target audience for this one was even born (its new leading man was just a baby when the first one was released), Mad Max has lingered in the zeitgeist through the years, and a fair portion of the international public that has just wound down from Furious 7 will be happy to suck in the fumes from this equally action-packed and infinitely superior film. One could plausibly observe that Fury Road is basically The Road Warrior on a new generation of steroids, and no doubt some critics will leave it at that; like the second and best film in the series, this one is mostly devoted to maniacal anarchic goons chasing Max and his small group of rebels across a scenically parched desert and leaving some spectacularly destroyed vehicles in their dust. The new film certainly boasts a higher percentage of flat-out amazing action than any of its predecessors, and that’s probably enough said for most of its potential audience. Perhaps the long gestation period served it well. While very similar to its predecessors in almost every way, the film has devilishness in its details: the tribal-style makeup, the endlessly inventive vehicles and armaments, the wild costumes and facial adornments, radiantly scorched locations that resemble — and yet go beyond — the series’ previous wasteland evocations, and a society equally lawless but more entrenched than those seen in earlier films (one that is, in fact, presided over by the same imposing actor who played the chief bad guy in the original Mad Max in 1979). And then there’s the new leading actor, Tom Hardy, who’s so ideal a replacement for Mel Gibson that one wouldn’t want to imagine anyone else having taken over the role. Rewatching the initial two installments today, it’s striking to see how little Max Rockatansky (whose name is uttered just once, in the first film) actually does during long stretches of them, and so it is here; at the outset he’s captured by soldiers of the Citadel and detained in a rocky hellhole where thousands of wailing captives perform slave labor while awaiting small rations of precious water dispensed by their tyrannical captor from his looming cliffside headquarters. When the time comes to hit the road, Max, his face confined behind a trident-like mask, is strapped like a grille ornament on the front of a marauding car, a predicament he is not expected to survive. But emerge from it he does, of course, and slowly the man behind the victim emerges — first to exciting, then to ultimately touching effect in the final scene. It’s as if Hardy was cast for his brawn, but ultimately used for his soul. Except for its mechanized details, the heavy chains, pulleys and steam-punk/heavy metal aspects of which lend a certain 19th century feel, the world on display here is straight out of dire early biblical times. Presiding over the Citadel is the fearsome Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, the nasty Toecutter in Mad Max), who has grotesque offspring, sports flowing gray locks and wears a toothsome facemask fed by large oxygen tubes. The slaves are covered in ashen white powder and live in a state of starvation and terror enforced by violent punks known as War Boys. The story cooked up by Miller and co-screenwriters Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is no more complex than this: Entrusted by Immortan Joe with driving the large War Rig truck across the desert to an oil-producing outpost, tough ruling-class babe Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, with close-cropped hair and raccoon eyes) instead diverts it across the desert with an illicit cargo — Immortan’s harem of breeding wives, who have memorable names such as Capable, Cheedo the Fragile and, best of all, Toast the Knowing. When first glimpsed, they look like a bunch of supermodels strewn across the desert for an exotic fashion shoot, although one of them, the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a real-life supermodel), is soon due to give birth. The first two Max features ran barely 90 minutes, and it takes guts and real confidence to dare push a straight chase film with very little dialogue to two hours. But Miller has pulled it off by coming up with innumerable new elements to keep the action compelling: the pitiless mindset of a brutish society; bending poles sticking up from vehicles that allow marauders atop them to be lowered into enemy trucks for hand-to-hand combat; an insane heavy metal guitarist affixed to one of the Citadel’s rigs, whose raucous wailing and flame-throwing ability perfectly express this world’s extremity; and a central woman, missing one arm, who’s as tough-minded as any man but also retains a special link to a remote society of women she intends to find. During the first extended, high-speed, jaw-dropping chase of Furiosa by the goon squad, which only ends when it’s engulfed by an enormous desert dust storm, Max remains frustrated by the chain linking him to his tormentors’ rig. But developing any trust with Furiosa takes considerably longer; she wants to kill him immediately and be done with it. They are, it would seem, potential soul mates, but the world they inhabit is not exactly conducive to developing trust, much less anything of a more amorous nature. Life is, in this world, not only cheap but almost assuredly very short. If one wanted to map out a chronology of Max’s life and adventures, it would no longer make any sense in terms of the man’s age, nor does it matter at all. Miller recently absolved himself of any need to somehow explain the character’s newfound youthfulness by comparing him to James Bond; Max just goes on and on, with perennial access to rejuvenation via new actors. The difference between this and Bond and many other such durable series is that it’s so palpably the product of one man’s imagination, a man who also possesses the skill, discipline and energy to put it all up on the screen so convincingly. Mad Max films are known for the moments when the cars’ superchargers are engaged for surges of speed, and it’s clear that Miller’s personal superchargers are in excellent working order. The colors are bold, the Namibia locations look like Arizona on steroids, virtually all the action looks real (thoughts of CGI only intrude with the massive dust clouds and certain personal and vehicular wipeouts), cinematographer John Seale’s cameras are everywhere they need to be to record the action maximally, and Junkie XL’s score hammers and soars. Second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris clearly deserves major credit for delivering much of what’s most eye-popping onscreen, and the film never sits still for more than a moment or two. Miller originally spoke of filming a sequel called Furiosa back-to-back with this one, so presumably he has material more or less ready to go, and Hardy has claimed he’s signed for three more installments. In other words, the world may not have heard the last of Mad Max.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," That adjective in the title is accurate. Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert. There are what seem to be dozens of huge rigs and chunky 18-wheelers driven by large, cross men with long hair and bad teeth, or no hair and no teeth, their rides pimped out with skulls and other badass accessories. Some of these assault vehicles have permanent armies of drummers on board, thumping belligerently and rhythmically away, creating the kind of scary and upsetting noise usually only heard on the streets of the Edinburgh festival. With a similar view to terrifying the enemy, one truck has a lead guitarist perched on the hood with a stack of amplifiers, thrashing out what might be a continuous Slipknot medley. Using a recording won’t do – these people believe in keeping their aggressive music live. And when the vehicles crash, they don’t do any forward-facing twirl though the air the way they used to do back in the 1970s: now it’s the customary rear axle lurch-up for a giant somersault and juddering crash that took the fillings out of my teeth. It’s like Grand Theft Auto revamped by Hieronymus Bosch, with a dab of Robert Rodríguez’s From Dusk Till Dawn. Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky himself, the former interceptor lawman and petrolhead of the original movies, driven to extreme measures by the murder of his wife and child. This film does not appear to run sequentially from the previous trilogy; it’s more a general reimagining of the first, or the overall raddled mood-scape of all three. Max is here a lone wolf, a survivor of the vaguely delineated global catastrophe that has made oil, water and bullets rare commodities thereabouts, and he is tormented by flashback memories of the child he couldn’t save. He is captured by the hateful chieftain Immortan Joe (played by Mad Max veteran Hugh Keays-Byrne) and taken to his grotesque stronghold, the Citadel, where Joe warlords it over an oppressed semi-bestial populace by controlling the water supply and bizarrely supplementing their fluid intake with industrial quantities of mother’s milk, farmed from imprisoned pregnant women. Max is fated to escape with another rebel: the one-armed Imperator Furiosa, played with glittery-eyed panache by Charlize Theron, whose job was to lead raids, stealing gasoline, ammo and other commodities. Once captured like Max, and turned into a gladiatorial warrior in Joe’s service, Furiosa is now furious at his patriarchal tyranny; she is escaping, taking with her an improbable phalanx of scantily clothed young women, the “breeders” the warlord wishes to make the mothers of his children (they look as if they are heading for an edgy Australian Vogue photoshoot). Max and Furiosa are heading for a spectacular showdown with their oppressor, and must also deal with Joe’s mercurial, shaven-headed footsoldier Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. It really is a strange film. As Max, the craggy but full-lipped Tom Hardy doesn’t look anything like Mel Gibson. It is Theron – or possibly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, playing a sultry breeder called Splendid – who is channelling the eerily beautiful Gibson from 1979, except that probably neither is pretty enough. Mad Max: Fury Road is almost a silent film in its way. Dialogue is at a minimum, and when Max says anything it is usually preceded by an eccentric rumbling, mumbling mmmm sound, like a macho Mr Bean. He is impassive, to say the least: the nearest Tom Hardy’s Max comes to an emotional outburst is when Splendid does something very brave while hanging on to the side of the truck. Max gives her a little smile and boyish thumbs-up. It’s the Mad Max equivalent of hugging her and declaiming: “Darling, your courage is magnificent.” And when Nux wishes to express defiance or euphoria, he sprays his mouth with silver-grey paint, to make his face look even more like a skull. That is pretty dysfunctional. At certain key moments, people’s body movements, especially Max’s, slightly speed up, giving the film a kind of dreamlike horror effect, which further colours the occasionally Dalí-esque strangeness of these feral militia on the landscape. Everything looks churned and charred: the heat and desert have turned everyone mad, like Max. As someone says: “Do not become addicted to water; it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence.” It could be a poster tagline for this entirely demented film.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015",Every shot is (and I summon this word from deep within my inner 13-year-old boy) awesome.,POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," I've written about this one quite a bit, so I may repeat myself a little. Nonetheless, I want to make this brief so as to get to the review. Mad Max: Fury Road is a project fifteen years in the making. It comes to us now via Warner Bros. /

Time Warner
. Writer/director George Miller has been trying to get this thing made since the early 2000's, with various delays and setbacks undercutting the efforts. In the meantime, Mr. Miller directed two Happy Feet films (winning a Best Animated Feature Oscar for the first one in 2007) and very nearly getting a Justice League movie off the ground way back in 2007. But this current incarnation has been in development since 2009, with Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson and Charlize Theron signing on as the co-lead back in 2011. The film shot in mid-2012 with reshoots taking place in late 2013. The making of Mad Max: Fury Road could make up a great book or documentary, but come-what-may, the long-awaited fourth Mad Max movie has arrived. The question now is whether anyone beyond the hardcore fan base is interested. It's been thirty years since the last Mad Max movie. While the franchise has remained vaguely popular or at least somewhat remembered, it's not something that is obsessed about and/or passed down from generation to generation like the Die Hard films or the Indiana Jones saga. I can only wonder if today's younger audiences have any frame-of-reference to the old franchise beyond ""those desert racing movies with that guy our parents speak about in hushed tones."" Of course, to Warner Bros.' credit, the vast majority of their marketing has been skewed towards those without any nostalgic memories of the original films. The marketing, like the film itself, is relatively self-sustaining and doesn't require knowledge of The Road Warrior or the other Mad Max movies. It remains to be seen whether or not the trailers and TV spots, which show off the film's vehicular stunt work and related eye candy, have sold the film to general moviegoers who just want to watch a spectacular looking R-rated action movie set in a post-apocalyptic desert starring Charlize Theron and that guy from The Dark Knight Rises. Village Roadshow, Rat Pac Entertainment, and friends have $150 million riding on the answer to that question. Unofficial tracking puts the opening weekend at around $40 million, which would be fine if audiences respond to the film's quality and give it something resembling legs. Pitch Perfect 2 won't help, as it's tough to make waves as a feminist action movie (which this is) when your competition is the female franchise movie event of the summer. I would like to be optimistic and presume that the film's high-quality trailers, which played with the likes of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, American Sniper, Furious 7, and Avengers: Age of Ultron will make the sell to the general moviegoer while the rave reviews will seal the deal. I'd like to think the reviews could boost that opening above projections, but that's a dangerous game to play. Of course, Warner is banking on overseas box office too, and the $414m worldwide success of 
Fox
’s Kingsman: The Secret Service has to be heartening. Come what may, Mad Max: Fury Road is here, it's spectacular, and I hope it makes enough money to justify the investment. Having said that, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if this were merely a one-and-done affair. Pundits and critics like to blame the twin successes of Jaws and Star Wars for turning Hollywood into something of a blockbuster factory. We can debate the merits of said accusation, but for me it comes down to one simple factor: If every would-be blockbuster, or even most would-be blockbusters were as good as Jaws and/or Star Wars, I imagine most of us wouldn't be complaining nearly as much. That brings us to George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. It is a revamp/reboot/sequel for a 30-year old franchise, directed by the original helmer who hasn't been culturally relevant in decades, featuring a new and somewhat flavor-of-the-month actor, and seemingly only existing because of the fact that the property is vaguely known and thus has a token amount of built-in awareness. If  you think that sounds like the kind of thing I complain about rather regularly, you'd be correct. Yet, Mad Max: Fury Road is an awesome motion picture. It's the best movie of the year thus far, and I can only presume will end the season as the summer's best would-be blockbuster. Point being, if more franchise rebirths were anywhere near this good I'd stop complaining. It may be rooted partially in nostalgia, but good lord does it artistically justify itself in every one of its spellbinding 110 minutes. The plot is pretty simple: Max (Tom Hardy) unwittingly ends up helping Furiosa (Charlize Theron) transport several female “breeders” (unwilling sex slaves/baby vessels) away from captivity and towards a would-be utopian promised land. You may have heard that this George Miller sequel is one feature-length chase scene, and that's mostly accurate. Yes, there are moments of plot and character development, and the long chase is broken up into three acts, but the film is indeed a near non-stop barrage of eye-popping action and gloriously impressive stunt work. I presume most of the stunts and crashes were accomplished practically. I don't know how much of the action is wholly practical and how much of it was achieved or at least enhanced with digital wizardry. So let me compliment both sides of the equation by stating that I believed my eyes for every single jaw-dropping moment. The only unbelievable part is that no one was seriously hurt or killed during the making of this picture. I cannot overstate the quality of the mayhem we see onscreen, both in terms of the vehicular carnage and how much each crash and near miss matters in terms of the story being told. There are real artistry and poetry to the onscreen chaos. The first act of the film is where most of the money shots from the trailer come from, and we are clued in quickly to something rather shocking: Max isn't the main character. Oh sure he's there in one form or another for the duration of the picture, but the primary action figure is Ms. Theron. Even when Max goes from a bystander to an aggressive participant, the focus remains on Theron's would-be rescuer, and all of her charges are given agency and sympathy. You may have heard that George Miller brought in Vagina Monologues author Eve Ensler to consult on the film and wow does it show. Fury Road is not a film that just uses the notion of human sex slavery for topical seasoning and/or an excuse to show quivering young girls half-naked in shipping containers or cages. It is very much about the notion of a world that has ditched most of the remnants of so-called civilized society yet has kept the patriarchal system that keeps women under the thumb of arbitrarily designated male rulers and consigns them to be no more than (often unwilling) breeders.  If you've read me for any length of time, you've heard me whine about the quantity and quality of female characters in mainstream motion pictures. Mad Max: Fury Road is everything I say I want. There are memorable male and female characters, and their respective personalities and desires are varied. Nicholas Hoult has a surprisingly compelling arc even as he spends the first half as the equitant of Swiper the Fox. Some of the women are victims, some are heroes, and some are merely trying to survive. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has an iconic moment that is both empowering and heartbreaking as she uses her exposed pregnant belly as a human shield, knowing that the reason for her captivity is also the only thing that will theoretically keep her alive. There is a third act story turn that sets the stage for the finale that will likely be discussed at length elsewhere, but I'm keeping it to myself for the moment.  It gives the film's extended climax an unexpected visceral and emotional kick. Suffice to say, this is not remotely a story about a strong male hero selflessly rescuing helpless damsels from male aggressors. Without going into details, there are moments where a female character does something or something is done to them that might have made me roll my eyes if they were the only female character in the film. One of the bonuses of having many female characters is being able to provide a variety of characterizations and presenting male and female characters that are equally shaded and flawed. That this is a wholly feminist movie goes without saying, and that's the icing on the cake, along with the fact that it works as an emotionally engaging movie, that makes it something more than the world's greatest sizzle reel. Through it all is Charlize Theron as one of the more interesting female action heroes we’ve seen in awhile. It is through her journey and her triumphs and tragedies that the film’s focus comes into view, and it is another bravura turn from one of our more interesting actresses. Tom Hardy makes a perfectly acceptable substitute for Mel Gibson. It is to his credit that he is willing to play basically a supporting character in a film with his name in the title. If it needs to be said, the film’s technical specs are superb. Cinematographer John Seale came out of retirement to shoot this picture, and if he decides to stay active he is going to be very in-demand after this one. Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel should darn well score Oscar nominations for their editing work here, offering countless cuts that enhance the coherence of the action rather than take away from it. Miller’s film is pure old-school action filmmaking, the kind where you can clearly see each beat and the kind where the geography and logic are never in doubt. And there are any number of crowdpleasing flourishes mixed in with the carnage, such as a single brightly-colored guitar player riding atop a truck and occasionally punctuating the story. Lord help me, but I was reminded of the red-coated girl in Schindler’s List, as he is a weirdly optimistic entertainer in a grim and dirty world of subsistence. I have said enough, and I have no desire to spoil the surprises or detail the many individual triumphs contained in Mad Max: Fury Road. Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable and glorious motion picture, not just one of the great action movies of our time but also a great film, period. There is an old Detective Comics story where an imprisoned Joker helps Batman rescue a kidnapped child and save her life. When Batman asks why The Joker would do such a charity, he replies that it was to give Batman a new twinge of presumably false hope for each time he would encounter a similar situation in the future. As a general rule, I walk into films like Robocop or Teenage Mutant Ninjas Turtles hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Mad Max: Fury Road represents my false hope from here on out. On paper it looks like everything I complain about, and yet it is an unmitigated masterpiece. And if every past-its-prime franchise extension and nostalgia-fueled reboot were anywhere near as good as Mad Max: Fury Road, we’d have little about which to complain.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," In a cinematic world filled with redundant and unnecessary sequels, Mad Max is one of the rare older series that actually deserves further exploration and expansion. Writer/director George Miller built a stunning, unique and rich world with his original trilogy of films, and because each sequel operates more as a “Tales From The Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland” instead of a subsequent chapter, there exists fantastic potential to keep telling those stories, forever. It was this thinking that got Miller to put together Mad Max: Fury Road, and we should be thankful because it is as crazy, thrilling, gorgeous, and awesome as anyone could really hope, and guaranteed to be one of the best big-screen spectacles of the year. Bringing us back to the death-covered world of the desert, where people bleed for water and gasoline, the new legend takes folk hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and this time puts him on a collision course with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a one-armed rebel on the run with an immensely valuable package. For years, she has served under a monstrous tyrannical cult leader called Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), but when she finds opportunity to escape, she takes it – and brings along with her Joe’s imprisoned prized “breeders” (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Megan Gale, Abbey Lee). An escaped prisoner of Joe’s, and in need of an exit strategy himself, Max teams with the women on their journey to a “Promise Land” known as The Green Place. With three war parties on their tails, what follows is an epic, wild pursuit across the wasteland that’s as dramatic and exhilarating as it is spectacular and beautiful. Mad Max: Fury Road is a chase film by the most literal of definitions, launching into the action just mere moments after the studio logo screens, and though it may sound exhausting, the film actually manages to maintain an incredible level of energy straight through to the end credits. This works not just because Miller packs the feature with a wide array of jaw-dropping, explosive-filled action sequences, but because of the gripping, dense atmosphere that the movie creates. The story never goes too long without giving us insight as to what’s happening on the antagonist’s side of things, and they’re constantly presented as a looming force right on our heroes’ heels – pushing them forward. This isn’t to say that Fury Road doesn’t have its more deliberate moments where we get to see characters, dynamics and deeper themes of hope, fear and retribution explored. But the story sucks you into its world in a way that gives the plot great urgency, flow and pressure at all times in the narrative. You know what also tends to add a good dose of urgency into a chase film? When those doing the chasing are absolutely terrifying. Taking the post-apocalyptic look of The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome up 10-15 notches, Mad Max: Fury Road’s villains are decked out in all kinds of crazy-yet-weirdly-practical costumes and makeup, helping us perfectly understand why Max, Furiosa and the women can’t get away fast enough. The appearance of Immortan Joe is art all by itself – with Keays-Byrne looking absolutely monstrous wearing a fang-filled breathing apparatus and white gladiator armor to match his deathly pale skin – but really, his entire army of skeleton-painted cult followers will send a shiver down your spine (including Nicholas Hoult as Nux, a devout follower of Joe’s who winds up being manacled to the titular hero). And even though you kind of want to giggle at the electric guitarist who is strung up like a marionette amongst the war drummers, even he is wearing a frightening mask and has an instrument that doubles as a flamethrower. Of course, the “mad” look doesn’t just stop with the antagonist forces, as the artistic aesthetic touches every costume and bit of production design, from the Volkswagen Beetles fused to the top of Furiosa’s rig as defense stations, to the mask made out of a garden hoe that Max is forced to wear in captivity. With a shaved head, war paint, and effectively-used metal arm, Furiosa is a bound-to-be-iconic vision for a hero of the apocalypse, and the contrast that exists between the beauty of the innocent women she rescues and the ugliness of the world around them is truly wonderful. A movie as crazy as Mad Max: Fury Road very much needs a cast that will commit to its over-the-top world as well, and George Miller has put together a phenomenal ensemble. Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky is a bit more on the strong, stoic side than Mel Gibson’s was, blatantly scarred by what the world has done to him. This only serves to shine more of a light on Furiosa, who is fueled by Charlize Theron-provided gravitas and a powerful performance. Nicholas Hoult is a tremendous surprise as Nux, given a fantastic arc relating to the characters’ connection to Immortan Joe that he plays to full emotional effect. And even though they’re grouped together for the entire film, George Miller does give Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Megan Gale, and Abbey Lee’s characters each individual personalities and places in the story. Mad Max: Fury Road is a special film. It’s bombastically entertaining and action packed, but it doesn’t disregard emotion and story; and it’s a fitting follow-up that will make lovers of the Road Warrior giddy. But it’s also entirely accessible to those who have never even heard of the Mel Gibson-starring films. It’s a tremendous cinematic experience courtesy of George Miller, and a must-see.

"May 11, 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is 120 minutes of non-stop, blood-pumping action unlike anything that has been released in some time. From the opening scene the action begins and it never lets up until the credits roll. That is far from an exaggeration. Thirty years after Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Fury Road picks up where it left off, in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by politics, murder and redemption. Tom Hardy takes over for Mel Gibson in the role of Max who is on a mission of revenge for his lost family. Hardy’s co-star is Charlize Theron, who proves her outstanding range as Imperator Furiosa, a fierce warrior seeking exactly what Max is – a way out of Hell. There isn’t any reason to spend more time explaining the plot because that is not what this movie spends much time on. The film’s opening scene shows Hardy slam his foot on the pedal, his car and the film never let up off the accelerator. Hardy’s performance is one of the most interesting elements of the film. Hardy doesn’t play Max as a cool, suave hero as you may expect. Instead he is awkward, erratic and it seems as if he maybe has thirty lines of dialogue in the entire film. But Hardy is one of the greatest physical actors working today as evident in films such as The Dark Knight Rises, The Drop, and Warrior. Hardy does so much without saying a word, and he brings a character, who could easily have been  one-dimensional, so much complexity. Theron is great as usual, playing a character unlike any she has played before. She kicks just as much ass as Hardy and is a joy to watch. Nicholas Hoult is one of the biggest surprises of the film as the most complicated, interesting character in the movie, Nux. And the supporting cast featuring Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Hugh Keays-Byrne are all solid. From the first frame of the film the audience can’t help but smile in enjoyment of the visuals, sound and the blistering pace of the film. It truly is a roller coaster ride of a film. The action is unbelievable, the effects are incredible, and the world created by director George Miller is mesmerizing. Mad Max: Fury Road is everything you could ask for from a summer movie and more. Not since 300 has there been a movie more heavy metal, as beautiful and insane as this.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015"," Watching modern studio movies today, often I find myself thinking, “Boy, there’s a lot of plot in this movie.” These thoughts often come during movies that I enjoy, like either of the Avengers movies. There’s a lot of plot in most movies, but I don’t remember everything always being so convoluted. Look at a movie that everyone loves, like The Empire Strikes Back: The plot of that movie is basically, “We need to leave where we are and try to get somewhere else,” but because everything else is so riveting along the way, it doesn’t matter. Adding more convoluted plot just seems like a way to cover the fact that there’s not much else going on. Mad Max: Fury Road has one of the most straightforward plots in a studio movie that I’ve seen in a long time. Basically, our characters drive a long way in one direction, then they decide to go back the way they came. That’s it. (My dumb joke is, being that the third Hobbit movie changed its title, they could have called this Mad Max: There and Back Again. I know, groan.) Also, there’s very little character development. As you may have heard, Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky has very few lines in the film. Max is certainly around for the whole movie, but this isn’t a movie dependent on dialogue. It really could have been a silent film. Part of me wishes George Miller would have tried that, just to see if it could be pulled off. So, with the simplest of plots and not much dialogue, here comes Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the most in-your-face enjoyable things to watch in a very long time. There has to be some sort of lesson to be learned here about modern filmmaking, to not let your convoluted plot get in the way of an enjoyable movie. You’ve probably seen those Mad Max: Fury Road trailers – aren’t they great? Hey, guess what: The entire movie is just like those trailers… Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching a non-stop, two-hour-long action-packed trailer. Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa, who is probably the main character of this movie (she has the most to say, at least). She frees a group of five women who were the wives of a local dictator named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). As she races across the desert with these women, she’s chased by Immortan Joe’s gang, which includes a captured Max Rockatansky (Nicholas Hoult’s character, Nux, is using Max’s blood as some sort of personal rejuvenation project… this is a really weird movie). Eventually, Max escapes and teams up with Furiosa and off we go. The whole movie is one big long car chase across the desert, filled with stunts and car wrecks and a noticeable lack of CGI. Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching the circus. It really is just non-stop “stuff,” but not in an intrusive way. After watching Mad Max: Fury Road, I re-watched The Road Warrior for the first time in over 20 years. I remember once thinking of The Road Warrior as a weird movie that had crazy car chase sequences. Compared to Fury Road, The Road Warrior seems very tame. Mel Gibson’s Max himself comes across actually kind of normal; he’s just a guy making his way through this dystopian future looking for a little gasoline along the way. Gibson’s Max seems a lot less “mad” and a little more introspective and lonely, but I guess Forlorn Max wouldn’t have made a very good movie title. As a contrast, Tom Hardy’s Max is legitimately mad, in both an angry way and a crazy way; he’s constantly having flashbacks to a young girl who dies that Max couldn’t save. If I had written this piece immediately after watching Mad Max: Fury Road, it would probably be much different. Again, this movie is a lot. And there are characters who are just plain gross-looking and, well, again… it’s a lot. But, over the next few days, I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. It’s as if there’s so much visual stimulus to take in, it takes a couple of days for your brain to catch up and report back, “I’ve decided that you enjoyed that movie.” And that’s the thing, even if you wind up not enjoying Mad Max: Fury Road, it impossible to not kind of be in awe of the spectacle.

"May 11, 2015"," That lovely sentence concluded Roger Ebert’s 1985 review of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Thirty years later, Mad Max is finally back in a new sequel, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Ebert’s words feel truer than ever. Fury Road is an incredible achievement, one that strains so hard at the leash of the possible that it eventually breaks free and barrels headlong into the realm of insane genius. Forget Max Rockatansky; director George Miller is the true madman here — and the true hero for having pulled it off. After a brief prologue, Fury Road opens with one of the craziest car chases in cinema history. It’s also the least crazy car chase in the movie, which keeps topping itself over and over right until the closing credits.  Along the way, the new Max also contains maybe the single best hand-to-hand fight in any major blockbuster since The Matrix, and scene after scene of jaw-dropping production and costume design. (If this movie isn’t in contention in both of those categories come Oscar time, something is truly and shamefully broken with the awards system.) Like the other Mad Max films, Fury Road is set in a post-apocalyptic future after a war over oil destroyed civilization. Unlike the other Mad Max films, it stars Tom Hardy instead of Mel Gibson as Max, a former cop and self-described “road warrior” struggling to survive in the ruins of Australia. All the Mad Max sequels are dystopian sci-fi Westerns; Fury Road is the series’ Stagecoach. After Max is captured by a band of albino maniacs, he’s brought to a citadel ruled by gas mask-wearing despot named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and turned into a human blood bag to refill one of Joe’s soldiers (Nicholas Hoult). When one of Joe’s lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), steals his slave wives (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) and attempts to ferry them to the freedom of a faraway paradise known as “The Green Place,” Joe’s forces are sent to retrieve them. Cue chases and more chases and another chase, and then like five more chases. For a world that’s out of “guzzoline,” these people sure do drive a lot. In fact, Miller’s pivoted away from the peak oil subtext of The Road Warrior and replaced it with an ecological message. Instead of gas, the characters in Fury Road are chasing water, a canny subject for a movie opening in the midst of a historic California drought. Immortan Joe controls his citadel by lording over its underground reservoir, while Furiosa races to return to the idyllic oasis of “The Green Place.” Everything between those two locations is dry, barren desert, an ideal setting for Miller’s epic chase scenes. (With its endless vistas and tiny automobiles dwarfed by giant mountains and sand dunes, Fury Road is like the Lawrence of Arabia of car movies.) Though there’s barely any dialogue in Fury Road (and most of it is drowned out by the sound of roaring engines), the film is also a pointed critique of a world where men seek to control, possess, and repress women. It never stops to talk about these ideas, though, and instead lets them emerge from the action, which is relentless and spectacular. In Hardy’s opening voiceover, he describes Max as “a man reduced to a single instinct: survive.” Traditional car chase movies are about evasion, deception, and timing; they’re typically set in urban environments with obstacles to avoid and escape routes to locate. The chases in Fury Road are like Max himself; boiled down to that single survival instinct. There is nothing but sand for hundreds of miles in any direction. There’s nowhere to hide and nothing to do but drive straight ahead and fight for your life. This franchise was quick and angry before Fast & Furious was even a gleam in Vin Diesel’s eye, but even after a 30-year layoff, it still feels cutting-edge. True, Hardy’s Max doesn’t jump any cars between buildings, but what Fury Road lacks in grandeur it more than makes up in clarity and inventiveness. Even with dozens of vehicles and characters onscreen simultaneously, all of which are covered in dirt and tattered rags, Miller’s precise camerawork, practical stunts, and sharp editing keeps things clear. It helps that those vehicles are so ingeniously creative: tanks made out of old hot rods; men attached to the back of cars on giant, swinging teeter-totter poles; and what can only be described as a guitar amp-mobile, topped by a dude rocking out on fire-spewing Fender. Hardy doesn’t look, sound, or act like Gibson’s Max, but he’s also more convincingly “mad” in the role than Gibson ever was. (This Max hears voices and sees strange visions and appears genuinely deranged.) He can’t hold a candle to Theron though, who is intimidatingly ferocious and touchingly vulnerable in equal measure, and arguably the film’s real hero even though Max is the title character. According to various reports, Hardy and Theron didn’t get along particularly well on set, but whatever animosity existed between them translated well to their characters, who don’t get along particularly well either. The other highlight among the cast is Hoult, who initially seems like a throwaway but grows increasingly central to the drama, and gets a really satisfying arc over the course of the journey from the citadel to the Green Place. Even though this is the fourth Mad Max, and it’s indebted to the style of the previous films, Fury Road stands alone. It’s better looking and more thrilling than any of the other installments. The color palette is vibrant and beautiful, and every inch of the frame is crammed with crazy, brilliant ideas. (You’ll never guess where the citadel gets its milk from.) And, of course, the vehicular action is instantly in the conversation for the best ever made. They’ll keep making car chase movies after Fury Road, but there’s really no need. It’s hard to imagine these great visionary wonders ever being topped.",POSITIVE

The fourth instalment of George Miller’s punky post-apocalyptic ‘Mad Max’ saga feels like a tornado tearing through a tea party. In an age of weightless movie spectacles, here’s a movie that feels like it was made by kidnapping $150 million of studio money, fleeing with it to the Namibian desert, and sending footage back to Hollywood like the amputated body parts of a ransomed hostage.It’s been 30 years since we last watched Mel Gibson’s Max Rockatansky drift into the horizon in ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’, but the Road Warrior hasn’t aged a day. He’s been transformed from a reluctantly charismatic Gibson into a terse Tom Hardy. Yet much has changed in the wasteland that Max wanders. While previous episodes were set amid the rubble of a ruined world, the colourful hyper-saturated landscapes of this new movie locate the story closer to the dawn of a new civilization than the twilight of an old one. Things begin inside the mountain stronghold ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an inbred monster who lords over a society that guzzles its citizens like fuel. Women are drained for their breast milk, girls are farmed for their wombs, and men like Max are used as vehicle ornaments called ‘bloodbags’. Unsurprisingly, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Joe’s one-armed lieutenant, is ready for a change. When she drives off with his prized concubines, the warlord unleashes a suicidal eight-cylinder army on their trail. Pretty much the entire film is a screaming death race down Fury Road.Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliam’s film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action. But the key to this symphony of twisted metal is how the film never forgets that violence is a sort of madness. Miller’s world is a raw portrait of man at his most primitive, and the oppression of women has long been a recurring motif. With Theron’s Furiosa behind the wheel, though, ‘Fury Road’ steers this macho franchise in a brilliant new direction, forging a mythical portrait about the need for female rule in a world where men need to be saved from themselves.That’s why Max is an enduring hero: he knows when to drive off into the sunset. This time, he leaves a generation of blockbuster cinema choking on his dust.

"May 11, 2015"," Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has been driven crazy by the death of his wife and daughter who still haunt him, but when he’s captured by Immortan Joe’s War Boys to be used as a “blood bag” for one Nux (Nicholas Hoult), Max finds himself caught up in a chase across the desert as Joe tries to catch Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has run off taking his best breeding wives with her. It’s hard to believe it’s been thirty years since Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, for which filmmaker George Miller went quite off the rails as he brought his Australian future shock action to mainstream American audiences to help make Mel Gibson a household name. Gibson is gone but the madness remains as Tom Hardy slips into a role that doesn’t require him to remember a lot of lines but also helps to show why at least the first two movies are such classics. Hardy doesn’t have much to say after the opening sequence in which Max peers across the desert with an introductory monologue as voiceover. He’s soon captured by a gang of painted “War Boys” who want to use his blood to fuel their warriors, and the focus quickly shifts to Nicholas Hoult’s Nux, one such War Boy who is completely devout to the mask-wearing Immortan Joe, who rules his mountain refuge with an iron fist, keeping the populace in line with water rations. One of his high-ranking officials named Furiosa has left with a tanker full of water, but in fact she has used her run to free Joe’s wives, the young and pretty sex slaves he uses to bear his children. Going by the seemingly inbred brutes he’s spawned so far, she’s making a wise move though it puts her on the run from Joe’s blindly-devoted War Boys who are ready to go to their deaths to please their master. If you think that Miller is trying to make some sort of veiled social commentary about religion fundamentalism, you won’t have to dig too far below the surface of this surprising simple story to find it. The entire movie is essentially a chase across the wasteland as Max is trying to escape from his captors and eventually ends up helping Theron’s Furiosa and her “girls” escape from the pursuing dictator and his suicidal zealots. As the chase progresses across the desert, we get to see the insane weaponized vehicles Joe and his caravan have at their disposal, complete with their own personal soundtrack provided by a truck full of drummers and a flame-spewing heavy metal guitarist who even gets involved in the action. In some ways, it’s a bit like Moulin Rouge! (another film by a visionary Australian filmmaker) in that it takes some time to adjust to the concoction of Adderall and adrenaline that drives the film’s visuals. When you think of inventive and creative production design, Terry Gilliam, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and even Stanley Kubrick may immediately come to mind, and the visual genius of George Miller and his team is evident from the make-shift vehicles created for Mad Max: Fury Road. It’s an original way to explore science fiction by taking parts of existing vehicles and creating new things that look even more fantastic when speeding across the desolate environments which Miller has found. It’s quite impressive to realize how much of the action is done practically, which also gives the movie such a distinct look and feel from the “Fast and Furious” movies. In that sense, Fury Road doesn’t really need Mel Gibson, as Tom Hardy readily slips into the role of a brooding silent type – and really, other than that opening monologue, he doesn’t say much more than ten words, which is fine since some of the words that come out of everyone else’s mouths are questionably silly at times. What some may find surprising about Miller’s latest venture is that it’s a rare feminist-friendly action movie in which Theron’s Furiosa and the women she’s saving have far more to say and do, constantly proving themselves to be far more logical and practical than the men chasing after them. Hoult’s character also tends to grow on you although the wild way his character is introduced, essentially turning him into as much a central character as the others, might also take some adjusting to. There are plenty of other characters, few of whom are actually given names at least until the end credits, which is a fun way to learn their amusing monikers. Other than the at-times wonky dialogue, the only other thing that might be considered a negative, keeping Mad Max: Fury Road from receiving an absolute rave, is that it may get a little too crazy at times for those used to more grounded storytelling. On the other hand, if you’re a fan of the original movies and want to see what Miller’s able to do with a bigger budget and modern technology, then it delivers something as crazy and fun as any of the earlier movies. Like being given a look into the brain of an insane drug-fueled alien, George Miller’s genius as a visionary helps make Mad Max: Fury Road one of those rare cases when a filmmaker returns to their groundbreaking franchise and manages to create something just as game-changing.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is Miller's masterpiece. It's a tour-de-force film, an action romp par excellence...A wonderous blast of fun that's sure to warm the heart of even the most jaded anti-blockbuster audience member.",POSITIVE
