"Apr 8, 2024"," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, a web-slinging franchise already tainted by misfires, has (hopefully) hit rock bottom with its time-jumping thriller Madame Web. You can see the yucky studio fingerprints all over this overproduced origin story, from choppy-as-hell pacing to the insistence on hitting certain formulaic MCU-type beats. Initial trailers tease eerie premonition horrors à la Final Destination that are barely in the final product, which has more in common with the first Dr. Strange (not even the spooky Multiverse of Madness sequel). If Madame Web were Final Destination: Superhero Edition, this would probably be a much more enthusiastic review — but it’s not. Madame Web is instead a flat-as-hell found family remix and awful bad superhero introduction that’ll test your SSU patience in record time. Dakota Johnson projects ambivalence and boredom as Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, who we meet as an emotionless thirty-something loner working as a paramedic in New York City. We already know she’s the daughter of deceased researcher Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé), betrayed by her expedition partner in Peru’s Amazonian rainforest while researching spiders. Cassie isn’t aware of the powers bestowed upon her during birth by a lifesaving arachnid bite, nor that Bruce Wayne wannabe Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) left her mother with a fatal gunshot wound. Cassie just wants to avoid death and watch American Idol like the average American during the early 2000s, not visualize the brutal killing of innocent girls who she then has to babysit thanks to the emergence of “time web” abilities that have her mind in a paradoxical blender. At its core, Madame Web is a comic book adaptation that fights against being a superhero movie. It’s written into Cassie’s personality — she doesn’t ask for the burden of playing foster parent to her eventual minions. Cassie is a complicated protagonist written to conceal any excitement or ownership of her superpowers, which lands like a thud throughout Johnson’s performance. She's as cardboard-flavored as the refrigerator drawing Cassie heartlessly declines from a grateful child. It’s hard to blame an actress when the material is so humdrum and uninspired, but still, what Johnson translates to the screen is like administered anesthesia. Cassie Webb is forgettably played in monotone, whether fighting Evil Spider-Man, learning Las Arañas lore, or floating through time-web-space like Johnson is trying to locate a reality before she signed on to Madame Web. Enter Cassie’s someday Spider-Women trio — who we only see as Spider-Women for, like, a collective two minutes (if even). Sydney Sweeney as good-girl-in-glasses Julia Cornwall, Isabela Merced as the fiery independent Anya Corazon, and Celeste O'Connor as rich-kid rebel Mattie Franklin. They are your prototype “found family” who dance on New Jersey diner tables to impress boys and make ill-advised choices because, if not, Ezekiel can’t locate his future murderers. It’s a numbing cycle of Cassie giving clear instructions for survival, Mattie disregarding the rules, and Ezekiel finding their location that falls into the same recycled staleness cemented by Cassie’s anchoring presence (or lack thereof). At least Johnson’s young castmates are allowed a tad more personality (which the film desperately needs). O'Connor’s brattiness as a skateboarding Spider-Punk in training or Merced’s stern insistence to obey orders allows for real character development — Sweeny less so, more of an American Girl doll for O’Connor’s troublemaker to corrupt. The film’s avalanche of problems ripples from here. Heralded Morbius writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless claimed scripting duties after Kerem Sanga took a crack. Claire Parker also notches a screenplay credit, as does director S. J. Clarkson, so we can assume revision rounds took place — to highlight how many hands were in the cookie jar. Four talents trying to homogenize their styles into one voice. You’re right to assume the blending process is a failure. Madame Web feels like a Frankenstein of spare Spider-Parts dissected and rebuilt by the studio machine. No role represents this sentiment more than antagonist Ezekiel Sims, who might be one of the worst supervillains in any comic book adaptation (SSU, MCU, DCU, the lot). Tahar Rahim’s performance is a blank stare and inconsistent accents; a millionaire (?), billionaire (?), who goes from shooting Constance Webb point blank and stealing her magic spider for personal use to living in New York City’s finest penthouse thirty years later, complete with his own NSA-stolen surveillance technology and tech wiz sidekick Amaria (Zosia Mamet deserves better). Sims isn’t the lead or focus of Madame Web, that’s Cassie Webb, but the screenplay so ineptly builds his nonexistent mythology no further than “bad guy in dark Spider-Man suit.” Not to mention his ADR work, in particular, is egregiously noticeable and quite horrendous for a Hollywood film with substantial budgeting and resources. Sims is a Mad Libs evildoer with an important arc about not obsessing over your future lest you doom your present, but producers clearly don’t care about the final cut version of Sims, which makes it hard for us to care in return. Madame Web plays as insincere, forces characters through obvious motions, and commits the ultimate sin for any superhero origin — is always looking toward future installments. I haven’t mentioned director S. J. Clarkson all that much because the film lacks identity, and I hope that’s a byproduct of wretched studio tampering. Sony’s inability to reconcile with the SSU's past and not let the future weigh down its present anxieties is in parallel with Cassie’s arc — and they can’t even tell that substory right. Madame Web is essentially promotional material for identities and superheroes you were sold this time around, with no real guarantee that any of these Spider-Women will appear down the road given the current SSU's disastrous status.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 4, 2024"," Late last year, May December sparked a spirited online debate about the definition of stylistic camp. While Susan Sontag purists were quick to insist that the outrageous tone of the film is to be strictly defined as comedy, many others were happy to shrug off this traditional definition and evolve the scope of camp into something weaponizable. And then we have Madame Web — one of the worst films in recent memory, which doesn't spin its camp with any sense of understanding or autonomy. It's an outrageous, sometimes entertaining mess that will hopefully supply audiences with enough disastrous creative choices and laughable nonsense to make its two-hour runtime somewhat ironically enjoyable. In Madame Web, a young New York City paramedic named Cassandra Web (played by a half-awake Dakota Johnson) has her dormant clairvoyant and precognitive mutant abilities ignited after an almost-fatal accident. Now able to see glimpses into the near future, Cassandra discovers that she can make drastic changes to help and ultimately save those around her. This gift was passed on to her from her long-dead mother, who had been studying spiders in the Amazon right before she died. When another mutant (Tahar Rahim) hunts down three seemingly average teenage girls on the subway, Cassandra uses her newfound abilities to save their lives, and the four young women find themselves on the run from a deadly, ruthless foe.  The story is impossibly bloated, with a meaningless plot — a fate foreshadowed by the ""Amazon spider"" dialogue made viral by the film's outrageous, campy trailer. None of it makes sense, and the characters often look at each other like they are unsure of whose line is coming next or which ping-pong ball they need to be running from. It's all just one long and ongoing disaster that's occasionally fun to watch but has too much filler to avoid a painfully boring third act.  Part of what confused me most about this confounding cinematic experience was the quality of its performances. Dakota Johnson has been on a tear lately with her press tour for the film. From eating up journalists who clumsily pestered her about the meme-ification of the film’s trailer to a comedic earthquake survival, Johnson is always a fun personality to witness in real-time. Her nonchalant eccentricity even translates onto the screen here — but instead of laughing with the movie, her performance seems to be constantly self-aware of the mess surrounding her. I can't speak to her internal monologue, but I couldn't help but feel like Johnson as Cassie was in as much awe of the film's spectacular ongoing failure as the rest of us. Then we have the unfortunate misuse of the film's young leads. Rising superstars Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor and Isabela Merced play three teenage girls who will one day become mutant heroes but currently require protection from Cassandra. With these three performances, the film goes into truly unforgivable territory. We get short visions of what their future superhero alter-egos look like, and it’s fairly glorious. But these are clearly promises of a cinematic tomorrow we will undoubtedly never see, as the quality of Madame Web is so wretched that any continuation feels all but dead on arrival. The wasted potential of a film led by these Spider-Women, instead of a cardboard cutout of Madame Web, was a grotesque tease.  While there are more than a handful of moments so terrible that they were an ironic joy to witness, the film is so long and confusing that its ironic value is slaughtered by its third act. Campy, yes — but also terrible.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 21, 2024",&quot;Madame Web is a frustrating example of a film that could work if they took better care of the story and didn&apos;t try and judo it straight into franchise fuel&#46;&quot;,NEUTRAL
"Mar 18, 2024"," The Gist: THE PERUVIAN AMAZON, 1973: Madame Web’s mom (Kerry Bishe) finally, finally finds the spider she’s been searching for – a spider that has some truly amazing peptides, the type of venom-derived peptides that, the script tells us, can supercharge cellular structure. Let’s hear it for peptides that supercharge cellular structure! Hooray for the peptides. She’s also pregnant, but that doesn’t stop Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) from shooting her and stealing the spider and leaving her for dead so some Peruvian spider-people known as Las Aranas can rescue her and take her to a magic cave for a magic bath so she can be bitten by one of the special spiders in the hopes that those peptides can save her. It doesn’t work and she dies but the baby doesn’t. Don’t you HATE it when that HAPPENS? Now we jump to 2003, where we meet that baby of destiny, all growed up: Cassandra Webb (Johnson), surely voted Best Bangs on an NYC EMT several years running. She’s a lonely sort with a cat, and to show us that she’s a lonely sort, she talks to the cat a lot and sadly thumbs through old photos of her mom. Her best bud-slash-ambulance partner is a guy named – hold onto yer hats true believers! – Ben Parker (Adam Scott), which has implications, my friends, major effing implications. One day, as she attends – put your hats back on so you can hold onto them again – Mary Parker’s (Emma Roberts) baby shower – who could possibly be in her tum-tum? – and drinks an ice-cold can of Pepsi-Cola, she and Ben are summoned to a rescue scene that goes sideways and nearly ends her. While she’s dead for a few minutes, she finds herself in an ugly and shitty special effect, and after Ben resuscitates her, she immediately says “I just wanna go home and watch Idol,” because it’s 2003, yo.  The ugly shitty special effect wasn’t nothing, of course. Cassie starts seeing glimpses into the future via confusing flash-forwards. This doesn’t happen all the time, only when very important things are going to happen, so yes, that means it happens precisely when the plot needs it. At this point the plot reintroduces us to Ezekiel as he beds a pretty lady, has a nightmare and engages in the worst pillow talk ever: “It’s not a dream. I’m gonna be murdered one day,” he says. His visions are clear: Three Spider-Women will take him out, so he goes about trying to find those women and take them out first, using computer composites and advanced surveillance tech that’s so complex and impossible, the movie doesn’t explain it, because it’d be way too difficult to do so convincingly. So we just move on. Who are those Spider-Women, you ask? Well, they’re not Spider-Women yet, just average teenagers: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). One day all three of these young women who don’t know each other end up on the same train as Cassie, who envisumalizes what’s about to happen, somehow convinces them that her envisumalization isn’t the ravings of a lunatic, and saves them from an attack by Ezekiel, who wears a black Spider-Mannish costume. Destiny, it seems, is really stinking afoot here. And destiny will lead our heroines to a thoroughly inscrutable finish at an Itchy and Scratchy fireworks factory topped by a giant Pepsi-Cola sign, as it damn well should, since being a shameless advertisement is the only thing this movie successfully achieves.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Deep breath: You’ve got Green Lantern, Elektra, Fantastic Four (2015), Fantastic Four (2005), Suicide Squad (2016)… time hasn’t vindicated any of these losers. Time to add a new one to this hall-of-shame list.  Performance Worth Watching: Johnson’s really it’s-a-living her way through this thing. She’s been through it before, in the 50 Shadeses, so by now she should be a pro at gutting it out. As an unapologetic DK fanboy, I just want to send her flowers and a nice card after this one. I can’t help but contemplate critic Gene Siskel’s famous criteria for judging a film: “Is the movie more interesting than the same actors having lunch?” In this case, I’d specifically amend that to put Johnson and Sweeney across from each other in a cozy diner booth having a sad-eyes staring contest over a slice of pie – first one to cry loses. That would be way more watchable than Madame Web.  Memorable Dialogue: My fave doozy in a script full of ’em: “There’s not enough frictional force in the bare human foot to overcome gravity and keep him stuck to the wall, much less the ceiling!” says Anya Corazon, like anyone would breathlessly blurt as they’re trying to escape being killed by a spider-madman. Our Take: A few sudden bursts of unintentional hilarity don’t save Madame Web from being unwatchable – unwatchable like a fox. The screenplay is a series of exponentially escalating incomprehensible storytelling decisions resulting in a bona-fide NONSENSE FUGUE. There’s a scene in which Cassie tells her teenage proteges, “Don’t do anything dumb,” immediately followed by a reiteration: “Seriously, don’t do dumb things.” Has she read this screenplay? It consists entirely of dumb things! They have no choice! One wonders if Johnson read it either, before hopefully being paid very well for this. (Note: She surely did read it. In a recent interview she essentially said this was one of those movies that looked like one thing when she signed on and became something entirely different after. She knew it was a disaster. She knew The Discourse was coming. Here’s another fistful of daisies, Dakota.) Our Call: I wanted to like this movie. Scratch that – I wanted to like disliking this movie. Just back the FTD delivery truck into Dakota’s driveway and SKIP IT.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 15, 2024"," Early on in Madame Web — the latest superhero film to be based on a Spider-Man-adjacent comic series — Dakota Johnson’s Cassie Web rejects a thank-you gift from the child of a woman whose life she just saved. From this, you can probably surmise that firstly, she’s awkward around kids, and secondly, she will eventually end up having to protect some kids. Like many heavily telegraphed moments in this film, you won’t need psychic powers to figure that one out — even if Cassie herself does, in fact, shortly develop such powers. But if you did have psychic powers, you might have wanted to use them to gently warn the cast away from this film, which manages to be both over-written and underwritten at the same time. Most of the actors here are wonderfully talented, but there’s only so much they can do with the material. A Prophet’s Tahar Rahim, so often a blistering presence, is left to thankless grumpy villain duties here; Adam Scott, fresh off his unimprovable turn in Severance, takes on a curious incarnation of Spidey’s Uncle Ben; Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor, as Spider-Women, have very little to do here. There is, perhaps, a bit less digital mulch sloshing around in Madame Web than in some recent superhero films. This is the result of a smaller and more self-contained story, involving the kind of nifty time-loop dilemmas familiar from small-screen sci-fi. But where the dialogue needed wit and spark, it has the kind of will-this-do one-liners (“Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom!”) and tired backstories you get when the characters are too flat to flesh out with rounded personalities. (Some unconvincing ADR smacks of a last-minute attempt to fix things in the edit.) Like the last remnants of a lost civilisation poking through the wreckage of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, hints of classical storytelling survive. The fateful legacy of a birthright inherited from a dead parent gives Cassie’s arc a Freudian motif, while the villain attempting to wipe out the next generation due to a premonition that they will cause his own downfall is a more interesting and personal motivation — at least on the page — than another bad guy wanting to destroy the universe. And instead of Chekhov’s gun, we get a new twist on an old favourite in the form of ‘Chekhov’s CPR’. It’s not enough to offset the creeping sense that, when it comes to the franchise sometimes known as the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC), the word ‘Marvel’ is synonymous less with a sense of awe than with a shrug.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 11, 2024"," Geraldine Viswanathan as Marian and Margaret Qualley as Jamie in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) As film bros and Joe Moviegoer alike await the release of “Dune: Part Two” with bated breath, they have largely given the cold shoulder to a spattering of other movies trying in vain to find audiences in the first two months of 2024. They run the gamut from acclaimed Oscar rejects (Ava DuVernay's gripping “Origin”) to costly debacles plagued by bad press and a cloud of let's-not-even-hate-watch contempt (more on that below). The Jason Statham-fronted thriller “The Beekeeper” (better than it looks) and “Bob Marley: One Love,” a new biopic about the reggae icon (unseen by me as of this writing), stand out as rare profitable exceptions in what is otherwise a concerning no-man's-land. Two February releases tell genre-driven tales that put women in the driver's seat of narratives all too often spearheaded by male protagonists. One is a buddy road movie with two lesbian friends seizing the spotlight. The other is the latest attempt by Sony to kickstart its own coterie of Marvel , away from the greedy Mouse, an origin story with shades of Bryan Singer's “X-Men” movies. Did either of them deserve their grim box office fate? Let's find out. “Drive-Away Dolls”: Jamie and Marian need a change, so they hit the road. Naughty, raunchy and kooky shenanigans ensue. That, in a nutshell, sums up the story of two sapphic besties dealing with the violent patriarchy (cops and criminals alike), horny athletes, an abrasive ex-girlfriend and a crooked politician with a hilarious secret. But it doesn't reflect the easygoing retro vibe that makes this live-action cartoon go down like honey. Our protagonists, living in Philly circa 1999, are polar opposites that somehow complement each other. Jamie (Margaret Qualley) lets her libido make her decisions, and her latest conquest is too much for her girlfriend Sukie (Beanie Feldstein), a police officer with a chip on her shoulder, to take. Straitlaced, tightly wound Marian (“Blockers'” Geraldine Viswanathan), is tired of her annoying (straight male) co-workers at her office job and dissatisfied with life in general, so she decides to rent a car using a drive-away service in order to visit her aunt in Tallahassee. The freshly dumped Jamie abruptly inserts herself into her solo trip. C.J. Wilson as Flint, Colman Domingo as The Chief and Joey Slotnick as Arliss in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) Away they go, unaware that the rather inept owner of the rental service (the ubiquitous Bill Camp) has given them the boxy Dodge Aries meant for a couple of goons (Joey Slotnick and C.J. Wilson) tasked with transporting a briefcase filled with unspecified contraband, also to Florida's capital. It's a case of mistaken identities that plays more like screwball comedy fodder than blood-soaked mayhem, through there's some of that, too.  Jamie, her confident swagger bolstered by a heavy Texas drawl, favors frequent detours to explore lesbian bar culture along the way, against the wishes of Marian, who'd much rather curl up with a Henry James novel than socialize. Once they realize they're carrying stolen goods, the two team up to deal with their ballooning underworld dilemma, as a suave gangster played by current Oscar nominee Colman Domingo deals with the incompetence of his jaw-droppingly stoopid henchmen. “Drive-Away Dolls” mixes two popular nineties subgenres that used to move B-movies off video store shelves: the down-and-dirty crime thriller and the exuberant queer indie. It's in this dual playpen that writer-director Ethan Coen and co-screenwriter Tricia Cooke, his partner in art and in life, jump in with gusto, wielding a budget and even a handful of A-listers that the movies that inspired them could only dream of. Cooke, who identifies as queer, infuses her more grounded (and yes, very queer) sensibility into Coen's goofy, occasionally gruesome sense of humor. Like the mismatched duo piloting this wild ride, the blend should not work yet somehow does. The results suggest what the Wachowskis' “Bound” would have been like as a farce. Geraldine Viswanathan as Marian and Margaret Qualley as Jamie in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) Coen, directing his first feature without filmmaking partner and sibling Joel, is not afraid to dip his toe in over-the-top gore that recalls Sam Raimi in the eighties and, to a lesser extent, the Coens' own debut feature “Blood Simple.” But there's a distinct laid-back appeal here. It's in the film's playful, gleefully racy sex scenes with undeniable shades of Russ Meyer; it's in the lava-lamp imagery of the segueways between some scenes; and it's in the twinkle in the eye of a front desk employee at a Tallahassee hotel who appears to have walked in from an early Alexander Payne movie. They indicate this isn't your typical B-movie homage. Amidst the broad odd-couple hijinks, a tender depiction of Jamie and Marian's friendship blooms. When it comes to the young women's personal lives, they begin to stealthily influence each other's behavior, navigating their deepening bond with a nuance and sensitivity that anchors the clever genre-hopping and even injects a political subtext without interrupting the bawdy fun. The fact that Coen and Cooke milk considerable mileage from Linda Ronstadt's “Blue Bayou” cover should tell you all you need to know. Well, that and the film's original title, which had another word for “Dolls” that's either pejorative or empowering depending on who you ask. (Yes, it's exactly the “d” word you're thinking of, and no, the contents of that mysterious briefcase are decidedly not what you're thinking of.) “Drive-Away Dolls” wallows in the muck yet always feels wholesome despite its “hard R” trappings. Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal pop in, and while it's fun to see the stars in lighthearted cameos, the movie doesn't need their wattage. Coen and Cooke elevate the scuzzy appeal of their disreputable building blocks while still paying tribute to grindhouse fare of past generations, clocking in at just 84 minutes. They've made a romp that's tough on the outside but squishy in the middle. This is primo trash and proud of it, not only great fun, but a great hangout flick and a winning buddy picture. It promises a rowdy time and delivers the goods before it slams on the brakes. “Madame Web”: Do you know what movie was in dire need of some of “Drive-Away Dolls'” lively energy and generosity of spirit? This somnanbulant excuse for a comic book adventure. Should I rip the Band-Aid? I'm going to rip off the Band-Aid. The story of how a sullen, disenchanted New York City paramedic discovers she can foresee future events is a washout, a non-starter, aggressively boring when it's not being conspicuously awful. The social media dust storm that this misbegotten dumpster fire kicked up has begun to settle, but I fear its ripple effects will be felt for a long time to come. At the center of this funnel cloud of good intentions and poor execution is a phoned-in performance by Dakota Johnson playing the aforementioned first responder, Cassandra Webb. (See? Studying Greek mythology was good for something, after all.) Cassie's mother was researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon before she was double-crossed by her handsome, power-hungry research partner, Ezekiel Sims (“A Prophet's” Tahar Rahim, picking up a paycheck), circa 1973. Mommie Dearest kicks the bucket moments after childbirth in a scene that feels ripped off from “Avatar.” Flash forward 30 years, and Cassie has a near-death experience of her own while responding to a crash. She gradually realizes that she can see things before they happen. A neat concept, and if someone with the panache of, say, Sam Raimi was the filmmaker calling the shots, we'd have a real humdinger that would keep audiences on their toes. Sadly, we have to settle for S.J. Clarkson in the director's chair, and the TV vet gives Cassie's visions the most earthbound treatment imaginable, leeching the thrill of disorientation that would have given these scenes their kick. Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon, Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall and Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin in a scene from ""Madame Web."" (Photo courtesy of Marvel / Sony Pictures.) Cassie discovers she's fated to cross paths with and protect three teenage girls: shy and awkward Julia Cornwall (the radiant Sydney Sweeney), the standoffish Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and skateboarding trust fund baby Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). Protect from who, you ask? You already know the answer: Ezekiel, older but still rather hunky, and yet the sex appeal still yields a charisma void. He's convinced the Indigenous people of the Amazon cursed him with knowledge of how he's going to die: at the hands of this teen trio with abandonment issues, at some unspecified future date. (It goes without saying that Sweeney, Merced and O'Connor are all in their twenties and as convincing as you'd expect playing teens, which is not very.) But revealing this information early in the game saps the life force out of “Madame Web.” The rest of the movie unfolds as one narrow escape after another, with perfunctory action scenes that fail to quicken the pulse, schintzy CGI and automated dialogue replacement, or ADR, so poorly synchronized you'd swear these actors have all been dubbed by other people. Only composer Johan Söderqvist appears to have understood the assignment, using Herrmannesque strings to generate an aura of a falsely accused person on the run from baddies and the law. (Think “North by Northwest,” but with bad visual effects and dialogue in the place of actual tension.) If the storyline gives you déjà vu, that's because “Madame Web” was released a few months after “The Marvels,” which brings together three superheroes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris). “Web” actually plays like a morose mirror image of “The Marvels,” but even though both productions were plagued with reported behind-the-scenes drama, “Marvels” director Nia DaCosta imbued her adventure with fleet-footed pacing, a colorful palette and a refreshingly featherweight tone. By contrast, Clarkson has crafted the movie that “The Marvels” and, while we're at it, the underappreciated “Wonder Woman 1984” were accused of being. Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin, Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon and Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall in a scene from ""Madame Web."" (Photo courtesy of Marvel / Sony Pictures.) “Madame Web” lumbers from setpiece to setpiece, with a perpetually irritated Johnson acting as she'd rather be anywhere but here. She's an undefatigable guardian who approaches death-defying situations with the energy of a janitor tasked with cleaning up a big mess. (“Really? Another spill to mop up?”) In the face of danger, you get the feeling she's about to ask for the manager but keeps getting interrupted. This underachiever should have been titled “Super Karen.” Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, has gotten a bad rap due to the “Fifty Shades” trilogy (I was underwhelmed by the first one but rather enjoyed Parts 2 and 3; shhh, don't tell anyone). It needs to be pointed out that she's been good in a number of films, including Luca Guadagnino's “A Bigger Splash” and “Suspiria,” as well as the indie sleeper ""The Peanut Butter Falcon."" Here, alas, she's checked out from the get-go, and even though Clarkson keeps “Madame Web” just under the two-hour mark, you feel like you've been robbed of more time than that. Much like its vexed vortex of a protagonist, you come away feeling like you've had to pay to babysit a bunch of ungrateful and unruly brats. This sorry Spidey off-shoot has already pegged as an expensive flop, and you can't blame the mall crowds for staying away. It drives you up the wall, and not in a nifty, gravity-defying way. “Drive-Away Dolls” and Madame Web” are now playing in wide release across South Florida, including Regal South Beach, AMC Aventura, AMC Sunset Place, CMX Brickell City Centre and the Silverspot Cinema in downtown Miami.

"Mar 8, 2024"," *** The first act of Drive-Away Dolls, Ethan Coen’s pre-Y2K lesbian screwball comedy, is pure cringe. It’s 1999 and two friends, Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) and Jamie (Margaret Qualley), are driving a rented sedan from Philadelphia to Tallahassee—and acting more like caricatures than characters. Marian is a bookish romantic; Jamie just wants to get laid, dude! The film is so dependent on stock characterizations that Ethan initially seems to be flailing without his filmmaker brother Joel (like Joel’s gorgeously austere The Tragedy of Macbeth, Drive-Away Dolls is a Coen brother movie, singular). Yet when Marian and Jamie get ensnared in a scheme involving a seething senator (Matt Damon) and a murdered dildo collector (Pedro Pascal), Drive-Away Dolls emerges as a cleverly comedic and romantic provocation. Despite being set after Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, the film imagines the ‘90s as an age when bigoted politicians were more ridiculous than dangerous and even Florida church ladies could be prevailed upon to support gay marriage. Kinky lovemaking abounds, but the evolution of Marian and Jamie’s bond—from friendship to far more—carries a whiff of Jane Austen, with Qualley playing a boisterous Elizabeth Bennet to Viswanathan’s disdainful Mr. Darcy. Is it any wonder that Coen wrote this jubilant lark of a movie with his wife, the film editor Tricia Cooke? The couple that plays together stays together. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

His neighbor’s sidewalk sweeping initiates the handsome 60-year-old’s daily consciousness, and a routine begins. Mustache trim, coveralls, canned coffee, cassette in the van stereo (Patti Smith or Lou Reed) as Hirayama commutes into Shibuya City to dutifully clean Tokyo’s public toilets. From what we can tell—because Hirayama says maybe five sentences in Perfect Days’ first half—the dirty job is just a job to him. The work remains in balance with Hirayama’s passion for music, his voracious reading, and his lunchtime nature photography. It’s no mystery why directing legend Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Wings of Desire) would be interested in rendering such a life. What 78-year-old, capital-A artist wouldn’t be? This is idealistic working-class poetry (à la Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson) about a man who accepts life as a series of days that can be pleasurable if porcelain scrubbing and creative ruminating are treated with equal care. As the Cannes jury decided when they gave him Best Actor in 2023, Yakusho makes all this mundanity incredibly watchable. The Japanese star’s shifting micro-expressions reveal a character who can be bashful, boyish or imposing when his constancy is interrupted by his co-worker, his niece, or a fateful stranger. We may wonder why Hirayama chooses solitude, but his ability to be present is as comforting as it is aspirational. Wenders taps into a precious cinematic paradox: We viewers escape our lives to be mindful inside someone else’s. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Cinema 21. **** Both lyrical and essayistic, the latest film by Ava DuVernay is, firstly, a feat of adaptation. Here, the Selma director interprets the 2020 nonfiction bestseller Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, which explores pancultural patterns of dehumanization throughout history. Yet Origin also foregrounds the research and writing of that book by Pulitzer Prize winner Isabel Wilkerson (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), turning this story into the cultural study meets memoir it never was on the page. It’s a bold choice, with DuVernay drenching the writer’s pursuit in historical flashbacks, as Wilkerson searches for the thesis of Caste across Germany, India, and the Deep South (where Audra McDonald, playing interview subject Miss Hale, delivers an astounding one-scene performance). With Kris Bowers’ orchestral score pulling the audience across borders and centuries, Ellis-Taylor embodies the quiet obsession of a writer who lives mostly in her head but is desperate to crack the code of man’s inhumanity to man. Sociologists and historians could rightly argue that Wilkerson’s premise—that racism is the result of deliberately constructed caste systems, not inherent biases—is flawed because capitalism, colonialism and genocide are expressed differently through American slavery, the Holocaust, and the subjugation of India’s Dalits. But that doesn’t matter when Origin is stretched to its full height. Akin to another rhetoric- and editing-centric piece of creative nonfiction, Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991), the ways in which theories hold water isn’t Origin’s reason for being. What matters is the deluge of anecdotal and emotional truth. PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. **** Astoria becomes an extension of a young woman’s soul in Sometimes I Think About Dying, an exquisitely restrained drama from director Rachel Lambert. Rey Skywalker herself, Daisy Ridley, plays Fran, a numb office worker who sits rigidly in her cubicle, silently terrified of being forced to engage in pleasantries. With eerie grace, Sometimes I Think About Dying peers into Fran’s suicidal visions—she imagines herself entombed in a tangle of driftwood on a desolate beach—but even as the film evokes the monotony of her depression, it gleams in moments of connection. An unexpected friendship with a hyperactive, pie-munching co-worker (Dave Merheje) leads Fran to a murder mystery party, where she delights the guests by flamboyantly miming death by acid. Fran is never more alive than when she yanks death from the darkened crevices of her mind and plays it as farce, an act that draws her more deeply into a city and its people. Sometimes I Think About Dying is unmistakably an Astorian movie—only in a close-knit community could a character give directions to their home by saying it’s behind “the purple house”—but its emotional reach goes beyond the sweep of the Columbia River, which to Fran seems both an empty void and an inviting canvas. Sometimes she thinks about living. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Fox Tower. *** Fans of macabre teen flicks like Edward Scissorhands and Warm Bodies should find enjoyment in Lisa Frankenstein, the latest quirky project written by Oscar-winner Diablo Cody (Juno). Kathryn Newton plays Lisa Swallows, a misfit growing up in 1989 who feels unmoored since the death of her mother…and finds her life taking a peculiar turn when a Victorian-era corpse (Cole Sprouse) rises from the dead and falls in love with her. Loaded with Cody’s usual acidic wit and oddball detours, Lisa Frankenstein goes heavy on neon lighting, voluminous hair, and malfunctioning tanning beds. Director Zelda Williams (the daughter of Robin Williams) channels early Tim Burton with her juxtaposition of gothic and suburban aesthetics, which gives the picture plenty of knowing style. Some of her and Cody’s choices fall flat (the film has at least two endings too many), but Newton and Sprouse are always there to provide spark, reveling in their excellent chemistry as they tread through the weirdness. Lisa Frankenstein won’t hit for all audiences, but it is easy to foresee it gaining a cult following, like the 2009 Cody-scripted feminist horror flick Jennifer’s Body. PG-13. DANIEL RESTER. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Fox Tower, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, Studio One. ** “Sometimes,” Rita Marley (Lashawna Lynch) says to her husband Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), “the messenger must become the message.” Her affirmation illuminates the thesis of Bob Marley: One Love, that the reggae superstar must learn to accept the consequences and dangers that come with being an activist and not let them impede his mission. It’s a noble sentiment that makes for a compelling arc, but it is undercut by the screenplay’s version of Marley and his beliefs, which are sanitized to the point of sterility. The story—which kicks off with the attempted assassination of Marley in 1976, prompting an exile to London where he recovers from the trauma while writing his landmark ninth studio album, Exodus—rarely rises above artist-biopic cliches, despite occasional flashes of brilliance from director Reinaldo Marcus Greene (King Richard) and the compelling combo of Ben-Adir and Lynch (whose performance is a reminder that after supporting roles in No Time to Die and The Woman King, she’s overdue for a starring vehicle of her own). Perhaps One Love’s greatest disappointment is that it’s so thoroughly average; a man like Marley deserves a mightier film. Devotees may find some enjoyment in hearing hits from the singer’s back catalog in surround sound, but anyone hoping One Love will do justice to an icon will find that the cinematic message lacks the conviction of the messenger.

Studio One. ** After an unintentionally meme-worthy marketing campaign, a few critics have been quick to call Madame Web—a schlocky Spider-Man spinoff starring Dakota Johnson as clairvoyant paramedic Cassie Webb—the nadir of the superhero genre. It’s certainly not that. The film fails to hit the so-bad-it’s-good lows of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Steel (1997) or Batman & Robin (1997), outside of a few heinous moments toward the end (including a villain being vanquished by a Pepsi sign). That’s not to say it’s good. As Cassie defends a group of teenage girls (including Sydney Sweeney) hunted by the nefarious Ezekiel (Tahir Rahim), it becomes clear that director S.J. Clarkson’s film is mostly just another dull attempt by Sony to spotlight Spidey’s side characters. Johnson and Adam Scott (as the tellingly named Ben Parker) breathe a bit of life into the tale, as do a few clever set pieces (a subway sequence comes off best). But the clunky dialogue, lumbering pacing, and underdeveloped supporting characters reveal the desperation behind Johnson’s viral promotion of the film: “You’re gonna love it.” PG-13. DANIEL RESTER.

"Mar 6, 2024"," Cinematic disasters shouldn’t be this boring. Directed by S.J. Clarkson, “Madame Web” is a collection of misfires and missteps, awkward dialogue, weightless action, shoehorned-in references—all told without any sense of urgency at all. The idea of a villain relentlessly pursuing his prey seems like it should be a pressing matter, but the film takes a week off to get lost in a glut of expository dialogue (the whole movie’s default dialogue mode). The actors do their best, but the script is leaden and there’s no real visual splendor to behold—not even in the ironic, “look how awkward/cheap/phony this is” way that viewers can get from good bad movies. There are funny lines here and there, both intentionally comedic and not, but while audiences may want to find themselves tangled up in the story, they’ll be left adrift without anything reeling them in. Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a misanthropic, awkward EMT working in NYC in 2003. One day, while saving someone, she drowns and temporarily dies before being revived by her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Now Cassie gets glimpses of the possible future and is learning to navigate those visions when she happens upon a trio of teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor) who have become the target of Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a man with incredible spider super-powers connected to Cassie’s mom (who died in the Peruvian forest in the ‘70s searching for a very special spider). Now Cassie has to figure out what is going on and help protect the three women from this menace. The cinematographer for “Madame Web” is Mauro Fiore, who previously was DP for “Avatar,” “The Island,” and “Training Day,” amongst many others. While the film is competently shot, there is no visual style to anything except rotating the camera occasionally to match Sims’ spider-y moves on ceilings, which is surprising given Fiore’s pedigree. But the usual engrossing imagery is absent here, washed out like so much of “Madame Web.” There are jokes but they mostly land flat. There are charismatic actors, but they aren’t given much to do or substantive characters to inhabit. Johnson fares the best out of anyone in this cast (except maybe Scott), as she is allowed to be a sarcastic, aloof, and overwhelmed person in a sea of craziness…but that interesting characterization is drained away as time rolls on, eventually leaving a stilted husk of a person offering empty line readings. There are a couple of scenes where the three teens are allowed to just play off each other, but those are cut short and even then they aren’t particularly successful at being clever or that entertaining. But still they had promise! Director Clarkson has worked in the superhero genre before (on Marvel’s Netflix shows “Jessica Jones” and “The Defenders”), so should be well-versed in creating some dynamic scenes between interesting characters, or at least some sort of engaging action. Unfortunately, none of the fight scenes land with any sort of impact. It’s not because most of them are part of Cassie’s precognitive visions and therefore “don’t happen”—it’s because they are lifelessly executed and poorly edited without any sort of appealing nature to them. In general, fight scenes don’t have to be revolutionary to be interesting; they just have to have some visual flair or at least involve characters that we the audience are invested in. But seeing as how there’s no one in this film that feels like a real person or at least captivating enough to care about, all the action sequences and grandiose stunt set pieces fall horribly flat. “Madame Web” is incredibly awkward as well. It belabors the point of foreshadowing that Ben’s sister-in-law, May Parker (Emma Roberts) is pregnant with someone (massive wink), but to what end? What is the point of tying it into Peter Parker (without ever saying that name) so much? That’s not a fun Easter Egg but a pathetic attempt at making the events of the movie somehow interesting by proxy. It’s not just that shoehorning in of everyone’s favorite wall-crawler that is awkward. Sims is dubbed pretty terribly (possibly by Rahim, but certainly in a lot of ADR) to the point of sounding like a ‘90s DTV action villain. Which should be fun…if it were a stylistic choice and not just something clunky. Sims’ assistant (Zosia Mamet) is given an inordinate amount of screentime (and terrible, cliched hacker lingo) that never really pays off in any way. And the dialogue is just constantly full of awkward exposition or some other weird phrasing that tries to sell themes of power (and spiders!) in off-putting ways that make it all feel wrong. Comic book movies reinvigorated the post-credits scene— there’d be a little tease into the future, usually with something that seems awkward if thought about too long, but could be enticing enough to see what’s to come. Those scenes are rarely visually interesting, often peppered with some attempts at humor, and rely on audiences caring about what happened so as to be invested in what happens next. “Madame Web” doesn’t have any credits scenes because it is a post-credits scene writ large. And when ballooned up from three minutes to two hours, the strain is noticeable. Hollow jokes ring false, dialogue buckles underneath the burden of carrying that much plot and explanation, and there’s no arresting imagery to engross viewers. “Madame Web” isn’t the worst, but it’s lack of immediacy and heart make it a disastrous slog.

"Mar 5, 2024"," We all know studios have some kind of say in the films that they distribute and release. Why wouldn't they? After all, they are ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into productions and feel that gives them a seat at the table behind the camera. When studios have as much of a say as Sony clearly did with Madame Web, it almost makes a review impossible, because this is a true mess of a film. Narratively, Madame Web is rudimentary but feels almost monolithic compared to the screenplay, but the horrifyingly bad editing and tonal shifts smack firmly of a film that was completed before being butchered by execs wanting to ride the wave of the superhero genre - and in doing so, have created the banalest, most generic, and pointless release the genre has seen in many, many years. The positives are few and far between sadly as the action and production design do nothing to lift the film from its basement, and the performances...well, sigh. Dakota Johnson must have a large cellular bill as she is phoning this in from the get-go, especially when having to participate in anything superhero-related. That said, I find Johnson to be gleefully watchable even in films such as this (her press tour performance was worth all the money, however). Sydney Sweeney, who I think is a very strong actress, is abysmal alongside O'Connor, and I don't recall Merced really doing anything, but special praise must go to Tahir Rahim who was handed a terrible role and simply had no idea what to do with it. Superhero film villains are often derided as weak and one-dimensional and nothing in Madame Web proves this to be wrong. I had hoped that Madame Web would at least be entertaining even if it was bad, but the film takes itself so seriously that even finding moments of levity feels like a bridge too far - though maybe the hamfisted references to Peter Parker count as comedy? Whatever the case from the beginning to its wholly unearned ending, Madame Web struggles against a studio that is desperate to create its own universe, but seemingly has no concept of how to do so. Making good films is a start, and Sony, with their live-action Spidey universe, is failing badly at that.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 2, 2024"," That might explain why “Madame Web” — the inauspicious directorial debut of S.J. Clarkson — offers up a sophomoric, overwritten screenplay that constantly re-summarizes the plot and comments on the obvious. Madame Web began in 1980 as an unusual supporting superhero in Marvel’s Spider-Man comic books. Blind and elderly, she exercised clairvoyant powers while being connected to a life-support system resembling a spiderweb. In this stand-alone origin story, Cassandra Webb (Johnson) works as a New York paramedic alongside her bland buddy Ben (Adam Scott). She begins to inexplicably experience violent visions of the immediate near future. She does not know what we know, having seen how her researcher/explorer mother died in 1973 Peru while looking for a rare spider rumored to possess great healing powers. Her killer, a duplicitous guide (and dull, one-note villain) named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), uses the spider venom to transform into a wealthy, evil ninja with Spider-Man powers. He vows to find and kill three superhero-costumed females he foresees will assassinate him. Meanwhile, Cassie spots three familiar-looking teens in the subway: soft-spoken Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), street savvy Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and undocumented illegal immigrant Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Cassie sees Sims kill the girls in a futuristic vision. She quickly — and too easily — persuades them to follow her off the train. Five writers received credit for this Marvel mess and its collection of braindead bromides such as “No matter what happens, we need to work together!” and “Sometimes you must sacrifice yourself to save someone you love.” With his constantly roving cameras capturing incredible compositions, Oscar-winning cinematographer (and Palatine High School graduate) Mauro Fiore — assisted by the keen editing of Leigh “Fast & Furious” Folsom — elevates “Madame Web” to a watchable status.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024"," Even before it was released last week, the buzz was as negative as any movie in recent memory, with most of it aimed squarely at the film’s star, Dakota Johnson. The negativity continued after the film’s dismal performance at the box office on opening weekend, with some declaring it one of the worst films of all time. That’s why in one sense “Madame Web” proved to be a slightly pleasant surprise. It’s nowhere near as bad as the buzz might suggest (Hello, have you seen “Lisa Frankenstein?”). That’s not to say it’s good either. “Madame Web” is basically just a film that is there – it’s a passable way to kill two hours while watching something that is pretty average. “Madame Web” serves as an origin story with Johnson playing Cassie, a New York paramedic whose mother Constance (Kerry Bishé) died shortly after Cassie’s birth while searching for a mysterious spider in the jungles of Peru. Following a near-death experience, Cassie starts to have visions and the capability to see into the future. This leads her to cross paths with three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Conner) who are unknowingly the target of Constance’s former assistant Ezekiel (Tahir Rahim). His wrath is driven by visions that the three girls will eventually become superheroes and will be responsible for his death. “Madame Web” is an origin story with a lot of origin – way more exposition and set up for the future of these characters than perhaps any film in this genre. And there lies one of the biggest problems with the film – it’s hard to get invested in a superhero movie that is practically void of superheroes. First-time feature film director S.J. Clarkson does try to spice things up by playing with the time loop element and staging a couple of action sequences, but it all feels like it’s been taken from a film cliche assembly line and pieced together to create something resembling a comic book movie. The cast is going through the motions too, although Johnson continues to develop a low-key screen presence that makes her interesting to watch, even when it appears she’s bored with the material as well. The result is “Madame Web” isn’t really the disaster some have labeled it. It’s basically just a forgettable misfire that will be a cinematic afterthought within a few weeks.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024"," Spider-Man is easily one of the most popular superheroes in existence. Among the many things that fans love about the revered webslinger is the amazing array of characters who fill out his world. Allies, villains, non-superpowered side characters – the list is long and diverse. Over the years many have found their ways onto the big screen and one thing has become abundantly clear, some characters have fared considerably better than others when it comes to Spidey movies. Adding to the list of those who haven’t fared well is Madame Web, a supporting character in the Spidey comics who now gets her own movie in Sony’s Spider-Man cinematic universe. Unfortunately what we get is an exercise in futility that stretches the Spider-Man brand beyond its limits. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and (somehow) written by a team of FOUR screenwriters, “Madame Web” is a hodgepodge of fair to downright terrible ideas, thrown together to form one of the more excruciating superhero movies to endure. Opening in 1973, deep in the Amazonian jungles of Peru, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) provides security for a science and research expedition led by Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé). There they discover a new species of spider with healing properties capable of curing all kinds of diseases. In true villain form, Ezekiel turns on Constance and their team, claiming the discovery for himself and leaving Constance for dead. A mysterious local tribe attempt to save Constance and her unborn baby using some kind of magical spider venom. But Constance dies while delivering her daughter, Cassie. From there we jump ahead to 2003 as what happened in the thirty years between is mostly left unanswered. Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a New York City paramedic working alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott). When an emergency call ends with Cassie having a near-death experience, she begins having strange and unexplainable visions. She first tries to dismiss them as simple déjà vu. But over time she realizes her visions are actually glimpses into the future. Meanwhile Ezekiel, who has premonition and physical powers all his own, has set his sights on three unconnected teenagers, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Carazon (Isabela Merced), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). Ezekiel has been haunted by visions of the future where these girls (somehow) gain their own spider-powers and use them to kill him. Determined to prevent his death, Ezekiel sets out to kill the girls first. But when Cassie’s newfound powers reveals Ezekiel’s plans, she’s compelled to save and protect the girls, all while trying to understand her strange abilities. As vague and poorly defined as it is, there are hints of an original and potentially interesting premise. But Clarkson and the team of writers never get beyond teasing those ideas. Instead their movie meanders to the point of tedium. The characters are dull and uninspired as is the action which is hampered by poor staging, choppy editing, and mediocre-to-bad CGI. The dreadful script doesn’t help things. It’s full of gaping holes, narrative shortcuts, and some astonishingly bad dialogue. The glaring oversights (and there are many of them) are especially funny. Take Cassie being wanted by police for kidnapping the girls she actually saved. Yet she drives all over New York City in a stolen cab, walks around in broad daylight, gets flights in and out of the country without the cops every getting wind. It’s as if the movie completely forgets the whole police angle. “Madame Web” is capped off with an unimaginative and utterly preposterous finale that leaves you scratching your head at how poorly its pieces come together. There’s no real stakes and as a result there’s no real suspense. Add to it our general lack of investment and you have a doomed ending with no real chance of offering up a satisfying conclusion. Its best quality is that it mercifully ends what is a flailing mess of a movie – one that seems perfectly content with riding Spider-Man’s coattails rather than trying for something smart, original, and coherent. “Madame Web” is in theaters now. Keith, I had a premonition that this would be garbage.  I do not like Dakota Johnson’s acting ability.  Too bad a superhero movie got wasted.  Did you notice in the pic above the Calvin Klein product placement? Keith, I’m both a big Marvel and Dakota Johnson fan. I found this awful. Just. Awful. Couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like AI wrote it. Marketing folks were more than “devious” when it came to the trailer – thought the girls were going to suit up and be way more active in the movie. Looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is set in, and maybe somehow the producers were actually reaching for a “retro” feel? And as for our star…Dakota is much better suited to Cha Cha Real Smooth and Peanut Butter Falcon-type roles. A superheroine…nope. Oh the whole thing with the girls in their superhero suits certainly teased something that was never delivered. I swear, I sat there wondering how something like that got made.  Exactly. It is so hard for me to believe there were any high-level executives of the studio in the screening room for the unspooling of the final product. I dreaded this as I’m sure this was a painful experience.  I feel bad for the people involved as Sony just doesn’t know how to create superhero films without getting in their own way.  I’ve only seen Venom in its entirely of these films and that was alright but I don’t have interest in anything else.  I’d like avoid Morbius as long as I live. Great review! Yes I skipped this one in theaters for multiple reasons. I’ve long lost faith in Marvel and stopped watching their films many years ago. The last Marvel movie that I actually enjoyed in theaters was “Endgame” about six years ago. I’ve never cared for any of Dakota Johnson’s work and the trailer for this gave me little hope. I might watch it on streaming some day if there’s nothing else on, but no plans to see it at all. I hate to be this blunt, but it’s astonishingly bad. Even when taking a surface-level approach to it, you can’t miss the many big holes and shortcuts.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024"," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  Making its area premiere at The Brattle Theatre is “Pictures of Ghosts” from acclaimed Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho, who caught audiences’ attention with his modern-day, llano-based spaghetti western “Bacurau” (2019). Filho’s current effort, a quieter, more personal one to be sure, is a love letter to cinema and the town of Recife, where he grew up. The poetic documentary follows the transformation of the city from its cultural heyday to the decline of its classic movie palaces. Of the many appearing in the film is countrywoman and “Bacurau” actor Sonia Braga. The film plays an extended run Friday through Tuesday. Later in the week is an olio of events, including the “Leap Day” film poll winners (from among films never screened at The Brattle) that yielded the beauty pageant road-trip-to-hell sojourn “Little Miss Sunshine” (2006), and the 1997 Japanese psychological horror flick “Perfect Blue,” in which the lines between reality and alter-reality blur for an aspiring singer. Grrl Haus Cinema sets up on Wednesday for a lineup of experimental shorts made by women, nonbinary, trans and genderqueer artists. On the free front, on Tuesday, the Independent Film Festival Boston swoops in for a screening of “Spaceman” directed by Johan Renck (of the “Chernobyl” series) and starring Adam Sandler as the first Czech astronaut (yup, you read that right) in space. The impressive ensemble includes Carey Mulligan (“Promising Young Woman), Paul Dano (“There Will Be Blood”), Lena Olin (“Chocolat”) and Isabella Rossellini (“Blue Velvet”). For the Monday Elements of Cinema screening it’s “Silent Running” (1972), one of two features directed by special-effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull (“Blade Runner”). One could argue it’s the original eco-terrorist film: The setting is a deep-space scow carrying Earth’s last vestige of flora, cared for by Bruce Dern as the gruff tree hugger taking a stand along with a trio of cute robots named Huey, Dewey and Louie. The post-screening conversation will be led by Matthew Nash, professor of visual arts at Lesley University. While both screenings are free, tickets are limited and go quickly. The New Hollywood Retro Replay Tuesday at the Landmark Kendall Square Theatre is the one that cemented Clint Eastwood as a box office mega force, “Dirty Harry” (1971), directed by Don Siegel (“Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “The Shootist”). Eastwood’s antiestablishment cop, dead set on putting bad guys away with his iconic .44 Magnum hand cannon, captured and cultivated the machismo of the era. He acts regardless of rules and regs in tracking down a serial killer known as Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), who taunts the San Francisco police with each bloody notch. Clint’s laconic nature and the cocky, take-no-shit one-liners made this maverick-cop thriller a fist full of dollars then and still packs a wow. Considering the fantastic cast and punchy setup, this is a bit of a toe stub for Ethan Coen in his second outing (his other being the 2022 rock-doc “Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind”) since splitting in 2019 with his brother Joel from a partnership that generated some of the most revered films of the recent cinematic past – “Fargo” (1996) and “No Country for Old Men” (2007) among them. These drive-away dolls are lesbians on a road trip to hell (well, Florida) to deliver a car and visit one’s nana. The car contains wanted cargo (a MacGuffin with shades of “Repo Man” that doesn’t have the greatest of payoffs) with a bunch of shady goons in hot pursuit. The lines between the sexually liberated Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and demure bestie Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) are drawn starkly in nearly every scene; along the way Jamie brings hookups back to their various motel rooms as the bookish Marian heads to the lobby to read Henry James during playtime. It’s a buddy movie with romantic possibilities – a soccer club spin-the-bottle makeout session forces the issue. Coen and his co-writer, wife Tricia Cooke, who edited projects such as “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” (2000) and “The Big Lebowski” (1998), borrow too much from their shared canon, namely C.J. Wilson and Joey Slotnick as idiosyncratic goons (and that is literally how the are referred to in the credits) whose opposite approaches to dealing with an escalating situation feel ripped slackly from “Fargo.” Qualley, so good in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” (2019) and last year’s “Sanctuary,” furthers her blossoming CV with an energetic, scene-pushing presence bolstered by an affable southern twang, and Viswanathan makes for a good offset. The chemistry between the two carries the uneven mishmash as it stumbles early and struggles to regain its quirky vibe. Also in the mix, in small raucous parts, are Matt Damon as a Florida Man, Colman Domingo as the goon handler, Pedro Pascal on ice, Beanie Feldstein (“Booksmart”) as Jamie’s brash law enforcement ex and Bill Camp as the car dispatcher no one listens to. At least this not-quite-fully-baked road comedy with a prize dildo set gone missing is a fast 84 minutes. (Tom Meek) At Somerville Theatre, 55 Davis Square, and AMC Assembly Row 12, 395 Artisan Way, Assembly Square, Somerville. After a near-death experience, paramedic Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson), starts experiencing déjà vu and other ESP strangeness. Set in 2003 Queens, Cassie has a vision of some guy named Ezekiel Sims, a muscular man who dons a black costume and kills three teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor), and at the premonition point intervenes and protects them. That inspires her to explore the source of her and Ezekiel’s powers, which predate the birth of Peter Parker, the Spider-Man most of us know. The Sony Spider Universe that “Madame Web” is a part of includes “Venom” (2018), “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” (2021) and “Morbius” (2022), and while it might not be the worst of the lot, it’s so low-energy, lackluster and middling that it may be the least memorable. Except for Adam Scott and Zosia Mamet in small, quirky parts, the cast has no chemistry and most line reads feel leaden and stiff. Director S.J. Clarkson, who has delivered strong visuals in television series that include Marvel’s “Jessica Jones” (2015-2019) and “The Defenders” (2017) on Netflix, resorts to regurgitating images from the X-Men franchise and the Ancient One of “Doctor Strange” (2016). The film does maintain one inscrutable, unsolved mystery: Sony’s reason to rehire “Morbius” co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to write another script (along with Claire Parker – no relation to Peter). The film’s only winning narrative asset is the tension of how without any physical superpowers, Cassie can trump Ezekiel’s daunting physical prowess. (Sarah G.

"Feb 26, 2024"," They’re just trolling us now. Hollywood. The entertainment-industrial complex. We gave them our geeky all: our money, our attention, our time. From 80s GenX kids *raises hand* who leaned hard into mega franchises — Star Wars, Back to the Future, and beyond — to the early Zoomers who came of cinematic age with the beginning of the MCU in the post 9/11 era… some of us even molded our entire personalities around the wonderfully engaging, smartly fantastical stories they told us. That was always going to be a bad idea, and now that bad idea is slapping all of us in the face: We gave them our hearts, and now they’re giving us garbage. Because they think they can get away with it. Because they took us for granted. Look: superhero fatigue might not have been a thing with audiences if the movies had just, you know, kept up. Not been junk. Yes, making movies is hard, but it’s not that hard, because cinemaniacs are always able to forgive a lack of resources. But a lack of authenticity? A lack of genuine enthusiasm? Not so much. These movies didn’t need to get bloated — bigger, ahem, isn’t always better — and they didn’t need to require homework, like watching all the ancillary streaming series. This isn’t how it had to be. They could have… just… given us good, honest stories. Madame Web? It’s almost impossible to see this travesty as a goodnatured mistake. This is a movie sprouted solely from the depths of corporate cynicism. From Sony attempting to glom onto the success for another studio of the MCU even though the company owned nothing of Marvel Comics except Spider-Man. And so in recent years we’ve gotten Spider-Man–adjacent flicks from Sony including Morbius and two Venom flicks. And now Madame Web. They’ve all been nothing but pop-culture jokes, and Sony doesn’t seem to grasp why. The movie’s Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson, bless: Bad Times at the El Royale, Fifty Shades Freed) is a paramedic in New York City in 2003. Why 2003? Is it to capitalize on the very solemn, very serious hangover from 9/11 in which the city was of course still wallowing a mere two years later? Especially for a paramedic, whom we might expect would have seen some traumatic shit that day? LOL, not at all. As far as I can determine, it’s so the movie can insert itself into the Tom Holland–as–Spider-Man timeline as established by the MCU. Because Cassie’s EMS partner is called Ben Parker (Adam Scott, the best thing here: The Disaster Artist, Fun Mom Dinner). Whose sister Mary (Emma Roberts: Palo Alto, We’re the Millers) is hugely pregnant and about to pop with a baby boy whose name she has not yet settled on. I’ll spell out the tease for those who don’t get it (though I’m not sure why you’d have any interest in reading a review of Madame Web if you didn’t): the blatant implication is that Mary is about to give birth to Peter Parker, who will become Spider-Man a decade and a half later, while he is being raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt Martha May. (There’s no Martha May here, but Ben does ominously drop the news that he’s just “met someone.” *groan*) [ETA: Martha? Why did I say that name? Why did I say that name?!] The desperation to ride the Spider-Man coattails is pathetic enough, but what are the odds that Ben Parker would happen to have two different unrelated people in his life who have acquired superpowers through a spider bite? Cassie’s spider wasn’t radioactive, just a naturally exotic denizen of the Amazonian rain forest — see, her mom (Kerry Bishé: The Fitzgerald Family Christmas, Argo) was researching these spiders while hugely pregnant, and was bitten just before giving birth and dying. And then, when Cassie, bizarrely, steps out of the 2003 action to take a side trip to Peru to investigate, she meets the local tribesman (José María Yazpik) who helped her mom and knows all about the spider bite, and gravely intones: “When you take on the responsibility, great power will come.” It’s like what Peter Parker learns about great power and great responsibility, but flipped, or something. Honestly, it’s exhausting trying to find ways to boil down all the convoluted, coincidence-laden nonsense of this movie in a way that doesn’t make me sound incoherent. Watching it all unfurl onscreen is kinda gobsmacking, yet also way duller than you’d imagine — it’s not even so bad it’s fun. And I’ve barely scratched the surface! Never mind Uncle Ben being knee-deep in spider-people — after the events of this movie, when Peter Parker’s Spider-Man comes along later, the people of New York shoulda been, like, What, more weirdoes in spider spandex? Cuz, like… Cassie ends up mentoring three teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced [Dora and the Lost City of Gold], and Celeste O’Connor) to become spider-themed crime fighters, and their origin story — which is also what this movie is about — involves battling wealthy businessman Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim [Mary Magdalene, Grand Central], shamefully wasted), who also has spider powers and spider spandex. The movie has no idea why Sims is evil or what he does in his spider spandex when he’s not trying to kill these girls. The movie doesn’t even know what sort of “business” he’s in. It’s all a bafflingly lazy stew of comic-book clichés. (One of the girls mentions, totally randomly, her “Uncle Jonah,” the only purpose of which is to make you think of J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper editor who will later employ Peter Parker as a photographer.) We can “blame” screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (who together wrote Gods of Egypt and Dracula Untold), Claire Parker, Kerem Sanga, and S.J. Clarkson. (Clarkson also directs, her feature debut after a long career as a TV director. This movie often has the small, cheap look of a 1990s cable show.) But they will have had little control over much of what we are subjected to here. It’s plain that Sony actually had little trust in fan interest in the Madame Web character as she is depicted in the comics: she is an elderly woman, disabled because of an autoimmune and neuromuscular disorder, with multiple psychic superpowers (none of this the result of a spider bite!). She could have been, onscreen, another Charles Xavier, X-Men’s Professor X. But that would have required casting a much older woman in a very different sort of story. The beginning of where this all went so disastrously wrong is right there: Sony didn’t really want to make an authentic Madame Web movie. It just wanted to wring whatever it could out of its sliver of Marvel Comics. Kerry Bishé gives one of the best TV performances of all time in Halt and Catch Fire, especially as the show leans into its final season. I really, really wish she was getting better work. Venom, I’ve never cared for personally, but is definitely the most popular Spider-Man villain who was introduced since Spidey’s classic era, and has carried several solo miniseries and ongoing series. It wasn’t crazy to think he might carry a movie or two. Even Morbius has had a long tradition of existence to Marvel Comics as well as the community at large. He too has been a headliner at times, albeit a B-lister at best. Not the craziest idea for a solo film among the Spider-characters Sony has available, though maybe 10-15 years late to ride the Twilight wave of vampire protagonists. Madame Web has had something like 50 appearances over 40-some years, all as a supporting character and (unsurprisingly for an elderly paralyzed woman in an action-dominated genre) never a fan favorite. The only thing that makes any sense to me is that they wanted to do a Birds of Prey knockoff with three minor Spider-ladies and Madame Web as “the woman in the chair” supporting them. Not too bad an idea, actually, but why they thought audiences would be excited about a non-viable prequel to the viable concept, I don’t understand. I guess it makes sense as the same sort of hubris that led to “Universal’s Dark Universe” and other attempts to artificially engineer the success of the MCU, but you’d think Sony would have gotten the message about such attempts by now. If I was in their shoes, I’d just make a Spider-Woman movie, using whichever one of the half-dozen or more examples strike their fancy. (You’re right about NYC having a plethora of Spider-people!) Spider-Gwen/Ghost Spider seems like a no-brainer to me, as she’s popular, including with kids, and has a great visual look that doesn’t seem like a total copy of Peter Parker’s suit. I’m a completionist. I tend to start series at the beginning rather than “when it got good”. Board game Kickstarter absolutely saw me coming with its exclusive add-ons. Left alone I’d probably have got enthusiastically into the MCU in spite of not being much of a superhero fan. But the more they said “and you have to watch this side series and read that comic”, and the more I tried to do that and saw those side series’s interesting ideas being sunk under the weight of Generic Superhero Stuff (done on a TV series budget), the less interested I became even in the core films. A reference can be a neat line that makes sense in context, which also gives a little dopamine hit to someone who knows where it came from; or it can be something which brings the film to a halt while your attention is forced onto it, so that you know you are Missing Out by not having watched More Superheroes Angsting and Occasionally Hitting Things Season 5. Go home and stream it now! What’s funny to me is that, at least in my perception* the most recent batch of MCU movies and TV shows have actually been much less interconnected. With The Marvels, for instance, I think audiences will totally get Kamala Khan’s deal whether they saw Ms. Marvel or not (though it should encourage them to go back and watch it.) And you might logically think Secret Invasion would be “required reading” for The Marvels, but it’s completely not, to the point that if you watched both, you’d be confused at how the show isn’t acknowledged in any way whatsoever. And I don’t think you need to know much more than “You know who the Hulk is, right, from the Avengers?  Works with Captain America?  Jen’s his cousin.” to fully enjoy She-Hulk.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024"," But for an editorial swerve, Madame Web could have been Hamlet. By which I mean cursed with a line that has the audience on such tenterhooks waiting for it they almost miss the rest. In the end we don’t actually get to hear the much-mocked quote from the trailer – “Ezekiel Sims; he was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died” – though we do get to see mom with him in the Amazon while researching spiders right before she died.  Cassie Webb’s mum does then die in the Amazon, in 1973, after being bitten by a massive spider and then immediately giving birth to a baby. Oops I mean being bitten by a spider and then giving birth to a massive baby. 30 Years later, Cassie has grown into a grumpy paramedic with only one jacket, though this is 2003 before fast fashion really hits. She has a pet cat which is even bigger than she was as a baby, a sweet apartment no one more junior than a plastic surgeon could now afford, and excellent driving skills, which also seem to have fallen by the wayside in the intervening 20 years.  An unexpected dip in the river in a crashed car leaves her dead for several minutes, and, once reanimated, blessed/cursed with seeing the future; though her immediate superpower seems to be the ability to pop balloons remotely while eating a sausage on a stick. And, well, it’s not very cinematic but she could have made a fortune at kids’ birthday parties if she’d just stuck to that.  Yes Shark Exorcist, you retain your crown as worst film I have ever seen, demonic nuns and all. Madame Web is however bookended by scenes of such dreadful ridiculousness, and such appalling acting, that if you fell asleep into your popcorn in the middle you might indeed think it was a bona fide stinker. Even the middle bit, while not terrible, never reaches any great heights. Actually the whole film feels like a two hour pilot for a superhero series aimed at smallish children. Not much happens, and what does happen we tend to see twice, as a good chunk is Cassie seeing the future, then living through it in an attempt to stop it. (In Greek mythology Cassandra was cursed by Apollo to see the future, but for no one to believe her.) Taking some time out to recover from the weird stuff that starts happening to her, Cassie starts having premonitions on a train, soon realising they involve three disparate teenage girls she then has to save from the clutches of a scuttlesome Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim).  The dialogue is often awful, and the movie moves forward in fits, starts and jerks, like they suddenly realised they need to explain something or get us somewhere. Cassie’s trip to Peru to reconnect with her dead mum is embarrassing, like a wellness therapy mini-break sold to wealthy Guardian readers. Though it’s not as embarrassing as Ezekiel Sims, a villain who makes Greta Thunberg look like Thanos. Crawling along ceilings and down walls he reminded me of those tiny sticky rubber figures – so beloved of British mums when tasked with filling 30 party bags for under a quid each – that “walk” head over heels down the window. Still, while Dakota Johnson is miscast (her style of acting just doesn’t work when you have to believe in an alternate universe, which generally seem more sincere than our own) I came to quite enjoy her deadpan delivery of Cassie’s general indifference to the world, whether doing entirely normal things or literally saving someone’s life.  The three young women she’s trying to save from Ezekiel’s black-spidersuited baddie – Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) – all have an existing connection to Cassie, and are, like the best teenagers, both perfectly nice and also extremely annoying; in this case mainly because they order a massive meal in a diner, putting themselves in huge danger, then don’t bother to eat the food. Literally every woman I know could be dining on a sinking Titanic in 1912 or picnicking on the sides of Vesuvius in 79AD and would resolutely gobble up every last crumb before leaving, so even in the weird world of superheroes that’s jumping the shark (exorcist).

"Feb 23, 2024"," Unlike some (many?), I haven’t grown weary of superhero films as a genre. What I have grown exhausted by are specifically Sony-made Spider-Verse movies that try to walk the line between standalone works while also incorporating just enough Spier-Man-adjacent references to frustrate and infuriate viewers. I wish the makers of Madame Web had simply stayed away from all things Spider-Man (which is virtually impossible, once you understand the full breadth of the story). Instead, they drop in what they think are sly nods and easter eggs that are neither subtle nor clever. Much like the rest of the screenplay (it took four people to write this!), the references are ham-fisted and all-around sloppy, and leave us with the promise of a better sequel that I can almost guaranteed you will never be made. Let me give an example: the film is set very specifically in 2003, and there’s a character named Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), who is probably eight months pregnant. Please feel free to do the math on who her baby is. She’s married to a man (whom we never see) whose brother is Ben Parker (Adam Scott) and who is really looking forward to being an uncle to this newborn—all the fun, none of the responsibility (that’s what he thinks). And no, I don’t consider any of this spoiler territory because the character names are right there on IMDB, and Scott is prominently featured in the trailers. All of this nonsense is a tease that never pays off. At one point, there’s a baby shower for Mary, during which the women in attendance have to guess the baby’s name. The game is interrupted before the inevitable name drop, so I’m thinking that reveal is coming at the end of the film (which it probably was at one point). But no, there aren’t even any mid- or post-credits scenes in Madame Web to tuck away such a choice nugget of web-slinging joy. But of course, anything involving the Parkers is shoehorned into the mostly unrelated story of Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), whose mother (Kerry Bishé) was killed in the rainforests of Peru while searching for a rare breed of spider whose venom might be the key to curing any number of diseases. She is also very pregnant, and in the company of security specialist Ezekiel Sims (French actor Tahar Rahim, most recently seen in Napoleon), who betrays her when she finds the spider and accidentally shoots her before absconding with the specimen. But a tribe of locals with mysterious spider-like powers (and outfits that look a lot like Spider-Man’s duds, if they were made on Gilligan’s Island) show up to try and save her by injecting her with the aforementioned spider venom. The mom dies but baby Cassandra lives and is sent home to live out her years in New York's foster care system. Cassandra grows up to become a paramedic (alongside partner Ben Parker) and after a near-death experience in which she almost drowns, she starts having visions of things that will happen in the immediate future, things she can change if she does something different or gets someone else to change their behavior. She sees herself and other people die, and so she does all that she can to save everyone in her visions. We also find out that Ezekiel is a little more adept at seeing the future than using the spider venom repeatedly, and he envisions three young women in various spider-themed costumes and powers defeating him in a fight. So, he hires a computer expert (Zosia Mamet) to track them down so he can kill them. Ezekiel actually functions as a costumed individual who leaps and crawls and has the general acrobatic skills of a certain Spider-Man who won’t actually exist for a couple of decades. During the course of her day-to-day happenings, Cassandra just happens to run into all three of these young women (minus their powers) around the city, including a rich kid whose parents are never around, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney, complete with schoolgirl outfit); Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who has been living with her immigrant grandfather illegally in Cassandra’s building; and skater punk and general troublemaker Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). Cassandara saves their lives when Ezekiel attacks them on a train, and they are basically stuck together for the rest of the film, although the police seem to think Cassandra has kidnapped them. Like many aspects of Madame Web, it’s a running gag that never pays off. As mentioned, most of the film is about the potential for something cool that we never get. The only time we see the three young women in their admittedly cool superhero costumes are in visions of the future. We’re not even given their future superhero names (for the record, two of them are different incarnations of Spider-Woman in the comic books, while Corazon goes by the name Araña), probably because they don’t want to make fans mad that these are in any way Spider-man related. In broader terms, first-time feature director S.J. Clarkson wants us seeing the Madame Web identity as someone who uses her powers to see the connections between people before the world makes them happen. As the film goes on, Cassandra is able to see further into the future and make more sweeping changes and adjustments to the world-to-come that makes her immensely powerful and able to lead the team of young women to fight crime down the road, presumably enhancing them with venom from this rare spider. Who the hell knows? Placing the Parkers in close proximity to Cassandra seems to serve no purpose, at least not in this story, but the implication is that somewhere down the line this powerful spider might be the reason that this universe’s Peter gets his powers, and not some radioactive arachnid. Again, it’s all about teasing the potential without actually seeing it to any kind of satisfying conclusion. And it makes the entirely of Madame Web frustrating in its best moments and downright infuriating in its worst. I also realized while watching this movie is that, while Dakota Johnson is fully capable of turning in great performances when given great material, she’s not quite capable of elevating mediocre material. She’s as bored and uninvested in her character and this movie as we are, and it clearly shows. Madame Web feels like it was chopped up and re-assembled from another, probably equally poor film, and the result is a wildly uneven, uninspired mess. Did you enjoy this post?

"Feb 22, 2024"," 
Written by five writers (including Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless of the aforementioned Morbius), Madame Web operates in a similar vein in all the wrong ways. It's not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, instead merely being a cog in Sony's live action Spider-Man Without Spider-Man-Verse, a half-hearted, corporate character rights-based attempt to expand the world of the web-slinging Spider-Man — without him being around — by focusing on characters adjacent to him. This time it's Cassandra Webb, gamely played by Dakota Johnson, who is living in New York City in 2003. She works as a paramedic with the superhero genre's most memorable modern uncle, Ben Parker (because of course she does), while largely keeping to herself and her cat. Briefly played by a wasted Adam Scott before he vanishes almost entirely from the movie, this movie's Uncle Ben is the first of many bizarre and painfully hamfisted references to other better superhero stories. And all of them land with dull thud after dull thud.
 
The more self-contained main narrative of Madame Web begins with Cassandra's mother who died giving birth to her after going out into the Peruvian Amazon in 1973 to research spiders believed to have healing properties. The awkward line explaining this — which was in the trailer and endlessly skewered because of the stilted way it sounds — is merely the beginning of the movie's unending and woefully poorly written dialogue. Much of this clunky verbiage is given to the otherwise solid actor Tahar Rahim, who plays the film's sad excuse for a villain, Ezekiel Sims. He delivers said lines while he tries to search out three teenagers that he believes will kill him in the future. It then falls to Cassandra to save them following an accident at work where she drowns and comes back to life — only to suddenly be able to see through time.
 
While not the most imaginative of premises, this sounds like it could be almost schlocky superhero fun on paper. Instead, it's a slog, as the film goes through the same motions over and over again with no spark to any of it. When Cassandra begins to discover her power, the way this is dragged out is more tiresome than thrilling. Though quite straightforward, the film explains her powers to us multiple times, demonstrating a severe lack of trust in its audience. When Cassandra then properly meets the three youths, Julia (Spokane's own Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), they feel like cardboard cutout characters with no chemistry. This becomes increasingly perplexing as they get ditched multiple times, making it feel like even the film doesn't know what to do with them. The action they do get up to all feels empty — either brief or scattered CGI nonsense. Even a clumsy post-9/11 surveillance angle feels wildly undercooked for all that it is supposedly gesturing toward.
 
If there is one small saving grace, it is Johnson. She has been great in films like the surprisingly stellar Suspiria remake and the regrettably buried Am I OK?, though this film doesn't even let her have fun with its powers. One early scene at a baby shower sees her getting a laugh on delivery alone, but that is soon forgotten in the mess to come. Even if you overlook some of the technical distractions — like entire lines of dialogue that have clearly been rerecorded and are not actually being spoken by the characters — paying attention does the experience no favors either. While much has been made of the looming death of the superhero subgenre, Madame Web is the film that truly feels like it may put the genre in its grave for a bit. But like the film's protagonist, it will likely be resurrected again. One just hopes it has more life than this.

"Feb 22, 2024"," The year is 2004, and you are 16. It’s the end of July, so to escape the sweltering heat, you and your friends see a movie at the mall. The movie is Catwoman, starring Halle Berry, but it could be anything. All you want is to be in a place with air conditioning that isn’t your house. You and your friends spend so much on chips and salsa at the mall Mexican joint and cheap jewelry at Claire’s that you barely have enough wadded up cash from your summer job to cover the ticket. In years to come, you’ll have fond memories of those friends, the virgin strawberry daiquiri you ordered, and even the cheap jewelry. You will remember nothing about the movie, except that it was bad. The year is 2024, and you’re 35. It’s February, and to avoid staring at the dead grass outside your window, you go to the theater with friends. The movie is Madame Web, starring Dakota Johnson, even though it should be something, anything else. Maybe it was the only movie that worked with everyone’s schedules, but like, come on. You’re an adult, you don’t want to see Poor Things or American Fiction?  You and your friends have full-time jobs, so you can get drinks beforehand, and even spring for popcorn at the theater. As the film starts, you’re hit with a wave of nostalgia, and it is decidedly mixed. The movie’s effects are terrible. The performances are flat, the character motivations barely existent.  And yet, as you watch, the flavors of restaurant salsa and syrupy mocktails flood your senses. The phantom weight of a tiger’s eye energy bracelet rubs against your wrist.  While the early-adolescent memories Madame Web inspires are good, the movie itself is undeniably a mess of the Catwoman variety. That the film is set in 2003 almost reads like an in-joke, because its whole vibe radiates the “how do we make a superhero movie/why are we even bothering?” ethos that defined comic book adaptations from 2000-2005.  If you’re looking for a nostalgic afternoon spent hooting at an incompetently made movie with your friends while you slam Clearly Canadians and cartons of Hot Tamales in the back row, you’re in for a treat. In all other cases, you’re better off spending your time and money elsewhere. Madame Web follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), an EMT in New York who grew up an orphan after her mom died while studying spiders in the Amazon. After a near-death experience, Cassie gets visions that allow her to see a few moments into the future. These visions bring her in contact with a trio of teens (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor) who are each being targeted by a creep in a suit (Tahar Rahim, trying and failing to force an American accent). It turns out Rahim’s baddie, Ezekiel Sims, is the guy who killed Cassie’s mom and made her an orphan! He’s after the girls because in the distant future, they’ll be superheroes (with powers they currently don’t possess, but whatever) and kill him. The plot threads binding these story beats together are as delicate as an actual spider’s web, albeit woven by a drunk spider. This is the kind of movie that repeats lines three different ways so that you can’t miss the implications of what people are saying, only to jump to a scene where a character drops a piece of exposition that makes no sense.  Characters behave in ways no normal human would. At one point Cassie decides she needs to go to Peru to find herself, and just…gets there seconds later (by now she’s wanted for presumably kidnapping the teens in her care, so how she managed to hop an international flight last minute during a historically heavy crackdown in airport security is beyond me). You see where this is going. Madame Web is “bad movie podcast” bad. It’s “Make-your-own-MST3K” bad. It’s also “Bored teenager with spending money” bad, which can be kind of fun if you’re a) a bored teenager, or b) a bored adult looking to replicate that experience, but with all of the things you couldn’t treat yourself to when you were a bored teenager. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024"," They’ll be laughing at this one for decades. Awkward, sloppy, staggeringly incoherent, there is little evidence to suggest that anyone involved in Madame Web knew what they were doing. The catastrophe extends all the way to the top of the queue. Dakota Johnson, struggling to hide her disinterest from the outset, takes an inherently awful screenplay and somehow makes it worse. Sydney Sweeney wears the look of a performer who forgot to learn her lines. Meanwhile, Tahar Rahim, the charisma-free villain of this cack-handed superhero tale, is forced to compete with some hideous post-production interference. The screen is fine; the projector isn’t broken, and the speakers are correctly fixed – it’s just bad overdubbing. Like, really, really bad. Sony did not arrange an advance press show for critics – I can see why. What, you may ask, is Madame Web? Comic enthusiasts will tell you she’s a mutant clairvoyant, a beloved staple of the Marvel cannon, and a helpful chum to your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. ​For the uninitiated, the cinematic version exists in some far-flung corner of Sony’s so-called Spider-Man Universe – which is to say that this bafflingly disorganised feature has nothing to do with the Tom Holland Spidey pictures. But it might be a distant cousin to the decrepit Venom franchise. Or something. It matters as much to me as it does to anyone else in this baggy, bewildering film. Squint your eyes and - if you’re lucky – you will just about make out the plot. A preposterous epilogue introduces Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé), a poorly sketched scientist researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon. The year is 1973 and a pregnant Constance is obsessed with rare arachnids and their alleged healing powers. Why, exactly, we’re not entirely sure – but everything goes sideways after Constance’s moustachioed explorer pal, Ezekiel Sims (Rahim), shoots her in the chest, steals her magic spider jar and leaves her for dead. Luckily for Constance, the magical Amazon spider people show up (stop giggling down the back) to save the baby. Fast-forward 30 years, and Cassie Webb (Johnson) is all grown-up. Our moody protagonist knows very little about her mum, and why she died chasing spiders in the jungle. Cassie isn’t really a people person, but hey, she’s a New York paramedic – a real-life superhero without the stupid costume. Her one and only friend at work (Adam Scott’s Ben Parker) thinks there’s more to Cassie than meets the eye, and he might be right. Across town, meanwhile, the slippery Mr Sims appears to have used his magical spider power to acquire a vast fortune. Alas, our grumpy baddie is haunted by nightly visions of his own death. Sims, it appears, will die at the hands of three Spider-Women, and so he makes it his mission to find them before they find him. What he doesn’t count on, however, is a stranger messing with his plan and, following a near-death experience on the job, Cassie acquires powers of her own. She can see into the future, which means she knows exactly what’s going to happen to the aforementioned Spider-Women (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced). I’d love to tell you more, but I might die of boredom. ​Some Marvel fans might appreciate the Ben Parker subplot. Mr Scott is, essentially, playing a younger, sexier Uncle Ben from the Spider-Man flicks. However, the inclusion of a story in which Ben and Cassie attend a baby shower for the unborn Peter Parker, ranks among the stupidest moves in comic book film history. Spare a thought for SJ Clarkson, the British filmmaker tasked with managing this sorry, pitiful exercise in blockbuster entertainment. Her film boasts no less than five screenwriter credits (always a troubling sign), and occasionally looks and sounds as if it is being edited in front of us. The relentless product placement is hilarious (three cheers for Pepsi, the film’s fizziest co-star). The action sequences are useless, the dialogue is all over the place, and the grainy special effects appear unfinished. It’s an ugly, toneless film, a superhero feature without charm, without humour, without spectacle. It seems unfair to point the finger at its leading woman – but Johnson is genuinely appalling. She looks fed up here, and guess what? I know the feeling. A film so bad, it would almost put you off going to the cinema.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024"," Madame Web is the third entry into a Spider-Man-less cinematic universe made up entirely of Spider-Man characters and the returns keep diminishing. For all of the goodwill that Tom Hardy‘s (inspired?) performance as Venom created, Morbius poisoned Sony’s efforts irreparably. When the Madame Web trailer debuted, the mood around the film soured to mockery. You know the line. When Julia (Sydney Sweeney) asks Cassie (Dakota Johnson) about a man in a Polaroid, Cassie replies, “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.” Fortunately, Madame Web isn’t the train wreck that Morbius was, but it is not an improvement either. Exposition replaces dialogue, franchise-seeding takes precedence over making characters authentic, and the action is underwhelming. Part of that may be by design. A lower budget means less spectacle and less spectacle helps Madame Web feel different from every other Marvel release. That works in the film’s favour as the stakes are relatively low. After a decade where every superhero climax means the end of the world, the survival of three women feels refreshingly low-key—even if those three women are future superheroes. Paramedic Cassie Webb survives an accident that leaves her with newfound powers: the ability to see forward in time. Cassie wastes no time in exploring her time loop gift and establishing a quick formula. Fail hilariously, quip, and try again. For that reason, the time loop sub-genre is popular to revisit. Whether the loops are about Bill Murray trying to be nice (Groundhog Day), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti surviving a wedding (Palm Springs), or Tom Cruise trying to survive at all (Edge of Tomorrow), the results are usually a hit with viewers. Madame Web risks threatening that streak. The plot, thin as it is, doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Cassie abandons her job with fellow EMT Ben (Adam Scott), using the time she has to unite Sweeney’s Spider-Woman, Isabela Merced’s Arana, and Celeste O’Connor as another Spider-Woman. The only problem? They aren’t those heroes yet, and they don’t see Cassie as anything more than an overworked ambulance driver. As Cassie fights to keep these future spider heroes alive, antagonist Ezekiel Sims (a criminally wasted Tahar Rahim) hunts them down, hoping to prevent a timeline where they kill him. But with duelling time-loopers, wouldn’t they fight each other for eternity? Such is the problem with the sudden influx of multi-verses and time-traveling heroes. Superhero fatigue is in high gear, but that’s not why films like Morbius and Madame Web do poorly. If a story succeeds on its own merits, the status of a shared cinematic universe is irrelevant. Even with the DCEU’s problems, people went to see The Batman in droves. Rushed stories cash a quick buck on Marvel’s popularity, but word spreads fast when people dunk on the movie all weekend on social media. The “with great power…” quote that we all know is tweaked to something clumsier, in the studio-mandated way of giving people the same thing but slightly warmed over with a new ingredient no one wanted. The line drew a laugh from the audience. However, I don’t want readers to walk away thinking nothing in Madame Web works. The practical suits are a nice touch, though it’s hard to ignore that the women wearing them are likely the reason behind the choice. Sydney Sweeney of Euphoria fame is a gifted performer (watch Reality), but none of that is why she’s featured on a one-sheet in skin-tight spandex. It’s a lazy ploy, but one that will sell tickets.
 As endearing cast as the cast is, they can only do so much with the material. The film relies on the vibes of Johnson, Sweeney, and Adam Scott, yet they’re constantly bogged down with ridiculous exposition and running away from garish CGI. Then there’s the impractical camera work. Sudden zooms work in Succession because they reveal a tic or reaction from characters as developments inform a scene. It acts as visual whiplash during most of Madame Web, tearing attention away from dialogue that already sets your mind to wander. The characters aren’t defined particularly well. Not even Johnson’s protagonist. Cassie is our in for the story, but there’s nothing special that binds you to her plight. Scenes of the four women hanging out are satisfying, but only because they derive from the kinship of the actresses’ charisma. Watching the group sing karaoke along to Britney Spear’s “Toxic” is a highlight, but, again, not because of anything the script brings. S.J. Clarkson, who directed episodes of several notable TV shows, handles the reins, making the most of the limited budget. But the script, by Morbius writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, is lifeless. Sony’s universally-beloved animated Spider-verse is one of the best things going on in movies. Tom Holland’s run as the MCU’s Spider-man is equally popular. So why is the live-action villain universe in such disarray? The Venom franchise succeeds because Tom Hardy leans into its B-movie sensibilities whenever possible. Madame Web has no direction. And without direction, all you can expect is flailing. In a year where DC and Marvel have two film releases pending, Sony is putting out three comic book films. Sony should stop diluting their shared Spider-Man universe, but with Kraven The Hunter coming in August and Venom 3 in November, the corporate churn continues. Partially because Sony releases these films to keep ownership of the Spider-man film rights from going back to Marvel.

"Feb 21, 2024"," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. The funny thing about watching audiences cool off from big-budget comic book adaptations in recent years is how, if you lived through the very early aughts, it almost feels like things are going back to the way they used to be. After years of Marvel tentpoles dominating the box office, it’s been easy to forget how unabashedly unserious these kinds of projects usually were outside of the handful that put the genre on the map.  But before the rise of the MCU, Bad Comic Book Movies™ — projects that didn’t take themselves or their source material all that seriously — were generally the rule rather than the exception. And while they might not have been great, they were the sort of films audiences knew how to have fun with. It’s only since multiverses became the hot new thing in Hollywood that studios have gotten comfortable even acknowledging (and capitalizing on people’s nostalgia for) those halcyon days when Spider-Man’s webbing was organic. But unlike some of Sony’s other recent Spider-Man features which have been more focused on bringing specific characters and actors back from past franchises, director S. J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is far more interested in revisiting a specific moment in comic book movie history — one defined by iffy costumes, perplexing plots, and a palpable sense of on-screen embarrassment. Set in a curious pocket of Sony’s larger Spider-verse of films where it’s still 2003, and Spider-Man himself doesn’t exist, Madame Web tells the tale of Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), an acerbic paramedic whose life takes a series of strange turns one day when she (briefly) dies while saving a man’s life. As an adult orphan whose mother died in the Amazon while researching spiders, Cassandra has a hard time connecting emotionally with anyone who isn’t her colleague Ben Parker (Adam Scott), or the stray cat that regularly wanders into her New York City walkup.  But after a routine emergency rescue leads to Cassie plummeting to her death, she awakens to find herself imbued with an ill-defined set of precognitive powers, and while she has no idea what to make of her alarming visions, it soon becomes clear that they’re all guiding her toward a trio of young girls. Disorienting exposition dumps in a film’s opening act are almost always a warning sign, but the way Madame Web clunkily juxtaposes a flashback to Cassandra’s past with glimpses into her charges’ futures almost makes it feel as if the filmmakers are trying to keep you from understanding what’s going on. Though his motivations are unclear, it’s simple enough to grasp in Madame Web’s first few minutes that perpetually barefoot explorer Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is eager to kill three masked women wearing spider-themed superhero costumes. It’s clear Madame Web wants you to wonder who Sims’ targets are, and why they don’t just use their powers to stop him in his tracks.  But instead of teasing their identities out, the movie just dumps Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) into Cassandra’s lap about half an hour in at a point when there are already too many other things going on.  Sony’s plan to build out an entire cinematic universe on just the Spider-Man IP alone has always felt a bit dubious, but in Madame Web’s younger leads, you can almost see how the plan could work. Similar to Cassandra, the girls have all been orphaned (at least emotionally), and they need someone to guide them through the madness of being teenagers.  You can also see how the girls’ thinly fleshed-out personality quirks might one day make them an interesting team of Spider-Women, and how Madame Web’s really a story about Cassandra stepping into her role as a mentor to a quippy new generation of heroes. But as present as that narrative intention is, the film doesn’t really set its characters up to feel like real players in a cohesive story, and the girls wind up being pushed into the background — first as they’re introduced as out-of-focus extras in the periphery of Cassandra’s story, and later as she takes the girls under her wing to protect them from Sims by… ditching them in the woods. Between its frantic set pieces in which the camera lens can never seem to decide where it wants to focus, and the way Madame Web’s script briskly bounces between scenes, it’s obvious that the filmmakers are trying to make you feel some of the deep discombobulation Cassandra herself is experiencing. Even though the execution is more than a little off, it’s a clever idea, and to the movie’s credit, Cassandra’s visions of being murdered by a knock-off Spider-Man are pointedly disturbing. But as much time as Madame Web spends telling you that Cassandra’s terrified for her and the girls’ lives you’d be hard pressed to get that impression from Johnson’s deadpan performance and the way she portrays her character as someone who approaches most situations with a pronounced sense of apathy. When you look at Madame Web as a modern comic book movie — one crafted with the knowledge of how much money these things can make — it’s hard to understand a lot of the choices that were made. But the film makes a hell of a lot more sense when you think of it not just as a movie set in 2003, but one that’s trying to evoke the vibes of comic book movies from that era. The signs are there pretty much from the jump, but it isn’t until Mis-Teeq’s “Scandalous” is dropped in during an action sequence that it becomes shockingly obvious how much Madame Web has in common with the 2004 Catwoman starring Halle Berry in terms of both films feeling like doomed misfires from the very beginning. Rather than any of Sony’s previous Spider-Man spinoff films, the confusing way Madame Web reworks Julia, Mattie, and Anya’s origins makes the movie play much more like something out of the era that gave us the first Daredevil movie and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. People like to look back on that point in superhero movie history fondly now because enough time has passed for those films to shift into cult classic territory. But the simple truth is that, for quite a while, big budget cape projects missed as often as they hit, and with Madame Web technically being a follow-up to Morbius and a precursor to Kraven the Hunter, it’s fair to say that Sony’s definitely returned to that time.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024"," One of the skewed ironies of the 2010s superhero movie era is that Sony’s Spider-Man spin-offs were greenlit out of a mercenary desire by Sony to craft their own cinematic universe and yet exist as among the most explicitly stand-alone cape flicks of their time. S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is a period piece set in 2003 that was supposed to be more closely tied to the Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland Spider-Man franchise until someone realized the math didn’t math. Rather than go the Texas Chainsaw 3-D route of hoping nobody notices or cares about timeline discrepancies, the film hides its broader continuity connections to an almost comical degree. It also has no illusions of pretension, operating as a wantonly silly and openly comic fantasy closer to “The Dead Zone meets The Terminator” than a conventional four-color actioner. It’s also, okay, it’s not “good,” but it’d be an enjoyable romp if tickets still cost $5 on a Saturday afternoon.  I'd never considered the connection between America's obsession with national/global security post-9/11 and its connection to superhero fandom—something to ponder. Despite the negative reviews, I'm still excited to see this one. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 21, 2024"," by Walter Chaw S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is a rare and specific variety of disaster, which is interesting because it’s largely centred around a rare and specific variety of spider. That is to say, not “interesting” so much as unintentionally ironic or something. Rain on your wedding day, 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife, you know? The mass-appealing, notes-driven, “for dummies,” not-entirely-accurate pop-cultural definition of a literary conceit. This reminds me of the swoony, heartthrob moment where Ethan Hawke defines “irony” perfectly in Reality Bites. I don’t actually remember what he says, though, because I haven’t seen that movie since its 1994 release–about ten years before the events of Madame Web, the screen debut of Marvel mutant Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), who’s named after the Greek archetype who can see the future but no one listens to her and Marc Webb, director of the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies. Just kidding. She’s named Webb because spiders spin them, with an extra “b” to throw you off the trail but not so violently that you don’t know it’s fucking with you. Madame Web (one “b,” because the picture is more invested in making sure you know it’s related to the lucrative Spider-Man franchise than in being such a tedious asshole) opens in 1973, with Cassandra’s super-pregnant mom Constance (Kerry Bishé) tromping around the South American rainforest like Sean Connery in Medicine Man in search of a super-spider when…okay, that’s enough of that. Anyway, 30 years later, Cassandra is a paramedic who can sometimes see the future, but nobody believes her. You might have deduced that by her name is all I’m saying. Madame Web is, on one level, a Powerpuff Girls hangout flick. On another level, it’s that party where you met a girl who was so much sharper than you that you could never entirely figure out when and how she was castrating you, although it was constant and brutal and you learned maybe you were into the humiliation thing but she got bored and now you’re writing about her 30 years later. Every Dakota Johnson line-reading in this film is a balls-shrivelling, meme-in-the-making fusillade of ice-cold, patronizing derision. She is a human wrecking ball of unusual precision. There’s a scene at the midway point of Madame Web where Cassandra reads her dead mother’s journal: “Peptides… More peptides… Ah, here it is: spider-people. Las Araňas.” Then, to her cat, she says, “Have you ever heard of Los Araňas? Me neither.” She pronounces “Las Araňas” like that one remote anchor on your local news broadcast does–like you might if you were being a relentless son-of-a-bitch working something out of your front teeth as you carefully savoured each syllable for maximum “I’m pronouncing this eleventh-grade honours-Spanish correctly, what’s your problem?” She reads on to discover that they can move around like spiders, these Las Araňas, and, her deep blue eyes registering the shock (she is not shocked) of understanding (she already understands), she looks offscreen left and stage-whispers, “Like ceiling guy!” She’s referring to the villain of Madame Web, Ezekiel Sims (French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim), who appears to her in visions walking on the ceiling. The way she says it makes my scrotum retract all the way up into my body cavity. I’ve been spoken to that way before, and those bits don’t grow back, my friends. Dakota Johnson knows this scene is ridiculous. She knows it is housed in a ridiculous film. She is smarter than her own character, of course, but she is also smarter than anyone who worked on Madame Web and most of the people watching it, including me. Comprising the movie’s MacGuffin are three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor) Cassandra must protect from Ezekiel. She does this by catching glimpses of them being brutally murdered in a changeable future, then changing the future. Better might have been her sitting in a recliner opposite Ezekiel in a nice conversation nook and ripping his self-esteem out of his nose like a Pharaoh’s mortician armed with a bent wire made of arched-brow cremaster and silken-garrote condescension. Later, Sweeney’s Julia Cornwall looks at a picture of Cassandra’s mom and says, “She’s really pretty,” and Johnson offers the kind of thin-lipped smile that shuts down bars. I’ve experienced performances like this before, generally by people like Joan Crawford or Bette Davis in the last few steps of their career, when they were cast as psycho-biddies in poverty productions. Performances that are not performances. Performances that are measured in the recoil of every other celestial body in the vicinity from the gravity tides produced by the massive ego-density of artists who have accumulated so much inertial confidence throughout their lives and careers that they are more impenetrable than black holes. Dakota Johnson is as different from you as you are from a starfish. There is nothing the same about how you were raised and thus how you understand and experience the world. I want to be a satellite in her orbit just to observe her and occasionally squeal, “Oh no she didn’t!” when she cuts someone off at the knees with the effort a sociopathic child exerts ripping wings off a fly. I want to be the Carl Sagan to her cosmos.",POSITIVE
"Feb 21, 2024"," Madame Web is about a paramedic, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), who receives semi-psychic powers, which are sometimey and not under her control. The scenes having to do with Cassie’s visions are confusing to say the very least, since they barge into the narrative with no preparation or context; they’re also edited as incoherently as every other action scene is here. The gist of the story is that Cassie, whose dead mom was trying to find a special spider in Peru, must protect three teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor) who are in danger from the movie’s big bad (Tahar Rahim), who has his own future visions in which he sees the girls, in superhero costumes, killing him. Thus does the movie spoil its own ending about twenty minutes in.  Enjoy that glimpse of the girls in their Spider-Woman costumes — for that is their destiny, to be Spider-Women, as this film is Spider-Man-adjacent — in that early vision and right at the end, because that’s all you get in this supposed superhero movie. Most of it is a matter of Cassie and the girls running from the big bad, except for when Cassie pointlessly goes to Peru to find out her mom, who died while giving birth to her, was looking for that special spider so she could cure the disease she knew Cassie would be born with. The sequence seems about as useless as the scenes having to do with Ben Parker (Adam Scott), a fellow paramedic, and his pregnant sister Mary (Emma Roberts), who will give birth, the movie hints, to Peter Parker, aka the Spider-Man most of us know. This movie isn’t really for a viewer who has never seen a Spider-Man film before, but neither is it for those who have seen every Spider-Man film (or even one). The screen is loaded with actors visibly wishing they were anywhere else, most certainly including the dull-affect Dakota Johnson, who narrowly loses the “Calgon, take me away” contest to Zosia Mamet as the big bad’s hacker. (Bored-looking Mamet sits at her monitor watching for the girls and delivering pearls like “I think I got them.”) The saddest/funniest aspect of the whole ordeal, though, is that it seems convinced it’s the first of many adventures with this quartet — the three superpowered girls commanded/protected by Cassie. There will be no such sequels. We will never see these characters again. There will be no great future stories with Madame Web, or Cassie Webb, or Jack Webb for that matter. So the ending is one of those “The end? Nay — the beginning!” conclusions meant to make us thirst for more, when what we’re craving at that point is simple fresh air, or something stronger. Madame Web was directed by S.J. Clarkson, who also gets official screenwriting blame along with three others, and I suppose we’ve reached the point where women can make superhero movies as empty and unsatisfying as men can. Clarkson has been a prolific TV director, and I hope this film, whose problems are probably most accurately pinned on an insecure studio’s meddling, doesn’t squash her career. Tahar Rahim, too, is a better actor than this movie, which destroys his performance with that poor dubbing, would indicate. Nobody comes out of Madame Web looking good except maybe Kerry Bishé, who, as Cassie’s ill-starred mother, at least gets in and out fast. Everyone else has to pull on hip-waders and slosh through this sewage until the finish. ",NEGATIVE

"Feb 21, 2024"," There are also some really unique genre pictures like The Book of Clarence, some very sound family fare like Orion and the Dark and a movie where Jason Statham plays an action hero called a Beekeeper. Trying to turn Madame Web into the next laugh-a-minute disaster midnight movie was bound to happen. We live in a post-meme society, one where any film that’s distinctly flawed but still showing signs of real personality gets shoved into a joke box that labels it “this week’s Worst Movie of All Time.” It’s an exhaustive discourse, as the “Morbin’ Time” effect that doomed Madame Web before it really had a chance. It’s a shame, really, because despite its clear faults, the Dakota Johnson-led spinoff is really one of the more fascinating Marvel movies in some time. Morbius was truly awful; this is not that. Cut from a very particular cloth of risky 2000s comic book movies that likely fell victim to studio meddling, Madame Web feels haphazard and melodramatic in an oddly refreshing way. It’s not really a superhero origin story as much as it is a B-grade sci-fi thriller, and its efforts to canonize its setting into some sort of Marvel future feel so delightfully lifeless and unwilling, like someone dragging their resistant 8-year-old to a piano lesson. The film, on purpose or on accident, shows you how contrived the continuous shared universe mentality is, and it has some (perhaps unintended, but still present and effective) fun with that in a very non-meta way. Don’t necessarily mistake its mistakes for mistakes, we’ll argue. Kevin Feige built the MCU to absolutely avoid movies like this, ones that can fly off the rail at any given moment because of strange decisions and potentially off-putting weirdness due to the unholy blend of unwieldy creative vision, careless studio interference and Michael Bay-approved obviousness of product placement. This movie is his worst Marvel nightmare. Bizarre springs eternal with Madame Web, and that’s kind of nice to have something so baffling in execution and lacking in uniformity sport the Marvel logo. It’s not entirely successful, but there’s not much else like it besides the Venom movies. It’s also got a surprisingly wry sense of humor, as Johnson and S.J. Clarkson mine the corniness of the plot and the very relatable “annoyed millennial unsuccessfully trying to relate to sarcastic Gen Z kids” dynamics (in 2003, sure, but it still hits). Johnson is really quite impressive here, as she’s wholly aware of what kind of movie she’s in and how ridiculous some of it is. Like a pro, she still powers through it by selling the drama in some really shaky dialogue and nailing the punch lines, even when they’re not necessarily there. Some of this movie is dinged from the delivery process, but it’s actually decently intact. If anything, this is really better than most of the recent MCU movies. Madame Web might be really messy and occasionally encourage the wrong kind of audience participation, but if you go in willing to meet it on its wavelength, you might be surprised by how nice it is to watch one of these movies not necessarily know where it’s going or why it’s doing what it is. That’s the joy of risks. They don’t always pay off, but they rarely fail without genuine entertainment value. People will say plenty about this movie, but they cannot call it boring. The first half is pretty excellent, even if it starts to get a little lost in the sauce with the meta-narrative…however, the animation is splendid and most of the script and voice cast are very well-considered. It’s upper-tier DreamWorks, but it doesn’t quite have the conceptual cohesion of something like Inside Out, as great as Kaufman working in this space is. This is exactly what it should be, a rare example of the schlocky, B-grade action movie that strives to be more than a temporary meme soon lost to time. David Ayer cuts down the unnecessary plotting and keeps this humming along at an enjoyable clip, and Jason Statham understands the proper frequency here as well as any actor could. It’s wildly fun in stretches, and being rough around the edges in a good Expendables movie way is more than forgivable. I’d watch more Beekeepers. Josh Hutcherson is a great jerk. This is the kind of movie that would do great business on home video and develop a very loyal cult following and, in like 10 years, would be regarded as a very savvy genre picture that the youths of the time understood more than the folks who didn’t really get on its level. Alas, that’s not the world we’re in anymore, but I sure hope this one finds a second life on streaming because it really is a shame we get a proper successor to the 80s/90s movies like Heathers, The Lost Boys, the 1990s Addams Family movies and Edward Scissorhands that doesn’t immediately find its audience. It’s a movie made by someone who clearly loves the irreverence and aesthetics of Tim Burton, the oblong austerity of Barry Sonnenfeld, the wacky studio comedy vibes of Penelope Spheeris and the buoyant campiness of Joel Schumacher. Plenty of Joe Dante The ‘Burbs vibes in there, too. Maybe this will take off on Netflix or Peacock or something. It’s a good movie and deserved more than what it got being dumped in February with little fanfare. Kathryn Newton, Liza Soberano and Cole Sprouse are all aces. Jeymes Samuel walks a tight rope here between satire and earnest heart, and he does so marvelously. He’s such a confident artist, radiant and grand in the way he envisions his stories and very deft to the touch with the emotions. He’s got an old soul for the old Hollywood scope and booming score that sweeps you off your feet. There is a real dedication present to genre homage while twisting it around to meet his forward-thinking vision. It’s pretty marvelous what he pulls off here, maybe not quite as tight as The Harder They Fall but just as impressive, giddy and resonant. Samuel is a special filmmaker, and this is a very good film that deserved so much more than bad-faith readings and to be dumped in January on a crowded weekend. It’s a definite step down from the insane heights of the first film, but it’s still so much fun and so much more engaging than most of the superhero films made these days. It’s a shame this will be it for the DCEU, if only because you’d rather have unwieldy variance with real risk (hello, Madame Web) involved instead of more sameness. James Wan really did everything he could here to craft a rollicking adventure out of production issues that show the seams in the edit. This really reminded me of a less polished version of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, lacking the gravitas but making up for it in pure, chummy enjoyment. That has to count for something, right? I’m sad to see Jason Momoa’s time as Aquaman end; he was just perfect for the part, but I’m glad he got one last chance to flex his joy in playing the role, even if the vehicle is a bit more dinged up than before. Also, the sunken ship underworld is yet another huge example of why Wan needs to do a Star War. No director right now would be a better fit. I’d bet $5 the pitch for this movie was “Vacation … but with ducks on migration! … but also Finding Nemo … on the quality level of The Secret Life of Pets,” and the entire room stood in applause. It’s okay! Illumination is incapable of making anything but the same perfectly fine, risk-averse family film over and over and over again, which means you always leave reasonably satisfied but wholly static. They clearly just want to be Blue Sky with Minions instead of Scrat, and more power to them. They’ll probably never make a great movie, but they’ll make plenty decent enough ones. 3/4-star movies for days. This was, weirdly, the second-best animated film released in December 2023 about talking birds who must escape evil humans who want to cook them and serve them to consumers… it’s also got the second-best Mike White movie script involving the word “orange.” Go figure.",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2024"," Just like a bug infestation, superhero movies can’t be stamped out. “Madame Web” is the latest attempt by a major studio to assure us that this genre is alive and well. Surely, there are still a few good movies left to be culled from the endless cosmology of comic books. This one has some lively directing and sensible casting entrapped in the webbing of an oddly stripped script. Director S.J. Clarkson is making her feature debut and genuinely tries to focus on a psychological angle, while trying to deliver what Sony wants, namely a costumed action fest linked to the “Spider-Man” franchise. The final result feels like a stretched out prologue with Dakota Johnson putting in effort to prove she wants to be in it. Many reviewers tend to compare a movie like this to ‘90s superhero duds, but here is another example of how that style carries on. It opens in a steamy jungle where researcher Constance (Kerry Bishé) is bitten by a mysterious spider and encounters slinging people known as the Araña (Spanish for spider). Constance dies but it turns out she was pregnant. In 2003 her grown daughter, Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Johnson), now works as a New York City paramedic. She’s been an orphan who likes the idea of staying single and not having children. She is also starting to get plagued by sudden visions into the near and distant future. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the very rich Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) beds society women he meets at the opera but is rattled by nightmares of three girls in spider costumes who kill him. He soon tracks them down to the same subway train. They are Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Luckily, Cassie happens to cross paths with them in time to help them fend off Ezekiel. It is a chaotic time in film when it comes to length. MCU movies are famously stretched out, yet “Madame Web” at 1 hour and 57 minutes feels like a lot of answers or essential plot points were cut out. How are Ezekiel’s three targets all conveniently on the same train? Why do they need to cross paths with Cassie randomly before she uses clairvoyance to find them anyway? Why does Ezekiel have a master hacker, Amaria (Zosia Mamet), who disappears half-way through the movie? Factory products of this sort are hard to blame on one sole person. The screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who also penned 2022’s infamously bad “Morbius,” is another take on a spiderverse character. Reportedly, this was meant to be a ‘90s nostalgia trip but for some reason was pushed into the early aughts, which accounts for the Cranberries needle drops combined with shots of billboards for Beyoncé’s “Dangerously in Love” album.  But there are some intriguing efforts present from the director. S.J. Clarkson tries to avoid depending too much on big CGI effects or overcooked action scenes. “I was engaged by the idea of clairvoyance and how cinematically that can be seen,” Clarkson recently told Entertainment Voice. “I was captivated by the idea of someone who uses their mind. That felt like an opportunity to do something different and lean into psychological storytelling. These stories tend to be about people overcoming something.” Some of the better scenes are the ones where Cassie attends a friend’s baby shower and is rudely interrupted by visions into the future, or moments where she nearly avoids a car wreck thanks to her gift. As the movie continues the inventiveness of the premise fights with the gimmick becoming a kind of inner trailer for what we assume is a sequel. For example, a lot of ads have shown Julia, Mattie and Anya in spider hero costumes forming a new team, but that’s not part of this movie. It’s just Cassie’s vision into what these girls will turn into in the future, meaning the future movie we’re expected to anticipate. Then there is Dakota Johnson, already outshining the movie with her recent media appearances discussing the project with open irony. She’s a gifted actor who has brought sincerity to schlock before as in “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Her approach to “Madame Web” is to bask in the absurdity and look very committed when discussing how her mom was bitten by a magic spider in the Amazon, or looking annoyed when babysitting her rowdy high schooler companions. She looks as if she’s in on the joke with us when she appears in the final scenes, decked in a wheelchair and dark shades, fully transformed into the title character. Her final grin seems to say, “I’m a famous actor hired to play a Marvel character, why not?” Everyone else is on autopilot, including Sydney Sweeney, who gets turned into a shy, nerdy schoolgirl twin of her “Euphoria” character. Tahar Rahim is beyond generic as the villain who looks like those business majors who spend every evening or crack of dawn at the gym, speeding off in a sports car to change into a costume similar to Spider-Man’s, except he’s evil. His grand finale is appropriately bland. It really just takes a falling neon sign to take out this kind of jerk. It’s easy to see in “Madame Web” potential in a director who can do strong thrillers or noirs moving forward and Johnson for a later shot at true costumed, popcorn glory. This is not a wreck on the scale of something like “Cats” or “Morbius.” Instead, it’s a movie that just doesn’t know what to do with the story. If Sony and Marvel simply focus on making a good film, as opposed to obsessively setting up new franchise chains, then we can have fun escapism that at least makes sense. “Madame Web” tries to stay grounded while being absurd, showcasing actors doing the best they can with a genre that is quickly gathering cobwebs and needs some decent sweeping before starting again.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2024"," A la paramédica Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson) le gusta salvar la vida de los demás. Es parte de su trabajo. Sin embargo, ella misma no se lleva muy bien con la gente y evita el contacto cercano con ellos siempre que puede. Su propia vida da un vuelco un día que cae al río durante una de sus misiones y casi se ahoga. Aunque escapa con un susto, sigue teniendo extrañas visiones y déjà vu. Sin embargo, las cosas se complican cuando tiene una visión de Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) asesinando brutalmente a tres adolescentes en el mismo tren. Gracias a su valiente intervención, consigue salvar las vidas de Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), Anya Corazón (Isabela Merced) y Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney).   Spiderman encabeza sin duda la lista de los superhéroes de cómic más importantes. Es un icono, ya sea en su versión animada o en una película de acción real, y hoy en día sigue generando grandes ingresos. No obstante, era justo mostrarse escéptico cuando hace años se anunció que Sony haría una película centrada en los personajes secundarios de SpiderMan, además de en el propio Universo Cinematográfico Marvel. Las burlas se acallaron cuando Venom se convirtió en un inesperado éxito de taquilla. Sólo unas pocas películas en solitario de Marvel han logrado recaudar 850 millones de dólares. La secuela Venom: Let There Be Carnage no pudo igualar esta cifra, pero 500 millones seguían siendo mucho dinero, sobre todo porque la película se estrenó durante la pandemia del coronavirus. Sin embargo, Morbius, la tercera película de este universo, fracasó unos meses después. Por eso era tan importante que Madame Web volviera a ser un verdadero éxito. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que esto ocurra es bastante baja. Al menos, las críticas vuelven a ser un absoluto desastre. Junto con las adaptaciones cinematográficas de los cómics, a las que actualmente no les está yendo muy bien en taquilla, esto no nos da muchas esperanzas de una recaudación razonable. Es una pena, porque hay elementos positivos que hacen que apetezca ver la película. Empezando por el reparto. En los últimos años, estas adaptaciones se han consolidado como un crisol de numerosas estrellas. La lista de grandes nombres es ahora tan grande que uno no puede evitar preguntarse quién más está en ella.  En Madame Web, sin embargo, a los actores y actrices les cuesta brillar de verdad. Dakota Johnson, que al menos tiene algunas buenas escenas en el primer tercio como una sarcástica paramédica, es la que mejor lo consigue. Realmente decepcionante es Tahar Rahim, que en realidad es un muy buen actor de carácter, pero que aquí está completamente desaprovechado como hombre araña descalzo. Su personaje no es ni amenazador ni trágico. Simplemente está ahí.  En general, los diálogos son terribles. Cada vez que se intenta explicar algo, el equipo de guionistas, formado por cuatro hombres y cuatro mujeres, fracasa en la tarea. Las escenas emotivas, cuando se supone que el cuarteto crece unido, tampoco logran impresionar; el lenguaje es simplemente demasiado poco natural para ello. Rara vez se tiene la sensación de estar tratando con personas reales. Las mejores adaptaciones cómicas de este tipo encuentran el corazón humano detrás del disfraz. Aquí ni siquiera parecen haber encontrado el cuerpo. Si al menos el disfraz fuera algo que mirar. Pero Madame Web tampoco es muy buena como película de acción, ya que carece de las ideas necesarias. Y faltaba el dinero necesario, ya que algunas escenas generadas por ordenador resultaron horribles. La capacidad del protagonista para predecir e influir en el futuro es realmente emocionante. Se le podría haber sacado mucho partido. En la película, sin embargo, esto no lleva a Cassie a hacer planes o a sopesar diferentes opciones. Prefiere la violencia pura y dura, que no encaja ni con la habilidad ni con la caracterización. Este es también el principal problema, incluso peor que la disparatada historia: Madame Web es aburrida. Lo que funciona en la primera mitad y aporta algo divertido, degenera en una bola de acción lanzada sin amor que no hace nada con los personajes y sus habilidades. Quizás no sea una catástrofe absoluta debido a los ocasionales momentos agradables. Pero no abre el apetito para nuevas incursiones en el mundo de las arañas, incluso si la película está claramente orientada hacia futuras partes. Nadie espera una experiencia cinematográfica sofisticada de títulos como éste, pero tal efecto lobotomizante no puede haber sido el objetivo declarado. Madame Web no cree que su público sea especialmente inteligente y quizás por eso ha sustraído todo lo que proporciona al menos un rudimentario alimento para reflexionar. Cuando uno considera cuánto talento se ha desperdiciado literalmente delante de la cámara, casi podría enfadarse un poco, oh si al menos la película no fuera tan miserablemente indiferente. Así que encaja perfectamente con las otras películas del Spider-Man-antihéroe-universo de Sony mencionadas anteriormente.  Y no te preocupes, la película, que por cierto está ambientada en 2003, aprovecha cualquier oportunidad para dejar claro dónde estamos. Así que si disfrutas dándote cuenta de que Emma Roberts y Adam Scott están emparentados con un personaje muy importante del cosmos de SpiderMan en la película, puede que vivas unos cuantos momentos agradables. Pero si eso es suficiente para ti, puedes llamarte justificadamente frugal en el espectro insano. Después de todo, Madame Web presenta una buena alternativa bastante pronto. En una escena, un médico aconseja a Cassandra que se quede en casa viendo películas antiguas. Una gran sugerencia, realmente no hay nada más que añadir.  Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Feb 20, 2024"," The proper metaphor to describe a film such as Sony’s latest live-action Spider-Verse installment, Madame Web, is a building with excessive permit issues that got approved anyway. Coming off the rather lukewarm reception to 2022’s Morbius, the studio has elected to press on with an assortment of standalone Spider-Man adjacent character films that is building to something? Superhero films are in a state of figuring out their identity and their place in a box office that is asking more of them — there’s no use belaboring that point. If there’s a primary failure in speaking about Madame Web, it feels like a film meant for another genre formatted to fit this universe that needs characters to power its machine. 2019’s Joker used Martin Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver and 1982 The King of Comedy as obvious templates in which it anchors its world. It just so happened that Joaquin Phoenix’s performance and just the right amount of comic book lore were able to push it into something interesting. In essence, Madame Web is primarily a small-level slasher film that happens to have spider people in it, with one person, in particular, trying to figure out their power set. The “Peter Parker” of it all feels like a forbidden word evident to the audience and something the film tries to play coy with. (It reverses the aforementioned “with great power comes great responsibility” line). The characters themselves fit a specific archetype other than exhibiting something outside of that, and most of the narrative is spent running away from a relentless villain with an absurd power set. Before even discussing the plot itself, you can see there are way too many masters (including a lot of product placement) being served in lieu of trying to do something different. Set in 2003, Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and is a bit of a loner outside of a friendship with her fellow EMT Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Much of Cassandra’s adverseness to the family has an origin that happened years prior, in 1973. Her mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), had traveled to the Peruvian Amazon to search for a rare spider species containing healing qualities protected by an indigenous tribe called the Las Arañas. There is only one issue, and it lies in her then-greedy partner, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who wants all the power for himself. A scuffle ensues, and he accidentally shoots Constance while she’s pregnant with Cassie. Before Constance’s death, there’s a ceremony in which Cassie is birthed and bitten by the special arachnid. One day on the job, Cassie gets into an accident and nearly dies. With this, she vaguely discovers that she can see into the future. It takes much of the film for this power to develop fully, and even then, it’s a bit hazy. Ezekiel also has the same ability as others that you would deduce from Spider-Man lore (super strength, crawling on walls, and apparent neurotoxin). Along with immense wealth, a hacker named Aramia (Zosia Mamet) has NSA surveillance tools. Ezekiel has one mission in mind. He’s plagued with these visions of three Spider-Women that may kill him one day; thus, he has to T-1000 it up to stop that from happening. Director S. J. Clarkson and co-writers Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker set the stage for a plot that wants to be put into anything else but this Spider-Verse. Any overtures to costumes and possible actions that would nail Ezekiel’s fears, in reality, must be believed. While Madame Web looks to convey that he’s this unstoppable killing machine, the (extremely noticeable) differences with Rahim’s ADR make his character more laughable more often than not. With Cassandra somewhat getting a handle on her foresight, she sees that she has to assist three teenagers, the nerdy and awkward Julia (Sydney Sweeney), the intelligent Anya (Isabela Merced), and the I-won’t-do-what-you-tell-me, flip off an ambulance Mattie (Celeste O’Connor). The teens behave the way you’d expect them to — because films like these don’t expect a group of young people to think rationally. Cassie gets tired of playing the caretaker role quickly, as punctuated by Johnson’s no-sell performance. Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor cling tightly to what their given personality is supposed to be and rarely (if at all) move away from that. In the end, the four bond over being directionless — coming from backgrounds where their parents are either deceased, non-existent, or taken away by other circumstances. In that regard, a little piece of camaraderie peaks over many fragmented set pieces linked together by the repeated use of vehicles as weapons. Sony has presented a superhero that can see into the future inside a film that feels like a prequel and assumed it’s earned the trust of its audience to bet on another story without earning it.",NEGATIVE

A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best answer to our question of the week. 04:10Last week's question we asked, what has been your favorite Deadpool joke out of all of Deadpool media? And that was coming off of the Deadpool and Wolverine trailer that we got during the Super Bowl. We got four answers, so we'll break down this week's honorable mentions before revealing the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to Clayton DeMato, who said, Hey there guys, my name is Clayton DeMato, long time listener. As someone who enjoys to have his balls fondled. 05:38Cornelius Robinson who said, Hey guys, this is Cornelius Robinson and my favorite joke from the Deadpool media is through the movies. When he mentioned that Nickassan and Teenage Warhead and Clauses were in a big house living together all alone. And it was funny how it was almost the studio didn't have any more money for new X-Men members. Which was a meta joke and was returned in the sequel. 06:07and it cracked me up. Yeah, that was a little bit of self-deprecating humor on behalf of the studio. Great joke with Deadpool referencing how only Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus seem to be at the X-Men Mansion all the time. I really did love the follow-up in Deadpool 2 when we saw the cast of X-Men Dark Phoenix in one of the classrooms, like basically hiding from Deadpool. So good. It did make me wonder where in the timeline the second Deadpool movie fit, but yeah, it was a great gag. 06:35It was a meta joke, it doesn't necessarily have to be scrutinized in the larger continuity. Sure, sure, I get that. But great answer Cornelius, our final honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my favorite joke would have to be from the Deadpool 2 teaser where he's changing into his superhero costume. Mostly just from the realism from it, like we all think we'd be these badass superheroes and stuff though, but let's be honest with me. 07:02would take that long just to get into our superhero costume and possibly get the same outcome like in the teaser. So that's my favorite joke just from the realism for me as well as just the Superman theme too. Yeah, I'm not sure how many people remember the teaser trailer to Deadpool 2. It was played in front of the Logan movie. It was essentially... 07:22Wade Wilson walking down and seeing an old man getting mugged in an alley and he runs into a phone booth to change into his Deadpool costume and it just takes entirely way too long. That's the joke. It takes him like two minutes just to change into his Deadpool costume and in the meantime before he can even get out of the phone booth we hear the old man get shot. Great gag. A hilarious way to kick off the marketing for Deadpool 2. I had almost completely forgot about this teaser until Travis brought it up again. 08:18Spider-Man is trying to warn Deadpool of Taskmaster's booby traps and Deadpool goes, ha ha, traps. Because I'm expecting him to say, to be laughing at boobies, but it's simple and catches me off guard. Yeah, and another classic Deadpool style joke where again it mixes the juvenile with the clever. In the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, Spider-Man... 08:43and Deadpool teamed up against Taskmaster. And it was a nice bit of subversion where you think that Deadpool, upon hearing the phrase booby traps is going to laugh at booby. But of course, he laughs at traps. He's like, you said traps. It was a great gag. I never saw the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. I didn't even know Deadpool was in that. He seems like a risky character for a cartoon. But, yeah, solid joke. Well, the nice thing about Deadpool is that you can make him as PG or rated R as you want to. And it just kind of works. As long as he's quirky and funny, it'll still feel like him. 09:12Do you have a favorite Deadpool joke? I really like the dig at DC that he did in Deadpool 2 where he's like, so dark, are you sure you're not from the DC universe? That was quality. This is fucking worst joke. No, but like I would say mine is in sort of the same scene. He's introduced to Black Tom Cassidy and he was like, hi, white Wade Wilson. And then later on he was just like, you killed Black Tom Cassidy. You racist. I was cracking up. Yeah. 09:42I also really liked the Juggernaut song though. Like that one stick with me for a while. Holy shit balls. Yeah, that was great. Yeah, Deadpool's humor is actually really solid and it makes me really excited to see Deadpool and Wolverine coming out the summer. So congrats again to Sean Curtis for winning this week's No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode when we'll be asking another Question of the Week. And now that that's done, on to the news. 10:42get that news from the studio itself. It's shaping up to be a great cast. Really can't wait to see them as Marvel's first family. And out of all the cast that the Fantastic Four franchise has had so far in live action, this one actually seems the most interesting to me. Yeah, it is interesting. I think it's a great cast. The logo is what I found most interesting. Like it almost makes me wonder if the Fantastic Four is gonna be a period piece. I've heard rumors that that was gonna be the case. And I think that this mid-century logo proves that. 11:12I think they're really gonna set up the Fantastic Four as like Marvel's first superhero family chronologically within the Marvel Universe and have them like maybe time travel into the present day by the end of the film. And why not? I mean, that could work. It worked with Captain Marvel. So. Right. Yeah, exactly. But besides the cast and potentially the setting of the movie, we also got a release date change for the film. It was originally going to kick off the summer season in 2025. 11:42coming out May 2nd, but Fantastic Four has been pushed back to July 25th, which is the date when the Thunderbolts movie was going to come out, but that film has been moved up to May 2nd, so basically they just swapped dates. So now Thunderbolts is kicking off the summer movie season, which I think is good news. I think it shows that Marvel has faith in the Thunderbolts movie to have such a valuable release date. Have they started filming Thunderbolts? Not yet, no. Man, that seems like a quick turnaround. 12:11But I imagine it has fewer special effects than Fantastic Four would need. Maybe. Who knows? A few months prior to that, in February, we're going to get Captain America, Brave New World, which has already started filming and I think is close to wrapping up here. I think this is all great news. It gives the studio more time to work on Fantastic Four, which, you know, is a flagship franchise that needs to be done right in its third iteration. And nothing got pushed back. It's just dates that are swapping. So we can still expect. 12:39something Marvel to come out on those original dates. Yeah, next year. Again, I'm really just hoping for this year to fly by. I know it's gonna be a crazy year with like the election and everything. Just bring on 2025 after The Joker, of course, cause I really want to see that, but yeah, 2025 is gonna be better than 2024, I'm pretty sure. Now I don't want to skip over Deadpool and Wolverine. So we could get to that movie and then once it comes out, then yeah, I'm ready for 2025 already. All right, we'll just skip to Deadpool and Wolverine, then skip to The Joker. 13:09and then skip to 2025. No, skip to Christmas, because you can't skip Christmas, man. That's true. That's fair. What are we talking about? I don't know. But let's go to move on to the next bit of news here, which is that the official trailer for the X-Men 97 cartoon has been released. It was released under a new banner. 13:29called Marvel Animation, which is pretty exciting to see, because I think it signifies that Marvel is going to be producing a lot more animated projects. Yeah, maybe What If will fall under that banner now, that's Spider-Man series, the prequel series that they're coming up with. I forget the name of it. Yeah, that was originally called Spider-Man Freshman Year, but they've since changed the title to Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I'm surprised there's not a home in there somewhere, but that's probably Marvel Animation, I imagine, as well. Marvel Zombies is also going to be animated. 13:59when that comes out. So, lots of projects for Marvel Animation cannot wait. These type of stories do really well, I think, in animation and Marvel hasn't really invested too much in that lately. Their previous animated films weren't very good, but these series hopefully will be. Just like the X-Men cartoon was back in the 90s, the trailer starts off showing us clips from the series from Nali back when that ended and picks up right where it left off. It's cool that the camera goes into the analog screen and basically takes us right back into that world. 14:28The animation is a little bit different in style, but you can tell heavily inspired by the 90s cartoon at the very least, especially in terms of character design, especially in terms of voice. Yeah, it sounds like the voice cast is returning, which I think I had already known that, but it was a nice kind of surprise to hear as well. Yeah, if it's not the original voice cast, they are remarkable impressionists. It's nice to see Cyclops as the leader of the team again. 14:56and really take center stage. Hopefully he proves to a whole new generation of fans that he is the de facto leader of the X-Men because the movies kind of gave him the shaft. The most standout moment for me in the trailer is when Wolverine is charging toward the camera, Gambit jumps on his back and charges his claws up with kinetic energy. I thought that was really dope. Yeah, it was a nice combo move, kind of like a fastball special, you know, if Colossus isn't around or anything like that. Yeah. 15:21I like there was a scene with Storm and she has her new haircut. It's like the ponytail kind of thing and there's just lightning crackling all around her. I'm like, oh shit, the animation is a lot better than in the 90s. Yeah, the ponytail hair here is kind of like a nice compromise between, you know, her long flowing hair from the 90s cartoon and also her mohawk style. I really like the way it looks here. Yeah, same. We see Jean Grey in this trailer who appears to be pregnant. 15:48Which is a surprise because that never happened in the comic books. Scott knocked up Madeline Pryor, who was a clone of Jean Grey. So either this version of Jean Grey is actually a clone or they're just going to make Jean Grey the mother of Cable, which is what I assume they're going with here. I think that's Cable in the womb. Unless Wolverine's the father. Oh, shit scandals. I doubt that they would do that. But if they're making Jean Grey. 16:16Cable's mother. I'm totally fine with that because she basically raised him in the comic books anyway when she and Scott were sent to the future to take care of him. I don't really like the character of Madeline Pryor or like the Goblin Queen or any of that stuff. So I won't miss her if she's gone. It looks like Magneto has taken over the whole school, which is kind of cool. Yeah, that is from the comics. Magneto took over the school around the time of the New Mutants and he kind of turned over a new leaf for a while before, you know, going back to being the villain. 16:46The trailer got me pumped up with loads of nostalgia. I remember loving this series as a kid, especially the first two seasons. The show kind of fell off after that. But the show was always known for seriously tackling the issues of prejudice and things like that. And hopefully this new cartoon really runs with those themes, keeps it as straight as possible, doesn't make it too goofy or anything like that because that's what made the original 90s X-Men cartoon so great. I can't wait for it. The show is actually going to debut pretty soon here in about a month on March 20th. 17:26What was your favorite character from the X-Men 90s cartoon, besides Wolverine, and why? I mean, everyone's gonna say Wolverine, so yeah, that's probably a good caveat.

Clarkson and stars Dakota Johnson, Sidney Sweeney, Isabella Merced, Celeste O'Connor, and Tahar Rahim. The movie is based on an obscure Spider-Man ally from the comic books, a mysterious psychic woman who can peer into the web of life and destiny, and has helped Spidey in several of his adventures. Madam Web is a project that literally no one asked for, centered around a character that isn't even bottom of the barrel. 19:00She's so under and below the barrel that you have to dig to find her. I wasn't anticipating this film, I only moderately enjoyed it and I won't be recommending it. I don't think a lot of people are going to be seeing this movie, I don't think it's necessary to see. So as I give our obligatory spoiler warning for this review, I do so with great ambivalence. If you don't want to be spoiled on Madame Webb's plot, give us a pause and I wish you the best in seeing this movie. 19:31If it sounds like I'm actively discouraging people from seeing the film, you may be partially correct. It's gotten to the point now where the obviousness of Sony's disregard for the source material and the audience is beyond the pale. For those who may not know, prior to the existence of Marvel Studios, the film rights for many Marvel characters were sold to outside studios with Spider-Man going to Sony. It made sense at the time because Marvel was a publishing company. They made comics. They didn't know how to make movies. 20:01But since the mid-2000s, Sony has cranked out a lot of subpar live action films, especially when compared to Marvel Studios, who has obviously had the best handle on their own intellectual property. Spider-Man has fared much better at Marvel than he ever did at Sony, but technically the Spider-Man Home Trilogy films were a Marvel production of a Sony franchise, because to this day, Sony still has the rights to Spider-Man, and they will continue to have them as long as they keep making Spider-Man-related films and don't lapse on their contract. 20:31The only reason average films like The Amazing Spider-Man, Venom, Morbius, and now Madame Web were made was to keep the character from reverting to Marvel. In Sony's eyes, it's better to make a mediocre movie now that no one wants to see in order to retain the potential of making money later. And as a Marvel fan, and as a movie fan, that sucks. And if we have to show the studio that message with our wallets, then that's what we should probably do. 21:01Don't go through any great efforts to see this movie if you already weren't planning on doing so. Yeah, it's definitely not worth your time, I would say. Yeah, I mean, it's not terrible, but you're right, yeah. It's not worth probably the money that you would spend. I would probably say if you're gonna see it, wait until it's out of theaters on streaming. That being said, I'm not gonna bash this movie for the sake of it. I will remain as impartial as I can as a critic. There are some people out there saying that this is the worst superhero movie ever made. 21:30But I think they're forgetting that 2015's Fantastic Four exists. Or Batman and Robin, which was worse than that. Or the Shaquille O'Neal Steel movie, which was worse than that. So, Madame Webbe, I would say, is around the same quality as Morbius, although I personally liked Morbius a little bit more. Madame Webbe is a film that is more divisive than outright horrible. And I'll say that I liked it a little bit more than I thought I would. But in the end, I could take it or leave it. Again, it's a film no one asked for. Yeah, I mean... 22:00I also liked it surprisingly a little bit more than I thought I would because I was expecting the worst movie that's ever been made honestly with the way film critics were talking about it. But I honestly liked it more than Morbius. I'd say I liked it more than Electra. There are worse Marvel movies than this in my opinion. Yeah, go see Howard the Duck, right? Exactly. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's really hard to watch non MCU Marvel movies, because it's obvious that they don't have a roadmap. 22:29You know, how does this connect in any way to Morbius or the upcoming Craven film or Venom? I have no idea. I honestly don't care. Yeah, I really don't care where this whole thing is going. And I kind of get the impression that the filmmakers didn't really care about this project at all either. And even the writers, it seems like none of them had really read the comics. Well, I mean, it's not like there's a huge amount of Maddenweb comics to go off of. You know, this is largely an original origin story for the character. 22:59Yeah, to be honest, I don't know much about the character. All I know from her is what I learned from the animated series in the 90s. Yeah, that was also my introduction to the character. She had quite a sizable role within that animated series, much larger than she ever did in the comic books. Interesting. The movie isn't a total dumpster fire. I think what keeps the film from being so is the director, S.J. Clarkson. 23:21This lady has been a part of every single television show you've ever loved in the last 15 or so years, having directed quintessential episodes of Heroes, House, Dexter, Bates Motel, Orange is the New Black, Jessica Jones, Game of Thrones, Succession, Need I Go On. You know, SJ Clarkson is incredibly acclaimed and talented. And I also think that she set up some incredible shots in this movie, especially in the first act when Cassie is discovering her powers. It's clear. 23:50that the director had an incredible knack for visual storytelling. The problem is that the story has to be good, and Madame Webb's story is not good. A lot of the characters are shallow, the second act is a drag with very little momentum, and I don't care how good of a director you are, there's no way to direct most of the dialogue in this film. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in any film. And what's really tragic is that S.J. Clarkson actually has a screenplay credit here. 24:19So it's not clear where things went wrong, but given the director's track record, I can almost guarantee it was studio interference. Interesting. I didn't realize she wrote this as well. That's a shame if it was studio interference because they really threw her under the bus letting her put her name all over it. Yeah, it seems to me when it comes to Sony and the Sony Spider-Man Universe films, it's like a bunch of non-creative business people making creative decisions that muddle the overall vision. 25:17probably would have preferred to this one is the superhero movie that we were promised in the marketing. Like was this even a superhero movie? Maybe in the sense that there were people with powers and a struggle between good and evil, but the costumes were pretty much non-existent. It wasn't like this, it was a spider-woman team-up film where we got to see these ladies kick ass. Right? Yeah, I don't even know like how the girls got their spider powers. Like what the hell? Yeah, the characters were like pretty much a bait-and-switch I think, which was not cool. 25:46The film felt so small because the stakes were so minuscule. While the film implies that these teenage girls will grow up to become superheroes, doesn't show anything to the effect of them, you know, saving the world in the future or even stopping a crime or doing anything worthwhile besides striking some cool poses. I mean, technically they all kind of saved Peter Parker's life, but it's not even clear in this universe whether or not. 26:11Peter Parker will become Spider-Man. If he does, he's not a very original character considering there's a shit ton of other Spider-People in this universe. And that's one of the worst things about this movie, right? The implications that it has on the larger Sony Spider-Man universe where everybody gets Spider-powers. You get Spider-powers. You get Spider-powers. There's a whole race of indigenous Spider-People in Peru apparently. And you know... 26:36There is some of that in the comics. There's the whole spider society, which I think was one of the worst ideas ever. Like J. Michael Straczynski really started this all when he insinuated that Spider-Man was part of the spider totem and that all of his animal themed bad guys were also representatives of their animal totems. It's kind of a neat idea and concept, but people ran with that shit for years and years. And then it just outstated its welcome. Like you had the sisterhood of the wasps. 27:03and the Spider Society and all this random shit. And it got really lame really fast. I'm just gonna say it now. There's too many Spider-Men, like way too many. I agree with you, for sure. At least within the 616 proper universe, I don't care how many Spider-Men there are across the multiverse. And I think that actually works, especially when you look at a film across the Spider-Verse. But when you have 50 million Spider-Men and Spider-Women in the same playground, it gets a little crowded. 27:31Which is a shame, I feel like, for anyone who liked the Spider-Verse films. Like if they go into this movie expecting like more of that kind of awesomeness, they're going to be sorely disappointed. Oh, for the most part. I really wish that this movie, like those Spider-Verse films, was made for the fans. Because honestly, I don't think this one was. I think this was trying to capture a new demographic for superhero films that really isn't. 27:57as interested in them as comic book readers. I 100% agree. It was like it was trying to tap into like the teenage thriller genre, like the people that went and saw Final Destination. But I think they'll be disappointed when they see this film. Of course, the fans will be disappointed. So it's hard to know exactly who is going to love this movie, if anybody. But speaking of the characters, let's go ahead and get into our character breakdown, starting with Madame Webb, aka Cassandra Webb, who was played by Dakota Johnson. 28:26I actually liked Dakota Johnson here more than I wanted to. I haven't seen her in too much stuff, only in Suspiria, but I was never too impressed with her acting ability. In this movie though, I actually thought she did well enough with most of the material, not just in conveying her burgeoning psychic powers, but also her emotional scenes as well. Yeah, this was also the first time I saw her. I agree, I didn't think she did that terrible. She probably had the best performance in the film next to like Adam Scott. Yeah. 28:55She has this kind of deadpan style to her that I think was really able to tap into the script's humor. I think she sold the comedy actually really well. What little comedy there was in the script. And surprisingly, I believed in the idea of her as a superhero toward the end of the movie more than I believed in her as a cynical paramedic in the beginning of the film. I wouldn't mind seeing more of her as a superhero character if and when she turns up again down the line. 29:22I praise her performance, however, with the caveat that she completely dropped the ball in her final scene with the wheelchair and the strange eyeglasses. That was just a really bad delivery. Absolutely. I'm still really confused by that whole thing. Like obviously she was blinded by some kind of debris, but when did she become paralyzed? How did she afford this like badass wheelchair? And why was she like all smiley at the end? Like the future has been really good, I guess. I don't know. 29:51I remember reading a quote from James Marsden over 20 years ago when he was doing an interview for the first X-Men movie saying that it was really hard to act through his cyclops visor and I think maybe Dakota Johnson just had the same struggles here. Yeah, it's gotta be a challenge. And it's a shame that Final Seem was what the audience was left with because I think the rest of her performance was pretty decent. Good even. 30:13Especially as she goes through her arc, you know, Cassie starts the film as a cynical paramedic detached from others due to her life as a seemingly unloved foster child. I think she resented her mother for being more invested in her research in the Amazon and then dying instead of caring and being there for her. And what's actually great about this aspect of the movie is that I thought the same thing about her mom. Like, I remember thinking in the beginning, like, lady, you are pregnant, do not fight over the spider with the gun toting psycho. 30:43But in Cassie getting her powers and exploring their ties to her mother's past, she learns that her mom did care about her, that her whole reason for seeking out the spider was for the improved quality of life for her child. And I don't know if it's because I'm a parent now, but that revelation hit me like a punch in the gut. And Cassie carried that forward, protecting and then seemingly raising these neglected teens as the mother figure herself, coming full circle. 31:37character of Madame Webb actually has in the comic books. It's called Myasthenia Gravis, and in the books, Madame Webb was born with it. She was born blind and a paraplegic, and she developed these psychic powers, this ability to peer into the web of life and destiny, which is a construct of fate. And in this movie, that is the disease that Cassie's mom was trying to prevent. Yeah, so you could say it's ironic then that her daughter ended up blind and in a wheelchair anyway at the end. 32:05Yeah, like it was faded or something. The web of life and destiny is actually the source of Spider-Man's Spidey-Sense and all the Spider characters who have Spidey-Sense are able to tap into that just a little bit. In the comics, Madame Web worked as a psychic medium who was once visited by Peter Parker, whom she knew off the bat was Spider-Man, surprising him, and she would go on to help him in several of his adventures. She not only had telepathy, but she also had clairvoyance. She could predict the future and she could also astral project. 32:34This movie had an interesting take on the astral projection though, in that she could send out multiple copies of herself who could also interact physically with the environment. That was a little weird. Yeah, pretty unique though. I thought that was actually kind of cool. Yeah, it's an interesting way to not limit her so much if the character is ever used again in future films. Let's go ahead and move on to Julia Cornwall who is played by Sydney Sweeney. This is actually my first time seeing Sydney Sweeney in anything. I never watched Euphoria or White Lotus or anything. 33:30I think she played an insecure teenager fairly well. Stop thinking with your dick. She was not great in this movie. I don't think I am. Honestly, I think she did the best out of the three teenage actresses or playing teenagers. I think Isabella Merced did the best. And that's good news for you considering that she's going to be Hawke Girl in next year's Superman legacy movie. But let's talk about Anya Corazon played by Isabella Merced. None of the characters were written well. Again, the dialogue was so incredibly awful. 34:00But at least I think Anya had the most believable delivery. Sydney Sweeney had to play this shy teenager, which she totally didn't come across as. Celeste O'Connor, who played Maddie Franklin, tried to portray herself as this rebellious teen, which I also didn't think she sold. But Isabella Merced as Anya really just had to play smart. She was the smart one. She had the easiest acting job, and therefore I think she pulled it off better. 34:25Yeah, I mean, she did fine. I don't know if I agree that she did better than the Sidney Sweeney, but yeah, she definitely did better than Celeste O'Connor. Yeah, Celeste O'Connor played Maddie Franklin. This is my first time seeing Celeste in anything, and if I never see her again in another film, I think I would be just fine. Her acting was so bad in this movie. She brought down the entire film like she didn't deliver a single line, believably, I thought, and it was probably one of the. 34:51worst performances out of any superhero movie in the last few decades. But not only that, like her character sucked. Like Maddie was so unlikable and rude and impulsive. And when she tried rescuing Cassie while skateboarding on a piece of debris, I wanted to fucking puke. If we gave away Brothers Awards for the worst moment, that would win it, because that was just ridiculous. What did you think about her backstory? Are I guess any of these three girls backstories? I thought they were good backstories. I agree. I thought. 35:20that made the characters more interesting. What I'm really curious about is how they got their powers in the movie. Yeah, they never address that. They just leave it open-ended, I assume, for maybe a sequel, where they'll get their powers or something like that. But in the comics, Cassie just kind of developed her powers. She's not a mutant, but she just became a psychic, I think, largely because her condition left her with a clairvoyant mind. But Julia Cornwall, who would later become Julia Carpenter, she got her powers through genetic experiments. 36:17It didn't give her spider abilities, but it did give her strength, speed, agility, reflexes. But she later got the additional abilities of Madame Webb's granddaughter, who had been turned into a spider-human hybrid by Doctor Octopus, hence the giant spider legs from her back that allow her to wall crawl. And then Anya, who is known as Aranya in the books, or Spider Girl sometimes, her powers were given to her by a sorcerer of the Secret Spider Society who was trying to save her life. 36:46and she did get the powers of a spider in addition to the ability to summon this exoskeleton armor. And she also carries these spider bola devices that she created that allow her to grapple ledges and snare opponents and can also be thrown as projectiles. So we saw that in the movie too. Man, that's a lot to get through in a sequel if they ever do. Yeah, I assume that if they ever get to those superhero origins, they'll probably all get their powers in the same way. Yeah, from the spiders in Peru, I guess. 37:15Speaking of that, let's move on to Ezekiel Sims who is played by Tahar Rahim. I don't even know where to start. Tahar Rahim is an actor I've never heard of playing horribly a role that is unrecognizable compared to the comic book Ezekiel, a character who in itself is a big ol' sack of mediocrity. Never ever have I cared less about a comic book movie villain. He had no arc beyond his desire to just continue existing. 37:45Beyond that, there were no goals. You know, he's a guy who wanted the spider venom to give himself power. And I guess he did that. You know, he amassed this power and wealth, but like, who the fuck is this guy? Like, why did he want power? What did he plan on doing with it? What was he doing all this time as Cassie was growing up? Like fucking investing in stocks and jacking off or some shit? He was not a good villain. He was barely even a character. You know, he mentioned something in. 38:13the Amazon about his family starving or something like that. And I guess he built an empire after that. But I have no sense of how loaded this guy is. Apparently only has like one employee who works in his apartment. It's like they couldn't find another location for him. They couldn't like show him walking through office space or anything like that. It's like, holy crap, what is going on here? Like he wasn't evil enough. He wasn't interesting enough. He wasn't anything worthwhile enough. And also his acting was not great. 38:42Not only did I not believe any of Tahar Rahim's line deliveries, I don't even think he delivered them because his voice never matched his mouth. It was like most of his lines were 80 yard in post-production. Yes. I actually wondered if that was his actual voice in the movie or if they got another actor to do his lines because I don't know, maybe he had a really heavy accent that was difficult to understand. I could definitely see in a lot of the shadowy scenes and just in the poor editing that he wasn't really actually saying. 39:11the lines we are hearing. Yeah, that may be due to rewrites, might be due to an accent or something. He's a French actor, and maybe he couldn't pull off a convincing Latin American accent, which I think the character was supposed to be. Yeah, who knows? But in the books, Ezekiel is not Peruvian, although he did get his powers through a mystic ritual in a Peruvian spider temple, which is probably why the movie started off in Peru. But like Ezekiel never wore a black Spider-Man suit in the comics. 39:40Where did that come from? Like, I want to know the reasoning behind that. The film never addresses why he looks like Spider-Man. It makes no sense, especially when you consider the implications for Spider-Man and his costume, which he developed and created and conceived of all on his own. It implies that maybe there was some external influence in Peter Parker's costume creation, and that doesn't make sense. Maybe from the Peruvian spider people? Not sure. Oh, that was dumb too. 40:09It was interesting. I kind of feel like when they were trying to explain the character of Ezekiel, they're like, he's kind of like Spider-Man. So they're like, oh, so he wears a suit. Let's just make him look like evil Spider-Man. Ugh. Yeah, that was some studio executives idea for sure. They're like, we got to make it marketable. We got to make it seem like Spider-Man's in this movie. 100%. The final characters I want to talk about are Benjamin Parker, played by Adam Scott, and Mary Parker, played by Emma Roberts. I don't have too much to say about them because their roles were so small. 40:39They're both likable actors who I think were entirely wasted in their roles in this movie. I don't know about wasted. I think they almost kind of added credibility to the film that it would have normally had. I liked seeing them in those roles. I think they're bigger actors than, you know, what those roles called for. They could have gotten away with actors of a lesser caliber, but no, I like seeing them in the roles. 41:01Yeah, it makes you wonder if they're planning to use them again down the line, which is why they wanted to get these bigger name actors. I keep making allusions to a sequel to this movie, but I think it's pretty clear that that's not going to happen. If Madame Web ever shows up again, it's probably going to be in some kind of like team up film, like Sinister Six type movie or something like that, that I think Sony is working toward, but probably not a Madame Web too. Just taking the box office into consideration. Yeah, I didn't even get number one. And this is a Spider-Man movie. That's crazy. 41:43In 1973, medical researcher Constance Webb discovers a rare species of spider in the Peruvian jungle whose venom has healing and strengthening properties. Though she is pregnant, her security escort Ezekiel Sims shoots her and steals the spider. An indigenous tribe tries to save Constance's life using the spider venom, but she dies shortly after giving birth to her daughter Cassandra. Now writing out that scene kind of sounds pretty interesting and cool in theory. 42:11But seeing it done in practice, I thought was kind of ridiculous, especially when you see the indigenous tribe crawling through the trees looking like Spider-Man. It's like, what the fuck is going on here? The CG is pretty bad seeing them leap through the trees. But I honestly didn't hate the designs of them. Like, if you're going to do an indigenous Amazon tribe, Spider-Man, that's how you do it. I didn't like the black webbing that they covered their bodies in. It was like. 42:39black twigs or something. Yeah, or netting, something like that. Some kind of- It was like trying too hard to make it look like Spider-Man's costume. Probably, probably that's fair. I thought it was just kind of an interesting design at the very least. Now when they were talking about the legend of the Aranya people, I forget what they called them, they mentioned a poison touch that Ezekiel Sims, of course, later on gets. What did you think of that? 43:03I think that's a cool idea, Ezekiel does not have that power in the comics, but I think it was a way to make him seem more villainous and more threatening. Back to the story, 30 years later, in 2003 Queens, New York, Cassie works as a paramedic alongside her partner Ben Parker. After helping rescue a man from a car about to fall off a bridge, she falls into the water and has a near-death experience that awakens her psychic potential to see into the web of life and destiny. 43:30I thought that was a pretty cool scene when she first started seeing the web in the water. It was hella confusing, honestly. I did like how the shattered glass looked like a web. Actually there's a ton of shattered glass in this movie that's very web-like. It's kind of like a recurring visual motif. Yeah, I thought that was pretty neat. Especially when it also correlates to what feels like her mind fracturing as her powers start developing. Right, yeah exactly. I do have a question. 43:57Were Cassandra and Ben fucking? No. OK. He stuck in the tip once. It didn't count. He put in a ball. All I know is that didn't really mean anything. Ben tells her that, like, you know, he's met someone, but he never says may. I was just wondering because they had like a weird chemistry between each other. No, I think she was too detached for any sort of relationship. Oh, Cassie began suffering from visions that turn out to come true, such as the death of her coworker, O'Neil. 44:27Meanwhile, it's revealed that since his time in Peru, Ezekiel used the spider venom to grant himself enhanced physicality, wall crawling ability, a poisonous touch, and precognitive dreams. Ezekiel seduces and kills an NSA agent to get access to a person tracking system to find three girls that his visions have convinced him will kill him in the future. I do think you can't really say precognitive dreams considering the fact that his dreams were lying to him. 44:54Yeah, it's hard to say because, you know, according to this movie, the future can be changed. So, I'm wondering if that's what would have happened to him if Madame Webb never came to be or something. Who knows? I have no idea what happened there. Yeah, kind of dumb. Meanwhile, Cassie has a vision on the subway of Ezekiel murdering the three girls, Julia Cornwall, Maddie Franklin, and Anya Corazon. She convinces the girls to get off the train and they flee. Ezekiel pursues them. 45:21but his attention is diverted long enough by local police trying to stop him for Cassie and the girls to escape in a taxi. Cassie drives them to a nearby forest where they discuss the man who moves like a spider. Cassie tells them to wait there as she leaves to revisit her mother's spider research back home. I thought it was a little convenient how easily they were able to ditch Ezekiel. 45:42Really, he was too distracted by taking out police officers. Why not just wait for them to be away from the police considering no one was looking up at the ceiling apparently to see him? Well, the police were shooting at him. He had to take him out. They would have kept shooting at him as he was trying to get at the girls. But they were only shooting at him because he started attacking them, right? Well, and also because he's a fucking dude crawling on the ceiling. I think, you know, anybody would shoot at that. That's where I would. 46:11Back in the forest, the girls get restless and walk to a nearby diner. Cassie learns from her mother's journal about the rare Peruvian spider, the mysterious indigenous tribe, and Ezekiel's identity as her mother's former security escort. At the diner, the girls draw attention to themselves, prompting a local to report the location of their missing whereabouts, leading to Ezekiel finding them. Cassie gets visions of Ezekiel killing them in the diner, prompting her to crash her car into the restaurant to ram him. 46:40Teenage girls, man, you can't leave them alone for a second before they're dancing on a tabletop so impress some boys. I don't know what kind of kid you're raising, but she needs to shape up. I was just saying, it was like bad writing. Like really bad. It was. Cassie hides the girls at a hotel where she learns more about Ezekiel's motives and abilities after communicating with him through a dream. She teaches the girls how to perform CPR, then leaves them to hide out at Ben's while she travels to Peru. 47:08There Cassie discovers a member of the indigenous tribe who tells her how her mother died and guides her through the web of life and destiny revealing that her pregnant mom sought out the spider in Peru to cure her daughter's myasthenia gravis. I do wonder why the guy wasn't dressed up like rainforest spider-man anymore. He was like wearing regular clothes. Like, does the tribe sometimes paint themselves red and cover themselves in black twigs and then sometimes wear regular clothes? 47:35Or I had something happen to that guy in the last 30 years where he was like, you know what? I'm going to move out of the rainforest. Yeah, I wondered the same thing. I think that was a mistake. I think they should have kept with the tribal look. Yeah, I agree, because, you know, they felt very mysterious and mystical almost. Back in Queens, Ben's sister-in-law, Mary, goes into labor on the way to the hospital. Ben's car is caught on camera with the girls and Ezekiel pursues them. Cassie. 48:01Now back in New York has a vision of them being attacked and steals an ambulance to help the girls escape and divert Ezekiel away from Ben and Mary. She takes the girls to a condemned fireworks factory where they set up traps for Ezekiel and call for a helicopter medical evac. Now I'm pretty sure that freaking fireworks factory burned down earlier in the movie, right? Right? Yeah, like how are all those fireworks still there after a fire like that? That doesn't make any sense. 48:26Also, I didn't realize that bottle rockets could shoot holes through brick walls. I got to be more careful with those things. I know, right? Those fireworks were so ridiculously overpowered. I think it was a front for like a mafia artillery cache or something like that, because like literally one of those fireworks took down a whole fucking helicopter, like exploded it. It's so crazy. And like ripping holes through the roof and like it pretty much toppled the whole building down. 48:54It's like, where can I buy these fireworks? Not where we live. You and I have had some fireworks mishaps on our own, you know, like accidentally having them explode the cardboard tube that they're in and like sending sparks everywhere. But I don't remember that being powerful enough to like rip a hole in someone's house. It's sad guys are on fire, but didn't destroy a house. When Ezekiel arrives, the fireworks distract him as the girls make their way to the roof for the evac. Ezekiel follows and the helicopter gets destroyed, putting each of the girls in danger. 49:48ambulances and fireworks and signs. I think that maybe his spidey sense kind of manifests as those dreams, visions that he gets. Sucks to be him then. Yeah. Cassie also falls off the building into the river below where she's blinded by a firework. She's saved from drowning by Julia and Maddie and Anya perform CPR. Cassie awakens in a hospital, now paralyzed and blind, and learns that Mary gave birth to her son, Peter. 50:16Back at her apartment in a wheelchair, Cassie decides to mentor the girls in their future roles as Spider-Heroes and has a vision of them in costume. No, they never named the baby Peter. No, and you know, fans will obviously get the reference. I don't know if general audiences will know that that's actually Spider-Man and Uncle Ben and Spider-Man's mom. Yeah, no one in my family did. I saw it with my wife and daughters and I had to explain to them who those characters were and why they were important. 50:45Seems like they dropped the ball on that front. Yeah. You know, considering that at the baby shower, they played a game where they tried to guess the baby's first name. They could have at least followed through with that by having a scene where Cassie visits Mary and is like, so what did that name end up being? And she's like, Peter, you know, and then the audience is like, Oh my God. You know, that would have been better. Right. Right. And the baby would have been played by Toby McGuire. Right. Exactly. I didn't see this would have flipped out. 51:13Yeah, superimposed Toby McGuire's face on little baby's head. The costumes we saw at the end were not great. I feel like that was the best look we got at them. And I did not love Madame Webbs. It looked really cheap. I don't know if it was just like the lipstick or the glasses or I don't know. Just I didn't like it. I don't like any of them as much as I thought I would. 51:37I liked the costumes, I did not like the headgear on any of them. Especially Madame Web's which looked like a plastic sleeping eye mask. Yes. The costume looked fine though. I didn't like Julia Cornwall's mask. That was weird. Oh, like the chin strap? Yeah. Very strange. But that was the end of the movie. There was no end credit scene or mid credit scene. I think I was half expecting Jared Leto to show up and say it's morbentime or something like that. But I'm kind of glad that there wasn't. Overall. 52:06The movie did have some emotional moments and was competently directed, but I think a beautiful arc regarding motherhood can't save the film from its clunky dialogue, the lack of superhero action, subpar performances, and forgettable characters. I rate this film 2.5 stars out of 5, a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, that sounds about right. I forget what we gave Morbius. We gave Morbius 3 stars? Yeesh. 52:34But I actually think Morbius had a stronger story and a better villain. I actually think Madame Web was about the same quality as the Echo television series that we just reviewed, which we also gave two and a half stars. Yeah, maybe you're right when it comes down to the villain. This absolutely was one of the worst villains in superhero cinema history, hands down. So yeah, around 2.5 seems right to me. I'm not expecting much better in terms of quality for the next Sony Spider-Man Universe film that's coming out later this year. 53:03which will be Craven the Hunter. Yeah, no, the whole radioactive lion blood just still freaking kills me. These Sony film writers need to read the comics. They would have made something we actually maybe would have wanted to see, like a Miles Morales movie or like Prowler, I don't know, something cool. I think a Prowler movie is a great idea. Just make it starring Donald Glover. I'd definitely see that. Oh, you weren't into Hypno Hustler? No, fuck that. 54:00or our newest tier that lets you join our Dynamike Podcast Network.

"Feb 20, 2024"," Let’s be honest here, most people had made up their minds on this film before ever going to see it hadn’t they? It’s okay to admit it, best being honest with these things. In fact any film that falls under the Sony’s Spider-Man Universe franchise – with the exception of the Venom films (Tom Hardy is bulletproof) – is likely to find itself fired upon by the web shooters of, well, the world wide web! But for those brave few who dared venture into the cinema, is this “the worst comic book movie ever” or “one of the most ramshackle films ever released”?  Madame Web, adapted from the Marvel Comics Spider-Verse character, sees New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) undergo a near fatal experience, that seems to unlock abilities within her that she never realised she had. Abilities gifted to her at birth. Abilities that allow her to see fragments of the future, and when she sees three teenage girls attacked by a brutal masked man, she must act to save them. Not realising, just how connected all these people really are to her. Including this vicious attacker. So…Madame Web is in so many numerous ways a bit of a tangled messy web indeed (certain lines of dialogue, the odd wooden performance, some logical leaps) and thus will do nothing to dispel all the talk of superhero fatigue and the genre’s nosedive in quality perceptions. But, call it the pre-release overblown anti-hype that Twitter, sorry X (sigh), have relished basking in, but this writer ended up really enjoying the experience.  S.J. Clarkson’s film just had something about it that won us over and is nowhere near the blight on comic book cinema it is being made out to be. Be it the well-worn (so to speak) costumed superhero stuff taking more of a backseat to a rather rollicking slasher-inspired Final Destination-esque horror thriller with some campy detours, or some entertaining characters that you are quite happy to spend time with, the whole mad little experience is endearing rather than tiring.  Madame Web is a bonkers movie that is as imperfect as it gets, from its tangled lore down to its wacky creative and filming decisions but it is also infinitely more interesting than other assembly line super capers for this very reason, and is largely its own thing rather than a tick box venture in universe building. All in all, it is a good night out, with a pigeon-saving, people-avoiding, new kind of hero and a finale that plays out like Highlander’s final set piece had it been sponsored by Pepsi! Chalk Madame Web up as one of those so called “disasters” that a select few (*raises hand) will gladly go back to and enjoy every time (Jonah Hex, Spawn, Howard The Duck) rather than an empty husk of a movie that you forget about as soon as you leave the cinema (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania) or truly a title deserving of worst comic book film ever (Fant4stic).  Maybe we are going slightly mad (it finally happened…), but we can foresee a certain crowd embracing this fun flick down the line. This Madame caught us in her web clearly!",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2024",I&#8217;m a firm believer that to know what a good movie is&#44; one needs to know what a bad one is as well&#46; I think we all know where this one lands&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2024"," It’s not very often that a superhero movie is so bad that you agree with all those villains who want superheroes to cease to exist. Look, we’ve seen bad superhero movies before. In 2022, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe gave us Morbius, which was an atrocity on every level. Two years later, they have managed to exceed every expectation that we have. And our expectations were low. Madame Web is unwatchable. There is no redeeming quality that could make this worth watching besides how laughably terrible it is. I’ve seen a lot of bad movies that people can make excuses for because they were low-budget and didn’t have the resources to be as good as they could be. This is an $80 million film using Marvel characters. There is no excuse for this. I struggle to figure out how a movie like Madame Web got greenlit in the first place. How did nobody mention during the first table read that the dialogue is so poorly written that not even the most talented actor could sell it? How did nobody look at each scene and see how choppily edited everything is? How was this movie allowed to be released in theaters as is? It genuinely feels like they took the very first rough cut of a superhero movie and accidentally leaked the footage into theaters. I think this is the first time I’ve cringed so hard my soul left my body. We’re gonna start from the top. Our movie opens with a woman who is nine months pregnant looking at spiders in the Amazonian jungle. It’s not the best idea for a pregnant woman to be in this environment, but Madame Web doesn’t have the best ideas. She holds a spider, but her colleague, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), turns on her. He points a gun at her and demands the spider. Why does he want the spider so bad? We really only get one line about it. It’s not enough to get anyone in the audience to care about his goal or his motivation. He shoots the pregnant woman, but a tribe saves her baby, who grows up to be Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson). Cassie is a paramedic with a very confusing set of character traits. She’s a paramedic, so you would think we’d have scenes of her helping and caring for people to get us to like and trust her, right? Nope! However, we do get a scene where a kid thanks her for saving her life, but she not only has forgotten about the kid, but is very rude to the kid as she reluctantly accepts a drawing the kid made for her. How is this a defining action that can get us on Cassie’s side? We later get the sense that she is spiteful about the idea of families because she grew up alone in foster care. However, her portrayal registers as unlikable and painful to watch. Throughout these scenes, we have a few red flags that key us into how horrendous this movie will be. First of all, the camerawork is frighteningly bad. During the dialogue scene between Cassie’s mom and Ezekiel, the camera makes very odd zooms during the shot. They look like very small crash zooms. They look like accidental zooms you see when watching documentary footage. Why does the camerawork for a very intense scene where a man is pointing a gun at a pregnant woman look like an episode of The Office? Furthermore, once we cut to the film’s setting in 2003 New York, we get tons of jokes that don’t land and dialogue that does not flow naturally in the slightest. My next criticism is something that is inexcusable. The whole movie is unforgivable, but this is a major technical error. Nearly every single line that Ezekiel says in the movie is ADR. If you look at the way his lips move in nearly all his scenes, they don’t actually line up with the words we’re hearing. It looks like a foreign-language film dubbed in English. That’s how bad the ADR in this movie is. I don’t know what happened here. My best guess is they rewrote all of his dialogue in post-production and didn’t want to reshoot anything. But this is an $80 million movie. There is no excuse for having ADR this painfully obvious in a big-budget studio film. Especially because it doesn’t just happen once. There are at least ten moments where you’ll see his lips not matching his voice. An early scene shows Cassie at a baby shower, where everyone has written fond memories of their parents on paper, and they’re reading it aloud. When they get to Cassie, they find she has submitted a blank piece of paper. When asked to elaborate, Cassie reveals her mom died in childbirth, and she grew up alone. This is the most awkward place to dump this exposition on not only the audience but also the other guests at the baby shower. Everyone was celebrating the mother and her baby, and Cassie managed to make the entire event dour by turning it into a pity party for herself. How are we supposed to like her as a person? How? There’s dreadful dialogue throughout the entire film, including an ADR line where Cassie says she has to go watch American Idol. It seems like they threw that in to sell the 2003 setting. But pretty soon, Cassie discovers that she has the power to see into the future. There are moments where we’ll see an event occur, and then we cut back to a few minutes earlier and reveal it hasn’t happened yet. It’s a lot like the 2007 Nicolas Cage movie Next, where he plays a magician who can see into the future. That’s not a great film, but it executes the concept much better than Madame Web. Let’s talk a little more about that dialogue. The expositional dialogue is extremely clunky. There are many moments where we see an event happen, and then a character states exactly what the audience just saw out loud. Why do we need that? I don’t know. There’s a lot of dialogue here that none of these actors can sell. The writing is bad, but so are the performances. Johnson is unwatchable in this movie. She’s been excellent in other films like The Peanut Butter Falcon and Cha Cha Real Smooth, but this is a charmless, bland performance. She barely displays any emotion. This is the type of performance we haven’t seen since Kristen Stewart in Twilight. She is not captivating enough of a performer to lead a movie like this. It’s like assigning emotions to a wall. But let’s look at this supporting cast. We have a very talented group of actresses who are sprinting their way towards Hollywood stardom. Sydney Sweeney has made a lasting impression in Euphoria and, more recently, in the rom-com Anyone But You. Isabela Merced has consistently turned in strong work in Instant Family and Dora and the Lost City of Gold, and she’ll even be returning to the superhero genre in James Gunn’s Superman: Legacy. Celeste O’Connor is wonderful in Freaky and Ghostbusters: Afterlife. They’re excellent actresses. It takes truly special filmmakers to display this little of their talent. They’re awful in this movie, but they have nothing to work with. They have to read badly written, poorly directed dialogue, and they’re doing the best they can. Let’s talk about the characters. What Madame Web manages to do with all of them is fascinating. After trying its damnedest to make you hate everything about our protagonist, the movie puts Cassie in charge of the three teenage girls whom Ezekiel is trying to kill. Her solution is to put them in a taxi, drive them out into the middle of the woods, and then leave them there with no food and water. She tells them she will come back for them, but of course, they don’t stay put. Meanwhile, a radio broadcast reveals that Cassie is now wanted by the police for allegedly kidnapping these three girls. This storyline is never resolved in the movie. It’s entirely forgotten about. The idea they’re going for here is that Cassie never had a family growing up, and she finds family in these three teenage girls who she’s trying to protect. I get that. But the movie never slows down to have fun with them and give them all chemistry organically. These three teenage girls were all on a train, and Cassie saved them from Ezekiel. Cassie and the girls only manage to escape because Ezekiel spends all his time taking out the police officers when he could very easily just kill the girls he’s after. After being forced to stick together, these girls go to a nearby diner, and they all end up standing on top of a table and dancing to “Toxic” by Britney Spears. Who wrote this? Why is this how they’re supposed to build a bond? This is weird, and it is out of character for teenage girls in the middle of nowhere who just survived a murder attempt. Later, we learn more about who these girls are. The exposition here is abysmal. The characters stand in a circle and take turns sharing their name and their relationship with their parents. They just stand around and verbally state their backstories to get us to care about them. It doesn’t work. Not only do we not see the backstories, but it doesn’t affect their actions or how they would perform in a life-or-death situation. More importantly, the backstories never get resolved! They don’t have character arcs. The backstories exist in one scene and are then thrown away and forgotten! We then have our third act, where Cassie learns about herself. After years of a (largely offscreen) contempt for her mother, Cassie learns that her mother was supposedly kind and had noble reasons for wanting the spider. This revelation doesn’t work because the audience saw most of it in the first five minutes of the movie! Cassie’s emotional revelation is completely weightless. It does not work on a dramatic character level. It is atrocious. But soon enough, it is time for our big final act, where we have the big final showdown between the heroes and villains. Superhero finales have been set against very memorable backdrops, especially the ones set in New York City. X-Men had the Statue of Liberty. Spider-Man had the Queensboro Bridge. But I think Madame Web’s setting takes the cake: a giant Pepsi-Cola sign. Look, I know this Pepsi-Cola sign. I’m a New Yorker, and I’ve seen the sign before. Hell, I’ve even directed a short film under the very same sign. At no point in all my years of living here have I ever thought that this would be a great place for the climactic final battle in a Marvel superhero movie. The finale of this film looks less like a battle and more like a high-budget Pepsi-Cola commercial. Between this and the giant Calvin Klein billboard that Cassie runs a truck through, the product placement in Madame Web is off the charts. I have not seen anything this pathetic in a long time. This is where we have to wonder how everything went so wrong. Whose fault is this? The writers? Two of the Madame Web writers are Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who have previously written cinematic disasters like Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, and Morbius. How have they managed to stay employed in Hollywood? Not a clue. What about the director? This is S. J. Clarkson’s feature directorial debut after decades of working in TV. I’m unfamiliar with her other work, but I’m amazed by what this film is. The dialogue scenes are directed very poorly, and the action sequences are dull. The train scene in this movie should have had so much tension that just isn’t there. The big, rousing finale is not big or rousing. It has some explosions. That’s it. But let’s go back to Sony. Because I’m sure the writers and director did not have a lifelong dream to make a finale set against a giant Pepsi-Cola sign. It’s amazing how a studio can have the rights to these famous Marvel superheroes and do nothing with them. The Spider-Verse movies are major exceptions, but we’ve seen Sony’s terrible attempts at building giant Spider-Man universes in Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rest assured, Madame Web is a new low in attempted superhero setups. The trailers were sure to show a few shots of Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor in their Spider-Women suits. You’d think that this movie features some Spider-Women, right? Wrong. There are no Spider-Women in this movie. Ezekiel has visions of the future, and in those visions, the three teenage girls are Spider-Women. But that does not happen in this movie. They don’t become the Spider-Women. It’s supposed to make you excited to see it happen in a sequel, but that is a cop-out that will never be resolved because this film is too bad to have a sequel. The Spider-Women suits have one minute of screen time in this movie. And we’re never gonna see them again. They only exist in the movie because of the villain’s visions. Madame Web is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies I’ve ever seen. The attempts to be inventive with the camerawork are dizzying, partially because of how poorly edited everything is. This is a new low for Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. It is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. The line delivery is comical. Nobody talks like a real person. The villain is forgettable and not captivating in the slightest. Rahim was outstanding in The Mauritanian, but like every other actor here, he has nothing to work with. This movie was not good enough for theaters, streaming, or your direct-to-DVD bargain bin. It made Morbius look like Citizen Kane. It dangles Spider-Man references at us like keys in front of a cat. Also, Madame Web doesn’t even have a superhero suit. There’s no awesome suit-up because she’s just dressed like a regular person, even during the final battle. What kind of superhero movie is this?! ComingSoon doesn’t enjoy giving out an awful rating, and it’s generally reserved for video games that are broken or entertainment that is devoid of any redeeming qualities. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2024"," The Sony Universe of Spider-Man adjacent movies continue with Madame Web, yet another baffling and nonsensical adventure of absolutely nothing. While the movie is absolutely not as terrible as most are making it seem, it’s still a story that goes nowhere, until it’s seemingly even more disappointing end game. The lesser-known Marvel Comics character in her own movie, along with some much more interesting characters we don’t actually get to spend time with. Read on for my Madame Web review.  Madame Web is a Spider-Man character made popular by the 90s animated Spider-Man series. The comic character is one of the hero’s lesser-known villains, but apparently was the right choice for Sony to make another Spider-Man villain into a kind of anti-hero. The story of Madame Web tries to make the character into an actual hero, but it does so in very strange and odd ways. The movie is about Cassandra Web (Dakota Johnson), a Paramedic in New York who begins to experience visions of the future after a brush with death.  Despite being a movie about a Spider-Man character that cannot ever mention Spider-Man, Madame Web gets dangerously close. And I can’t understand why. There’s a whole side story about Peter Parker himself. Cassie’s partner on the job is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), a young uncle of Peter Parker. Throughout the movie, Ben is seen taking care of his sister-in-law, Mary Parker, as she is pregnant with a son. Part of the third act climax is also about how Mary and Ben are caught up in this adventure of Cassie’s.  Madame Web also teams up with Cassie with three young women who are other Spiderverse characters from the Comics. The three women, played by Isabel Merced, Sydney Sweeney, and Celeste O’Connor, are characters who will eventually get powers and become various spider-woman characters from the comics. These three characters and the chemistry between their actresses make them so much more interesting than the main lead. More interesting than anything Johnson does in the movie.  And while I don’t want to spoil anything in this Madame Web review, let’s just say that the girl’s history and their story don’t get much importance in the movie. Which is one of the more disappointing elements of Madame Web. A movie that had the framework and potential to be pretty great, but gets lost in its convoluted mess. There are hilarious moments, and some pretty funny back-and-forth between the 3 girls, the ultimate climax feels more like a setup than any kind of resolution to the story audiences just saw. All in all, a disappointing entry into more Spider-Man movies without Spider-Man, that continues to make us wonder, ‘why?!’",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2024"," It seems a little cruel to dogpile on a movie that has been bashed even before it was released. But for the life of me, I’m having a really hard time coming up with anything kind to say about Madame Web. All those seemingly infinite resources, and this is what the filmmakers come up with? Perhaps this is the beginning of the end of the unshakeable hold that superhero movies have had on the box office for the past decade and a half. Now, to clear up a little confusion about where this movie fits in the superhero genre, yes, it is a Spiderman spin-off and Spiderman is a Marvel character. But no, Madame Web is not part of Disney’s Marvel Universe. Sony holds the licensing to Spiderman and all its spidey off-shoots. When Spiderman does cavort with Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, etc., it’s with the express permission of Sony executives. You don’t get the feeling anyone involved with the film tried very hard. Dakota Johnson sleepwalks her way through the portrayal of Cassie, a misanthropic paramedic whose mother died giving birth to her in a jungle where she was researching exotic spiders with curative powers. Granted, Johnson was given a ridiculous, cliche-ridden script, but had she inserted a little emotion, perhaps a whiff of irony here and there, her performance might have been more memorable. Cassie inadvertently finds herself in a position to protect three teenage girls who have caught the lethal attention of one Ezekiel Sims (who coincidentally had a nefarious connection with Cassie’s mom back in the jungle). Played by Tahar Rahim, (Napoleon, The Mauritanian), he is one of the most lackluster, forgettable villains to stumble across the big screen. Should he rain down hellfire on the girls who he dreams are destined to kill him, or should he buff his nails? Does anyone really care? The entire film seems like one long, tiresome setup for a sequel, a goal that is sadly (but perhaps fortunately for viewers) out of its reach.

"Feb 20, 2024"," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzThe female British filmmaker S.J. Clarkson (“Toast”/”Banshee”), with a number of TV credits, directs this dreadful clairvoyant superhero movie that has trouble getting off the ground. Clarkson co-writes it with scriptwriters Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker. They base it on the story by Sazama, Sharpless & Kerem Sanga.It’s a Spider-Man spin-off that tells the absurd enigmatic Marvel publishing’s standalone origin story of its superhero heroine, who first appeared in the comics in the 1980s as a secondary character. The role is played by Dakota Johnson as an aloof heroine, seemingly not concerned her dialogue would be a joke if it was funny or that her talent is wasted in such an empty role.In 2003, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a NYC paramedic who has a near-death experience and a sad back story. One day she attains the mental superpower to see into the future and change it. Her first use of these powers is to save three teenagers–Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor)–from being targeted by the dangerous madman Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who possesses spider-like powers. We learn he was in the Amazon with her pregnant mom who was researching spiders before she died. Through his powers, which tie in with Cassie’s, Sims had a strong feeling his powers would one day lead to his death.Everything seems amiss in this dud, from the bland story, the poor editing and directing, and that an action pic could possibly have so little action.If I could show off my limited clairvoyant abilities, even I could predict this stinker will flop at the box-office and with the critics.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024"," One of two things are going to happen - this movie will fade away very quickly or stories will be written about it for years to come. I have to believe this is not the film turned in by the director, editor, sound team, and others who had a hand in making it. I have to believe this is studio wrangling at its most brazen and embarrassing. Let’s start by acknowledging that making movies is hard. Really hard. I was reminded of this when a TikTok reviewer, Kit Lazer (a really great follow by the way), posted a video about this very fact. I think, as critics and film reviewers, we sometimes lose sight of this - though we shouldn’t. As anyone can attest, working in a creative space, in an effort to create and entertain, or simply to make art for others to view, consider, and consume is something we, as a society, easily take for granted.In full disclosure, I acknowledge that the first draft of this Madame Web review was full of vitriol. I rarely have been so lost, frustrated, and eventually left with slack-jawed disbelief when watching a major studio’s film. In all ways, this is a bad movie. In some ways, so bad you can have fun with it. And perhaps, this will attain some Showgirls-like level of infamy in the months and years to come. I dunno. I think Madame Web is more likely going to become a punchline to a joke about how you botch a superhero movie. “I hope they don’t Madame Web this one!” or “It’s like when you sit down to watch [movie] and you get Madame Web instead!” Something like that.Anyway, Madame Web is a movie clearly ripped out of the hands of director S.J. Clarkson, who, after directing 22 years of television episodes and series, is making her cinematic debut. I have to believe (I want to believe) that editor Leigh Folsom Boyd would attest, if put on a witness stand, that a different cut of Madame Web existed under her watchful eyes. A talented editor, with a resume that includes the last two Tom Holland-led Spider-Man films, Folsom Boyd could not have turned in this cut. I imagine someone in the sound department sat aghast realizing that nearly all of actor Tahar Rahim’s lines were badly, embarrassingly overdubbed in post-production, so much so that we see shots of him simply not talking, his mouth not synced with the words he’s saying, or random shots of him from behind or the side where we can’t see his mouth while talking. Plus, he sounds like he’s in a booth reading lines into a microphone. This sound mix, and blame whoever signed off on it, is one of the worst in recent memory. I want to believe Madame Web is not the work of these talented creators. Because if Sony Pictures’ brass didn’t wrestle control of this film away from people, and this is what was turned in - I find myself going back to writing the kind of review I truly want to avoid. As presented though, Madame Web is an abomination. It makes no sense. The film has no tone. The gaffes are mighty, the performers either miscast, checked out, or acting in a completely different film. There are at least a couple of instances where lines are repeated, which, as has been surmised online, may be an actor giving two line readings and then instead of picking the correct one, both were left in. I mean, I could go on and on.Basically, this is an origin story introducing Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson). Cassie, as she is known, was born in a remote Peruvian jungle in 1973, when her mother, an anthropologist, gave birth to her in distress after being betrayed and shot by colleague Ezekiel Sims (Rahim in appearance, voice still TBD). Ezekiel steals a spider, long sought after among those who seek such things, and by the year 2003, he has nefarious goals, Spider-Man like abilities and the vision to see into the future.Ezekiel also has not aged a day it seems in 30 years, but we move on.Cassie meanwhile is a paramedic. Her best friend and work partner is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), not quite an uncle as his sister Mary (Emma Roberts) is close to having her first child. We learn she is having a boy, whose name is obscured by popping balloons and a sudden callout to an emergency. Peter. The boy’s name is Peter, in case anyone is wondering.  Let’s start by acknowledging that making movies is hard. Really hard.

We learn she is having a boy, whose name is obscured by popping balloons and a sudden callout to an emergency.  After a near-fatal accident, Cassie sees clairvoyant abilities awaken within her and she starts having brief glimpses of a future where bad things happen to seemingly random people. This naturally collides with Ezekiel, who himself is having visions of three teenage girls, wearing Spidery outfits, who will eventually kill him. He decides to kill them first. Cassie starts seeing how he will do this. And then, fates align and she becomes a reluctant protector to the three girls, who she has randomly encountered at work, at a hospital, and in her apartment building.The teenage girls - Anya, an immigrant worried about deportation (Isabela Merced), Julia, a rule following high schooler (Sidney Sweeney), and Mattie, a skateboarder (Celeste O’Connor) - are full of sass, questions, and confusion. By the time they come together in a stolen taxi, driven by Cassie, we too, ironically, are full of sass, questions, and confusion.Beyond this set up, Madame Web slings webs of empty fortune. No one seems to be engaged, no one seems to care. The non-ADR line readings in the film feel as if they are being read off of a page at a first-view table read. There is no passion, no enthusiasm for a story and script credited to five individuals, of which two of them - Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - have never surpassed 25% on the Tomatometer for any of their four previous films.Perhaps my favorite character is that of Amaria (Zosia Mamet). Amaria sits at a makeshift set of monitors with access to every “camera in the city” to try and track down where Anya, Julia and Mattie happen to be. She never has a scene where she is not seated in front of the computers and softly pushes Ezekiel into discussing his diabolical plans while she furrows her brow once she realizes she is being paid to help target teenage girls her boss hopes to murder. Nevertheless she persisted.If the massive, blatant product placement doesn’t get you, the rushed, harried visual effects will bring frustration. The incomprehensible story notwithstanding, it is strange that a movie with so many nods and winks to the Sony/Marvel Spider-Man movies never outright connects those dots. However, on the list of issues with Madame Web, that is admittedly way down the list.Here’s hoping the stain of this washes away soon for all involved. But in a world where Morbius exists (written by Sazama and Sharpless, no less!) and the Miles Teller-led Fantastic Four made it to the big screen all those years ago, Madame Web may ultimately represent the nadir of the Sony/Marvel superhero partnership. A movie so bad, it makes you wonder if Sony has such little regard for its audience that they assume anything with a Marvel connection will draw money. Let this be the bottom. Let everyone pause for a minute and think about what they have done. And let’s hope everyone can see into the future and recognize just how embarrassing a movie this truly is. In those reflections, may the blame also fall to the appropriate people. Because…let’s remember friends…moviemaking is really hard work.  After a near-fatal accident, Cassie sees clairvoyant abilities awaken within her and she starts having brief glimpses of a future where bad things happen to seemingly random people. This naturally collides with Ezekiel, who himself is having visions of three teenage girls, wearing Spidery outfits, who will eventually kill him. He decides to kill them first.

The teenage girls - Anya, an immigrant worried about deportation (Isabela Merced), Julia, a rule following high schooler (Sidney Sweeney), and Mattie, a skateboarder (Celeste O’Connor) - are full of sass, questions, and confusion. By the time they come together in a stolen taxi, driven by Cassie, we too, ironically, are full of sass, questions, and confusion. Beyond this set up, Madame Web slings webs of empty fortune. No one seems to be engaged, no one seems to care. The non-ADR line readings in the film feel as if they are being read off of a page at a first-view table read. There is no passion, no enthusiasm for a story and script credited to five individuals, of which two of them - Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - have never surpassed 25% on the Tomatometer for any of their four previous films. Perhaps my favorite character is that of Amaria (Zosia Mamet). Amaria sits at a makeshift set of monitors with access to every “camera in the city” to try and track down where Anya, Julia and Mattie happen to be. She never has a scene where she is not seated in front of the computers and softly pushes Ezekiel into discussing his diabolical plans while she furrows her brow once she realizes she is being paid to help target teenage girls her boss hopes to murder.  If the massive, blatant product placement doesn’t get you, the rushed, harried visual effects will bring frustration. The incomprehensible story notwithstanding, it is strange that a movie with so many nods and winks to the Sony/Marvel Spider-Man movies never outright connects those dots.  Here’s hoping the stain of this washes away soon for all involved. But in a world where Morbius exists (written by Sazama and Sharpless, no less!) and the Miles Teller-led Fantastic Four made it to the big screen all those years ago, Madame Web may ultimately represent the nadir of the Sony/Marvel superhero partnership. A movie so bad, it makes you wonder if Sony has such little regard for its audience that they assume anything with a Marvel connection will draw money.  Let this be the bottom. Let everyone pause for a minute and think about what they have done. And let’s hope everyone can see into the future and recognize just how embarrassing a movie this truly is. In those reflections, may the blame also fall to the appropriate people. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024"," The build up to the latest Spider-man spin-off hasn’t filled movie fans with excitement, if they’re even aware of it at all. The posters for Madame Web give little away other than the faces of the impressive cast, while star Dakota Johnson gave a dubious description of the film while hosting Saturday Night Live: “Kind of like if A.I. generated your boyfriend’s perfect movie.” That may have been a joke, but given Hollywood has suffered a couple of high-profile box-office bombs already in 2024, producers may be hoping not to be the next punchline. To put it very basically, Sony Pictures own the Spider-man movie rights, but not Disney’s main Marvel Cinematic Universe. Both studios share the character for main MCU films, but Sony also have their own spin-off movies like Venom, Morbius, and now Madame Web. Johnson stars as Cassie, a paramedic who develops clairvoyant abilities. Through these new powers, the socially awkward Cassie must save three teenage girls from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a hunter with a connection to her past.  Another year, another pointless superhero entry. Yes, there have been some hits after 2019’s high point, Avengers: Endgame, both in the main MCU timeline and Sony’s Spider Verse. However, Madame Web is another example of the barrel being scraped in the hopes that audiences will buy into anything with superpowers. The script is painful at times, preferring bland exposition instead of trusting audiences to understand what’s going on.  There is a glimmer of hope in Cassie’s characterisation as a recluse who views her powers as a nuisance, but that quickly fades once she inevitably has to take the plot seriously (well, someone should!). On the whole, it’s an empty cat-and-mouse thriller that might have had something to say had it been released twenty years ago (when the film is set), but now feels like an awkward apology for a franchise starter.  Johnson’s sardonic demeanour may work for some, but it’s clear the Fifty Shades actor would much rather be somewhere else. Equally Rahim, best known for award winners A Prophet and The Mauritanian, is turning up for the blockbuster pay day in a forgettable bad guy role. The three teens – Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, and Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney – all fight against bland material that’s happy to put them in teen pigeonholes.  Perhaps the film’s greatest sin is the lack of connection between the female leads. Basing a superhero movie around sisterhood or found family would have been a fresh way to approach this kind of film, something that the MCU almost achieved with The Marvels. Instead, these women are bunched together for arbitrary reasons that never get built on.  Madame Web feels like the depressing nadir act of corporate movie franchises,  thrashing around for nearly two hours looking for a reason to exist. Bereft of ideas and invention, it’s a prime example of the laziness that has seen superhero movies descend into their seemingly terminal downward spiral. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024", Eight reviews this week from Erik Childress and Steve Prokopy run the gamut from good documentaries to surprisingly-not-so-bad to shockingly awful. Where do all of these films fit in? How do you feel about an action film from the director of Underwater with this name (Land of Bad) or the rookie secret service agent trying to save the President with this one (Air Force One Down)? Ewan McGregor takes a road trip with his addicted daughter (Bleeding Love) and Lily Sullivan stumbles upon an alien conspiracy (Monolith). Those documentaries include a scary one about Christian Nationalism (God & Country) and a more inspiring one about the history of black astronauts (The Space Race). Finally in theaters this weekend comes another musical biopic (Bob Marley: One Love) and another Sony Spider-Man adjacent comic book tale (Madame Web) that have their own set of problems.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 19, 2024"," Decades into the comic-book-movie experience, filmmakers are still experimenting with the form. Madame Web, the latest in Sony’s vaguely intertwined series of films connected to the wider world of Spider-Man, is about a woman named Cassie Webb (played by Dakota Johnson) who discovers that she has clairvoyant powers. More noticeably, it’s about an ostensible superhero who approaches perilous danger and supervillain skirmishes with the laconic, standoffish energy one might associate with the ingenue of a Luca Guadagnino movie, not the umpteenth Marvel joint. It’s certainly different to give the superhero-going audience a protagonist who seems uninterested in, and indeed actively exhausted by, the idea of doing good. But that kind of radical passivity can only go so far. Madame Web is allegedly here to offer spills and thrills, while weaving together new strands of a cinematic universe that includes other somewhat deranged Spidey movies such as Venom and Morbius—a misshapen side series sprouting out of the success of the broader Marvel movies. Instead, it gives us Johnson reading dialogue about studying spiders in the Amazon with a tone reeking of “contractual obligation.” As with the Venom films and Morbius, I could never quite decide whether Madame Web’s ineptitude sparked the kind of giggly enjoyment one derives from watching a camp classic. Was the surreal lack of energy from all the actors a wry choice, or was I just watching the sleepiest superhero movie ever made? Supporting actors such as Sydney Sweeney and the delightful Adam Scott normally have a lot of charm, but here they favor drawling, understated line deliveries. As such, it’s hard to ever feel the stakes being raised, even as Cassie (who begins the film as a humble paramedic) starts to explore her dizzying powers of prediction. What does this have to do with Spider-Man, or webs in general? Not too much. Even to a comic-book reader such as myself, Madame Web is something of an obscure character, a sort of human-arachnid seer who pops in and out of the action from time to time. In this film, inexplicably set in 2003, she’s just another 30-something bumming around New York, living alone with a cat. Cassie is an orphan, born to a spider researcher in the Amazon who died in childbirth, but her only superpowers are her killer bangs, red leather jacket, and disarmingly awkward personal style. That is, until she has a near-death encounter while rescuing someone on the job, giving her bizarre visions of her immediate future. This steers her toward three young women—Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who all seem destined to become future heroes, but only if they manage to avoid a creepy, superstrong clairvoyant named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). But what will make them heroes, or why Ezekiel is plagued with visions of them attacking him, is left rather vague. Watching the film doesn’t bring a lot of further clarity. Setting the movie in the past seems to be a choice geared around the hypothetical potential of this cinematic universe—like Madame Web is getting a glimpse into intellectual property yet to come. In her present, though, the action is almost embarrassingly low-key. Cassie is not a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and she’s honestly a mediocre ambulance driver; most of the movie consists of her rushing her teenage charges away from danger. As a villain, Ezekiel is not particularly weighty; Rahim growls every bit of expository dialogue he can, but his motivations are hard to grasp beyond a fear of whatever future heroines these girls will become. For most of the movie, he’s not even really aware of Cassie or her powers. I almost admire the sheer lack of effort on display in the acting, storytelling, and set pieces. To say that Johnson in particular phoned this performance in would be an insult to Alexander Graham Bell. It doesn’t help that every other performance has a strange, stilted energy; even when everyone’s in the same room together, too many line readings feel like they’re being delivered with a Zoom delay. And to be pedantic for a moment, plenty of contemporary Spider-Man movies and spin-offs have been released in the years since 2003, when this film is set, and none mentions the good Madame or her coterie of female sidekicks. So how can the filmmakers pretend that all of this adds up to something audiences might care about? If it wasn’t already clear that superheroic cinematic universes are no longer an exciting idea, Johnson’s involvement feels like a half-hearted wave goodbye.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024"," Superhero fans are a hypercritical bunch, especially when it comes to movie trailers. They dissect every frame and the trailer of Sony’s Spider-Man spin-off, Madame Web, didn’t impress them. Judged to be clunky with too much exposition and risible dialogue, it brought out the meme-writers at their most scornful. The hope was that the film would carry on the winning streak established by Wonder Woman in 2017, when it defied the odds by proving that a superhero movie with a female lead could be a box-office hit. Captain Marvel confirmed the good news by grossing more than a billion US dollars worldwide. And Black Widow did pretty well, too. Then last year, there was a resounding hiccup when Warner Brothers shelved DC’s Batgirl without even releasing it to a streaming service. So there’s a lot riding on this one. In Marvel’s comic books, Madame Web is anything but an action hero. A striking figure of mature years, she’s blind and tethered to a life support system, a throne-like chair at the centre of what looks like a giant spider’s web. Her power lies only in her ability to forecast the future. Not surprisingly, she’s had a radical makeover here. Played by Dakota Johnson, Cassie Webb is in her thirties and has all her faculties, although she hasn’t yet become clairvoyant. She’s a paramedic in New York City when her life takes an irrevocable turn to the supernatural with her discovery she’s now psychic. The rest of the narrative is a barely comprehensible mash-up of Spider-Man themes involving the venom of an Amazonian spider that has potent but unreliable properties. A spider bite is indirectly responsible for Cassie’s clairvoyance, but the movie’s villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), another supporting character from the comics, has acquired extra benefits from his entomological connections. He can crawl across ceilings and generally carry on like Spider-Man’s evil uncle. And his main mission is to murder three women who are fated to kill him in 10 years’ time. At present, however, they’re air-headed adolescents and Cassie finds, to her disgust, only she is capable of protecting them. So it’s a story about bumbling into greatness and, it has to be said, the bumbling bits are mildly funny. Director SJ Clarkson has helmed episodes of Succession, which makes sense. At their most entitled, the three teens give off faint echoes of the Roy offspring. But as soon as they’re revealed to be just a group of misunderstood kids with neglectful parents, the cliches multiply at a dispiriting rate. Things also take a turn to the portentous, which does not sit well with the shamelessly ludicrous nature of the plot. The fact that the writers of Sony’s 2022 flop Morbius had a hand in this storyline didn’t augur well. And so it’s turned out. The film plays like another desperate attempt to keep the franchise flag flying.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 19, 2024"," I’m not sure where to start.
By now, you’ve likely heard about Sony’s newest Spider-Verse entry, Madame Web. You’ve probably heard critics from early screenings talk about how bad it is. Watched TikToks about how it’s the worst movie ever made. Seen a Rotten Tomatoes score that looks more like your car’s interest rate than a film rating. Maybe you’ve even heard jokes about how it makes Morbius look like The Godfather. Yet what many of these reviews, commentaries, and videos fail to really understand about Madame Web is just how much work has been put into this project. How much energy and time, and effort it takes to create a film that fails on so many levels. Because make no mistake: Madame Web is terrible. It’s a burning dumpster that’s been dropped from an AC-130 into an inactive volcano filled with moldy fish. It’s not just bad — it’s amazingly bad. It’s the kind of bad that’s so all-encompassing that it can’t possibly be an accident — it’s either the product of conscious decision-making or it’s a cosmic joke where the punchline is a shovel to the head. Things that failed:
The acting. The acting is the kind of miserable, lethargic exercise in dullness that you haven’t seen since The Phantom Menace. It’s the kind of acting — and this goes for everyone — where you wonder if after every take, director SJ Clarkson (Toast, a Game of Thrones prequel that died in the womb)) would say, “CUT! OK, let’s try it again, but with less effort.” The dialogue. The dialogue — well, the script in general — is so rote and cliché-ridden that it actually feels like parody. Every actor is wasted on the absolutely wretched lines they’re forced to deliver. And there are great actors here! Sydney Sweeney has a good bit of talent! Isabella Merced, too! Damn it, Adam Scott is here! Playing … I shit you not … Ben Parker. Yes, that Ben Parker. Does he say the famous line? No, he does not. That line is instead delivered by a Peruvian tribesman who lives in a tree. I did not make that up. Finally (well, not finally, but I’m running out of energy)… the gratuitous product placement. It’s astonishing. It’s almost admirable in its naked blatancy. Every can of Pepsi practically glows. Every bottle of Budweiser glistens with dew. Put it this way — the product placement is so overt and shameless that the villain is killed by a Pepsi sign. I did not make that up either. Nothing. Nothing worked. This movie is a detestable altar of sacrifice to the gods of ignorance and greed, a worthless strip of celluloid that should be buried under a landfill. It’s a thing that should not be. I am less for having seen it. Save yourselves.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024"," Madame Web is an $80m (£63m) film with the quality of an unlicensed superhero painted on the side of a carnival ride. It’s desperate and seems embarrassed of itself, the pained shrug of a creative team ordered by Sony executives to keep the wheels turning in their Spider-Man-adjacent universe, all while the actual Spider-Man is out on loan to Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it’s never clarified, Madame Web is presumably meant to exist in the world of Morbius and Venom – where it’s heavily implied a Spider-Man exists, possibly Tom Holland’s, but everyone is legally barred from mentioning it. The film is set in 2003. There is an Uncle Ben (Adam Scott), whose sister (Emma Roberts) is about to give birth to a boy, whose name she knows but physically cannot utter, as if cursed by an ancient witch. Ben is co-workers with a paramedic named Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), whose mother was shot dead in the Amazon while pregnant with her. There’s the line, “When you take on the responsibility, great power will come” – a garbled take on Spider-Man’s famous catchphrase, made now to sound like a translation app gone awry. The film’s script was partially co-written by Morbius’s Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who hit copy and paste on their superhero colonising their powers from the jungles of the Americas. Cassie’s mother was on the trail of a rare Peruvian spider whose venom can “supercharge their cellular structure”. Her security guard Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) shoots her dead and steals it to harness its powers, leading him to nightly visions of his future demise at the hands of three Spider-Women – later a trio of unsupervised teenagers, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who he’s determined to track down and kill. After a near-death experience, Cassie starts to experience premonitions that eventually land her as the disgruntled caretaker of the girls. In the comic books, Madame Web is an elderly woman and clairvoyant aid to Spider-Man. The film has absolutely no idea what to do, visually, with that kind of power set, so Cassie can either yell at people to move out of the way or hit them with a car. She spends the film switching between both options. The film is obstinate in its internal logic. Cassie’s first port of call after witnessing the future is to visit her optometrist. When she rescues these teen girls, she promptly dumps them in the middle of the woods and drives off, all because she wants to double-check something back at her apartment. Madame Web makes time for Cassie to conduct a CPR demonstration for her new wards, but doesn’t bother to explain how Ezekiel got his hands on an evil Spider-Man suit more than a decade before Spider-Man existed. The infamous bit of dialogue from the trailer that promptly went viral – “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died” – doesn’t actually feature in the finished product. But there’s plenty of opportunity for Johnson, who delivers every line like she’s trying to catch Ellen DeGeneres in a lie, to say equally bizarre things. “I hope the spiders were worth it, mom,” she says at one point. “Obviously it was bad... she died,” she sighs during another. Director SJ Clarkson, who makes her transition here from television, has a tendency to zoom in dramatically on actors’ faces during dialogue scenes. It’s a trick usually deployed in reality TV to spice up banal conversations. But Madame Web is fiction and has seemingly passed on the opportunity to make itself exciting – instead offering a two-hour prelude to a 30-second trailer for a sequel that will never happen. Ah, well. On to the next Sony project, August’s heavily delayed Aaron Taylor-Johnson vehicle Kraven the Hunter. Let’s see if that one can make a lick of sense.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024"," MADAME WEB. With Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabella Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahir Rahim. Screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and S.J. Clarkson. Directed by S.J. Clarkson. Rated PG-13 for violence/action and language. 117 minutes. In theaters. Dakota Johnson is a wonderful actress who appears incapable of feigning enthusiasm. As most of the job of a professional movie star involves answering the same stupid questions over and over while pretending to be excited about idiotic shit, her listless, vaguely dismissive junket interviews can feel like a blessed respite from the phony Hollywood hype train. Johnson brings that same energy (or lack thereof) to MADAME WEB, another calamitous comic book movie appearing at what finally feels like the sputtered-out end of the genre’s cultural domination. Like “Venom” and “Morbius” before it and “Kraven The Hunter” coming later this year, it’s one of Sony’s Marvel-adjacent projects. My understanding is that the studio retains the rights to make live-action films featuring characters from the “Spider-Man” comics but not Spidey himself, which is why we’re seeing entire movies devoted to third-tier villains. This is the kind of idea only an executive could love, flooding the market with bootleg knockoffs of a product people were already getting pretty sick of. Everyone in “Madame Web” looks like they’re in crummy mood. The movie unfurls with all the verve of a contractual obligation, while Johnson works her trademark “I’d rather be anywhere else” vibe like we haven’t seen since she went viral for making Ellen miserable. There’s almost a level of performance art to her portrayal of New York paramedic Cassandra Webb, who after a near-death experience begins to manifest psychic powers reminiscent of that old “SNL” sketch spoofing “The Dead Zone” in which Christopher Walken could only see a minute or two into the future. Johnson was the only person involved in the “Fifty Shades” movies who played them as comedies about a woman learning to put up with a rich weirdo boyfriend who gets her off, and she seems to be undermining “Madame Web” in an even more cheerfully destructive manner. Every time Cassandra (see what they did there?) is handed a soda as part of the movie’s obnoxiously omnipresent product placement, Johnson awkwardly rubs and fiddles with the can like she’s never held one before in her life, appearing either unwilling or unable to simply open and drink from it on camera. Its such a bizarre, insanely distracting bit of business – she even inexplicably carries an unopened Pepsi from one scene into the next like she’s cradling a kitten – one can only assume the actress must be amusing herself at the expense of the film. At least somebody’s having fun. For reasons too inane to recount here, she winds up the clairvoyant protector and den mother to three teenage girls (Isabella Merced, Celeste O’Connor, and cartoonishly voluptuous It Girl of the moment Sydney Sweeney) who are being hunted by a freakish billionaire with wall-crawling superpowers and a black Spider-man costume, even though Spider-Man hasn’t been born yet. (More on that in a minute.) This villain is played by Tahir Rahim, the marvelous actor from Jacques Audiard’s “A Prophet” and Hulu’s “The Looming Tower” miniseries, who for some reason has had about 80% of his dialogue poorly re-dubbed and played over shots of the back of his head, as if they’d hastily tried to rewrite the film in the editing room. I’ve seen reality shows with more convincing ADR. Sweeney’s surprise sleeper hit from this past Christmas, “Anyone But You” is still playing down the multiplex hall, a testament to how much shoddy filmmaking audiences – myself included – are willing to overlook for the simple pleasures of watching attractive, charismatic stars fall for one another in exotic locations. (I hope Hollywood takes heed of the “Much Ado About Nothing” riff’s continued success and greenlights more Shakespeare adaptations starring girls with giant gazongas.) Sweeney isn’t given much to do in “Madame Web” besides bicker with the other two teenagers. They all have the same bratty personality and once in awhile non-committedly throw food at each other. While we’re teased with flash-forwards of all three growing up to be the various incarnations of Spider-Woman, this is one of those wannabe franchise movies that’s a prequel to itself, so none of that actually happens in this installment. They don’t even get to wear the cool costumes from the comics. Instead, Sweeney spends the movie in a Catholic schoolgirl outfit, and cinematographer Mario Fiore’s inability to get a single flattering angle of her in it suggests he might be better suited for a job selling pencils. Johnson’s dorky ambulance partner is played by Adam Scott. He doesn’t really have anything to do with the story, but his name is Ben Parker and his sister is about to have a baby. You can probably guess what the kid’s gonna be named, but every time they try to tell you the movie cuts away, presumably for legal reasons. I guess it’s for the sake of this continuity quirk that “Madame Web” makes such a big deal out of being set in 2003, lingering on a massive billboard for Beyonce’s “Dangerously In Love” album and a radio DJ introducing Britney Spears’ “Toxic” as “a new track that’s about to burn up the charts!” Yet at the same time, the rest of the music cues are all early 1990’s hits by the likes of 4 Non Blondes and The Cranberries. I found this almost as perplexing as the soda can stuff. Despite taking place in New York City, “Madame Web” was filmed in Boston during the summer of 2022, which explains why “Queens” looks so much like Downtown Crossing, and why Spider-Man’s uncle lives around the corner from the South Street Diner. You may remember that Sweeney threw out the first pitch on the night that the Red Sox lost 28-5 to the Toronto Blue Jays. (After seeing her on Instagram housing a Fenway Frank, I can understand why our boys in the bullpen might have been a little distracted.)

"Feb 18, 2024"," For the past couple of years, Sony Pictures has tried to build its comic-book series of films with their Spider-Man Universe. They want to compete against the other companies, as well as complement what is being built in the MCU, potentially connecting the two worlds into one giant amalgamation of blockbuster success. The Sony Spider-Man Universe (abbreviated as the SSU) is meant to expand the sandbox of the friendly neighborhood superhero from Queens by creating pictures about some of the supporting characters in the comics, most of which center around villains. Hence, the arrival of “Venom” (and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”) and “Morbius” into our local cinema. It has to be said that these projects have been bankable for what they are worth.  While critically panned, audiences have managed to go out of their way to see these pictures. No matter the disdain from the critics, money tells the whole story. Fans of the source material, or the superhero film craze, have made their impact on ticket sales. Because of such, plans for future side-character action flicks are in play. (“Kraven the Hunter,” which releases later this year, and “Venom 3” coming next.) These films are in such a flux that it is hard to pinpoint exactly where they are headed in the grand scheme. Is there going to be a connective tissue to these films? An “Avengers: Endgame”-like picture that ties them? So far, there’s no hint in sight. They are working as separate pictures that mention the Spider-people only by name, without an appearance. The webbing is quite messy. The latest one to arrive is “Madame Web,” helmed by television director S.J. Clarkson. She’s known for her work in Marvel’s “The Defenders,” “Jessica Jones,” and “Anatomy of a Scandal.” She has already had some experience in this world of superheroes via the aforementioned Netflix shows. Clarkson only directed two episodes in each one of those series. But that counts as background and experience to work with. However, with how the screenplay has been toyed with and manipulated, I believe nobody was ever going to make “Madame Web” function as a proper film to begin with.  With a disorganized premise and no vision in sight, the latest installment in the SSU once again falls flat. This time without an entertainment factor (or social media gag) to tie it with. From the get-go, there are a few issues. There’s a change to the Madame Web character in this film. Instead of having Cassandra Web be a blind, paralyzed old woman hooked to a web-looking support system like in the comics, she is a young paramedic named Cassie, whose psychic powers emerged during a work-related accident. The change comes with the casting of Dakota Johnson in the titular role. She’s a talented actress who has worked with many fantastic filmmakers, from Luca Guadagnino (with whom she has had her best work) to Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Looking at it from another side, no matter what version of the character she played, Johnson couldn’t nail the nature of it all. She didn’t fit in that elevated superhero realm. And that is for the better, as she could do better in more exciting and rich projects than this one. Nevertheless, the film begins with an expedition in the Peruvian Amazon. We see a pregnant arachnologist (Kerry Bishé) and her travel partner (Tahar Rahim) searching for a rare spider whose venom is rumored to cure all diseases. Everything seems to be going as planned until they find the spider. The expected act occurs and gives us the first impression of how plodding the rest of the film will be.  A bite and a betrayal come into play, which leaves the baby an orphan with powers she will handle in the future. The concept of Cassie’s powers is intriguing on paper, somewhat leaning towards a “Terminator”-like territory. The idea of having a person see and change the future as she pleases is not original per se. Yet, the introduction, at least the basics, has some potential. You can turn that into a worthwhile narrative. Now, the problems arise when discussing the concept’s execution. This whole idea is an inexplicable mess that neither the writing team nor the characters can adequately explain. The film then fast forwards to 2003, where we see Cassie work as an EMT.  During one of her shifts, she has an accident that almost costs Cassie her life. In that near-death experience, she awakens her psychic abilities of seeing (and manipulating the future). One of her visions included her coming across three teenage girls—Julia (Sydney Sweeny), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor)—who are in great danger. Ezekiel is on the hunt, searching for the girls. He’s a man cursed by his given gifts and now seeks a way to balance things out. Worried for their safety, Cassie groups the three girls. And tries to find a way to stop the man who wants to kill them. A chase film emerges from this premise. But the necessary tension, thrills, or wit to give the viewer a fun time.  Immediately after this set-up for the main plot point, “Madame Web” goes on a trajectory of plodding repetition, where we have scenes of Cassie experiencing visions and Ezekiel talking to himself about wanting to find the girls before it is too late. These constant exposition dumps intertwined with the running-and-gunning make this film a very frustrating experience to endure. There seems to be a lack of vision in the action set pieces and the narrative itself. One might ask if the team put some thought into these sequences. They feel like copies of what came before but rendered to their most unimaginative states.  “Madame Web” treads the same waters as the pre-MCU comic-book movies of the early 2000s, in the likes of “Catwoman,” “Elektra,” and “Daredevil.” It fits into this schematic not only because of its setting and talented cast attached but also because of its sloppy and messy nature. At the center of this story is an interesting, simple story that a filmmaker can play with. Multiple writers were in charge of writing this story. And you immediately get the sensation that what we see on-screen is a simplification of an amalgamation of more than a dozen ideas. There have been many bad comic-book movie releases recently. The difference between a film like “Thor: Love and Thunder” and “The Flash” and this one is that although they are poorly constructed, you can understand the concept. In “Madame Web,” you can’t even grasp it.  Hector Gonzalez is a Puerto Rican, Tomatometer-Approved film critic and the Co-founder of the PRCA, as well as a member of OFTA and PIFC.

Fans and critics alike seemed finally to be on the same page, calling the film ""hilariously bad"", ""one of the worst pictures ever"", and, most damningly, ""worse than Moebius"".",NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2024"," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) was an idiosyncrasy long before Madame Web was conceived. 2018’s Venom revealed that star and executive producer Tom Hardy is a bizarre man in the best way possible. Venom: Let There Be Carnage upped the slapstick, puerile tone, and Morbius was a film allegedly best left unviewed (I did). The universe is doomed not to feature Spider-Man (those Disney MCU contracts are mysterious beasts), and their unusual efforts to differentiate themselves from the superhero pack have left them out of touch with popular and critical taste. The worst Madame Web could do was poke a few more holes in the sinking ship, and it’s such an odd swing that it fails to land even that. To be clear: the value of Madame Web and all the SSU is entirely divorced from quality in my book. As a longtime apologist of Fox’s X-Men series, I appreciate anyone working against the notion that superhero movies are bound to the MCU formula, or even a genre, for that matter. The X-Men movies were a mess, and I loved them for their highs and lows. The SSU has been all lows so far, but they’re throwing away narrow notions of superhero movies, too, which earns them a soft spot in my heart. The Venom movies are easier to forgive. They’re charmingly bad, anchored by a committed performance from Hardy that deserves the same beloved status Hugh Jackman earned in his decades as Wolverine.  How did they mess this up? First off, they made it an origin story. Boring, we’re over it, just have a scene where the new superhero’s powers are explained and get to the good stuff. We don’t need Dakota Johnson’s Cassandra Webb running around as a disgruntled paramedic, rejecting thank yous from kids and complaining about New York City traffic. An accident on the job awakens her ability to see into the future, which tips her off that three teenage girls are going to be murdered by a leeringly evil man with spider-like abilities (Tahar Rahim), and her intervention leads to the movie-long discovery of her powers. Only by the end is she truly Madame Web, and boy is it a slog to spend that much time on a plot everyone knows like the back of their hand. The good news is that there’s fun to be had along the way (mostly unintentionally). The script is a mess of blunt exposition that leads to some hysterically undeliverable lines, which is somehow topped by every single word out of Rahim’s mouth feeling like it was delivered in a sound booth far away from the set and entirely divorced from the tone of the scene. But what really exemplifies this film’s self-inflicted tomfoolery is a cat. Cassandra is a stubborn loner, you see, which must have made the writers think of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. So they give her a stray cat she calls Cat, as a fun reference. They mercifully resisted casting an orange boy to play the stray (you can’t outdo Orangey, the legendary cat actor featured in Breakfast at Tiffany’s). Instead, they cast an unmistakable rotund chonker to waltz onscreen and lap up some milk. Two things here. One, why would you cast an overweight cat as your stray? There’s no good answer to this one. Two, many adult cats are lactose intolerant, and even if the kitty can keep it down, cow’s milk doesn’t provide the nutrition they need. Cassandra may as well have given the cat a bowl of the film’s ubiquitous product placement, Pepsi, for all the good she was doing it. Or maybe the film is implying that she doesn’t care about the cat at all and is purposefully inducing diarrhea or bulking up an already big boy? Don’t worry, the movie isn’t that smart. They just made a minor plot point make no sense, a small thing amid major plot points that make no sense.  The other inexplicable, self-inflicted wound is the casting of Dakota Johnson. Her low-key, borderline petulant presence makes absolutely no sense as a burgeoning hero, and whether this incongruity is a positive or negative will entirely come down to personal taste. For me, she operated as a salve that nearly healed the whole thing. She never feels like she wants to be in the movie, and the most verve she brings is when she’s seemingly playing with the material, talking down to the very movie she’s leading. Johnson has long been making promotional work performance art (remember her takedown of Ellen DeGeneres?), and with Madame Web, she’s seemingly targeted this playful disdain for industry requirements on the ubiquity of superhero movies. Or maybe that’s just wishful thinking on my part, and she just delivered a terrible performance. Either way, the performance is hilariously off-kilter, as jarring and strange as all of Michelle Williams’ work in the Venom movies, hence, making it of a piece with the rest of the SSU. The SSU just happens to be awful, so bad some raise up the films as fun-bad. I’m not quite there on Madame Web, but I bet there’s a slightly worse cut of the film that could nudge me over the edge.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 17, 2024"," Sony’s fourth Spider-Man spinoff “Madame Web” was doomed from the beginning. Made in conjunction with Marvel, the superhero film features a passionless Dakota Johnson in her worst performance since the “Fifty Shades of Grey” trilogy. The story written by director S.J. Clarkson and three cowriters including the team responsible for “Morbius,” “Gods of Egypt,” “The Last Witch Hunter,” and “Dracula Untold,” is filled with ridiculous dialogue, and we get a second-rate villain played by Tahir Rahim who mutters his badly dubbed lines. You don’t have to be a clairvoyant to catch the warning signs, just watch the trailer. Paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) saves lives when she’s not being saved by her coworker Ben Parker (Adam Scott). After he rescues her from a submerged vehicle, she awakens with superpowers including clairvoyance. Cassie sees snippets of the future which begin as weird moments of déjà vu. When she begins to realize what’s happening (in “Groundhog Day” do-over style) her second sight puts her in the path of three teenage girls about to be murdered. The teens played by Sydney Sweeny (“Euphoria”) as nerdy white girl Julia Cornwall, Celeste O’Connor (“Ghostbusters: Afterlife”) as skateboarder Mattie Franklin, and Isabela Merced as brainiac Anya Corazon, are seen in Cassie’s visions donning cool Spider-Girl suits while battling the story’s villain Ezekiel Sims (Rahim) who wears a black Spider-Man suit. Cassie saves the girls, who don’t know each other when they come together on the subway, the scene filled with lackluster CGI. The saying, “A hero is only as good as its villain” is a cliché, but there is truth to that line in “Madame Webb.” Rahim, a good French actor whose breakthrough performance came in 2009’s “A Prophet” is dreadful as the story’s barefoot, dapper-dressed antagonist Ezekiel who speaks in an annoying low gravel. Rahim is in competition with Johnson for the film’s worst performance. “Webb” takes place in 2003, as evidenced by Britney Spears’s “Toxic” which spurs the girls to table dance in a roadside diner while expressing their love for the new jam. This is just before Ezekiel shows up trying to kill them AGAIN, only to be saved by Cassie. The song “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes would have worked better in the scene and it falls in line with the timeframe. When Cassie discovers an old photograph dated 1973 of her late mother Constance (Kerry Bishé) with Ezekiel in the Amazon jungle, she travels to the site where she encounters the leader of Las Arañas, a group of Spider-Men who travel across the treetops and we learn more of the Webb’s backstory complete with betrayal and a mythical spider. The film opens with the Amazon scene before jumping 30 years to NYC.  Apart from the bad and insensitive dialogue, Cassie asking her partner Ben (who can’t wait to be an uncle) if he wants to get shot in Queens has spurred an online backlash, the origin story’s biggest problem is that it’s 2-hours of setup followed by the credits. The film’s ending should have happened 45 minutes into the film leading to a fully realized Madame Webb mentoring the teens as they become Spider-Girls preparing to battle Ezekiel for the rest of the story. As is, we get glimpses of a much better film in Cassie’s visions showing the young women in great-looking costumes battling an older grey-haired Ezekiel. Pepsi’s product placement is so conspicuous that the film’s climax involves a fight scene on a giant neon billboard for the cola. “Madame Webb” follows Sony’s spider-verse spinoffs, “Venom,” and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” plus the Jared Leto vampire flick “Morbius,” all of which are better than this hot mess.  Adam Scott, Mike Epps, Zosia Mamet, and Emma Roberts as pregnant Mary Parker (cue the music) are wasted in the film, the silver lining is at least they are not subject to much of the horrible dialogue. I like Dakota Johnson; she’s given us many terrific performances including 2022’s “Cha Cha Real Smooth” but she is miscast as Cassie and for most of the film she delivers her lines with a lack of enthusiasm. I don’t blame her. The song “Bury a Friend” by Billie Eilish serves as a harbinger of bad films. It was featured in the trailers for “Madame Webb” and “Night Swim.” On the small screen, it has the opposite effect, as the foreboding track fits perfectly as the theme for HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country.” MAILING ADDRESS: 2003 8th Ave., #300, Fort Worth, TX 76110PHONE: 817.405.9318EMAIL: hello@fortworthreport.orgOur MissionWe pledge to produce high-quality objective local journalism that informs public decision-making, addresses the quality of life of our community’s citizens, holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers’ stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood.

"Feb 17, 2024"," Yikes! I’ve made a habit and a living from pulling the wings off the more pitiful creatures caught up in the Marvel and DC Universe, but arriving at Madame Web with Fortinbras timing some two days after its release, I find the carcass stripped clean by critics and audiences alike; this is a bad movie we can all agree on as the nadir moving forward. This is multiverse, meta-verse, cobblers-o-verse stuff from Sony, licencing the Spiderman universe from Marvel but somehow not having the rights to show the main character; ie a worthless property. I remember the speculation when all this potential with IP was initially being unlocked, they’d say; imagine a film about Miss Monneypenny! But who wants that? She sits at her desk and flirts with the male staff. That’s all she does; make her do anything else and she’s just not Miss Monneypenny anymore. There’s absolutely nothing in Madame Web’s universe to make it worth exploring for supposed fans of this genre. So set your self-serving gobbledygook threshold to overload and let’s get stuck in. Instead of the aged psychic grandma in the comics, this Madame Web is Cassandra Webb, a spunky NYC ambulance driver played by Dakota Johnson, the daughter of a woman who had her health restored by mysterious spider-men after giving birth in the jungle in Peru in 1973. Why a heavily pregnant woman in 1973 would be in a jungle investigating spider people might seem like an issue until you set eyes on Tahar Rahim, so good in A Prophet, now looking like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Manuel from Fawlty Towers and speaking the same kind of English-as-she-is-spoke, except the words never come out of his mouth. ‘You have no idea of the torment and torture of dying all over again…can you imagine how frustrating it’s been trying to identify someone you’ve only seen in a vision?’ Sigh. What’s gone so wrong for SJ Clarkson’s movie? So, it looks like they planned this movie as a religious nativity scene around the birth of Andrew Garfield’s Spider Man, then re-did it around Tom Holland’s incarnation of Peter Parker. There’s continual compelling visual evidence through sound and music that it’s 2003 and not 1993, for all the difference that makes. There’s time-specific adverts for Pepsi and Beyonce and characters discuss how Britney Spears’ Toxic has just come out. Webb’s co-ambulance driver is Adam Scott from Parks and Rec but he’s so old now he’s playing Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben so that Madame Web can help him with his mad rush to the hospital for the birth of Spiderman. Madame Web also goes to a baby shower for Ben’s sister Mary (Emma Roberts) and has prophetic visions of the future that may not come true. Meanwhile Ezekiel Sims (Rahim) has a vision of a gaggle of costumed and accessorised Marvels/Justice Society/Who cares? spider-girls killing him, and is tracking down the young women and kill them first. All you need to know is that Madame Web’s badly-edited deja-vu visions enable her to change the future, save the girls and kill the baddie. Madame Web wins out in annoying fashion because although she claims she can’t control her powers, she gives every scene a do-over when she doesn’t get what she wants and the audience have to watch the same action over and over again with different outcomes. Similarly, the film-makers seem to have had several do-overs at adjusting the time-period, characters and storyline here, with tell-tale dialogue not synchronised with the images. Sydney Sweeney is amongst those buried in the jumble; Johnson can’t do anything as a character who spends her recreational time staring at her own birth certificate in an effort to remind herself (and us) of who she is. Nor can Johnson do much with a scene in which Madame Web rescues the girls by stealing a taxi and driving it through the window of a restaurant, an act which fails to arouse any consequence in a fakey New York that looks like it was smooshed together from old photographs and adverts. ‘He can climb on walls, how is that even possible?’ the hipster spider-girl team ask about Ezekiel Sims, opening up another confusing question; I thought Peter Parker was trying to protect his own identify, rather than the existence of all super-heroes ever. Perhaps that’s why his birth takes on an almost Biblical reverence here, with Uncle Ben as Joseph? It’s hard to find the right words to close out this gibberish gumbo of remixed, re-hashed lore but somehow Madame Web provides it in the climax. ‘When you take on responsibility, great power will come.’ Sony had Madame Web written by the guys who wrote Morbius, they were so pleased with how hard that turd flushed; I wouldn’t trust them to empty my bins, and yet here we are. The verdict is in; file Madame Web along with Elektra and the most annoying, confusing, unwanted cash-grab spin-offs at the end of the comic book era. To be honest, all the bad press had me kind of interested. And the trailer actually looks kind of interesting. But still pretty sure I’ll pass. Out of curiosity, was there any dumb sinister six stuff here? No vulture? No morbius? Have they given up on the dream of a sinister six movie without the guy the sinister six are supposed to fight? No nothing. I’m sure there are better placed than me to get the easter eggs that are usually jammed into this; I was out the door before any post/mid credits malarkey, but apparently there’s none. It seems to be about establishing this all girl spiderman alternative team but they don’t seem to have names, character or even costimes; the way they appear in the trailer is somehow outside the scope of the film. No venom, no anything, I can’t even see what a fanboy would get from this. Maybe on your second watch, things will click into place. You comparing it to Elektra was all that was needed to sink this ship.
Even Psychic Grandma could have foretold that Sony would screw this up! Why couldn’t Sony have just made a Psychic Grandma movie, that’s what the fanboys want. Maybe not with her in it, but set in that universe? Oddly enough, that’s one of a blizzard of problems here. Madame Web has intimate do overs, so can’t lose as a superhero. Of course her ability to use her super powers comes and goes, just like how Spidey’s web fluid runs out at key moments when the narrative suits. It’s kiddie stuff. I’m both a big Marvel and Dakota Johnson fan. I found this awful. Just. Awful. There are a couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like Artificial Intelligence wrote it, which is not a compliment. The marketing folks were more than “devious” when it came to the trailer, but they had to do something to make it look watchable – don’t want to spoil anything for those who venture forth. Now to be sure, I don’t think it is the worst superhero movie ever made. I think the best way to sum it all up is it looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is actually set in, which also is not a compliment. Dakota is so much better suited to Cha Cha Real Smooth and Peanut Butter Falcon-type roles. A superheroine…nope. Felt like an Elektra period Marvel movie, compromised, ham fisted product. Johnson good in the films you mention, but has an impossible role to play here. That chat either the spider people was awful, and the stuff between Rahim and Zozie Mamet was absolute cringe. Did they change the time period after it was shot? I couldn’t work out exactly what had gone wrong, but something did. Pulling Kraven the Whatever he was from last year suggests it’s a turkey as well. You can’t tell from the trailer quite how off the rails this goes. Not good. So much manoeuvring. Yet I genuinely didn’t get who these girls were, or what this had to do with Peter Parker being born, or why there were no other superheroes apart from Ezekiel Sims, it was like reading the manual for a product you can’t use, written in a language you barely speak. They can have that quote for the poster. I’m blaming the distributors. Nothing else to see except this and Memory so as depressing a double bill as I can remember. Interesting to see the bullet Sydney Sweeney dodged. Actually, the three kids were impressive, thought the superhero costumes plain awful. Who in their right mind could have greenlit such nonsense? This is pretty much a prequel and Dakota Johnson just looks plain puzzled to be in it. The whole alternative future notion is quite clever but gets boring quickly. At least I saw them months apart, but they’re both bleak but in different ways. Being able to see a minute into the future is like a cheat code rather than a super-power; no chance of losing out while you’re resetting every time things go against you, so, like Spiderman’s fluid, her powers dry up whenever she really needs them. I think constant recutting has rendered this film as gibberish, I genuinely can’t imagine this getting green-lit on that script. It’s also worth noting that all the MCU and DC hate is directed towards female led films, indicating that male fan-boy angst is driving the collapse of these franchises. Interesting gender perspective.  Did they hammer Black Widow as well? It looked like they re-shot stuff to bring in that other element. It wasn’t much of a concept and giving a glimpse of what the teenagers could do was like a credit sequence. Just awful. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"Feb 17, 2024"," Madame Web, Sony’s latest entry in its ongoing Spider-Man universe, is a tangled mess. Not winkingly fun enough to be camp, it’s an embarrassment of dull action, sloppy plotting, and a protagonist who seems like she wishes she were anywhere else. Dakota Johnson (Persuasion) plays Cassie Webb, a New York City paramedic whose driving skills are her greatest skill before she becomes clairvoyant. Her second sight activates after she nearly dies on the job, granting her visions that first feel like déjà vu, then evolve into her seeing a mysterious man attacking three teenage girls. The seeds of Cassie’s power come from the Peruvian jungle, where her late mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), decades earlier searched for a spider that could cure various illnesses. Upon learning the amazing arachnid also grants people wall-crawling powers and super strength, a colleague, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim, Napoleon), double-crossed the pregnant Constance, shooting her and stealing the spider. Red-suited spider men laughably drop from the jungle canopy to help but only manage to save the baby, along with a suitcase full of convenient photos and journals. Flash-forward to 2003, where the adult Cassie has a work partner named Ben Parker (Adam Scott, Severance) who’s excited to be an uncle—the only Spidey-related tangent the film has. Meanwhile, Ezekiel has become wealthy but obsesses over a recurring vision where the teens kill him once they develop special powers and their own spider gear. “Every day that goes by, my appointment with death grows closer,” he says. That holds true for us all, although it’s not clear what Ezekiel does with his precious time beyond sit in a high-rise, drive a Corvette, and growl at Zosia Mamet (Molli and Max in the Future) as a tech-savvy underling. After fate places Cassie in the girls’ proximity, Cassie intervenes when Ezekiel, in a spider suit, crawls on subway ceilings and more without anyone noticing. New Yorkers are notoriously blasé, but come on. Set in Queens, New Jersey, and the Peruvian jungle by way of filming locations in Massachusetts and Canada, the film’s screwy geography is the least of its problems. Four credited screenwriters—Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and director S.J. Clarkson—barely develop the story or these characters. They don’t even bother to have Cassie do proper CPR, which is a key plot point. (She just does chest compressions, not the breaths the American Red Cross recommends.) Johnson has become known for her dry, deadpan delivery in interviews, but that demeanor here reads as if she’s tired and miserable. As the teens, Sydney Sweeney (Anyone But You), Isabela Merced (Migration), and Celeste O’Connor (A Good Person) bicker between table-dancing at a diner while they’re supposed to be lying low. The action, such as it is, often involves Cassie driving a stolen cab or ambulance. The film cares nothing for continuity or basic common sense, with her driving the same smashed-up cab before and after popping down to Peru. Clarkson (Anatomy of a Scandal) films Cassie’s visions at varying speeds, repeating the same moments until Cassie realizes she’s seeing the future. The less said about the wispy, weblike special effects, the better. The context of Madame Web as a film is more interesting than anything onscreen. The Ringer this week and NPR previously covered how Sony legally must churn out something related to Spider-Man every few years or lose the movie rights to the friendly neighborhood web-slinger that Sony has held since 1999. Sometimes that generates pop culture magic, such as with the recent Tom Holland-led Spider-Man trilogy or the animated Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Other projects, such as the Tom Hardy-led Venom films, have a B-movie goofiness that’s hard to resist. Madame Web essentially kicks the rights issue down the road until another project like this year’s Kraven the Hunter arrives, further enmeshing Spider-Man within Sony’s clutches. Although Spidey can’t legally untangle himself, viewers at least can tap out—and should. Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024"," Madame Web would be fun if it was a lot better or a lot worse. It’s nowhere good enough to be a first-rate superhero movie, nor is it bad enough to be an amusing Batman & Robin-style trainwreck. The story takes place in 2003, and indeed the film feels like the comic book fare of the early- to mid-2000s – stuff like Elektra, Catwoman, and The Punisher, when filmmakers were still trying to figure out how to bring second-tier characters into the live-action realm. And since it’s an origin story, the plot ends at the spot where most people will wish it began. New York City EMT Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) inexplicably begins getting glimpses of the immediate future after a near-death experience. Her visions involve three teenage girls: Juila (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya (Isabella Merced). They’re in peril from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a guy with spider-like powers who has had his own premonition that they will one day kill him. Cassie attempts to rescue the girls, while simultaneously figuring out how her abilities tie into his. If you guessed he was in the Amazon with her mom researching spiders before she died, you’ve obviously seen the trailer. The screenplay for Madame Web is atrocious. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless also wrote Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, Power Rangers and Morbius. Their track record is obviously not great. Sims is a flat, uninteresting villain with paper-thin motivation, the dialogue is frequently awkward, and when the girls become costumed crimefighters at the end, no explanation is given for how that occurs. Superhero origin stories need strong characterization and tight plotting to make viewers care about the build-up. We know we’re not going to see the familiar Madame Web and the Spider-Women until the final minutes, so if we aren’t invested in their genesis, the result is empty.  Surprisingly little action takes place in the movie. When it does, the editing is confusingly choppy, thereby robbing it of excitement. Director S.J. Clarkson’s idea of style is to have the camera flip over during the middle of fight scenes, a technique that reeks of desperation and becomes tiresome. The concluding battle is particularly messy, with shoddy CGI and a corny bit of product placement that finds everybody brawling in front of a Pepsi sign. Actually, product placement is ubiquitous. A Calvin Klein billboard factors prominently into another scene. For all that’s bad about Madame Web, a level of entertainment does exist, thanks to the actresses. Dakota Johnson is terrific, giving a funny, self-knowing performance. She seems to recognize how dumb the story is, and her turn as Cassie almost plays like sarcastic commentary on it. On their side, Sweeney, O’Connor, and Merced work up fun chemistry as the teens. Each provides her character with personality, despite the bland script. Collectively, they keep the movie from sinking into bottom-barrel Marvel fare (i.e. Morbius and Fantastic Four). The four leads are easily the best thing here. They could headline a grade-A superhero movie or shine in an intentionally goofy entry like The Marvels. Instead, they’re trapped in a poorly written, stiffly directed dud. What a waste.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2024"," It gives me no pleasure to report this because we could use some fresh and original superhero adaptations on the big screen these days, but the Dakota Johnson-starring “Madame Web” is one of the worst comic book movies I’ve ever seen. Everything about it seems flat and artificial and contrived, from the limp dialogue to the annoying special effects to some surprisingly uninspired performances, given the talent level of the cast. Even some of the actors come across as if they’d rather be anywhere else but in front of a blue screen, pretending to fight a lackluster and ill-defined Marvel villain while straining to be heard over all the audio pyrotechnics. “Madame Web” kicks off with a cheesy and poorly shot prologue set in the Amazon in 1973, with Kerry Bishé as Constance Webb, a nine-months-pregnant researcher desperately seeking to discover a legendary spider with magical venom that could unlock, I don’t know, the cures for diseases and the mysteries of life and all that jazz. When Constance finally finds the spider, she is betrayed and shot by her hired security expert, one Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). Constance dies while giving birth to a baby girl. Flash forward to 2003 and Queens, where Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is working as a paramedic, with a bewildered-looking Adam Scott as her best friend and partner, Ben. (Ben! Hmmmm. Or maybe not hmmm.) Now, we know it’s 2003 because we see a terribly photoshopped billboard for Beyoncé’s “Dangerously in Love,” and Britney Spears’ “Toxic” is prominently featured, and at one point Cassie says, “I gotta get home in time for ‘Idol,’ ” even though nothing about her cynical, hardbitten character would indicate she’d be a fan of “American Idol” or even own a TV. With the “Fifty Shades of Grey” star doing her best to let us know SHE knows this is all camp nonsense, Cassie starts to experience jarring and often violent mini-flash-forwards to the immediate future. These constant visions are rendered through the use of a split diopter lens as well as some audio stingers that result in some of the most grating sequences I’ve ever experienced. Each one of these scenes should come with two caplets of Tylenol. In this same timeline, Ezekiel is experiencing his own visions, in which he is killed by three future Spider-Women. In “present day,” they’re still teenage girls who have yet to become superheroes. Ezekiel’s plan is to kill them NOW before they can kill him LATER. Celeste O'Connor (foreground, from left), Isabela Merced and Sydney Sweeney play teenagers destined to become Spider-Women who need the protection of Madame Web (Dakota Fanning). Through a strange series of coincidences that might not be coincidences, Cassie meets the trio and vows to protect them. Celeste O’Connor is Mattie Franklin, Isabela Merced is Anya Corazon and Sydney Sweeney is Julia Cornwall. They are all paper-thin characters required by the script to behave like absolute idiots and constantly put themselves in danger even when they know some sort of ceiling-crawling maniac is trying to kill them. After a series of clunky, poorly choreographed and fake-looking battle sequences, we get a tease to a sequel that most likely will never happen. If we’re lucky. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024",It collapses so pathetically that studio executives might as well have dialed 911 to rescue it. ,NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024"," Sony is taking another crack at making a Spider-Man movie without the titular character. Venom and its sequel were decent. Morbius was a guilty pleasure that was lambasted by critics. So, where does Madame Web rank? A bit closer to the latter. Madame Web follows Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), a New York paramedic who, after a near-death experience, discovers she can see pieces of the future and even change the outcome. As she’s struggling to learn how her new ability works, Webb comes across three girls who are being hunted by a mysterious man with spider-like abilities. The man is Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a wealthy researcher who stole a rare spider from an isolated Peruvian tribe in a remote region of the Amazon. The spider gave him powers but also cursed him to repeatedly see visions of his death. And that future death would supposedly come at the hands of three girls played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor. In order to prevent his death, Ezekiel decides to use his powers and fortune to track down the girls who would grow up to become Spider-Women and kill them before they get their powers. Seeing Ezekiel murder them in several visions, Cassie resolves to protect the teens until she can find a way to stop Ezekiel. But the key to her future turns out to lie in her past, specifically, her mother’s journey to and death in the Amazon.  With a 14 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s clear critics (and audiences) don’t think highly of Madame Web. It’s corny, the writing is, at times, nonsensical, and the editing can be downright nauseating at times. The effects, one of the key components of any superhero film, have moments in this movie that give Madame Web the appearance of a rough cut rather than a completed project. This is most apparent in the climax, which takes place atop an exploding fireworks warehouse. This is a film that will fall to pieces at any point with even a shred of serious thinking (how can a wanted paramedic afford to charter a private plane to Peru on short notice?). It’s inexplicably set in 2003 but seems to feature technology more common in 2024, especially where Ezekiel’s “woman in the chair” hacker/assistant is concerned.  Johnson does her absolute best to give a charming performance in a film burdened with such nonsensical and cliche writing, but there’s only so much she can do. She clearly has the acting chops to deliver a strong performance in a dramatic role, as shown in Cha Cha Real Smooth. Some of her efforts shine through, but most of Cassie’s standout moments are swallowed by the storm of mediocrity that makes up Madame Web.  Parks and Recreation fans who accidentally stumble into a theater to watch Madame Web will be pleased to see Adam Scott playing Cassie’s EMT partner. He’s perhaps the best part of this film, and all he had to do was channel his inner Ben Wyatt. Madame Web feels like an early 2000s superhero movie outside of its own time. And that seems to be Sony’s vibe with these “sort of” Spider-Man movies without everybody’s favorite web-slinger. But whereas Venom and its follow-up made decent money, Morbius floundered.

"Feb 16, 2024"," Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present. One of the great blunders in recent Hollywood history involves the executives at Sony Pictures, circa 2000, rejecting a deal that would have given them the rights to every superhero in the Marvel Universe. The comic book company had just filed for bankruptcy and were in desperate need of a cash infusion. So, when Sony exec Yair Landau was sent to inquire about their studio obtaining the rights to Spiderman, Marvel chief Ike Perlmutter had an alternate proposition for him – take all our characters for $25 million. When Landau reported the offer to his bosses they rejected it, saying, “No one gives a @#$% about any of the other Marvel characters. Go back and do a deal for Spider-Man.” This deal was closed for $10 million. As for the rest of the characters, apparently a great many people gave a @#$% about them. Ever since realizing their mistake, Sony has been trying to jump on the superhero bandwagon with various incarnations of the webslinger as well as films focused on ancillary characters in his universe, which they have the rights to. The result has been misguided efforts like the overblown “Venom” (2018) and its sequel, the misguided “Morbius” (2022) and now, the absolutely awful “Madame Web,” a mess of a movie that is at times so incredibly inane it may have a future as a cult classic. Jump ahead to 2002 and Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a New York City paramedic who has always been, socially, a step behind everyone else. On a call one day, she has a near death experience which unlocks some latent psychic abilities. Now she can see the future, something she has in common Ezekiel who has come to the Big Apple to track down Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeny) Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). He has foreseen that these three teenagers will kill him, and he wants to beat them to the punch. Fortunately, Cassie can see what is to play out and comes to their rescue. Overplotted and underwritten, the film contains some of the most simplistic dialogue in recent memory as well as character actions that make little sense. Johnson does her level best to bring a bit of fun to this and she’s the best part of the movie while her young counterparts accord themselves as well as they can. However, even the most skilled thespians would be unable to salvage this lifeless, desperate product. I don’t require an Aaron Sorkin-like script or perfect plotting from a superhero movie but on the other hand, I expect more than the nonsensical mess concocted by four “writers” presented here.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 16, 2024"," Four people worked on the screenplay for Madame Web (2024) and every one of them should be ashamed. It wants to bill itself as a psychological thriller with action and adventure, but it feels like the longest commercial for medication that helps you remember where you put your keys. It’s difficult to imagine someone not sitting down after drinking heavily and saying, “how can we maintain a connection to Spider-Man without actually saying ‘Spider-Man’?” and other drunk people threw out a bunch of ideas after skimming a Wikipedia article and consulting a dirty sock, and voila, a germ of a parasite of an idea formed and Madame Web was born. In deepest darkest Peru, Constance Web (Kirby Bishe) searches in vain for a rare spider whose venomous properties could be the key to solving disease forever. She has selfish ulterior motives for finding and potentially wiping out a species of arachnid for an untested chemical property that is literal years away from being tested in humans, while risking disease and permanent injury to her unborn child, but that’s a flashback for another time. Her guide or sherpa or assistant or himbo tagging along for the malaria, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahuim), double-crosses her and steals her prize. Constance is mortally injured but her child is saved by a secret tribe of spider people, with the promise that the child will return to the hidden jungle when she’s ready to learn the truth. I can think of no bigger “Screw you, Colonizer” than making a child work for answers to questions she doesn’t know she’s supposed to ask. Thirty years later in 2003, Cassie is a paramedic with the social skills of a jutting tree root. She was raised in the foster system and holds a grudge against her mother for having the audacity to die in a forest. Cassie is getting flashes of déjà vu and visions of terrible events to come but lacks the self-awareness or common sense the Good Lord gave a box of hair to do anything about it. Through poor judgement and basic incompetency, she finds herself in charge of three impulsive and unattended teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, Isabela Merced) and must keep them alive by abandoning them in a forest, abandoning them at a motel, and ditching them with a friend so she can do some research, which involve going through her mother’s 30-year old research things and looking thoughtful. Then she does a turn and burn to deepest darkest Peru – last minute on a paramedic’s salary – matching 30-year-old photographs to the ever-changing wilderness to get the mystical answers she seeks. Meanwhile, Ezekiel Sims has somehow become very wealthy, but frankly isn’t any smarter. He has also acquired “spider-person” powers like strength and walking on ceilings from the spider he stole from Constance. How? No one has time for villainous origin stories when we have an entire hero’s origin story to screw up. He also sees his own future death at the hands of three women in spider costumes. He sets out to stop these women now (yet, in their past) by using advanced CTV technology. How this knowledge is obtained using a stolen NSA key card with the weakest system password any 12-year-old could have hacked isn’t mentioned because those are details clever screenwriters come up with. Ignoring that taking action on a future event automatically changes how the future plays out, Madame Web plods along for nearly two hours. If you’re expecting to discover how the three spider women become spider women with extra legs, the power of flight, and electrical webs, this movie isn’t it. Madame Web is not a movie anyone deserves, and Sony slipped this to reviewers mere hours before its premiere. It’s the sort of passive hand off that’s not a sign of great confidence. Dakota Johnson, known best for some of the most lackluster “erotic” scenes ever committed to film from fan fiction, doesn’t just sleepwalk through Madame Web, she’s in a vegetative state letting the action happen all around her. When her character is feeling motivated, it’s only to run – run to the car, run to the ambulance, run through the warehouse, all to be just a bit too late to be effective. The choices Cassie Webb makes barely serve her reckless behavior as a paramedic, but we’re supposed to believe that from this mess of a human will be reborn as the great mutant pre-cog, Madame Web. No, we won’t, thanks. Madame Web force feeds the kind of mid-century morality that says single women will prove their worthiness to society if they refuse to get married and have children, see The Sentinel (1977). In this case, Cassie ends up sacrificing fundamental pieces of herself to become dependent upon the next generation of Spider People (her “children”). This plot twist to bring the movie in line with comic canon completely ignores the previous 110 minutes, while also ignoring the entire set up of the film. If you allow yourself to get angry now, you can save yourself the price of a movie ticket and the gas. Since we’re at it, let’s talk about the music. If you’re going to set a movie in 2003, maybe have music released in 2003. That’s what made other loud action movies like Bumblebee (2018) so much fun, by using relatable, identifiable music from the era. There are six pop tunes in Madame Web: “Dreams” by The Cranberries (1992), “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes (1993), “Bitch” by Meredith Brooks (1997), “I Think We’re Alone Now” by Tiffany (1997), “Scandalous” by Mis-Teeq (not released in the US until 2004), and “Toxic” by Britney Spears (2004). I can pull the Billboard top 100 for 2003 and blindly pick more appropriate songs like “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence or “Miss Independent” by Kelly Clarkston. Like everything else, it appears not even the barest effort was exerted for the music, and since music sets the tone for scenes, all of it felt off and awkward. Finally, I want every single one of you to apologize to The Marvels (2023), because despite the pile-on due to the cast, the director and the screenwriter (all women), it was an enjoyable 105 minutes and told a complete story. Not Madame Web, though, and because it didn’t tell a complete story, there is the implied threat of future movies. It’s disrespectful. Madame Web is rated PG-13 for mild swears, lots of spiders, many instances of the bird, explosions, truck accidents, ambulance accidents, people falling, people getting poisoned, childbirth, and more spiders.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 16, 2024"," Barely 10 to 20 minutes in, it is easy to see the bleak future of the two-hour movie - and the franchise that might be on the anvil over at Sony. It goes nowhere. The dialogue is ham-fisted, the action amateurish, the visual effects rudimentary and the final outcome disastrous. As for the acting, the less said the better. And that certainly isn't for want of effort. The actors strive very hard indeed. The strain shows. With an overload of inanities to deal with and tide over, the cast - besides Dakota Johnson, it includes Sydney Sweeney and Tahar Rahim - is hard-pressed to pull the proceedings out of the fire. There is little humour going around. Most of the film's attempts at being funny fall flat and the bursts of energy that peppers Madame Web are too overly affected to be effective. Dakota Johnson, she of the three 50 Shades films, is saddled with a role that approximates the character's arc in the film - until the very end, she struggles to figure out who and/or what she can be if she were to put her mind to it. In her original comic-book avatar, Madame Web is an aged, sightless wheelchair user endowed with powers that help her see the future in time to be able to stop or alter unwanted events. In the movie, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Johnson) is a New York Fire Department ambulance driver who is constantly racing against time. An accident triggers a startling change in her. She experiences disturbing visions of the immediate future that alarm and forewarn her. Unlike the Cassandra of Greek mythology, three girls she decides to help against a malefic force believe her helpful prognoses. First up, Cassie saves (very casually, if not unintentionally) a pigeon from a death foretold and then moves on to bigger creatures and lives as it dawns upon her, with a bit of help from a figure hidden in her past, that she is no ordinary 30-year-old woman. The villain, played by Rahim (the French actor has never been so shoddily treated by a movie script), can crawl on ceilings, swoop upon his prey at will and emit a fatal neurotoxin from his hand, but neither he nor the film has a way of wriggling out of the web of mediocrity that they are caught in. Madame Web is dead-on-arrival fare. Disney's Marvel movies, when things tend to go right, often deliver levels of entertainment that can keep audiences invested in the make-believe world that they conjure up with all their might. In Madame Web, nothing works. Nothing at all. An overwhelming dullness creeps into everything that Sony's Columbia Pictures-produced film rustles up. Most of the action In Madame Web takes place in New York in 2003. The period movie feel that Director S.J. Clarkson and her production designers seek to impart to it - to help the audience get a sense of the time and place, Pepsi cans of a certain vintage, a giant Calvin Klein hoarding through which the heroine drives an ambulance and a poster announcing Beyonce's debut album are thrown in - seeps into the overall look and texture of the film and not always in a good way. Madame Web is stylistically obsolete and technically sloppy - it is at most times reminiscent of the time when Hollywood superhero movies were only beginning to find their way forward and paving the ground for a spate the MCU fare that now crowds everything out. Madame Web opens in the Peruvian Amazon where Cassie's pregnant mother, Constance (Kerry Bishe), is on an expedition to look for a rare spider with healing abilities. She is betrayed by an evil associate, Ezekiel Sims (Rahim), who wants the spider for himself. Constance dies but not before being bitten by ab arachnid and giving birth to Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb, who acquires psychic powers thanks to the beneficial venom that passed on to her. The rest of the film has neither bite nor bang as the baddie, who, too, foresees his death in a vision and sets out to eliminate the three teenage girls who he knows will cause his demise. The girls are just, girls but each possesses the potential to be a Spider-Woman. Still in their teens, they are well away form acquiring any real powers. That is where Cassie comes in. She has visions that reveal troubling events of the immediate future. She babysits the three girls - Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) - babes in the woods who need all the handholding that they can get from Cassie - through the tough situations thrown at them by the crawling menace that Ezekiel turns into. If one were able to say that all this is fun while it lasts, Madame Web might have just about passed muster. Since it isn't, the movie is exhausting, pointless and totally bereft of the kind of flashy - and superficial - craft that superhero movies usually ride on. It is all very well to rustle up a female-centric superhero movie but all that Madame Web is likely to do is give all that are involved with the making of this forgettable movie a bad name that will be difficult to live down. It would be regarded as the worst of its kind had it not been competing with Morbius, the Sony Spider-Man Universe monstrosity that preceded it.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024"," En un año en el que no estaremos tan saturados de cintas de superhéroes, Sony Pictures ha estrenado la primera película de este género del 2024: Madame Web, protagonizada por Dakota Johnson y dirigida por S. J. Clarkson. Si algo es cierto, es que desde que el primer avance del filme, de inmediato surgió una gran polémica. Miles de fanáticos argumentaban, por medio de redes sociales, que la película se veía de mala calidad, como si hubiera contado con escaso presupuesto. Del mismo modo, aseguraban que era ilógico contar la historia de un personaje secundario de los cómics de Spider-Man, sin tener al propio Spider-Man en la trama. Ahora que la película de Madame Web finalmente ha llegado a los cines del mundo… ¿será que acaso los fans siempre tuvieron la razón? El universo cinematográfico de Spider-Man (sin Spider-Man) de Sony Pictures ha dado mucho de qué hablar, desde que inició en 2018, con Venom. Y es que pareciera que todas las películas que conforman a este universo compartido, tan sólo están hechas para que Sony pueda mantener los derechos del arácnido en el cine. Venom, Venom: Carnage liberado, Morbius, y ahora Madame Web, se han sentido como productos vacíos, sin alma, que no tienen realmente nada que contar. Más adelante, este mismo año, tendremos Kraven: El cazador, además de la tercera entrega de Venom. A estas alturas, tal vez ya tengamos una idea sobre qué esperar de estas cintas. Madame Web, ambientada en el año 2003, nos cuenta la historia de origen de Cassandra Webb, una paramédica que desarrolla habilidades psíquicas. En su búsqueda por encontrar la raíz de sus poderes, el destino la conduce hacia tres adolescentes en peligro, quienes, en un futuro, también tendrán habilidades sobrehumanas, sin que ellas aún lo sepan. Perseguidas por Ezekiel Sims, un hombre que mantiene una misteriosa conexión con la protagonista y que, al igual que ella, también puede ver el futuro, Cassandra protegerá a las jóvenes a toda costa. Por desgracia, una vez que el segundo acto arranca, y nos presentan a los personajes de Julia Cornwall, Mattie Franklin y Anya Corazón, todo se va en picada. Es nula la química entre las cuatro actrices, y en todo momento resulta inverosímil la situación que las mantiene unidas. Dakota Johnson intenta hacer lo más que puede, con el poco material que le es brindado, y consigue brillar un poco, más que nada por su carisma y su humor irreverente. Ella es quien carga con toda la película. Por su parte, Sydney Sweeney nos entrega un papel enternecedor y amigable, pero que cae en lo sobreactuado. Isabela Merced y Celeste O’Connor simplemente están ahí, sin aportar nada en lo absoluto. Lo que resulta aún peor, es el antagonista, Ezekiel Sims, interpretado por Tahar Rahim. A pesar de que entendemos el porqué de sus acciones, jamás se nos explican sus motivaciones, o la razón por la que es «malo». Sólo se trata de un villano plano y unidimensional. El guion no se preocupa en darnos una construcción de personajes adecuada, del mismo modo que nos entrega unos diálogos de pena ajena. Forzar referencias a Spider-Man, por medio de los discursos de los personajes, además de caer en lo risible, no se siente para nada orgánico. Por si todo esto no fuera poco, uno de los aspectos que pueden ser más criticables sobre Madame Web, es la publicidad engañosa con la que se promovió la película. Sin caer en spoilers, sí es importante aclarar que, tal vez uno de los momentos más esperados del filme, no sucede de la manera en la que los avances lo prometían. Eso puede desembocar en una enorme decepción. Madame Web es una película que verdaderamente no tiene razón alguna para existir. Su ritmo es torpe, desorganizado y caótico, dando como resultado escenas que carecen de lógica, con saltos abruptos y cortes sin sentido en su montaje. Se nota a leguas que el metraje fue editado una y otra, y otra vez. El argumento central de la película tenía cierto potencial, pero se terminó optando por el camino fácil. Al final, tenemos un producto genérico y sin esencia, que no cuenta con un solo momento memorable, ni siquiera durante las secuencias de acción. Para todos aquellos que disfrutan del cine de superhéroes, puede resultar alarmante el declive que ha tenido este género en los últimos años. Sin duda, Madame Web es una clara muestra de ello. Marvel Studios atraviesa tiempos difíciles. DC prefirió reiniciar de cero todo su universo. Ahora, Sony Pictures, con su saga de antihéroes y villanos de Spider-Man, no parece tener un rumbo fijo. Este universo cinematográfico arácnido no tiene ni pies ni cabeza, y por instantes, pareciera que ni siquiera Sony sabe qué es lo que está haciendo con sus propias producciones. ¿Acaso ya perdieron por completo el camino o será prudente seguirles dando oportunidad de mejorar?

"Feb 16, 2024"," After the incomparable success of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on every conceivable level, Sony Pictures decided to dig deeper into the Spider-Verse, this time pulling out a character that most mainstream moviegoers know little about and make her the focus of their next big motion picture. So, instead of a movie about Hobie Brown, Spider-Byte, or even Spider-Rex, we got Madame Web.  As for the characters, only Cassie and her buddy Ben (Adam Scott) are somewhat fleshed out, while no one else receives any type of character development beyond what the film requires for a specific scene or moment. Everyone either needs to be saved, or they are the villain. Or they are Ben. Other than that, they are filler. Johnson and her Spider-Stans do a decent enough job and are committed to the material, but Rahim as Sims is one of the worst screen villains in the last few years, which is saying quite a bit considering we were just subjected to MODOK in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Dar-Benn in The Marvels, and Atticus Noble in Rebel Moon.

"Feb 16, 2024"," The Sony Picture Universe of Marvel Characters, elegantly abbreviated as SPUMC, has been suffering tremendously as it attempts to pad the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unfortunately for Madame Web, the attempt to parallel the success of Spider-Man through alternative means has teed itself up to forever live in infamy by spinning a story nobody asked for. Sony's decision to greenlight Madame Web in the state that it was is astounding. The fact that the entire filming process was complete, edited, and somewhat promoted proves that studios are willing to create content for the sake of using Marvel's sake -- even in vain. What exactly was the motivation here, besides spitting on the Spider-Man legacy? Was it worth pouring a life-changing amount of money into Morbius For Women? The entire concept of Madame Web is inconceivable, but the execution is shockingly poor. Then again, who exactly is Madame Web for? It's pre-Peter Parker and yet miscalculates the birthday of Tom Holland's webslinger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Look, superhero movies aren't for everyone, and that's understandable. But would it kill Sony's creative team to fact-check the timeline they assumedly wanted to align with? Screenwriting has become an incredibly fluid art form, yet those credited on Madame Web's screenwriting team may want to remove this specific title from their portfolio altogether. Every scene feels like an absolute chore to get through, and there's nothing particularly interesting about how the screenplay is written.  The most meme'd line from the trailer, ""He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,"" isn't even in the movie itself.  Line deliveries are lifeless and flat -- no member of this cast could be bothered to sincerely engage with the script, and their apathy is more than present. It's as if lead actress Dakota Johnson had a completely different idea in mind when her agent booked her for a ""Marvel"" movie. She works through Madame Web as if she's in a daze, and is already thinking about how she can redeem her career after agreeing to take such a dismal role. Madame Web is  Marvel-adjacent and serves as another ill-fated attempt at repackaging characters that haven't been locked under Disney's domain.  That being said, Marvel's ongoing quest to remain relevant outside of its more-anticipated properties didn't exactly stick the landing.  It's sincerely puzzling as to why Sony insisted that Madame Web was even made. It holds no stake in Sony Pictures' regretfully-growing Marvel sub-universe, nor does it bear any deeper significance for Marvel's mainline movies.  It exists for the sake of existing and in the most pitiful way. Everything about Madame Web effectively works against its favor; an incohesive plot, questionable dialogue, an apathetic cast, and cringe-inducing CGI elevate a predictably bad movie into an even more abysmal one. If there's one thing about Madame Web, it's that it's the perfect movie to pirate through an incredibly shady second-hand torrent site. Save your money, and skip this one completely.  1/10.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 16, 2024"," After a couple of Venom films and a Morbius, I’m not sure if Madame Web will bring any valuable weight to Sony’s Spider-Man-less Spider-Man universe. Granted, Tom Hardy has pulled in high numbers with his wild take on Eddie Brock, and who knows, maybe the upcoming Kraven the Hunter will spin this web of missed opportunities in a more vital direction. However, as it stands, for all the merit that could come with a film designed to be relatively standalone and focused on strong female characters that would ideally appeal to a teen girl audience, missing the mark in so many ways does no one any favors, and likely keeps Peter Parker swinging in a different direction. While anyone at least a little comic book savvy (or those who remember their Spider-Man cartoons well enough) likely recalls the character of Madame Web as being a blind, elderly woman who sits in a fancy chair and passes along cryptic clues to our favorite web-head, this is a film that wants to go over how someone rose to be in this position. Set in 2003 (a loosely applied date, as several elements suggest this was not always the year the movie was supposed to be set in), the goal of Madame Web is to establish how a paramedic-turned-clairvoyant will lead a team of Spider-Women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor) to take on various bad guys. Why we need a whole movie to establish this, rather than get straight to it, emphasizes one of the key issues in this film and why it feels like a regression for 2024 comic book/superhero movies. Having to go through the motions means watching Madame Web stumble through a series of scenes we’ve seen in plenty of these movies by now. Whether it’s the opening sequence where Dakota Johnson’s Cassandra Webb is born that is straight out of Blade, the awkward realization of having new powers that recalls Daredevil, or the eventual teaming up of seemingly unconnected characters being sought after by another, akin to X-Men, we have all the usual beats in place. Now, of course, many of these films, good and bad, all lift many of the same plotlines to get through their origin stories. Madame Web, sadly, opts to clumsily take its turn, not unlike Fantastic Four (pick one) or Ghost Rider. It’s evident from the get-go, as we are quickly introduced to the film’s villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), whose entire performance appears to have been badly redubbed. Add to that a poorly rendered CG spider, and my hopes for this film to at least top Morbius were quickly dashed. Cut to the film’s 2003(ish) present day, and you have Johnson and Adam Scott’s Ben Parker (aha!) doing their best to at least have fun banter before things take a turn. There’s probably something to be said about a paramedic whose abrasiveness and desire to be left alone is only countered by a strong sense of duty. However, that’s undone by the movie’s inability to show Cassandra as a hero we actually want to root for. At times like these, one would want to at least be able to say something along the lines of, “For all its flaws, Johnson holds onto her dignity,” or whatever, but that’s not the case here. Detached in a way that suggests “this isn’t the film I signed on for,” Johnson hits a few necessary beats early on, only to become a character either annoyed by those around her or making a choice to leave the annoying characters around her to solve the mystery of why said irritants are being targeted. It makes her an odd superhero, and Johnson joins the other cast members by delivering lines in the style of “fifth attempt during Zoom re-recording” sessions. This film not only feels like a throwback to the days of lesser superhero films that sat alongside what Raimi’s superior Spider-Man movies had to offer, but it also fits in by being seemingly embarrassed about having ties to a comic book that suggests having to use names like “Madame Web” (which is never said in this movie) and wearing “goofy” costumes. Director S.J. Clarkson, making her directorial debut following a long list of TV credits (including Marvel’s Jessica Jones), finds scant moments to inject any real sense of style here, with only Ezekiel’s more villainous form (a non-Spider-Man costume that looks an awful lot like a black-suited Spider-Man) getting a few instances that stand out thanks to camera rotation. While one could say this is a movie aiming to be a more street-level superhero flick, it feels more like a busy comic book thriller with no real sense of what to do with its $80 million budget (an awful lot of time is spent with characters inside vehicles). Perhaps more could be done if this film wanted to either be more fun by way of its ensemble cast or harness the ridiculous energy that comes from a plot borrowing choice ideas from both The Terminator and The Dead Zone. Sadly, Madame Web does none of these things. It’s never morbin’ time in these parts. Even a random trip to Peru (where Cassandra ditches the teen girls she’s supposed to protect) doesn’t yield anything beyond yet another expository sequence. Ezekiel Sims, similarly, doesn’t get to live up to his awesome name, as he’s nothing but a force for evil. His over-the-top terribleness that quickly establishes him as a dangerous threat never amounts to anything more in the form of showiness. So, the film leaves us with Johnson, who is mostly out to sea, a dryly funny Adam Scott in the film’s 6th most important role, and, for some reason, comedian Mike Epps, who doesn’t get to say anything funny. In between are the three young women with very little to offer and Emma Roberts as a pregnant Mary Parker to allow the film some fun in making its audience do the math to figure out how an unborn Spider-Man fits into all of this. There’s no joy in watching a film like this, as nothing good comes from it. I haven’t even mentioned that for all the nonsense being fed by this story, it’s also pretty lifeless, meaning it becomes a slog pretty quickly. But with that said, what else can I expect from yet another attempt to build something like this without much desire to deliver anything more than a demand fulfillment sent down by the studio? I can go along with the idea that plenty of people worked hard on delivering a final product, but it’s a shame to see a movie with so little “movie” to actually offer. Worse than generic, Madame Web feels like an obligation come to life. With performances that lineup with the best sleepwalkers, iffy attempts at excitement via psychically-tinged action sequences, and a bland story designed to build toward a by-default more interesting concept to work with in a sequel that will unlikely happen, there’s just nothing here. Nothing has made me interested in seeing more of what this particular web-line in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe could deliver, and seeing yet another superhero movie that dares to sell audiences on a diverse, female-led story lose the thread on what works doesn’t help at all. This film is far from spectacular, as it’s a tangled mess.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 16, 2024"," The death of the comic book movie genre is being greatly exaggerated, despite the fact that Madam Web is one hell of a motive for its murder. There’s an oft-repeated sitcom joke where a character has to find something good-but-small to praise in a horrible play or movie that their friend did. “The lighting was atmospheric,” they’ll say. The lighting sucked in Madam Web. Any compliment is a lie. It is palpable what a horrible time everyone had making the movie, a wildly unpleasant experience that can only be topped by having to watch it. Only us Spider-Man nerds care, but the original Madam Web was a silver-haired, blind fortune teller in a wheelchair who dressed exclusively in a spider-emblazoned slanket. Somewhere in the multiverse, Helen Mirren got an Oscar for bringing that version to life. In this one, Dakota Johnson is Cassandra Webb, a character whose defining characteristic is that she’s unlikeable. That’s not a shot at Johnson – although it’s also not not a shot – so much as it is a literal fact pointed out by other characters in the film. Those other characters include Ben Parker (Adam Scott). That’s right, the film serves as the origin story of Spidey’s father figure Uncle Ben, whose defining characteristic is reminding everyone that the second season of Severance is overdue. Set in 2003 for – and this is very important – absolutely no reason, the nonsensical plot sees Cassie granted the ability to kinda sorta see versions of the future because her mother got bit by a magic spider in the Amazon while dying during childbirth. She has a vision of Ezekial Sims (Tahar Rahim) killing three teenaged girls: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Their defining characteristics are shy, sassy, and shy-but-sassy, respectively. Why is Zeke trying to off some young’uns? Because he too has magic Amazonian spider mojo that shows him a future vision of the three women as superheroes that toss him off a building to his death. It may be interesting to discover how they become spider-themed adventurers, so the movie never goes there. It does spend a lot of time with Zosia Mamet in front of a wall of monitors telling her evil boss where to find the ladies. And it also shows the origins of Spider-Man’s defining mantra. Only instead of “with great power comes great responsibility,” a jungle wizard says “when you take on great responsibility, great power will come.” Which is (A) just really, truly, absolutely not true and (B) almost the logical opposite of what that message is supposed to be about. Everyone. E-v-e-r-y-o-n-e in the movie gives a horrible performance. None worse than Rahim, whose every line of dialogue was clearly redone in post. It’s genuinely quite funny how he only talks when off-camera or when it is too dark to see if his words match how his lips move. There’s a really upsetting scene where the girls dance on a table to Britney Spears’s “Toxic” for a bunch of what appear to be frat boys. The finale takes place in a fireworks factory, and said fireworks are shown blowing holes in brick walls. The Pepsi ad placement is so blatant, it’s a sign of restraint Madam Web doesn’t stand over a defeated villain and say “Should have had an ice-cold, refreshing Pepsi-Cola.” Alison Willmore at Vulture says “In some sequences, Johnson gamely gives Math Lady meme face as her character, Cassandra Webb, first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers she’s developing. In others, she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that she’s appearing in a real stinker. Girl, give us nothing! No, seriously, there’s no point in doing anything more.” Rosa Parra at In Their Own League says “The trailers sold me on an action-packed film where a group of women were going to be kicking ass! But instead, I got a movie about Cassandra Web becoming a guardian to the teens and her journey in dealing with her powers— and the teens were massively underutilized.” Emmanuel “E-Man” Noisette at The Movie Blog says “From the cringy Spider-Man references and absurd logic of its characters, this film immediately becomes one of the more forgettable comic book movies of the year. This felt like a troll job to spite fans who are tired of these Spider-Man-Less films.”",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024"," Produced in association with Marvel, ""Madame Web"" follows in the critically mauled wake of ""Venom,"" ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" and ""Morbius,"" the last of which qualified as the worst of the bunch. Until now. Is ""Madame Web"" bad enough to put a final nail in the coffin of increasingly feeble superhero epics? The jury is still out. But it is second to none in the dark art of boring you breathless. The usually frisky Dakota Johnson is stuck in this 2003-era origin story about the soon-to-be Madame Web, aka Manhattan paramedic Cassie Webb, now struggling with her newfound power to see the future. As a clairvoyant, how could she not predict the disaster ahead? Cassie is not alone in her identity crisis. There are other potential super divas gearing up, including ""Euphoria"" breakout Sydney Sweeney as nerdy white girl Julia, Isabela Merced as Latina mathlete Anya, and Celeste O'Connor as Black skateboarder Mattie. Flash-forwards show them in various stages of Spidey cosplay doing lame things it took four screenwriters to concoct. Basically, they're dodging the villainous Ezekiel Sims (a strangely bland Tahar Rahim), who holes up in a penthouse making mischief with a nutso techie (Zosia Mamet). For background, the film opens with a spider research trip to the Amazon in which Ezekiel kills Cassie's pregnant mom (Kerry Bishé). But don't worry: spider venom saves the infant Cassie. Meanwhile, Ezekiel is haunted by visions of these future spider girls who are keen to take him out. He insists they must die. Cassie has other ideas, which she carries out with the help of fellow paramedic Ben Parker (a barely used Adam Scott) whose pregnant sister-in-law is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts). Any relation to Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man? One guess. The tangled plot resists deciphering as it forces a connection between characters that defines implausible. The actors are stuck with unplayable roles. Johnson's sexy deadpan and aura of mystery can work wonders in such films as ""Cha Cha Real Smooth,"" ""A Bigger Splash"" and ""The Lost Daughter."" But Cassie is a nothingburger part that would stymie even a young Meryl Streep. Who's to blame for choking the life out of ""Madame Web""? The obvious suspect would be the director. But British firebrand S.J. Clarkson, a gifted TV director (""Succession,"" ""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""Dexter""), is reduced in her misfire of a feature debut to keeping the actors from tripping over the truly atrocious dialogue. Better luck next time. The real culprit here is the greed manifested by studio suits who keep hawking cheap knockoffs. ""Madame Web"" feels like a random collection of half-baked ideas thrown into the air and allowed to land, with the cynical assumption that we'll buy any lazy hack-work that is Spider-Man adjacent. Kill me now. And there's no end in sight. You should know that the SSU has two future installments — ""Kraven the Hunter"" and ""Venom 3"" — ready to go in this year alone. That is definitely more like a threat than a promise. ""Madame Web"" comes in at under two hours, and that's the best thing I can say about it. Even the thought of a sequel would be cruel and unusual punishment.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024"," Like any true daughter of Hollywood, Dakota Johnson is a professional who understands that you have to work with the material you’ve got. Her breakthrough role as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies was a triumph of never holding herself above lines like “Punish me! Show me how bad it can be!” or the requirement to bite her lip so frequently she must have needed ChapStick after every take. But even Johnson has her limits, and Madame Web, one of Sony’s attempts to build out its own Spider-Verse, blows so far past them that you can practically guess which scenes were shot last based on the degree to which its star has given up. In some sequences, Johnson gamely gives Math Lady meme face as her character, Cassandra Webb, first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers she’s developing. In others, she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that she’s appearing in a real stinker. Girl, give us nothing! No, seriously, there’s no point in doing anything more. Cassandra — Cassie to her friends, which include her EMT partner Ben (Adam Scott) and the trio of teenage girls she ends up trying to help — is one of the deeper cut characters that are pretty much all that’s left for Marvel and DC movies to dredge up at this point. Aside from a late-breaking and wildly mangled ability to be in multiple places at one, Cassie’s powers, which develop after a near-death experience, involve an ability to see the near future. It could make for an interesting exercise, pitting someone with knowledge and foresight but no physical gifts against Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a proto-Spider-Man villain who can climb walls, punch hard, and poison with his touch. But Madame Web, helmed by prolific British TV director S. J. Clarkson, can’t come up with a remotely exciting way to pit these two against each other. Ezekiel wants to kill three high-schoolers — the meek Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), the requisite STEM girl Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and the rebellious Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) — because he’s plagued by prophetic dreams in which the three, costumed and superhuman, kill him. Cassie’s own visions are rendered in smeary bursts that are hard to make out, and even after she reluctantly becomes the girls’ protector, she mostly only anticipates new and not especially cool-looking ways to run away. Madame Web is draggy through most of its middle and inept by its end, but it’s also the kind of bad movie that is difficult to describe without making it sound awesome. For instance: It is set in 2003, as signaled by a Dangerously in Love ad and mention of Martha Stewart’s legal woes, for no obvious reason aside from the fact that it needs Ben (full name Ben Parker) to not yet be an uncle to his future Spider-Nephew. And yet — the movie plays bewilderingly coy about who Ben is. He refuses to say the name of the woman he’s started seriously dating (presumably May), and just when his pregnant sister-in-law Mary (Emma Roberts) is about to reveal her baby’s name, Ben and Cassie are called away to an emergency. The movie takes place in New York, but Cassie does manage to take an effortless mid-movie jaunt to the remote Peruvian jungle to visit the place where the scientist mother (Kerry Bishé) she grew up resenting died. While there, she communes with some indigenous Spider-People who may be the stuff of legends, but who conveniently speak English, before popping back to Queens for the big finish. The climax, by the way, takes place in an abandoned factory prominently labeled with a neon Pepsi-Cola sign (there’s a lot of Pepsi product placement), but filled, for reasons unknown, with boxes and boxes of fireworks. Superhero movies aren’t going away, but there’s a Schadenfreude in watching Madame Web and getting the feeling that the once-dominant genre is full-on dissolving like reality does toward the end of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It’s not just that studio execs obviously reworked the film to the point of incoherence, with Johnson herself freely admitting that the finished script was nothing like the one she signed on for. It’s that there is no evident vision to Madame Web at all, no sense of why anyone involved wanted to make it aside from the compulsion to keep milking this IP for whatever last drops of profit can be squeezed out. I wouldn’t say it’s joyless, because no film can be entirely without joy when it has Johnson hating on children and saying the line “Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom.” But it’s an $80 million project with no reason for existing aside from seeding spinoffs with the younger characters that are unlikely to actually happen. The more these movies have to serve as marketing campaigns for future installments, the less pleasurable they become as experiences in themselves. With Madame Web, at least, there’s no pretending that something good is coming down the pike. When Johnson settles into the “thinking hard” face that’s Cassie’s main expression, you have to wonder if she’s actually just considering firing her agents.

"Feb 16, 2024"," BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE **1/2 (107 minutes) M
The music is great but the flow is stilted and much of the dialogue incomprehensible in the loving biopic Bob Marley: One Love.  Some strong stretches manage to capture the peace-loving spirit of the father of reggae, such as the concert he staged during a violent election period in Jamaica. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard) also brings us into how and why Marley created reggae. There’s no question how convincing a job British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir does in his portrait of Marley as a loving family man and a star largely unaffected by ego as he gains global popularity.  Regrettably, the rambling, episodic nature of the storytelling is coupled with a commitment to cultural authenticity that, even more regrettably, results in some fast-talking, heavily-accented performances that are tough to decipher. The film could have done with subtitles, an option that will no doubt be available when the film enters the stream on Paramount+. Perhaps it’s best to wait till then. MADAME WEB *** (116 minutes) M
If you were to believe the thermonuclear attack launched by the world’s motion picture critics against Madame Web you could be forgiven for expecting this Marvel film to be among the worst entries of the superhero genre. If anything, Madame Web turns out to be a rather pleasant and enjoyable surprise, a well-made and well-paced origin story for a band of female superheroes who exist in the Spider-Man Cinematic Universe. (So it’s one of those hybrid Marvel films where Sony owns the rights to the characters – for those who care about such matters.) Dakota Johnson (she of the 50 Shades trilogy) puts in an above-average performance as Cassie Webb, a New York paramedic who grew up as a foster kid. Knowing little about her scientist mother who scoured the depths of the Amazon searching for a medically valuable spider, Cassie discovers she has some Spidey-type powers as well as a touch of clairvoyance that tends to kick in at opportune moments. Cassie’s quest is to protect three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced) who are destined to be masked guardians in the future, provided they can survive the competing quest of a villain who wants to kill them all so he can be left alone to exploit a rare spider venom. OK, the plot isn’t exactly William Goldman but it’s still a heck of a lot more coherent than a lot of other superhero films that have not drawn anywhere near the same degree of critical ire. So, never mind the critical mauling the film has received: Madame Web chimes in as a superhero lark that sits well above the dreck offered up by the genre in recent years. INSPECTOR SUN AND THE CURSE OF THE BLACK WIDOW *** (88 minutes) PG
Think Agatha Christie meets A Bug’s Life and you’ve got the gist of Inspector Sun, a brightly animated comedy-mystery lark wherein the titular detective, a seven-legged spider with Poirot-styled pencil moustache, tries solving a rather complex murder case on board an art deco flying boat as it wings its way from Shanghai to San Francisco in 1934. Fizzing with one liners and a cast of insect and insect-adjacent characters (remember, spiders are not insects!), Inspector Sun is a lovingly rendered throwback to old-style film noir mysteries and the clichés they rode upon. It’s replete with retro references adults will likely appreciate more than kids. Fortunately, he has Janey (Emily Kleimo), a more-than-capable jumping spider assistant to help him work through the blizzard of clues surrounding the untimely demise of crime boss Dr Bugsy Spindlethorp (Scott Geer). As the genre conventions dictate, chief among the suspects is, of course, his ex-wife Arabella Killtop (Jennifer Childs Greer), a sexy black widow spider who steps comfortably into the role of femme fatale. The dialogue is crammed with quick jokes, many of which might fly over the heads of young kids who, to be honest, might also struggle to comprehend a plot that, while well-thought through, is perhaps a few degrees more complex than it needs to be. You have to listen fast to catch all the lightning-fast exposition. Still, it all comes together in the end with a terrific action finale in San Francisco Bay beneath the yet-to-be-completed Golden Gate Bridge. Director Julio Soto Gurpide, working from a screenplay by Rocco Pucillo, ties everything together with panache. They don’t scutter about in the crawlspaces of the plane but instead occupy a beautifully designed parallel world to the humans, complete with its own corridors, cabins and dining rooms. FALLEN LEAVES * (81 minutes; subtitled) M
In writer/director Aki Kaurismäkia’s thoroughly boring rom-com Fallen Leaves, slow-witted working-class drones Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) try finding love in a colourless Helsinki. What is clearly intended as a quiet little romantic charmer is actually inert and wholly uninteresting, its straight-faced performances and supposedly dry wit failing to bring the ditty to life. Think of it as an arthouse sedative. NYAD ***1/2 (121 minurtes) M
Two superb, Oscar-nominated performances from Annette Bening (best actress) and Jodie Foster (best supporting actress) drive Nyad, the bittersweet tale of flawed heroism following sexagenarian athlete Diana Nyad and her steely resolve to swim from Cuba to Florida. Some 30 years after her failed attempt at the endeavour she decides to reinvigorate her body and her mind by trying it again – ove and over. Summoning her best friend and longtime trainer Bonnie Stoll (Foster), Nyad sets out to defy stereotypes about the elderly by getting into shape and heading into the critter-infested  ocean with the help of veteran navigator John Bartlett (Rhys Ifans). In a splendid, warts-and-all portrayal Bening reveals Diana Nyad as both a defiant figure and as a ego-driven brute, expecting everyone to service her enterprise. The film is drawn from the book Find a Way by Diana Nyad and is at pains to shows how dogged determination and sheer stubborness are both sides of the same coin.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 16, 2024"," If there’s a rule to be aware of when it comes to Sony’s
so-called “Spider-Verse” movies, it’s this: If Spider-Man isn’t in it, it’s
likely to disappoint. That applies to Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Morbius, and now Madame Web. Although all these
properties have comic book sources, none has translated well to the big screen.
This is in part due to poor writing but is equally the result of a general lack
of direction on the part of Sony which, outside of its partnership with Marvel
Studios for the Tom Holland Spider-Man series, doesn’t seem to
understand the characters over which it has stewardship. Madame Web is
another example of a comic book movie no one was clamoring for. Two things come to mind immediately when considering this
production. The first is how disjointed and haphazard the storyline is,
frequently employing sleight-of-hand to resolve conflicts. It is evidently the
first chapter of a longer story since three of the four principals never develop
their super-powers (which are hinted at in flash-forward dream sequences) and
exist predominantly to fill “damsels in distress” roles. The second is how
juvenile the dialogue is. This is especially evident at the end with a
voiceover pronouncement that would have been at home in a Saturday morning
cartoon.  Like Argylle, Madame Web makes for a better
trailer than a full movie. That’s because the central premise – a superhero
whose power is the ability to see short distances into the future and thereby
alter the timeline (if she wishes) – is ripe with possibilities. None, however,
are effectively explored. Maybe that’s the trap of the origin story nature of
the narrative. It’s so busy introducing characters and establishing situations
that there’s no time to do anything more than dispatch a feeble villain in a
perfunctory fashion. One of the reasons why Madame Web doesn’t work is
because there’s rarely any tension. For an action film, even one falling into
the superhero subgenre, the dearth of excitement is a death sentence. Although it’s refreshing to see studios continue to uncover
female action heroes worthy of screen exposure (this one follows The Marvels
in that regard), it’s disappointing to find how shabbily treated they are.
Perhaps Madame Web might have worked better had it narrowed its focus to
a single character – in this case, Cassandra Web (Dakota Johnson). The addition
of three teenagers in need of protection – Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney),
Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) – muddies
the waters. This would-be series might have been better served by delaying
their inclusion until a potential sequel. Speaking of elements that were not in the final cut of this
movie, it’s evident that some connective tissue with the Spider-Man movies
was sloppily edited out of Madame Web. The footprints have been left
behind – the character of Cassie’s best friend, Ben (Adam Scott), is
unquestionably a younger version of Spidey’s Uncle Ben and the baby born during
the course of the proceedings is Peter Parker. It seems likely that these
things were acknowledged in the script at some point but were elided from the
final cut. Those who watch the names scroll by at the end will learn the truth;
Adam Scott is credited as playing “Ben Parker.” (Mary Parker, Ben’s sister-in-law
and Peter’s mother, is also in the movie, played by Emma Roberts.) Madame Web opens with a short prequel set during 1973
in the Amazon jungle. It introduces the mother of the film’s main character
(played by Kerry Bishe), a scientist studying rare spiders. After discovering
an amazing new species, she is attacked by her alleged bodyguard, Ezekiel Sims
(a dreadful Tahar Rahim), who steals the spider and leaves her for dead. She is
rescued by local tribesmen who are able to keep her alive long enough to give
birth to Cassandra.  Thirty years later, Cassie is a New York ambulance driver.
After being involved in a near-death experience, she begins having episodes in
which she can seemingly see into the future. After determining that she’s not
hallucinating, she begins to tinker with her abilities. Meanwhile, Ezekiel, now
possessing powers gained from the spider’s venom, is having recurring dreams of
his death at the hands of three women. He uses stolen AI to locate them and plots
their murders. When it comes time to execute his plan, however, his murderous intentions
are foiled by Cassie, who has a vision of him killing Julia, Anya, and Mattie,
and acts to save them. Sadly, Madame Web fails to rise above its pedigree as
a lesser superhero movie. It does nothing to convince viewers that there’s
value to be found in a story not featuring a marquee comic book character.
There’s a growing sense that Sony is overreaching by plumbing the bargain bin of
the IP for which it owns the rights and trying to force-feed the public with
characters like Venom, Carnage, Morbius, and Madame Web. We’ll never know
whether a well-crafted, riveting Madame Web might have made this an
early-year box office gem because that’s not what director S.J. Clarkson has delivered.
Her vision – or at least the one Sony allowed to reach the screen – is a tired,
infantile exercise in exploring the worst tropes of origin stories. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 16, 2024"," ""Madame Web"" is a movie filled with ambulance action, table dancing and - this is more like it - a tribe of Amazonian spider people. Very Indy-ish, and very promising. But then there's also an infestation of product placement of the most shamelessly brazen sort, and you marvel that studios give a thumbs-up to this sort of thing and then wonder why their movies die on the vine.  The movie's title character, played here by Dakota Johnson, first appeared in Marvel's ""Amazing Spider-Man"" comics in 1980, and she's kind of interesting — a blind pre-cog who can see into the future and possibly change it. She's very super in her native format. Not so much in this movie, though. Here she's almost completely pre-super, and largely preoccupied with looking after three bratty young acolytes (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced) who, as we eventually see (and instantly guess), are on their way to becoming fully suited-up Spider-Women later on in what Sony Pictures and Marvel's movie arm must have been hoping would mark a return to the long-ago glory days of the Spidey franchise. But as an attempt to kickstart a new Spiderman dynasty, the movie falls seriously short; the story is virtually all intro, with not a lot of payoff in Spidey action. None, actually — although we're clearly in Spidey's world here, the celebrated web-slinger never puts in an actual appearance.  Judging by the critical hostility that has greeted ""Madame Web,"" the possibility of future adventures now seems iffy. But the movie does indicate a way forward for this sort of picture in a time of mounting superhero fatigue among moviegoers. (Presumably people who've paid to sit through such widely reviled films as ""The Marvels"" and ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" the piddling ""Morbius"" — another attempted Spider-Man spinoff — and the awful ""Eternals."") Introducing three fresh young super-women into the Spider-Man universe would seem like a surefire way of reigniting interest out in the youth market. And it would help mightily if the producers could hold on to Dakota Johnson for any future installments — her air of serene self-possession in the face of all the movie's limp CGI and lunkhead dialogue (""When you take on the responsibility, great power will come"") is wonderfully calming. If she's not appalled by the movie's mad editing and muddled plot (two of the picture's three writers also worked on ""Morbius""), why should we worry? The story begins in Peru in 1973, where a woman named Constance (Kerry Bishe) is researching a tribe of spider-worshippers. Assisting her, for reasons unclear, is a treacherous character named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who is bedeviled by a recurring dream about three young women he's convinced will one day kill him. Better he kills them first, he figures.  Constance, who is pregnant, gets bitten by a spider and later gives birth to a daughter she names Cassandra (Johnson). The little girl grows up to be an EMT, and we first meet her wheeling around Manhattan in an ambulance alongside her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). There is a lot of racing about from one emergency to another, and since Cassie can see into the future — and must then relive what she and we have already seen — the movie begins to feel padded.  Soon we re-encounter Ezekiel, who's also in New York now and busily monitoring the movements of Cassandra and the three girls with whom she's become encumbered (for reasons purely misterioso). Ezekiel and a sidekick named Amaria (Zosia Mamet) are employing the usual sort of all-seeing computer setup to locate the three young women. They eventually find them taking part in a big action scene down in the subway, where everybody gets to meet a sort of Evil Spider-Man (actually Ezekiel in a black-and-red supersuit), who is of course in a homicidal mood.  The story sprawls. Cassie is at pains to announce her concern for the safety of the three girls now that Ezekiel is on their trail; but then she'll run off to South America or someplace, leaving them on their own — and leaving us to cope with all the commercial shillery rearing up around what seems like every corner. There's a sudden Beyonce billboard visible in one scene (Beyonce is signed to Sony's Columbia Records label). And when we take a break to attend a cookout with Ben and his pregnant sister Mary (checking off their familiar Spidey-world names), we can't help noticing that everyone is drinking Pepsi-Cola — a warmup for the movie's big finish, which takes place atop a huge Pepsi billboard on the bank of the Hudson River. I'm not making this up.  In order to really work, the movie would have had to give us a look at the three fledgling Spider-Women learning their trade and having their first crime-fighting adventures. Did someone really think it best to hold off on providing that sort of basic audience pleasure, to save it for some future installment that, as now seems entirely possible, no one may ever request.

"Feb 16, 2024",Congratulations&#44; Sony&#46; You outdid yourself&#46; You actually made a movie worse than Morbius&#46; Madame Web is another obvious case of Sony churning out a movie to keep the Spider-Man property&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024"," The Ben Affleck version of Daredevil hit screens on Valentine’s Day back in 2003, so it’s fitting that Madame Web not only is set during that particular year but also opens in theaters on the same day 21 years later. Heck, all that’s missing is a hit Evanescence song on the soundtrack. I bring this up because Sony’s latest excursion into its Marvel Spider-Man–adjacent cinematic universe is the most second-tier, early-2000s comic book yarn that’s seen the light of day in ages, and this includes both the Venom entries and 2022’s Morbius. Director S.J. Clarkson has delivered a glossy, hyperactive jolt of colorfully unvarnished absurdity that could almost be fun if it wasn’t so poorly plotted and obnoxiously dumb. The film comes tantalizingly close to being an unintentional parody of the superhero genre, and that happy accident almost makes watching the resulting mess worthwhile. What Madame Web does have going for it is that it is fairly well cast, rarely slows down, has some nice visual flourishes, and doesn’t take itself too seriously. Dakota Johnson’s seeming disdain for the material nicely fits her lead character of New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb. She brings a sharp sense of humor and a cutting wit that makes much of this nonsense tolerable. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor are also rather good as the teenage trio Webb protects from harm, while Adam Scott is having the time of his life as Ben Parker, a name that should be familiar to fans of everyone’s favorite wall-crawler all over the world. Granted, the same could be said about Daredevil, and yet two decades later, that piece of goofy schlock is still considered something of a disaster, and for good reason. But one thing it undeniably has over Clarkson’s equally brain-dead slice of super-powered hokum: a great villain. Two of them, actually. However, Michael Clarke Duncan as a suitably threatening Wilson Fisk and Colin Farrell as magnificently out-of-his-gourd Bullseye both deserve to be in a much, much better motion picture. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea what happened with Tahar Rahim’s performance as Peruvian madman Ezekiel Sims. Though Rahim is a sensational actor, known for his superlative turns in A Prophet, The Past, and The Mauritanian, it sounds like almost all of his dialogue was done via automated dialogue replacement (ADR), as if he were starring in some 1970s Italian spaghetti Western or giallo. His character’s motivations are never explored and rarely explained (and certainly not in any detail). Sims’s superhuman abilities seem to change whenever the plot requires them to, making him not so much a threat as a vaguely unthreatening Terminator clone. And what is that plot? Webb is an orphan who, 30 years after her traumatic birth, suddenly gains furtive Groundhog Day–like glimpses into the future that she can’t control. This leads her to Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Merced), and Mattie Franklin (O’Connor), three teens from different worlds who have been marked for assassination by a determined Sims. Sims has been having nightmares of them growing up to be vigilante superheroes who, for reasons he does not know, break into his Manhattan skyrise and throw him out the window to his death. Instead of waiting for that to happen, he decides to kill them while they’re still in high school, and Webb is the only one who can stop him. Or something like that. It honestly doesn’t matter. Simms wants to kill the girls. They don’t want to die. Webb tries to gain control of her prognostication abilities to keep him from doing it, and in the process learns how her mother (Kerry Bishé) was betrayed and then murdered while researching spiders in Peru. There’s not a great deal more to it. The story and screenplay, credited to five different writers (including Clarkson), is all over the map. It makes playful references to the superhero-who-shall-not-be-named (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), although as he’s nothing more than the bun in Mary Parker’s (Emma Roberts) oven, this isn’t a surprise. But the film also doesn’t do a thing to flesh out any character other than Cassandra Webb, and this includes Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Heck, if someone revealed that Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor ad-libbed all of their dialogue, I’d be tempted to believe them. But that’s the least of the film’s structural problems. Not to be a broken record, but why is Sims the way he is? If this Peruvian spider is so well known around the world, why did no one other than Cassandra’s mother go look for it (including after her death)? If Julia, Anya, and Mattie end up being spider-powered superheroes within a few short years, why does all of New York lose its collective crap when Spider-Man comes along after they’ve been doing their thing for probably at least a decade? What exactly are the rules regarding Webb’s abilities? Some of these questions are important, others arguably not so much. But the fact that all (and several more) are given not so much short shrift but no shrift at all is an issue. A few implausible occurrences here and there and a small cadre of narrative shortcomings aren’t a deal breaker. But an onslaught of them? One right after the other? To the point where it becomes borderline comical? That’s too much of an ask. Which brings us back to those not-so-fondly-remembered 2000s catastrophes like Elektra, Catwoman, Fantastic Four, and the aforementioned Daredevil. There was talent involved with each from a production standpoint, they all had game casts, and the same can be said about Madame Web. But the latter falls into a similar trap of mediocrity they all became ensnared in, and it’s a shame Cassandra Webb didn’t see that regrettable turn of events coming, because then maybe she could have done something about it — like canceling production before it even began.

"Feb 16, 2024"," Not unlike a burger at Arby’s or whatever KFC was doing with the Chizza, Madame Web is a quizzical aberration of capitalism. Of course, meme culture makes you morbidly curious. No, it’s probably not been prepared with sanitary methods in mind. Yes, it will make your tum-tum hurt. Madame Web is the latest entry in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, or SSU. You know the MCU? The DCEU? This is that. For Sony’s Spider-Man movies. But they can only include Spider-Man proper now — as in, say, Spider-Man: No Way Home — when the MCU sphere is also involved. If that gives you a headache, the SSU was once known as the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, or SPUMC. They pronounced it spum-see. Kind of like the C. diff that would inflame your colon after eating a promotional tie-in meal somewhere for Madame Web. You may have read elsewhere that Madame Web is an objectively terrible but subjectively delightful slice of camp cinema — or a bad movie that mostly knows it’s bad, leans into said badness and achieves a level of entertainment in spite of itself. No. No, no, no, no, no. Madame Web is just bad. The SSU has camp. It’s called Venom. And it’s also called Venom: There Will Be Carnage. In those films, you’ll find outsized melodrama, exaggerated excess, bromantic chemistry and the endlessly delightful sight of Tom Hardy cooling his overheated genitals in a hoity-toity restaurant’s lobster tank. A third one is coming later this year. It should be fun. Meanwhile, Madame Web instead offers the following: a lead performance from Dakota Johnson whose clear and charmless contempt can’t be cut around however exhaustive and nauseating the editorial efforts; three supporting performances from Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor that wouldn’t pass muster in the smallest of community theaters; a villain whose voice someone hated so much it has been largely overdubbed by a man who sounds quite ill and nothing like actor Tahar Rahim; and a by-committee screenplay that tiptoes around very specific Spider-Man references like “Uncle Ben,” “Peter Parker,” “Uncle Jonah” (LOL) and “With great power comes responsibility.” At least co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, returning from the shockingly preferable SSU entry Morbius, appeased the lawyers. And in the SSU, those lawyers seem to be all that matter — from the ones who enforce Sony’s rights to non-Spider Man characters from Spider-Man comics to the ones assisting on the financials for Q1 2024. Madame Web is ultimately a bunch of names and numbers on a ledger — one likely to turn red, if there’s any justice left — and it musters a similarly exciting energy. It’s a meal like the one Brundlefly would consume in David Cronenberg’s The Fly, whittled down to goopy, enzymatic mush by vomitous acid. There are at least a couple of interesting things about Madame Web. First are the panic switches seemingly pulled in post-production to align its 2003 setting with the birth of … well, let’s call him Petrus Parkus. You know, the character played by that very famous actor, Todd Netherlands? Very cute to believe anyone from this movie will ever play these characters again at all, let alone alongside an actor like Todd Netherlands.  The second is the tension established among Johnson, Sweeney, Merced and O’Connor. Oh, it has nothing to do with their fright at becoming the prey of mean ol’ Ezekiel Sims (Rahim, if in appearance only), who prowls around New York like an evil Spider-M … sorry, Arachnid Male. Neither does it have to do with the concern about their prophesied or present-tense superpowers. Instead, it has everything to do with the optics of when to drop their representation for roping them into this debacle. OK. Maybe that’s unfair to their reps.No one made them sign on for Madame Web. That’s what makes Johnson’s pissy press-tour persona even more puerile. She chose this. All right, maybe lines like “OK, so this guy’s hands somehow release an acute neurotoxin” or “But I don’t have a neuromuscular disorder!” weren’t in the original script. But her character was surely named Cassie Webb. In a movie called Madame Web. Which is adjacent to Spider-Man (but only adjacent … good job, lawyers). With mediocre source material comes modest expectations. Besides, doesn’t Johnson — among the most vapid, juiceless A-list performers there is — need to give more than one performance somewhere above average before something is truly below her? Johnson’s good-faith effort begins and ends with the same-old pee-shiver face every actor makes when playing someone with precognitive abilities to see the future before it happens. That’s Cassie’s superpower, unlocked after the perpetually put-upon paramedic plunks her head on the windshield of a taxicab plummeting off a bridge. It’s kind of like a less gory Final Destination, a franchise whose finest sequence this film seems poised to reference. But no. That vehicle has a better 2003 Final Destination-ish film to appear in. Anyway, the same peptides that will later propel the heroism of Petrus Parkus pump through Cassie’s blood, too, and her accident also unlocks long-dormant secrets about her mysterious birth. Of course, those secrets would be less dormant had Cassie browsed her dead mom’s treasure chest at any point in the 30 years of her life before this film takes place. Sims has spidey sense, too. He’s got the moves like Parkus will one day have, but he’s also been cursed to see his eventual fate at the hands of Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Merced) and Mattie Franklin (O’Connor). In 2003, they’re just teens who dance on a table at a diner to Britney Spears songs, as American diners were wont to let teens do back then. Later, they’ll become superheroes … if Cassie can keep them alive in a film that can hardly keep its sense of time, science or legal issues that would prevent a kidnapping suspect from peace-ing out to Peru (as a maniac with inexhaustible surveillance resources hunts her, no less). Two years before YouTube debuted and four years before anyone had an iPhone, a subway rider watches horizontal video on a mobile device. Julia, Anya and Mattie leave a campfire burning to dance at that diner and wouldn’t you know it: Cassie does not return hours later to find a conflagration worthy of national news coverage. Budgeted at $80 million, Madame Web might be the most expensive CPR training video of all time. And it uproariously sends Cassie to Peru for a full week of self-discovery while Sims ostensibly continues to track the girls in New York using omniscient satellite powers. At least the pop-song soundtrack is chronologically sound. But with Madame Web, if you wake in the morning and you step outside and you take a deep breath and you get real high, you’ll still scream at the top of your lungs, “What’s goin’ on?” Johnson will be fine after Madame Web. Sweeney will be fine. Adam Scott and Emma Roberts, who turn up for thankless paycheck roles, will be fine, too. Cry neither for Sazama and Sharpless, who are almost certainly on retainer for several more rounds of C-list Spidey-character scripts. Instead, feel the worst for director S.J. Clarkson — a 20-year-plus veteran of prestige TV who has seen several big-ticket projects come her way and never materialize, and who will almost certainly take undue blame here despite a keen visual knack for kinetic energy that gets lost in all the chopping. “The best part of the future is that it hasn’t happened yet,” says one character. There’s no real good spin on Madame Web, but that might be the best Clarkson can hope for.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 16, 2024"," While Madame Web immediately became a meme after its first trailer dropped, I have to admit I was quite intrigued by the premise. A team of Spider-Women comprised of Hollywood’s biggest leading ladies all woven together by a psychic web? Sign me up! Unfortunately, what we get with Madame Web is a lackluster origin story devoid of much action, powers, or sense. Dakota Johnson stars as Cassandra Web, a loner of a New York City paramedic who finds that “when you take on the responsibility, great power will come,” in a new play on the iconic Spider-Man line. The responsibility? Protecting three young women from a mysterious rival who wants them dead with her newfound clairvoyance. There’s Sydney Sweeney as the meek Julia Cornwall, Isabela Merced as the independent Anya Corazon, and Celeste O’Connor as the rebellious Mattie Franklin. All four of them share the same experience as abandoned women who don’t have real family to rely on. It makes sense that this leads them to become a found family of sorts, but the story lacks the emotional depth needed to be believable. While this quartet seems like a match made in leading lady heaven, the girls are sidelined for most of the film. Cassie is often having them hold tight for three hours in the woods while she runs around trying to figure out what’s going on or disappearing mid film for an impromptu trip to Peru that explains her past. These types of transitions feel lazy and reductive.  Tahar Rahim plays our generic bad guy Ezekiel Sims who strangely sounds as if he’s been dubbed over in every scene. He has no real motivation as a villain other than a vision that the future Spider-Women are going to kill him. We don’t know when or why and it all comes together rather dully. It’s particularly disappointing because the most thrilling moments are when we get to see the girls with their Spider-Women powers, which are only seen in his vision. We never see them use powers in this film, let alone see how they get them. The film does do a nice job of creatively tapping into Cassie’s visual web of powers, as well as the trendy 2000s. In one scene, she rewrites history by crashing a stolen taxi into a diner in a sequence soundtracked by Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” The most interesting aspect of the film is the minor storyline focused on the Spider-Man universe we all know and love. We meet Uncle Ben (Adam Scott) and his very pregnant sister-in-law Mary (Emma Roberts). There’s hints of Ben dating someone new — future Aunt May anyone? — and Mary goes into labor delivering a healthy baby boy. They don’t come out and say it, but we all know it’s a baby Peter Parker! The end of the Sony film is a mad dash to connect the film to the character in the Marvel Comics that finds Cassie suddenly blind and paralyzed, giving off a Professor X energy as she welcomes the girls as her metaphorical daughters. It’s so on the nose that it becomes cheesy. That cheap quality is a running thread with most of the film as it is full of moments that are laughably bad or awkward due to the set ups and dialogue. All in all, Madame Web wastes a strong cast with a half-baked story, weak dialogue, a pointless villain, and no real development of a majority of the characters or their powers. While I would love to see this cast of Spider-Women actually get a chance to shine, this film may be too bland to start a franchise.

"Feb 15, 2024"," Wow. Well, this is definitive. We all knew that superhero movies were breathing their last, and that recent flops The Marvels, The Flash and Ant-Man 3 had signalled the inevitable end of it all. Yet, still nothing can quite prepare you for this latest (and surely final?) instalment from Marvel’s “Spider-Verse”. In its sheer mind-boggling awfulness, it represents (to paraphrase Robert De Niro’s Al Capone in The Untouchables) the death of the superhero genre, the burning of the superhero genre to the ground and then the returning in the middle of the night to piss on the superhero genre’s ashes.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Madame Web (Estados Unidos/2024). Dirección: S.J. Clarkson. Guion: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S.J. Clarkson. Fotografía: Mauro Fiore. Edición: Leigh Folsom Boyd. Elenco: Dakota Johnson, Sidney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahar Rahim, Emma Roberts, Zozia Mamet. Calificación: apta para mayores de 13 años con reservas. Distribuidora: Sony/UIP. Duración: 117 minutos. Nuestra opinión: regular. La última escena de Madame Web, el film ambientado en el “universo del Hombre Araña” que se estrena hoy, podría ser una de esas películas paródicas al estilo de Scary Movie, que tanto éxito tuvieron a principio de los años 2000. Si en lugar de reírse de los modos y formas del terror la idea hubiese sido burlarse de las películas de superhéroes, la existencia de Madame Web tendría más sentido del que tiene como un intento fallido de exprimirle hasta la última gota al género que está en caída libre. El film protagonizado por Dakota Johnson es una acumulación de malas decisiones y desvíos incomprensibles en una trama que desperdicia todos los elementos que el proyecto tiene a su favor. Para empezar, el hecho de que la historia transcurre en el mismo mundo narrativo en el que se desarrolla el cuento de Peter Parker, uno de los personajes más conocidos y queridos de Marvel, podría haber sido una ventaja para la nueva aventura. Sin embargo, cuando se cuenta que Cassie Web (Johnson) trabaja como paramédica junto con un tal Ben Parker (Adam Scott), que está a punto de convertirse en tío por primera vez, el guiño para los fanáticos del superhéroe arácnido por venir -hasta se habla en un momento de la responsabilidad de tener grandes poderes-, es tan insistente que termina por aburrir. En su primera mitad, el film se apoya en el tono del thriller, un estilo que le sienta bien al personaje central, una mujer acostumbrada a la soledad y poco interesada en establecer vínculos emocionales cuya vida cambia radicalmente cuando, tras un traumático accidente, empieza a desarrollar el poder de la clarividencia. Y es en ese punto en que la fantasía y los elementos sobrenaturales toman el mando de la narración hasta chocar la nave. Desconcertada por las visiones del futuro inmediato que se manifiestan más allá de su control, Cassie se ve involucrada con tres chicas adolescentes, Anya (Isabela Merced), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) y Julia, interpretada por la conocida -aunque aquí resulte difícil de reconocer-, Sidney Sweeney, tan solitarias como ella. Encargada de proteger las vidas del trío, la protagonista empieza a descubrir su propia historia y el lazo que la une a Ezekiel Sims, el villano que hará todo lo posible por cazar a sus nuevas pupilas. Interpretado por el actor francés Tahar Rahim (La serpiente, Napoleón), Sims es quizás uno de los villanos más planos y menos interesantes de todo el universo Marvel, y al endeble desarrollo del personaje se le suma un evidente problema con el audio de sus líneas de diálogo, que parece haber sido grabado fuera de sincronía con la imagen. A medida que la trama avanza -sería más apropiado decir que tropieza-, la verosimilitud del relato se reduce al mínimo, al punto de que cada escena se vuelve un muestrario de frases hechas, declaraciones vacías y fracasados intentos de sumarle épica a una historia que no la encuentra por ningún lado. La participación de actores carismáticos y talentosos como Johnson, Scott, Rahim, Emma Roberts y Zozia Mamet, las últimas dos tremendamente desperdiciadas, termina por transformar a Madame Web en una larga y escasamente creativa publicidad de la marca de gaseosa que aparece repetidamente en cámara. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Feb 15, 2024"," An instant candidate for a Razzie Award, Sony’s Marvel-adjacent “Madame Web” arrives out of the Spider-Verse, and it is a stinker. How do you make a comic-book-based superhero origin film about a superhero whose powers are not clear to you (or her) for the first half of the film? We start out in the Peruvian Amazon in 1973 with the hero’s very pregnant mother, Constance (Kerry Bishe), a scientist and arachnologist, searches for a particular spider that she believes has venom that will cure her sick unborn child. Accompanying her is the obviously evil guide Ezekiel Sims (great French actor Tahar Rahim, completely at sea in this mess). He is trying to steal Constance’s notes and her spider. Cut to 2003 New York City (the film was shot in Boston and Los Angeles). Cassandra, uh, Webb (yes, that is her name), Constance’s healthy grown daughter, is a paramedic in the FDNY performing CPR in Queens. Her partner is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), a nice guy with a resonant name, who does not hit on her, even though she looks like that famous woman in the “Fifty Shades of Grey” movies. She describes herself as a “model foster child” and is a bit of a loner, living on her own in a walk-up in Chinatown. Cassie begins having visions that she realizes are the future being revealed to her slightly ahead of time. She will team up with three “teenagers”- disagreeable Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced, “Dora and the Lost City of Gold”), rebel Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife”) and apologetic Julia Cornwall (26-year-old Sydney Sweeney of the current hit “Anyone But You”). The women will face Sims, who hasn’t changed at all over the years and who chases them into the subway wearing a black Spidey-like suit. He wants to kill them because every night he dreams of them killing him. Written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless of Sony’s godawful “Morbius,” newcomer Claire Parker and director S.J. Clarkson (TV’s “Vinyl”), “Madame Web” is replete with execrable dialogue, crummy chases, badly conceived “visions” and a villain whose attacks don’t succeed for reasons we don’t understand. Zosia Mamet of the HBO hit “Girls” appears in a nothing role as a hacker working for Ezekiel. She can find anyone in NYC in seconds using facial recognition. Cassie watches the sublime Alistair Sim in a “A Christmas Carol” on her TV. Sweeney wears knee socks and a miniskirt and climbs up on a diner table to dance for strange, young men seated around her. Really? For the most part, “Madame Web” feels like amateur hour. It’s shoddy and inept. Johnson seems like she’s rehearsing instead of acting, and like nothing is real. It’s a weird disconnect for sure. I wish the filmmakers had followed Cassie’s maxim, “Don’t do dumb things.” The young women insist on referring to black-garbed Ezekiel as “ceiling guy.” Why is Emma Roberts in this film as Ben’s very pregnant sister? An all too-usual fate is in store for Mike Epps as a charismatic paramedic. Cassie drives the endangered girls, who bicker over an old, open bag of beef jerky, to a woodsy, woodpecker-heavy part of New Jersey in a stolen taxi and then leaves them alone in the woods for hours. We hear about “peptides” and Peruvian jungle people known as “Los Aranyos.” The screenwriters think it is clever to adapt a famous line from the original “Star Wars.” Oh, the fans will love it. Cassie finally realizes that she has a “sixth sense.” My sixth sense tells me this “Web” is going to bomb hard.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," In Sony’s quest to maintain the Spider-Man trademark, they continue milking whatever character from his universe that they can, no matter how irrelevant or nonsensical they may be. In the now established “Don’t Say Spider-Man” Spider-Man Movieverse, S.J. Clarkson directs what is essentially “Donnie Darko” but with a heavy theme about Spiders. The writers do everything they can to allude to Spider-Man and Peter Parker but, I’m assuming because of contractual stipulations, not once do we ever get to see Peter Parker or Spider-man, nor do we ever hear his name uttered. Uncle Ben does play a big role, though, because he is not canon in the MCU. “Madame Web” tells the standalone origin story of Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who develops the power to see the future… and realizes she can use that insight to change it. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies… if they can all survive a deadly present. Everything about “Madame Web” from small plot beats to major plot points is so convoluted and dull, and unnecessarily tough to keep up with. There are baffling twists and turns and nothing that ever really pays off (or will ever really pay off). We know as much as they do that there will not be a sequel. No one comes out of “Madame Web” looking pretty, as just about everyone is made to look a fool. Talented folks like Adam Scott, Sydney Sweeney, Celese O’Connor, and Isabel Merced are tasked with playing some of the dumbest, and dullest protagonists ever written. All the while the movie never really acts as an origin movie for these Spider-Women, so much as it acts as the origin for Madame Web. There is absolutely no reason why this movie should exist, and central star Dakota Johnson plays her role as if she’s always on the verge of yawning. She sleepwalks through this performance delivering every line with the competence of a porn star. It doesn’t help though that the script is a farce of terrible one-liners, awful character dynamic, and endless exposition dumps in an effort to untangle this entire narrative and transform it into something remotely coherent. So, Madame Web could predict certain events and their outcomes; how far could she foretell future events? Could she or couldn’t she change the course of events that transpire? And if she could foresee the transformation of three powerful spider-based superheroines, why couldn’t she foretell the birth of Peter Parker’s Spider-Man, or Mile Morales’ Spider-Man? Why couldn’t she tell Ben that his sister-in-law and brother would die? Did she ever find it weird Peter Parker designed his costume after Ezekiel’s? “Madame Web” might be one of the worst films of 2024 bar none, it’s one that will sadly sit alongside the pantheon of junk comic book fare like “Catwoman” and “Morbius.”",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," El desgaste que están teniendo las películas de Marvel hace mella hasta en un filme de Sony, en la que Marvel participa parcialmente. Ni Dakota Johnson, la hija de Don Johnson y Melanie Griffith, ni Sydney Sweeney, de Euphoria y en el actual éxito en los cines de Con todos menos contigo, logran salvar del desastre a Madame Web. Estamos en Nueva York, y no aparece Peter Parker, pero sí otro Parker (Ben, que era el tío). Si esto da para una secuela, o para integrar a estos personajes al multiverso arácnido, dependerá de cómo le vaya con el público. Como ya hizo con Morbius y Venom, Sony apela a individuos no demasiado protagonistas en los cómics de Marvel. Los dos mencionados y Madame Web son como personajes marginales. Pero algo ha cambiado. Si en el original Madame Web era una anciana ciega que se movía en silla de ruedas y contaba con extraños poderes psíquicos, ahora es la joven actriz de Cincuenta sombras de Grey, es paramédica y conduce una ambulancia. Cassie (por Cassandra) que experimenta visiones de cosas terribles, que están a punto de suceder, pero, y cuando hay un pero, hay esperanzas, con suficiente antelación para prevenirlas. Y si entre sus habilidades se cuenta que puede ""estar en más de un lugar al mismo tiempo"", la pregunta es ¿cómo adquirió esos poderes? Todo arranca como en Los cazadores del arca perdida, en algún lugar perdido de la selva amazónica, en Perú. No hay indios, pero Constance (Kerry Bishé) no busca otra cosa que una araña que tendría propiedades curativas. No es fácil encontrarla. Y la científica, con un embarazo de ocho meses, descree de ese mito de que por allí habitan Las Arañas, “hombres araña que corren por las copas de los árboles"". El que no cree, no sabe lo que se pierde. Todo esto es el arranque, y termina mal. Traicionada por un miembro de la expedición, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim, con un parecido tan grande a Nico Del Caño, que no pude dejar de pensar en el diputado de izquierda en toda la proyección, cada vez que aparecía), que quiere a la arañita, pero con otros fines menos benévolos, Constance es asesinada por Ezequiel allí, en medio de la jungla, no sin antes ser picada por una araña. Y las acciones se trasladan a un futuro, que en verdad es un pasado actual, porque transcurre en Nueva York, en 2003. Constance le ha transmitido los poderes de la arañita a Cassie, su hija, que ahora tiene 30 años. ¿Cómo se le despiertan las premoniciones y poderes? Tiene un accidente y muere -por unos instantes, eh, porque la película tiene que seguir- y cuando despierta, al rato nomás, ya vislumbra lo que va a pasar en un futuro inmediato. Partiendo de que las premoniciones son del tipo de la saga de Destino final, pero con menos morbo porque hay que arrear chicos a los cines, el hecho de que sea como un deja vu reiterativo hasta hace pensar en Hechizo del tiempo, El día de la marmota.

"Feb 15, 2024"," The makers of “The Marvels” need to send a gift to the team behind “Madame Web.” For a short time, it looked like last year’s offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be remembered as the company’s biggest failure. “Madame Web” is such a horrific mess that it makes “The Marvels” look like an Oscar contender. It isn’t that the writing of “Madame Web” is bad. It is not that the acting is one step above a grade school production of “Death of a Salesman.” It isn’t even the lack of good special effects, a villain that can easily be confused with Spider-Man or the odd fact it is set in 2003 for no real reason. Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) has her life as a New York paramedic disrupted when she starts seeing short glimpses into the future. The audience knows she got her strange powers when her mother was bitten by a spider during childbirth. No, it was not radioactive but that wouldn’t have been a shock considering how much the film lacks in originality. Her visions show her that three spunky teenagers – played by (a very wasted) Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced are the target of a super villain who can walk on walls and has super strength. Toss in that he is wearing a suit that looks like a ripoff of the black costume Spider-Man wore in “Spider-Man 3” and he is a walking billboard for a lack of original thinking. The best script Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and S.J Clarkson can create has the four women running, hiding, running, hiding and then stopping for dinner. The fact the three teens are being hunted is set aside while Webb jets off to Peru. There is an oddity at every turn. The film is set 20 years ago but everyone acts like it is 2024. Technology is so advanced it can do facial recognition from a drawing. And the bad guys monitor street cameras as if they are every two feet. That was not the case 20 years ago. This could be ignored if the film was not so filled with cliches and trite storylines. The “we will do this together” speech has been done in superhero movies for decades. Then there is the changing time element. A big deal is made of the fact Webb is the only person who can change time. But the entire film is based on how without Webb’s intervention, the three teens would be killed before they could become their own superheroes. Ezekiel Sims (Tahir Rahim) is a cold-blooded killer but if you believe the script, there is no way he can change his future. Having gone through its A–list of characters, the brain trust behind the latest offering based on a Marvel comic book, dips deep – very deep – into the roster of characters. While there is a general knowledge of Spider-Man or Thor in the world, it takes a true fan to remember the character of Madame Web when she first appeared in the comic book Amazing Spiderman No. 210. Even those who know the comic book version will find it odd she has gone from a senior citizen confined to a wheelchair and is now a thirtysomething paramedic as played with great dullness by Johnson. The movie shows Johnson has never met an emotion she couldn’t ignore. At least she no longer has to list “50 Shades of Grey” as the leading example of just how void her acting skills are. “Madame Web” continues the downward spiral of both Marvel movies and the 2024 film business. The only good thing that can be said is that it is not the worst film based on a Marvel comic book. It will take a mighty effort to dethrone “Morbius.” Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Feb 15, 2024"," While it's hard to feel too sorry for the multi-million-dollar superhero industrial complex, 2023 was such an annus horribilus for comic book movies that their sudden underdog status is almost endearing. At the very least, you'd hope the genre's flop era might yield the kind of imaginative filmmaking that can happen when all creative bets are off. As if to acknowledge the need for some sort of rebirth, the latest in the studio's extended Spidey series — which runs the quality gamut from Across the Spider-Verse to Morbius — takes place all the way back in good old 2003, right before superhero cinema's two-decade reign of terror gripped the multiplex. With her indie-rock bangs and skinny jeans, Fifty Shades of Gray star Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, a 30-ish paramedic zipping through post-9/11 New York to the sound of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs — right past an old-school Blockbuster and an awkwardly conspicuous Beyoncé billboard, Tobey Maguire's web-slinger presumably swinging by somewhere just out of shot. After a brush with death, Cassie starts to experience visions of the future — no, not of The Apprentice host running for US President or boot-cut jeans returning to fashion, but flash forwards in time that portend some violent, soon-to-occur event. (In what might be the movie's cleverest moment, Johnson watches a pigeon crash into her apartment window, not unlike her grandma 60 years earlier.) As we learn in a prologue set in 1973, Cassie's mother died giving birth to her daughter in the Peruvian jungle, where she'd been searching for a rare species of spider said to have magic healing properties. Saved by a mystical race of Amazonian spider-people — the kind of cartoonish Indigenous folk movies use to gift the white hero with powers — the young infant was unknowingly possessed with the insect's strange visions. But mum's already notorious companion Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim, A Prophet) stole the spider, and 30 years later he's been cursed with nightmares in which three teenage spider-girls — played by Sydney Sweeney (Anything But You), Isabela Merced (Dora and the Lost City of Gold) and Celeste O'Connor (Ghostbusters: Afterlife) — bring about his untimely death. Looking like a Sweet Valley High cosplayer at a Halloween party (and one montage away from a nerdy girl makeover), the 20-something Sweeney gets one of the movie's biggest unintentional laughs as a purportedly mousey teenager. Lucky for these very authentic high school girls, Cassie's psychic glimpses are one step ahead of the murderous Ezekiel's — and she's soon rescuing them from his evil webby clutches, drawing them into a tentative, nurturing sisterhood. Although her name sounds like a sexy CD-ROM avatar from Web 1.0, Madame Web dates back to 1980, when the character was introduced to Marvel comics as an elderly, web-dwelling mutant with clairvoyant powers. It's a cool bit of Marvel arcana from which to spin an eccentric standalone movie; throw in a little Britney Spears on the soundtrack and it all sounds pretty… fetch, right? Madame Web may well be a welcome throwback in theory, but the result is worst possible version of a superhero movie from the era — the sort of boilerplate storytelling that can't even summon the trashy, retro fun of the Venom films, let alone Sam Raimi's vibrant Spider-Man instalments. As always, Johnson has charisma to burn (if nothing else, the movie has given us her delightfully candid press tour). But her talents are no match for an abysmal screenplay — credited to director S.J. Clarkson, Claire Parker, and Morbius writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless — that fails to establish the most basic rapport between its characters. Where Cassie's den mother relationship with her teen sidekicks should be the soul of the movie, Sweeney, Merced and O'Connor's burgeoning superheroes are so hopelessly one-dimensional that you wonder whether the writers have ever encountered a teenage girl. ""Isn't it sad what happened to Martha Stewart?"" says Sweeney's future Spider-Woman at one point, referring to the cooking mogul's then-indictment on stock fraud charges — words spoken by no teenager, in 2003 or otherwise. TV veteran Clarkson directs with the visual wit of an anonymous streaming series (she previously helmed episodes of Jessica Jones and The Defenders), even managing to flub a sequence cut to Britney's all-timer Toxic — surely one of the easiest slam-dunks in movie music-cue existence. (That said, a pair of product placement moments — one right out of Wayne's World and another in which the sponsor's logo gets destroyed in a climactic battle — practically drip with cheeky, deliberate irony.) Every time the movie threatens to build momentum — the sense of relentless pursuit essential to up the characters' mortal peril — Clarkson lets the tension slacken. Like the Madame herself, the audience is always two steps ahead of the action. Instead, the movie eventually reveals itself to be yet another dreary preamble to a would-be franchise, with uncle Ben Parker (an underused Adam Scott) on reliable stand-by and his sister-in-law, Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), pregnant and about to pop — gee, wonder who that kid will turn out to be?

"Feb 15, 2024"," I realize the title to this review is going to cause some outrage. I like to believe even on bad movies people are usually still trying their best. Therefore, I did not give such a title lightly. In fact I waited several days to write the review after the embargo and release to make sure how I felt about Madame Web and that I wasn’t just feeding on internet hate and hyperbole. It’s not that it’s just a movie I dislike. That happens all the time. It’s that it is so sloppily constructed that it’s hard to justify its existence on any level. I usually try and start my reviews with some positives but with Madame Web I have very few. There are a few actors like Isabela Merced and Adam Scott who are trying their darndest with the material and a few moments of nice cinematography as well as some winks to 2003 where the movie is set. That’s about it. The script is the biggest problem with dialogue that had me howling (to myself) in my seat The story also fails to develop compelling characters who’s actions feel believable. Every flash forward is so poorly edited and constructed that it feels confusing rather than enlightening and there are often big gaps in logic or story that leave you wondering ‘how did they get here?’ or ‘how did she know that?,’ ‘has she never been in water before and if not why?’ You get the idea. The actors, who have been good in other roles, can’t save this script with Dakota Johnson making her role in Fifty Shades of Grey look like an Oscar bait film and Tahar Rahim entering the history books as one of the most poorly executed villains ever. What’s more shocking is how poorly made Madame Web is. We expect clunky dialogue these days from superhero movies but everything from the editing to the sound design to the action is sloppy! And let’s mention the product placement that had me wondering if I’d wandered into a parody film by mistake. There’s scenes in this film where a character opens a can of Pepsi right in front of the camera acting like a Price is Right model showcasing it for all to see. Then later on the climatic fight scene is literally done beneath a giant Pepsi Cola sign. I wish I was making this up. I’ve mentioned how I hate modern action movies where characters stand around staring at screens. Well, in Madame Web there is an entire character who seems to not leave the villains apartment but just stares at screen for her entire existence. The sad part about this henchman is she is played by Zosia Mamet who is so wonderful in the lead of Molli & Max In the Future– a far better film out in theaters now. When I think of the style and energy that film brought to the table on a nothing budget it’s infuriating to watch a big mess  like Madame Web. Did I mention how bad the editing is in this film? I mean come on! The trailer for this film promises aspects that aren’t really delivered like instead of a team-up movie with other spider-women it’s a teens being ordered around by a bored female mentor movie (the teens are mostly standing around waiting for things to happen to them). The villain instead of being cold and calculating is in revenge-mode for crimes that haven’t happened despite himself being a cold-blooded murderer! It makes no sense. It honestly feels like they just made it up every day they went to shoot and all the winks to Spider-man only amplify that feeling. It’s especially baffling when Sony has done such a brilliant job with their animated Spider-verse movies. They might have just as well hired Tommy Wiseau and made this one of his triumphs. At least that would have some personality. This is without a doubt the worst comic book movie since Catwoman and it may be even worse than that. As I recall that at least didn’t have ADR and visual effects problems… It’s not even fun bad. It’s just boring, lame and incompetent. Badly done Sony!! Badly done!",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," We’re currently in a moment in cinema where superhero movies are the norm. Little by little, we are beginning to witness more representation in terms of gender and ethnicity, and I can’t help but wonder if films like these are made to check off a diversity box or because they genuinely have an essential story to tell. In this case, I believe there is a little bit of both. Some situations feel a bit too convenient and don’t have any relatable elements. But in contrast, other moments felt organic and were engaging.  Cassandra Web begins to see visions of the future and doesn’t know how to deal with all the pressure and responsibility that comes with those powers. To master her new abilities, she must learn about her past to finally move on. All this sounds promising on paper, but Johnson’s performance left so much to desire. I’ll be fully transparent by admitting that I’ve never been fond of Johnson as an actress. She comes across as someone who plays her characters in a monotonous manner and doesn’t add any complexity. Her performance as Cassie further solidified my feelings and left me wondering what another actress could have better delivered. She seems unengaged and completely lacks onscreen presence, charisma, and magnetism.  It’s unfortunate because Isabela Merced, Sydney Sweeny, and Celeste O’Connor deliver solid performances and do their very best with the poor writing they were given, which brings me to the script—a poorly written screenplay filled with cringy and eye-rolling inducing dialogue. The antagonist is a power-hungry, one-dimensional villain that’s borderline comical. Several moments were handled wonderfully and even sparked some hope that this film would be a solid entry into the comic book genre, but then they were followed by poorly delivered or written interactions, and I was instantly disappointed again. One of Cassie’s special powers was the capacity to be in various places at once—a power I eagerly wish to acquire.  The film stays away from verbally hammering into its viewers that these are all women and that they too can save the world. My last disappointment is the way the “teenagers” were utilized. The trailers sold me on an action-packed film where a group of women were going to be kicking ass! But instead, I got a movie about Cassandra Web becoming a guardian to the teens and her journey in dealing with her powers— and the teens were massively underutilized. Overall, “Madame Web” fails to deliver an entertaining comic book story. With its titular performance being one note and secondary characters massively underused, this entry is another forgettable film that left me wishing I could be in two places at once.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2024"," If last year, with bombs “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “The Flash,” “Shazam 2,” “The Flash” and “The Marvels,” didn’t already prove superhero movies were on life support, then Sony’s latest dip into the pool, “Madame Web,” may have just pulled the plug. Greenlit at a time when famous actors suiting up in spandex was all the rage and when these movies could be counted on to mint at least $100 million domestic at the box office regardless of quality, “Madame Web” seems to be in a league of terrible movies all by itself. In a way, it’s commendable just how lost and out of rhythm this film is, as you can tell about midway through, everyone involved stopped caring. Hell, it’s blatantly obvious the studio executives saw an early cut and tried to “solve” the problem with reshoots. If this was the movie after it got spliced up in the editing room, I’m genuinely curious how bad it was before it got released to the public. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and credited to five (!) screenwriters, “Madame Web” is a movie that will be dissected and studied for future generations. It’s been a hoot watching the actors on the promotional circuit insist this is a standalone movie in a standalone universe, even though it’s very evident Sony is trying to juice up their own cinematic universe. (The movie features Peter Parker as a literal fetus!) And for a movie that’s called “Madame Web” and features Dakota Johnson as the main character, who in the comics is a wheelchair ridden clairvoyant who occasionally helped Spider-Man see into the future, that name is never uttered once, nor does she really do anything heroic. Hilariously, the main plot has our heroine looking after three teenagers who are in imminent danger, and she ditches them for half the movie because she needs to go explore the jungles in the Amazon because someone was researching spiders just before her mom died! (And no, that viral line heard in the trailer sadly didn’t make the final cut).  A clunky, head-scratching opening set in Peru 1973 gets the ball rolling on the absurd backstory around the main character, which may or may not have something to do with spiders and/or spider-people. Cut to 2003, Cassidy Webb is an EMT working alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott), eventual uncle to Spider-Man, where, after suffering a near death experience, uncovers the ability to see brief visions of the future. One of those glimpses involves the lives of three teens (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’ Connor) who are in the crosshairs of the villainous Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). In the comics, I’d wager Ezekiel probably had a sense of purpose or drive to what he’s doing. And it’s clear, in the previous version of this movie, that spirit may have existed. But somewhere along the lines, this character’s entire arch was completely retooled in favor of a bumbling quest to kill three teenagers because he saw a future in which they kill him. Didn’t we just see an entire prologue where he captured a powerful spider for the purpose of giving him superhuman capabilities? I feel bad for Rahim, a respectable performer, as every single line of his dialogue was poorly dubbed with the worst ADR you’ve ever heard. I’m convinced the actor’s real voice is used probably 15% of the time, and that’s being generous. As for everyone else? Gosh where do we begin. Johnson and the entire ensemble look frantic and, honestly, sort of embarrassed. The movie has no thrills or suspense and is never grounded in a way that makes its hilarious narrative logistics seem even remotely feasible. Most of the film is spent with characters driving around in taxi’s or contending with clumsy needle drops of Brittany Spears’ “Toxic” while uttering dialogue like “I just want to go home and watch Idol.” Nothing spun in “Madame Web” is derived from any real stakes and it’s filled with lousy TV-grade level special effects. Not to mention the entire climax is basically an ad for Pepsi with key dramatic moments featuring the cola’s logo. And yet, there is something oddly compelling about how awful “Madame Web” tuned out. How, in the world of studios taking tax write offs for completed projects, was this film able to see the light of day? How do you have Sydney Sweeney, one of the hottest stars on the planet, and showcase her in a Spider-Woman costume for approximately seven seconds? These are bumbling inquires that will plague the movie’s already fractured legacy. What’s even more ironic about the overall purpose of “Madame Web” is how it’s meant to establish a framework to exist within Sony’s beleaguered cinematic universe and sustain future installments. A bold strategy that will never payoff.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Can Madame Web possibly be as bad as its trailer make it look? It is. But at least it’s unintentionally hilarious, and not a completely joyless slog like Morbius, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, or just about all of the DC superhero movies of the past three years. This latest film from Sony’s wing of Marvel movies is disjointed and ugly, plagued by an action filmmaking style that’s nausea-inducing, atrocious dialogue, and a villain with no presence and unclear motivations. Madame Web is a relatively minor character from the comics, indicating that the three different studios that make multiple superhero movies each year are starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel. But the worst thing about Madame Web is the way it’s shot. During the action scenes, the camera pans and swings all over the place, in a way that makes spatial continuity and coherent storytelling a secondary concern. It just looks cheap. As for the final action scene, it’s not only nonsensical, but is meant to resemble the finale of Sam Raimi’s 2004 Spider-man 2, even set in a nearby part of Queens. The comparison isn’t favorable. The film begins 30 years before the main action with the heroine’s mother (Kerry Bishe) in the Peruvian jungle, seeking a rare spider while nine months pregnant. After she’s double-crossed by her guide Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), she dies but her baby is born, and that baby grows up to be the heroine, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson.) She’s a New York City paramedic who lives alone and remains affected by her foster-care past, seemingly having her partner (Adam Scott) as her only real friend. But after she nearly drowns, Cassie suddenly gains the ability to see a few seconds into the future, and sometimes double back and fix mistakes. Meanwhile, the evil fixer remains around, haunted by a recurring nightmare that three girls in superhero costumes (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced) are out to kill him. (He’s also got Zosia Mamet around as his computer existence, who has access to Clearview AI-style computer surveillance software that I’m sure didn’t exist 21 years ago.) The film is set in 2003 for no apparent reason, although I assume it’s because they wanted to use a particular Britney Spears song and that’s when it came out. One prevalent theory states that it was originally set in the 1990s, with the year pushed back a few years by reshoots and ADR. As for emerging A-lister Sweeney, she dresses similarly to “Baby One More Time”-era Britney, complete with schoolgirl outfit, in a couple of scenes, while playing almost a decade younger than her real age. The storytelling is convoluted when it comes to the different spiders, what powers they convey, and how they’re activated by submersion in water. Why does the villain have what looks like an evil version of Spider-man’s powers, when the heroine is so different? Don’t get me started on the scene in which Cassie teaches the three girls CPR, for no reason other than that they’ll have to use it at a crucial moment later. Speaking of Spidey, he doesn’t exist here, but the dialogue is peppered with a couple of dozen not-so-subtle references to Spider-man and the Spider-man canon, most of which draw groans. Madame Web was directed by S.J. Clarkson, best known as a director of British TV shows; she also directed that Game of Thrones prequel pilot with Naomi Watts that ended up not going forward. The film was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, men responsible for some of the worst movies of recent years (Morbius, Dracula Untold), with Clarkson and Claire Parker also credited. Dakota Johnson is a talented actress, and when she hosts Saturday Night Live, she’s very funny. But she’s chosen movie projects poorly, and lacks the ability to hide her contempt for the material when she’s interviewed about such projects. The world’s worst film analysts are going to conclude from this that there’s no interest in female-driven superhero movies and I imagine they’re going to decide that they hate Dakota Johnson, too. That’s not the problem here—the film doesn’t fit into any of the “woke” tropes, aside from women being the stars—it’s more that Madame Web has no good reason to exist.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Indeed, after watching the latest from Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, most of you will rightfully walk away thinking that Sony just really hates superhero movies, and is going out of its way to gut whatever characters it can (legally) get its hands on so as to worsen the public’s perspective on the genre, because Madame Web‘s disastrously-woven pile of flaws exceeds the descriptive limits not only of the English language, but of the very collective of contrived sound itself. Right from its passionless outset, the film’s largest, most foundational problem is made immediately apparent; the entire essence of Madame Web blows right past the cynicism and lack of confidence that we’ve come to expect from the SSU, and quite tragically operates in a state of what can only be described as self-hatred. This is a movie that’s so dangerously unconcerned with its own presentation that it was deemed acceptable to have Ezekiel Sims’ lips very clearly not match up with the words being spoken on multiple occasions (yes, that actually happens several times in the movie). Since we’re tangentially on the topic of performances now, it’s clear as day that not a single person present had any faith whatsoever in the material — and why would they? If the film’s dialogue is indeed reflective of the shooting script (which very clearly was not the same one that Dakota Johnson and company initially received), then just reading this film must no doubt have been an absolute slog and a half. To describe the performances of the four leads (including Johnson, as well as Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor) as wooden, uninspired, and without any believable chemistry isn’t inaccurate, but one struggles to imagine what they possibly could have done to make the material work at all. Tahar Rahim’s performance as the aforementioned antagonist Ezekiel, meanwhile, evokes the energy of an angsty clown fiesta at which even the cheesiest Saturday morning cartoons would sneer — but maybe that’s just what happens when your whole performance takes place in an ADR booth, as his did, by all appearances. As for the dialogue itself, it has this almost genuinely impressive ability to, scene-by-scene, manifest as the absolute worst cinematic burden it could possibly be, and then some. Whether it’s the tonally detached banter between the three Spider-Teens, Cassie Webb offering up another round of exposition that tries and fails to sound like it’s coming from a human, or all four of them reaching the peak of their interpersonal character development by way of an impromptu CPR lesson (spoiler alert, it’s not much of a peak), the film’s dialogue not only sounds and reads like a soulless Wikipedia entry, but also relentlessly boasts the intensely irritating quirk of unplugging itself from the rest of the film’s context to desperately try and prompt an unrelated reaction from the audience (the line “you won’t like me when I’m hangry” is in this movie twice, if that’s any indication to exactly how low Madame Web reaches). But, of all the symptoms that spring up directly from Madame Web‘s penchant for self-sabotage (and again, it’s genuinely difficult to tell if it was deliberate or not), the worst of them is its inability to understand any facet of what it is, and so it subsequently approaches each and every one of its scenes without the tools or coherence necessary to even make them work as individual pieces. Indeed, forget the nonsensical plot beats, the painful performances, and the dialogue that grabs your hand to lead you out of the movie whenever it can. Let’s address instead the more intrinsic “why” behind what will no doubt be remembered as a legendary fumbling of the genre; what is it about Madame Web‘s approach to the action-comedy blend so often found in most comic books movies (both good and bad) that causes it to nosedive so harshly? It’s because most all comic book movies, on some level, approach both their source and written material with a marked level of confidence; even the poorer examples like Shazam! Fury of the Gods, which spends most of its time grasping for straws, at least grasps for those straws with a very intimate zest; one that’s in harmony with an identity of some kind, and also knows what it’s going for, even if neither the identity or the goal of the film offer much in the way of artistic nutrition. Madame Web doesn’t know what straws it’s grasping for. Worse still, it doesn’t care about itself enough to even make an attempt at grasping for whatever straws may or may not have existed throughout the whole lifetime of the film’s production. Given how unique this film’s take on the character and the genre could have been, given its premise, the chief emotion that Madame Web may end up creating is anger: anger at these actresses being tricked, effectively, by the initial promise of a better script (because it certainly couldn’t have been worse); anger at how carelessly these characters are being treated by a company that has to know, at this point, that they’re no match for its older, Disney-backed cousin; and anger at how poorly-treated the film has been, by sufficiently complicit suits and hacks, that it wound up on the big screen in the state that it did. Indeed, it’s not Madame Web itself that should be the target of the anger, but rather the specific parameters of the spaces it inhabited prior to its release, and the forces that allowed it to be the blight on cinema that it is. All-in-all, what else is there to say? Madame Web is a notoriously foul piece of work, and my heart genuinely goes out to all who were, are, and will be affected by it — whether that’s an honest artist or technician who didn’t know what they were getting into, those involved with the creation of the original comic book character who now have to see Madame Web be the laughingstock of pop culture for a hot minute, or any future audience member bent on getting a first-hand reading on the film’s failures, and thereafter feels their already non-existent expectations all but implode. It’s truly a dark day for superhero movies.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," “Madame Web,” a new Spider-Man spinoff starring Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney, and now playing in theatres, is a superhero origin story that actually becomes less interesting once the man character’s powers kick in. The story begins in the Peruvian Amazon where pregnant arachnologist Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) and explorer Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) are hunting for a rare spider whose venom can cure diseases. Upon discovery, Ezekiel decides he wants the spider all for himself, and shoots Constance, leaving her for dead. Before she passes away, however, she is bitten by the magical spider and gives birth to a daughter. Cut to thirty years later. It’s 2003, and Ezekiel is now wealthy beyond imagination, with powers derived from the Peruvian spider venom. But with the good comes the bad. He is plagued by visions of his own murder by teenagers Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced). In another part of New York, Constance’s daughter has grown up to be socially awkward paramedic Cassandra Webb (Johnson). A near death experience, coupled with the injection of spider venom from her mom, has left her with the ability to see into the future. When she has a premonition of Ezekiel murdering the trio of teens on a train, she steps in to help. “If you want to live,” she says, “you have to trust me.” To fully understand why Ezekiel wants the three women dead, Casandra must learn to control her new powers. To do that, she must look to the past, and her mother’s work in the Amazon. Like a lot of people who follow this kind of thing, I saw the on-line “Madame Web” news and its star, Dakota Johnson’s endlessly meme-able press tour. I thought the chatter was entertaining, and Dakota’s interviews may one day become the stuff of internet lore. Flippant, disinterested and outspoken, her press interviews probably gave the studio a headache, but likely made her fans happy for their unfiltered honesty. After having seen the film, it is my solemn duty to let you know that the interviews are more entertaining than anything in the movie she was out there promoting. I was intrigued that “Madame Web’s” story was not another caped superhero saves the world tale. Origin stories should keep the action personal, allowing us to get to know the character before they set off on grand, planet changing adventures. But origin stories are tough. The stories have to do the heavy lifting with exposition while keeping the movie moving along. “Madame Web” gets bogged down with tedious repeating of what is to come, comedy moments, some intentional, some not, that don’t land, and weirdly disengaged direction and performances. It may have worked if the stakes weren’t so low. Ezekiel, the villain, while ill-tempered and creepy, doesn’t seem to pose THAT much of a threat. He does have a cool villain’s lair, what little we see of it anyway, and has power and money, but he isn’t that hard to thwart, and great villains should at last appear to be unthwartable (I know that’s not a word, but it seemed appropriate here). Even the action scenes seem listless. They harken back to the bad old days of “Catwoman” and “Daredevil.” No huge stakes, unless you are the Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens, New York. That thing takes a beating. I know the movie is set in 2003, but the action doesn’t feel like a tribute to the shooting style and CGI of the era, it just feels dated. By the time the end credits roll, you’ll wish you had the power to see into the future, like Cassandra Webb, so you’d know to skip this one.

"Feb 15, 2024"," There was a time, not so long ago, when every Hollywood actor – A-Lister or aspiring – wanted to be in a superhero movie. At the height of its success, the genre made superstars out of up-and-coming performers including Chris Evans, Brie Larson and Chris Pratt, to the extent it seemed almost a rite of passage to play a role – hero or villain – in a Marvel or DC project. But lately it’s felt like the bubble is close to bursting. Since Avengers: End Game concluded Marvel’s Infinity Saga in 2019, the studios have seen diminishing box office returns (still obscene numbers, but not as lucrative as they had hoped) and increasing pushback from the critical sphere. Even the fans, usually reliably sympathetic to the cause, have been expressing their growing ambivalence, while stars such as Robert Downey Jr – whose career was revitalised and arguably defined for a decade by Iron Man – expressing, if not regret, a certain happiness to be out of the superhero churn. Not a great time to be launching new superhero projects then. In sharp contrast to Marvel, Sony have been trying to get their own Extended Universe off the ground for a while. Piggybacking off the success of their Spider-Man films (some of which have been made in collaboration with Marvel) they have been plundering the depths of Webslinger lore for potential gold. The animated Spiderverse films have proven highly successful, and even the Venom films, starring Tom Hardy, have been lucrative if not critically divisive. But Morbius, released in 2021, was a critical and commercial flop (and an embarrassment, as online trolls managed to convince Sony to put it back in cinemas through a meme campaign, only for it to flop again on rerelease). Their 2024 hopes lie with Spidey villain spin-off Kraven the Hunter (pushed back from 2023 to this summer) and Madame Web, loosely based on various iterations of Spider-Woman. When the first trailer for the film dropped towards the end of 2023 it was widely panned online for its dodgy-looking effects and star Dakota Johnson’s flat line delivery, possessing all the enthusiasm of a teenager reluctantly cast in a school production of Death of a Salesman. While social media buzz can build hype for a film, the public ridicule aimed at Madame Web did not bode well for Sony’s efforts at firmly establishing a live-action Spiderverse. It’s difficult to say why Dakota Johnson took the role of Cassie Webb, an orphan who discovers she possesses clairvoyant powers and must use them to protect three teenage girls from grave danger. Perhaps Johnson’s agent felt she should do a superhero movie as many of her peers have – a sort of acting box-ticking exercise. It’s the sort of move that would have made sense a decade ago when Johnson was fresh off her Fifty Shades of Grey contract. Now, best loved for her deadpan press appearances and wry turns in various indie projects, it’s a little more perplexing that Johnson would see Madame Web as a great career opportunity. Certainly it can’t have been the script that reeled her in, flat and lifeless as it is, consisting largely of characters worriedly delivering lines of exposition to each other and a few lacklustre fight scenes. Equally lost are Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor, who play Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin, the teenagers who are targeted by nefarious Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) who has prophetic visions of them killing him sometime in his future. They don’t yet possess their spider-powers – the film offers no indication of when they will get them either – so the film largely revolves around Cassie playing an arduous game of keep-away as she tries to conceal the teens from Ezekiel’s wrath. Meanwhile, the film attempts to connect itself to the Spiderverse with the inclusion of Peter Parker’s uncle Ben (Adam Scott) who works with Cassie, and his sister-in-law Mary (Emma Roberts). Mary is pregnant during the film, and it’s strongly implied the baby is the future Peter Parker. Still, the film stops short of actually saying this (perhaps due to past complications Sony has faced around connecting their standalone projects to their Marvel collaborations). Sony may decree that Madame Web actually takes place in an alternate dimension to the Tom Holland Spider-Man films, because that seems to be the move whenever a studio creates a superhero that is less successful than they predicted. Yet these corny attempts at worldbuilding all feel incredibly lazy, neither committed enough for Spider-Man die-hards nor intriguing enough for casual fans. A scene in which Cassie travels to Peru to seek answers about her spider powers is laughably old-fashioned, while the film’s shoddy editing and constant spinning camerawork only serve to make the audience feel as if they have contracted acute vertigo. With its 2003 setting, Madame Web is technically a modern period piece, but aside from a clumsy scene where a radio DJ remarks “This song is gonna be huge!” as he plays Britney Spears’ Toxic, there’s precious little about the film that makes it feel like it’s set 20 years in the past. “They can track you through those now,” One character says nervously as another pulls out her cell phone. Meanwhile, the villains have access to a live, hi-tech surveillance system that covers the entire New York and New Jersey area with facial recognition software. This is supposed to be 2003. There’s just something gratingly cheap about the affair, from script to cinematography to performances, as if no one involved wanted to be there. Johnson sleepwalks through her scenes, radiating indifference, while her three teenage accomplices are interchangeable and Rahim’s Big Bad is a generic moustache-twirling bore. If there’s one positive, it’s that Madame Web is so completely forgettable, it’s unlikely to do any damage to the cast’s career prospects going forward. It should, however, give Sony pause for thought about what exactly their game plan is going forward, and if this path of giving every Spider-Man B-character their own film is really something anyone, fan or not, really wants.

"Feb 15, 2024"," “Madame Web” es la más reciente entrega del SPUMM (Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Movies), o como se le está diciendo recientemente, el SSMU (Sony’s Spider-man Universe). En todo caso, el nombre no importa. Lo que tenemos acá, junto a películas como las de “Venom”, “Morbius” (ugh), o la próxima a estrenarse “Kraven el Cazador”, es un universo de PERSONAJES del mundo de Spider-man… pero sin Spider-man. Curioso, considerando que el origen de Venom, por ejemplo, está casi siempre ligado al famoso Hombre Araña, o que personajes como Madame Web muchas veces cumplen el rol de antagonista para dicho super héroe. Interesante, pues, que hayan decidido desarrollar este universo de películas de Spider-man sin Spider-man. Al inicio, parecía que la idea no era del todo mala; después de todo, la primera “Venom” fue un éxito de taquilla inesperado. Pero ahora que hemos llegado a “Madame Web”, la gasolina se acabó. El éxito no podría estar más lejos. Y por más de que incluyan incontables referencias a personajes más interesantes o populares, filmes como este simplemente no pueden alcanzar el mismo éxito que las producciones protagonizadas por el Hombre Araña. “Madame Web” termina siendo, pues, de lo peorcito que ha producido Sony… aunque sigue siendo mejor que “Morbius”. Solo por el reparto (prefiero mil veces a Dakota Johnson que al insufrible de Jared Leto), y por poquito, pero algo es algo. “Madame Web” se lleva a cabo en el 2003 (por alguna razón), y tiene como protagonista a Cassie Webb (Johnson), una paramédica trabajando en Nueva York. Como nos enteramos en un torpísimo prólogo, su madre murió en la selva peruana (¡¡!!) mientras investigaba a un tipo de araña con supuestas propiedades curativas, y Cassie nació ahí (lo cual hace que, técnicamente, sea peruana… HUH). En el presente, sin embargo, Cassie no está interesada en nada de eso… hasta que sufre un terrible accidente en el trabajo, quedando con el corazón detenido por tres minutos luego de ahogarse en un río. Al ser revivida, los poderes de Cassie despiertan, haciendo que pueda ver diferentes versiones de un futuro inmediato. Es así que termina protegiendo a un trío de chicas que, eventualmente (pero no esta película) se convertirán en superheroínas: la Julia Cornwall de Sydney Sweeney (inocente y distraída), la Anya Corazón de la peruana Isabela Merced (un poco pesada, al menos al inicio), y la Mattie Franklin de Celeste O’Connor (rebelde y avezada). Resulta que tanto ellas como Cassie están siendo perseguidas por Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), un ex compañero de la madre de Cassie, que ahora cuenta con los poderes de la ya mencionada araña, y viste un traje similar al de Spider-man (como para engañar a los “geeks”). Como se imaginarán, las chicas tendrán que averiguar qué está pasando, y tratar de sobrevivir a los ataques de Sims. Es así, pues, que “Madame Web” se convierte en una de las historias de origen más innecesarias que haya tenido el infortunio de ver. Ahora, técnicamente cualquier historia puede ser buena si es construida con cuidado, y en el caso específico de los blockbusters de superhéroes, si se le da más énfasis al trabajo de personajes y al desarrollo de la narrativa, que los “easter eggs” para fans. Pero como se deben imaginar, ese no es el caso acá. “Madame Web” cuenta con agujeros lógicos más grandes que el Amazonas, y conceptos que me sorprende ninguno de sus CUATRO guionistas (¡¡!!) haya cuestionado. Es decir, la cinta se siente como hecha a la volada, como si la gente responsable de producirla se hubiese visto obligada a trabajar con una premisa en la que no estaba particularmente interesada. Consideren, si no, que la araña del Amazonas peruano le otorgó poderes a una tribu local que se llama… LAS ARAÑAS (qué original, en serio). Y que su mayor representante, por razones que jamás entenderé… es un hombre claramente NO latino que habla inglés. O consideren, también, que ni Sweeney ni Merced ni O’Connor hacen nada importante hasta literalmente el final. En serio; son más objetos que tienen que ser protegidos por Cassie que verdaderos personajes, con poca iniciativa, cero poderes, y una pizca de desarrollo de personajes. Lo cual es una pena, porque por alguna razón, Madame Web cuenta con un reparto envidiable. De hecho, es gracias a dicho reparto, principalmente, que la película no aburre, y que termina cansando un poco en vez de molestar o frustrar. Dakota Johnson resalta como Cassie, por ejemplo, desarrollándola como una mujer fuerte, sarcástica, y dispuesta a salvar y proteger a otros (por algo la hicieron paramédica). Adam Scott hace lo que puede con un rol francamente ingrato, al igual que Emma Roberts, y Tahar Rahim es suficientemente intimidante como Sims. Y de las chicas, quienes destacan más son Isabela Merced como Anya (orgullo peruano) y Celeste O’Connor como Mattie (la más rebeldona de las tres). A Sydney Sweeney, desgraciadamente, la han dado un rol súper soso, por lo que la mayor parte del tiempo se le confunde con el decorado. Una verdadera pena. En fin. Si me dieran a escoger entre ver “Morbius” o “Madame Web”, escogería a la segunda, y solo porque el reparto hace lo que puede con un guion infame. Pero por más de que la película cuente con algunos planos bien planteados y secuencias de acción cumplidoras, simplemente nunca logra justificar su propia existencia. Entre la narrativa torpe con demasiadas escenas de exposición (el prólogo es injustificable), los efectos visuales que parecen haber sido sacados, apropiadamente, de una película del 2003 (con dobles digitales poco convincentes y todo), y el abuso de zooms abruptos y cámaras nerviosas en las escenas de acción, “Madame Web” cansa en vez de entretener. No creo que los fans de los cómics salgan satisfechos, y el público casual no hará más que preguntarse cuál es el punto de todo esto. Francamente, creo que no lo hay, y ya es tiempo de que Sony se dé cuenta de ello. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Eschewing comics history, the film ditches the blind, elderly wheelchair user as she first appeared in favour of Johnson’s socially anxious take on the character. Her hitherto hidden abilities unlocked following a freak accident, Cassie finds herself entangled in the lives of three teenagers (played by Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor,and Sydney Sweeney) and their would-be killer, sinister Spider-person Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim). Director S.J. Clarkson won’t be held back by the lack of actual Spider-Man in her Spider-film, throwing all manner of webslingers at the wall to see what sticks. In addition to Web(b), Ezekiel, and a tribe of Spider-Men, this includes three future Spider-Women and Uncle Ben too (Adam Scott, bringing charisma sorely lacking elsewhere). While the visuals are refreshingly clean and grounded for a modern superhero film, the story is bogged down by exposition and egregious product placement. Its genre aspirations are admirable – slasher callbacks and a cute Final Destination 2 homage – but it’s hard to shake the sense that it’s more interested in shilling a well-known fizzy-drinks brand. What’s more, any character development feels unearned, not to mention ill-served by the generally poor performances. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Madame Web emphasizes a lot on the déjà vu experience. That means we will see a lot of scenes where the main character’s precognitive ability (Dakota Johnson’s Cassandra Webb a.k.a. Cassie) can see the future before it happens. With her clairvoyant-like power, the same scenes will be repeated twice. Yes, they are redundant and what’s worst about them is S.J. Clarkson’s penchant for shooting her movie in a disoriented way. It’s like she wants us to inhabit Cassie’s perplexing state. Well, that’s understandable but at the same time, the over-reliance on disjointed editing and fast-moving camerawork meant to mirror Cassie’s experience grows more distracting than immerses us — at least for me — deeply into her character’s point-of-view. Before I go further, here’s what Madame Web is all about. The movie begins with a 1973-set prologue in the Peruvian Amazon jungle as we learn about the pregnant scientist Constance (Kerry Bishé) is determined to find a rare spider with explorer Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) by her side. The spider in question happens to have a special healing power but Ezekiel, however, has other ulterior motives. Cut to the present day, well, in 2003, the movie introduces Constance’s adult daughter Cassie working as an FDNY paramedic alongside her colleague, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). One day during an emergency rescue that ends with Cassie stuck inside a car nosedives into the river, she suffers not only a near-death experience but also awakens with a strange set of premonitions. While she tries to make sense of her newfound ability, it is a matter of time before she sees the vision of three teenagers — Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) — being killed by a mysterious man in a black Spider-Man-like suit. That man would be Ezekiel, whose clairvoyance keeps bothering him about the three future Spider-Women going to stop him one day. So, the rest of the movie is about Ezekiel’s determination to find these three teenagers at all costs with the help of Amaria (Zosia Mamet), a tech-savvy assistant responsible for keeping an eye on their whereabouts using the surveillance video system. Cassie, in the meantime, is reluctant to keep the three teenagers from harm. And ironically, the word “reluctant” fits well with Dakota Johnson’s impassive acting which makes me feel like she’s doing this for the sake of a paycheck. Her flat dialogue is reminiscent of reading the lines from a cue card. It doesn’t help either when her interaction with the three teenagers is devoid of substantial character development. It’s hard to root for them and frankly, I barely care whether they can make it alive because the stakes are depressingly low and Tahar Rahim’s antagonist turn as Ezekiel Sims doesn’t come across as a formidable villain. The three teenagers played by Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced hardly make any lasting impressions here with their mediocre performances. S.J. Clarkson, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Morbius (!) scribes Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless and television executive producer Claire Parker, relies heavily on tedious exposition dumps to move the story forward. The added clunky dialogue makes things worse, coupled with the erratic pacing and incomprehensible action set pieces are a series of splitting headaches. The needle drops, particularly the use of Britney Spears’s “Toxic” in the nighttime diner scene are awkwardly misplaced. If you keep track of the entertainment news, S.J. Clarkson once made the headlines as the first female director to helm the untitled Star Trek 4 but the project failed to see the light of day. Imagine the inferiority she might bring to that franchise if the project remains with her on board, especially given the piss-poor result seen in Madame Web. Madame Web is currently on my list as one of the worst movies I have seen in 2024 so far. Like the horrendous Morbius two years ago, this embarrassing failure sure feels like revisiting the nightmare of 2000s-era bad superhero movies.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," With the rise of popularity and commercial success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a new boom of cinematic shared universes hit theaters with many hoping to capture even a sliver of the success found by Marvel. For a variety of reasons, this experiment was largely a failed endeavor with many attempts calling it quits rather early, perhaps the most iconic example being Universal's Dark Universe which called it quits after a disastrous single film after an extensive PR push and promise of what was to come. It is almost commendable in a way to see which of these attempts have pushed on, even in the face of commercial and box office failure. With the DCEU calling it quits last year to focus on a new start under the hand of James Gunn, this moves Sony's Spider-Man Universe up a position when it comes to superhero-shared universes. After taking 2023 off following the largely disastrous review of Morbius in 2022, the SSU is back in full force for 2024 with a whopping 3 feature releases, starting with S. J. Clarkson's Madame Web.  Set in 2003, Madame Web follows a paramedic named Cassie (Dakota Johnson) who begins to have short visions of the future. These visions lead her to three teenage girls named Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced) who have a mysterious man chasing them trying to kill them. This man is an explorer named Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) who has a history with Cassie's mother, joining her on an expedition to Peru right before her death while she was still pregnant with Cassie. Still trying to figure out her powers, Cassie has to figure out a plan to protect these girls and figure out what Ezekiel wants before he can make the kill. While critically mixed, the SSU has provided a certain type of dumb fun rarely seen in mainstream films up to this point, but Madame Web loses even this defense instantly becoming one of the worst films of the year. Incredibly boring and incoherent, Madame Web is a film that gives no energy to logic or direction. Dissecting the film bit by bit, perhaps the most confusing failure within the feature is its shortcomings as a superhero feature. The superhero narrative has been done to death over the last couple of decades with many of the tropes and expectations coming with the layout feeling contrived and predictable. Madame Web not only wanders through a stale formula but does it particularly poorly.  One of the biggest faults for the character is that her powers, quite frankly, translate horribly to the big screen, at least in the film's portrayal of them. The editing from Leigh Folsom Boyd is consistently rough, more on that in a moment, but the visual designs given to bringing Cassie's developing powers to life are genuinely headache-inducing. Rushed flashes of light and cuts feel disorienting and cheap. It doesn't help that her powers consistently make no sense with the logic of how they work changing with every scene, none of which feels that compelling or exciting. When it comes time for the film's action, a fundamental flaw is found within these powers. To defeat her enemies, Cassie has to simply follow her visions, showing no agency or effort beyond following what is given to her. Traditionally, a hero will show tenacity and effort to accomplish their goals, creating a compelling character that the audience wants to root for. Because of the nature of Cassie's power, this effort is never seen and the weight of the action sequences fall apart as a result. Without getting into spoilers, it also needs to be noted that the promoted realization of Spider-Woman as a character is an embarrassingly cheap tactic to get audiences into the theater by promising something not really within the feature. Anyone going to the film to see these characters in action is sure to be disappointed. On the other side of the battle, Ezekiel is a tremendously shallow villain with the weakest of motivations. This lack of depth and effectiveness is not only seen in the roles these characters play in terms of the superhero fights but also in their personalities throughout the film. Outside of incredible basic motivations and backgrounds, the characters throughout the feature lack identity and feel like shells of real humans. This lack of thought and effort translates also the the actual narrative and drama of the feature. Not only is the film hollow, but it is completely illogical at every turn. While fantastical in a way that naturally abandons reality, the film doesn't even attempt to have character choices or even simply world dynamics make any sense with this being so distracting that it feels impossible to lose oneself in the actual journey of the film. This journey doesn't even try to set up the story to make the emotional climax at the end feel justified with the grand conclusion to the film scratching an itch never present in the runtime before it. To bring the 2003 setting to life, the film also has an obnoxious habit of throwing references to the era in your face in a contrived fashion, a particular standout for me is a massive ad for Beyoncé's Dangerously in Love album.  On a basic filmmaking level, Madame Web manages to find new lows even beyond the already-mentioned failures. The visuals are atrocious with horribly mashed-together edits and lazy visuals that never hold any sense of awe or imagination. The film doesn't even try with much of its ADR creating some of the most embarrassing sequences of any major release, especially when it comes to Rahim's performance with his dialogue legitimately not even somewhat matching up with the movement of his mouth. While there are many terrible films each year, the vast majority can at least hold themselves to a basic filmmaking standard, something Madame Web fails with. While many praised the studio for utilizing a smaller $80 million budget, in the context of what these types of releases normally are budgeted at, it is clear Madame Web suffers from a lack of both resources and care on every level. If there was one decently ok portion of the film, it would be in its performances. While predictably Dakota Johnson overall struggles to find her footing in a heroic lead role such as this, despite a few stronger comedic lines, the rest of the cast is aggressively fine. Adam Scott plays his part well as Cassie's co-worker who gets brought into the conflict within the feature while Sweeney, O'Connor, and Merced show basic hints at possible chemistry moving forward. Rahim seems to have potential as a villain, but again his performance is completely undercut by the film's horrific production value. However, even if this wasn't the case it is almost a guarantee that his performance would be broken apart by the film's awful dialogue to reduce any larger chance for impact or success.  Even in the context of the SSU, Madame Web is one of the worst main release disasters in recent memory. Not only is the film boring, hollow, and incompetently stupid, but the feature can't even put in the effort to achieve basic filmmaking norms, delivering a final product that is genuinely embarrassing for all parties involved. While the trailer and promotion for the film were worthy of memes, the final feature doesn't even deserve that fate and instead should be avoided by all.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Even after recent superhero movies have lowered standards, Madame Web is among the worst adaptations of a Marvel Comic ever made. Another entry in Sony’s Spider-Man spinoff universe—including Venom (2018) and its 2021 sequel, Morbius (2022), and coming soon, Kraven the Hunter—the movie is a spectacular mess. Dakota Johnson, playing an obscure and lesser-known character in Spider-Man lore, stars as a New York paramedic who develops spider-based precognitive abilities, giving her the foresight to protect three future superheroes from a dastardly spider-centric villain. But nearly everything about the production—the performances, character development, screenplay, camera movements, and editing—suggests those involved had other things on their minds besides telling a good story. They were probably busy fulfilling the demands of a corporation determined to squeeze every drop of potential out of their intellectual property. So, it’s less about thoughtfully translating a character to the big screen than supplying companies such as Pepsi with a place to hang their product placements and commercial tie-ins. The movie plays like the chaotic result of copious notes from executives and marketing committees, while director S. J. Clarkson’s work alongside three other credited writers feels beside the point. Unlike the protagonist, whose second sight allows her to make choices to select the best possible future, the filmmakers have little creative wiggle room. Everyone involved is adhering to the blueprint, no doubt based on an algorithmic model capable of predicting maximum audience satisfaction, and then informed by an AI screenplay analysis tool that determines whether the product will earn a positive return on Sony’s $80 million investment. Madame Web may look quite good on paper according to this hypothetical AI software. But, as with most Hollywood formulas, the details matter. And anyone who’s used AI in creative matters knows there’s always something not quite right about the result. Unfortunately, few of the details here coalesce into a coherent or compelling structure; instead, it’s embarrassing from start to finish. With a level of superhero storytelling not seen since the early 2000s, Madame Web takes place, curiously enough, in 2003. Looking back, the superhero movies of that year include Ang Lee’s Hulk, the Ben Affleck version of Daredevil, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And it’s as though Clarkson—who makes her feature debut after an impressive career directing television—watched each disastrous example for inspiration. A prologue set in the Peruvian jungle in 1973 establishes that Cassie Webb is born after her mother (Kerry Bishé), who was researching rare spiders, dies in childbirth. Thirty years later, Cassie (Johnson) drives ambulances with her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). During a rescue, she falls into the river while inside a car, and her near-death experience activates something in her mind—she can now see brief glimpses of possible futures, which register as déjà vu at first. Part of what she sees is Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a mysterious man in a Spider-Man-esque suit, killing off three future Spider-Women—Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced), who, at present, are still powerless teenagers. Cassie resolves to intervene and help the girls with her clairvoyant powers. The setup draws inspiration from science-fiction concepts established in Philip K. Dick’s literature about predestination versus determinism, albeit without the author’s intelligence or vision. Similar to the protagonist in Dick’s novel The World Jones Made or the short story “The Minority Report” (both from 1956), Cassie can see various possibilities before they happen and make the perfect decision for the moment to thwart Ezekiel. But Madame Web’s characters, narrative, and execution fail to make the idea compelling. The teens, each with absent parents like Cassie, rely on her as a makeshift denmother and protector. They’re rambunctious and irresponsible, but they’re little more than three damsels whose eventual roles as Spider-Women remain unrealized. Johnson plays Cassie with a flatness that suggests she’s going through the motions for her paycheck, which will sustain her until she can do something more meaningful with Luca Guadagnino or some other more artistically inclined filmmaker.  Meanwhile, the villain’s motivations are murky at best. Performed by the French actor Tahar Rahim with a baffling accent, most of which sounds ADRed, Ezekiel wants the girls dead because he has seen his grim future where the Spider-Women eventually kill him—though, there’s no further explanation. Aside from wanting to forestall his death, what Ezekiel plans to achieve with his vague powers is unclear. What is his evil Master Plan, and why were the future Spider-Women attacking him? We never find out. Similarly, some Peruvian spider-guy explains to Cassie that her mind has “infinite potential,” but the full scope of her powers feels unclear. And the flash-forwards to Spider-Women never allude to how they gained their powers, nor the nature of their abilities (they use energy blasts and robo-arms). In this, the movie expects comic-savvy audiences to come equipped with that knowledge, leaving everyone else thoroughly confused. Besides plot details, the emotional beats, too, never land. Take the tension between Cassie and her mother, whom she resents for her absence. Cassie’s sense of abandonment isn’t established enough to pay off emotionally when she reconciles with her mother later in the Spider Realm (or whatever it’s called).  Also oppressively confusing is Madame Web’s visual execution. Although some brief nods to Martin Scorsese’s frenzied ambulance drama Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and Steven Spielberg’s prescient Minority Report (2002) suggest there was some intention behind the aesthetic, the rest is jumbled. Cinematographer Mauro Fiore uses upside-down and twisting camera movements to enliven the proceedings, but there’s no consistent use of them, making each choice feel impulsive and flailing. Editor Leigh Folsom Boyd adopts the motif of broken glass to evoke a spider’s web, working in fractured images and shard-like film segments, and she presents them in a jarring succession of cuts framed by embarrassingly bad CGI webs. The brief glimpses of the future Spider-Women look downright silly, too, as though the filmmakers resolved to use 2003-era technology to render them. The chases and fights prove mostly unintelligible, and since the viewer is strained to care about anything happening onscreen, the action feels even more hollow than it looks.  When the climactic battle unfolds against the neon Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens, it’s unmistakable that Madame Web exists as a product first and a commercial artwork second. That bitter pill might be easier to swallow if the outcome weren’t so incompetent. This manner of lazy, slipshod filmmaking plays only to a shut-your-brain-off-and-enjoy-it audience, uncritical of Hollywood delivering superhero movies of the lowest possible quality. But even on those resigned terms, it’s insulting. There’s no care or passion behind it, making similar products from the MCU and DCEU seem like fine art by comparison. Madame Web doesn’t even have the courtesy of being passively awful; it’s an active, incessant loathsomeness that permeates almost every scene and twists the viewer into knots for the torturous 116-minute runtime. And when it’s not naggingly dreadful, it’s simply not entertaining, not even ironically so, which may be its worst characteristic of all.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," “Bob Marley: One Love” is both entertaining and disappointing at the same time. The late reggae icon’s music propels what is otherwise a very bland reenactment of segments of his life. You can’t blame Kingsley Ben Adir who is fine in the title role and the soundtrack is engaging, but the movie’s awkward structure prevents “Bob Marely: One Love” from gaining any potential dramatic momentum. One thing about the new Marvel superhero opus “Madame Web” is “You’ve seen it all before.” Dakota Johnson is passable in the origin story of a woman with the ability to see short spans into the future. She and some innocent teens are hunted by a power-hungry villain, played by Tahar Rahim, who’s horribly miscast. I see the future of “Madame Web” and it’s going nowhere. Don’t see the lush French historical romance “The Taste of Things” on an empty stomach. The first 20 minutes consists of the loving preparation of mouth-watering gourmet meals. Juliette Binoche stars in the romantic tale of a cook and the renowned chef she works for, set in the late 1800s. “The Taste of Things” is sophisticated and tasty. As Whitney Houston once sang, “Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.” That seems to be the sentiment behind Jennifer Lopez’s phantasmagorical mini-movie musical, “This Is Me…Now: A Love Story,” now on Amazon Prime. It’s a self-produced and financed vanity project, filled with celebrity cameos, that serves to promote the singer/songwriter/dancer’s latest album. It’s an imaginative series of music videos strung together into the loose-fitting story of a hopeless romantic constantly in search of love. It’s one odd duck of a movie, but an engaging one.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 15, 2024"," While the comic book genre has been around for quite some time, there was no metric in place to expect the pop culture explosion that landed at cinephiles feet over the past decade. While the likes of Superman ’78 and Batman ’89 showed the potential success of the genre, 2008-2022 showed studios that the ideology of “if you build it, they will come” held as comic book properties of little to no prior fame or popularity were released and despite the quality would always garner a substantial box office. As 2023 arrived, things began to change as most comic-book films flopped critically and financially, leading to the question, “Have we finally hit the over-saturation of the genre?” To some, that answer was yes, even before 2023, but when it was affecting the bottom line, it was quite an eye-opening year for the genre. What were once event films became chore-like entities that needed a revamp. Would the first entry in the 2024 slate provide the revamp cinephiles were looking for? Unfortunately, Madame Web is a tangled web of disappointment and frustration. It is a soulless cash grab that echoes memories of Catwoman, Daredevil, and Elektra as not just one of the worst films within the genre but the bottom of the barrel in the Sony-verse. The story of Madame Web revolves around a girl named Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Johnson), who has to confront her past when she finds out that her mother was researching spiders in the Amazon just before her death. With this discovery, Cassie must protect three teenagers who have superhero-like abilities from a person from the past who is trying to harm them. Madame Webb‘s screenplay fails the film dramatically as Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and S.J Clarkson’s script could be more coherent. In their efforts to reimagine The Terminator in comic book movie form, the script ultimately is a convoluted chore. The lackluster screenplay leads to cinephile “secondhand embarrassment” as the film is a cacophony of clichés and cringe-worthy dialogue wrapped in a thinly veiled attempt at obtained action, but in turn, is a cliched execution thought to be a thing of comic book movie past. Failing to weave a compelling story leads to underwhelming performances across the board. While the dynamic between Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced was the film’s highlight, Dakota Johnson struggles to inject any life into Cassie that would allow any investment into her story. While Adam Scott is wasted, seeing him on the big screen is always nice. The film’s ultimate failure falls at the feet of Tahar Rahim’s Ezekiel Sims. Not only is it one of the worst villains in comic book movie lore, but it’s also one of the worst performances. I failed to engage with any of Rahim’s choices as a “villain of the week” from the Smallville days would have been better suited in Madame Web.  While the VFX in comic book films has been critiqued over the past few years, the film doesn’t help that narrative as the CGI would fall in line with a low-budget 90’s comic book films; I’m looking at you, Fantastic Four ’94. With noticeable green screen work, every visual aspect of Madame Web feels like it was thrown together at the last minute with no regard for quality. Ultimately, Madame Web is a tangled mess whose lasting impression and lesson is that only some comic book properties must be adapted. To make matters worse, the line from the trailer that became a meme, “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,” was not even in the film. The 2024 slate within the genre is off to a shaky start.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Whenever a movie like Madame Web comes around that no one expects to be any good and thus everyone feels okay poo-pooing, it’s in my nature to stand up for it in some way; to find that one good thing which everyone should consider before dismissing it outright. I went into Madame Web with confidence that it couldn’t be all bad, and with expectations in check, it might even be enjoyable. Yet within minutes I realized this task would be in vain. The latest entry from the Sony superhero canon is not bad in the way the typical superhero movies can be bad. It’s bad in whole new ways — ways that I found to be shocking, and that the audience found consistently risible.  Wait! That’s it! That’s the silver lining! The one good thing about Madame Web is that its unintentional comedy hit ratio is as high as many intentionally comedic movies. Be it a wonky line reading, a ridiculous plot development, or the fact that the villain’s performance is almost entirely ADRed (and quite sloppily, I might add), Madame Web consistently evokes laughter, which is fun if you can get past how interminably boring it is overall.  The film takes place in a different universe than the MCU, and it’s unclear whether or not it is meant to connect to the short-lived Amazing Spider-Man series. This is ostensibly a standalone origin story for the titular hero, but that doesn’t prevent the script from being wishy washy about it. Minor spoiler alert: Uncle Ben is a character in this movie, played by Adam Scott, and his sister is currently with child. Who could that be? Madame Web dances around saying Peter Parker’s name outright, going so far as to have a baby shower where they play a name guessing game that ends before anyone guesses correctly. I’m not joking.  Madame Web is set in 2003, but it’s pretty clear that this timeframe was decided after the fact, and the film was originally supposed to be set in the ‘90s. I imagine this decision was made to divorce the narrative from any currently-existing Spider-Man cinema. It makes for a wonky version of 2003 New York where no one has a cell phone, the internet is something only supervillains have, and Britney Spears is considered a brand new artist by radio DJs when introducing a needle drop of Toxic, a song that was released at the height of the pop-star’s fame. There’s even a gigantic billboard of Beyoncé’s Dangerously In Love that is so clearly a digital addition to the scenery that it’s hilarious. No lie, it floats and jiggles. Really, it’s a lot of work for a meaningless change. But hey, maybe I’m wrong and 2003 was the plan the whole time and the script just sucks like that.  Anywho, Dakota Johnson plays Cassandra Webb, an adult orphan who works as a first responder (no mention of 9/11 in her ranks — another point for “this was supposed to be the ‘90s”). While pregnant and researching the healing capabilities of a certain type of spider in the Amazon, Cassandra’s mother was betrayed and killed by her partner Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who aimed to use the spider to give himself superpowers or something. Here in the present day — er, bobo 2003, Cassandra gets into an insane car/bridge accident which unlocks her ability to see the future in bursts. This newfound ability places her into the path of three young women whose character names I don’t feel like looking up, but they’re played by Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’ Connor, and Isabela Merced. You see, this trio of young women are being targeted by the guy who killed Cassandra’s mom, because he has visions of the three of them one day killing him, which he’d like to prevent. Cassandra has visions of him killing the girls, so she takes it upon herself to protect them. Make sense? No? That’s fine, you don’t care, I promise. Anything else you need to know will be explained to you when Cassandra talks out loud to a stray cat who exists just to receive exposition.  The bulk of the film is the foursome of women bouncing from one baffling location to another while running from Ezekiel, who mostly just barks orders (from offscreen, via ADR) to a lady who has a computer that can do anything and see everything and find anybody. Every once in a while they scrap, and then bounce to a new spot.  There’s not a whole lot of action, but you wouldn’t know it from the absolutely insane edit. Few shots occur without a snap zoom in and/or out, and the filmmakers never use fewer than ten shots when one or two would do just fine. It’s the herkiest jerkiest movie you’re apt to (try and) see, with large chunks of action that can only register as total nonsense. Add to that the insertion of Cassandra’s premonitions and most sequences devolve into chaos. And since the action cannot be engaged with, the sequences tend to bore, failing to add any pep to the film’s otherwise bland pace.  What results is a film consistently at odds with itself. It’s as busy as a film can be, putting tons of effort into all the wrong things, defying the viewer to be entertained by its ridiculous plot and garish visuals. Again, the bar here is low, but it’s a shame that the filmmaking is so shockingly shoddy, because there’s a version of this script that could be a lot of fun, especially if the performers offer it the same level of commitment that they do here. But as it is it feels like no one actually wanted to make this movie. It feels like the Sony wing of Marvel just wanted to poop out something that could maybe turn a small profit by being Spider-Man adjacent — just a little bit of something recognizable that’ll give the diehards their fix until next time.  Oh, and did you know that a shattered pane of glass looks like a spider web? Well if you didn’t, you will by the end of Madame Web, a film that uses this visual motif more times than you would believe. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2024"," Wondering if Madame Web is ok for kids? Madame Web is associated with Marvel, but it is not part of the MCU. While Madame Web boasts lots of star power, unfortunately, she deserved better. I’m not even sure you can call this a superhero film. But is it kid friendly? Well, at least Madame Web is fairly family friendly since there wasn’t much action. Here’s what parents need to know in this Madame Web Parents Guide. Madame Web is a standalone origin story of  Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), a paramedic in Manhattan who begins to have visions after having an accident and dying for a few minutes. She realized that she can see the future and therefore, change it. When she sees three young women about to get killed on the subway, she tries to stop it, and must face her past while also making a new enemy. Madame Web is rated for PG-13 for action, violence, and language by the MPA which means some content may not be suitable for children under 13 years old. Parents are strongly cautioned. Profanity is moderate in Madame Web with uses of sh*t, a**, a**hole, bi*ch, and hell. There are also uses of Deity including “oh my g-d” “Jesus” and g-ddamn. There is some sexual content, but no nudity in Madame Web. You do see a couple kissing and then a couple in bed, implying sexual relations. You also see a woman in her bra.  You can expect to see some superhero violence, but there aren’t really superheroes. Characters are shot from close range, including police officers. There are explosions, car chases, fighting, and hand-to-hand combat. There are some jump scares. Characters are seen being choked and strangled. Parents can expect some violence, use of weapons, death, and some profanity used by some characters. To sum it up, Madame Web is kid friendly for ages 10 and older. However, if a child has lost a parent, then Madame Web may not be for them. Now let’s get into it. I love Marvel. I love superhero movies. I love female led superhero movies. But Sony did Madame Web dirty. There was too much origin and not enough action. Character development is essential, and even after 2 hours of character development, not much was developed.  I don’t blame the actors, as there was not much in the script to personalize. The action scenes were boring and the villain was one-dimensional and not interesting. There were no stakes in the film. You have a woman trying to protect 3 other women, which, yay, they don’t need a man to protect them. But also, why should we care? In a genre when human lives are dispensable, what’s a few more?  We get a glimpse of them in their suits and that got me pumped! I’m like ok, I’m going to see some kick-butt females beating down some bad dude. And maybe that’s my mistake for buying into the cliche. But I waited and waited.  Madame Web isn’t given physical strength, but her powers are in her mind, which is a welcome change. Then you give her a basic storyline with cheesy dialogue. The problem is not Dakota Johnson.  You’ll see some Spider-Man references as Madame Web is part of the Spider-Man Universe, but it’s not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So don’t expect any mid- or end-credit scenes either. It was just a disappointment all around which makes me so sad. ",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2024"," If Marvel is the Coke of superhero movies and DC is the Pepsi, Sony is the RC Cola, a passable substitute when they’re out of what you really want. Although the studio has had the rights to Spider-Man, one of the most iconic characters in comic-book history, since the end of the 1990s, it spent much of the 2010s struggling to convert that prize property into a watchable movie, let alone an expandable franchise. After Sony struck a deal to incorporate Spidey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and especially after it cast the buoyant Tom Holland, the character’s fortunes soared. (2021’s Spider-Man: No Way Home is the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time.) But the studio was left in a peculiar position, owning both Spider-Man and the 60-plus years’ worth of secondary characters that have populated his world but unable to use them in the same movies. The result, beginning with 2018’s Venom, has been a singularly strange series of films that take place in a world built around a figure whose name cannot be uttered within it, like a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead where no one thought to check in advance who owned the rights to Hamlet. While the previous DC Universe has wound down in preparation for next year’s Superman-led reboot and Marvel has kicked all but one of its movies into 2025 as the company tries to reverse its precipitous loss of audiences, Sony has three comic-book movies on tap between now and November, claiming for itself the lowest point in the genre’s fortunes since at least 2007. RC Colas for everyone! The first of those is Madame Web, and boy, it is a doozy. Its mockable, memeable trailer had prepared me for the worst, and on that level, at least, it did not disappoint. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and starring Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic who gains the ability to see the future after a drowning accident, the movie is marginally competent at its best, and at its worst, it’s an incoherent mishmash populated by slumming movie stars who make little effort to disguise the dawning realization that they’ve made a terrible mistake. It’s a travesty, a disaster, a blight on the history of superheroes and cinema itself. I enjoyed the hell out of it. For as often as movie critics are accused of having rarified taste, of just not liking anything, the opposite can also be true. Seeing hundreds of movies a year for years on end can lead to a condition where you place too much value on novelty, and even a minor twist on a worn-out formula feels like a life raft in a sea of sameness. It shouldn’t be a big deal, or even particularly noteworthy, that Madame Web takes place in a version of New York that actually feels like New York, or that its action sequences are spatially coherent and largely free of computer-generated murk. But by the recent standards of the genre, even its occasional jankiness comes as a pleasant change of pace. It’s the kind of superhero movie they made before superhero movies were all they made, disreputable and messy and kind of a hoot. To be clear: Madame Web is bad. Really bad. As in, most of the main villain’s dialogue seems to have been dubbed by an actor who doesn’t particularly sound like him. Johnson may not mouth the now-infamous line from the trailer about how her mother was in the Amazon researching spiders right before she died, but she does pull out a valise crammed with her mother’s old notebooks and murmur, “Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom.” Just as the dire and humorless Morbius ended with the promise of a team-up between Jared Leto’s living vampire and Michael Keaton’s Vulture (ported in, for reasons never to be explained, from the universe of Spider-Man: Homecoming) and Venom 2 ended with Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock getting zapped into the MCU to set up a crossover that seems unlikely to ever happen, so Madame Web is infused with the promise that the next movie will be the good one. In the movie that actually exists, Cassie is tasked with saving three teenage girls (played by Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced) from being murdered by Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), whose own visions of the future show the girls’ grown-up versions killing him. Like Cassie, Ezekiel has gained powers from the bite of a Peruvian arachnid worshipped by a tribe known as Las Arañas, which the movie helpfully and non-litigiously translates as the Spider-People. (Naturally, some of those people are indeed -Men.) In both Cassie’s and Ezekiel’s visions, the three girls grow up to be various versions of a crime-fighting webslinger, one with mechanical legs protruding from her back, another whose wrists shoot meshes of electricity, but these glimpses of the future are so vague and hazy you have to indulge in some post-film Googling to figure out whom they’re meant to be playing (briefly: two Spider-Women and a Spider-Girl). You can only imagine the buzzy young actresses’ agents informing them they’ve been cast to play a superhero, only for them to later realize they spent 90 percent of the movie flouncing around in schoolgirl uniforms and getting their necks broken. Johnson, for her part, infects every scene with a dry sense of remove, as if she can’t believe she’s doing this either. So many superhero movies, even the decent ones, approach audiences as if they’re directives issued from command central: You watch because you have no choice not to. But there’s no cost to missing Madame Web, except for passing up a hilarious couple of hours in a theater. The mainline MCU movies are self-conscious to a fault, full of quips and winks, but Madame Web is thoroughly un-self-aware, the rare modern movie that achieves the status of pure camp without meaning to. It might not be the kind of fun its makers intended it to be, but that doesn’t make it any less of a good time.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," The only real bummer about “Madame Web,” the latest installment in the Spider-Man chronicles, isn’t that it’s bad, but that it never achieves memorably terrible status. The story is absurd, the dialogue snort-out-loud risible, the fights uninspired. Even so, there are glimmers of wit and competency. And then there’s its star, Dakota Johnson, who has a fascinating, seemingly natural ability to appear wholly detached from the nonsense swirling around her. Most actors at least try to sell the shoddy goods; Johnson serenely floats above it all. A misterioso clairvoyant, Madame Web is a secondary Spider-Man character who met the web-weaver in the comics in 1980 while regally parked on a life-support system shaped like a round-bottom flask. Blind and plagued by a debilitating autoimmune disease, she had a standard super-type get-up — a black unitard veined with lines that converge in a web — that was offset by a white-and-black hairdo that suggested she shared a stylist with Peter Parker’s editor J. Jonah Jameson. She entered with “a smell of ozone and disinfectant and age,” the classy intro explained, and with “a voice that crackles like ancient parchment.” Johnson’s Cassandra Webb — Cassie for short — is far younger and seems more like a patchouli and cannabis kind of gal, despite the frenetic wheel skills she displays in her job as a New York paramedic. Her powers haven’t yet emerged when, after a preamble in the Peruvian Amazon, she is speeding through the city in 2003. As with many superheroes, Cassie has a tragic back story and so on, a generic burden that Johnson’s palpably awkward charm humanizes. If the actress at times seems understandably baffled by the movie she’s in, it’s because she hasn’t been smoothed into plastic perfection by the star-making machinery. Johnson seems too real for the phoniness thrown at her, which is her own super power. The British director S.J. Clarkson has multiple TV credits on her résumé, including a few episodes of the Netflix series “Jessica Jones,” about the hard boozing, fighting and fornicating superhero. Johnson’s Cassie is sadder and more naturally offbeat than Jones, and like most big-screen superheroes, Cassie doesn’t seem to be getting any noncombative action. Yet she too doesn’t fit easily in Normal World. One of the better scenes in “Madame Web” happens at a baby shower, where Cassie inadvertently wipes the smiles off the faces of a roomful of women by talking about her dead mother. It’s squirmy, funny filler: the guest of honor is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), Spidey’s soon-to-be mom, who chats with his future uncle, Ben (Adam Scott). Clarkson shares screenwriter credit with Claire Parker as well as with the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose collaborations include a string of critically maligned box-office fantasies: “Dracula Untold,” “Gods of Egypt,” “The Last Witch Hunter” and “Morbius.” (That’s entertainment!)

"Feb 14, 2024"," Two interesting things happened after the trailer for Madame Web, Sony and Marvel’s latest Spider-Man spin-off, was released in November last year. The first was that its star, Dakota Johnson, promptly ditched her talent agency and moved to a new one – though of course that could have just been a coincidence. And the second was that an amusingly clumpy line of Johnson’s dialogue – “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died” – went moderately viral on social media.  Unless I fell asleep, said line has actually been cut from the finished product, perhaps from shame, though unfortunately the others didn’t meet the same fate. What an unreservedly hopeless film this is: a sort of two-hour explosion in a boringness factory, in which the forces of dullness and stupidity combine in new and infinitely perturbing ways.  Even Johnson, who managed to bring a bit of wit and zap to the Fifty Shades films, borderline sleepwalks through the role of Cassandra Webb – a New York ambulance driver who was bitten by a magical spider while in utero, and has since developed the classic spider-like ability of being able to see into the future. These visions prompt her to protect three dreary teens, played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor, from Tahar Rahim’s Ezekiel Sims, a former spider researcher turned tech billionaire (OK) who also has the gift of spider-foresight, and is now trying to kill the girls before his recurring dream of them becoming a trio of Spider-Women who hurl him off a skyscraper to his death can come to pass. There is something inherently hilarious about a film in which everyone constantly talks about spiders yet almost nothing spidery actually happens, beyond Rahim’s character occasionally pulling on a black Spider-Man suit. Speaking of, something very odd appears to have happened to Rahim’s performance in the edit. Whenever his character talks, the French actor’s face is almost always off-screen, and on the very occasional moments it is visible, the lip-sync is about as convincing as in Shaolin and Wu Tang. I kept wondering if Johnson’s “he was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died” might end up coming out of his mouth instead, but sadly it was not to be. The script cleaves to the standard superhero origin-story format that has been done to death over the last 20 years, with no surprises thrown in along the way. Even the process of Cassandra grasping her powers is drawn out to near-unendurable length: an entire half-hour passes before her first act of heroism, which is stopping a pigeon from hitting a window. All in all, it’s a new low in a mini-franchise comprised almost entirely of new lows: Venom, Morbius, and now this. Extraordinarily, Sony has another two of these nightmares lined up for imminent release: Kraven the Hunter in August, and another Venom for Christmas. Perhaps if everyone laughs enough at the trailers in the interim, some bits of those might be cut too, and we can all save ourselves a few precious minutes.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2024"," “Un gran poder conlleva una gran responsabilidad” es, sin lugar a dudas, una de las frases más famosas e icónicas de los cómics. Si la transportamos a nuestro medio audiovisual, podríamos adaptarla como: “Una buena adaptación conlleva que la película prevalezca sobre el material original”. No es compatible adaptar cualquier tipo de material, ya sea literario o gráfico, si para hacerlo debemos esperar que la audiencia visite dicho material, sea cual sea su formato. Esta discusión es milenaria y se puede aplicar a miles de productos audiovisuales, desde las primeras películas de monstruos como Nosferatu (1922) y Frankenstein (1931) hasta el tedioso y agotador concepto de los universos cinematográficos. Como todo en la vida, hay buenos y malos ejemplos. Si bien algunas películas y series han estado a la altura (e incluso han superado) su material original, como la trilogía de El señor de los anillos basada en la saga de libros escritos por J.R.R. Tolkien, Pulp Fiction, basada en novelas y revistas impresas en papel barato (el llamado ""pulp"" por los impresores), dedicadas a narrar historias de crimen y misterio que enloquecían a Tarantino, o las primeras temporadas de The Walking Dead, basadas en los cómics de Robert Kirkman (entre otros), la gran mayoría de las producciones se encuentran muy por debajo de la calidad de sus cimientos. Esto es decir poco de Madame Web (2024), que lleva este concepto a un extremo que solo puede generar vergüenza ajena. No es la primera vez que Marvel Studios nos decepciona con semejante tomada de pelo en su larga historia de basura cinematográfica. Hace años que perdió ese “toque” que lo volvió adictivo para los fanáticos de sus personajes e historias. Pero es preocupante pensar que alguien, al menos una persona, haya visto el producto final que su directora, S. J. Clarkson, quien solo tiene en su haber una película para televisión llamada Toast (2010), haya permitido que esta llegue a las salas de todo el mundo. Ya no sé si pasa por un tema de avaricia o necesidad de vender, poniendo como prioridad la cantidad de cintas por encima de su calidad, o simplemente es una obsesión de querer sacarle jugo a cada personaje mediocre y sin sentido que puedan tener en sus páginas. La película es desastrosa, visualmente horripilante, con un manejo de cámara que intenta emular las páginas de un cómic pero se queda en un trabajo burdo y tosco. La historia peca de querer abarcar mucho, presentando una paleta de personajes sin gusto, muy pobremente llevados adelante por sus protagonistas, ninguno de los cuales destaca ni supera la monotonía actoral. Es verdaderamente difícil encontrar algo que se pueda destacar de la cinta, donde ni siquiera su presupuesto (digno de una película de estudio grande) puede maquillar las falencias visuales y de efectos especiales que tiene. Durante sus casi dos horas de duración, vemos una narrativa forzada, un guión incoherente y ridículo, justificaciones paupérrimas y lo que seguramente sea uno de los peores personajes escritos desde el comienzo del cine de superhéroes de este siglo, diría que incluso superando al antagonista de Morbius (2022), película dentro del mismo universo. Si bien no es ninguna novedad que el cine de superhéroes murió con “Iron Man” en Vengadores: Endgame (Avengers: Endgame, 2019), aunque improbable, película tras película Marvel (y, por consiguiente, Disney) nos demuestra que siempre hay lugar para una peor película.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," The first time Marvel’s logo played on the big screen, it wasn’t technically on a Marvel film. Those now-ubiquitous white-on-red letters emerging from the pages of a comic made their cinematic debut in front of 2002’s Spider-Man, produced and distributed by Sony. When Marvel started their own studio a few years later, they updated the logo for their own use; instead of a comic, the word “Marvel” gradually materialized out of scenes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and shots of stars like Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Studios like Sony who license Marvel characters can’t use the new logo; they’re stuck with the old version. In fact, that’s the Marvel logo that appears at the start of Madame Web. It winds up doing a pretty good job of setting the tone for what follows, since this movie feels like the sort of clumsy, clueless superhero adaptation Hollywood used to make in the days before Marvel started their film studio. Like a lot of those pre-Marvel Studios Marvel movies, Madame Web seems vaguely embarrassed to be based on a superhero comic. The same goes for Dakota Johnson, who plays the title character — although can you technically call someone a title character if said character never actually goes by the name mentioned in the title? Johnson plays Cassie Webb; no one onscreen ever calls her “Madame Web.” With one very brief exception, she never wears a superhero costume in the film, either. Like I said, everyone looks a little ashamed of what they’re doing. (Under the circumstances, that’s not an unreasonable reaction.) Marvel Comics’ Madame Web is an old blind woman with precognitive abilities. She spends most of her in a high-tech chair, and occasionally offers Spider-Man cryptic advice about his future. In the film version, directed by S.J. Clarkson, Spider-Man is a literal fetus while the future Madame Web is still just a New York City paramedic. (Emma Roberts plays a small and essentially pointless role as Peter Parker’s mother, Mary.) In the year 2003 — which is only important in the sense that it allows Madame Web to be an extremely vague prequel to other Spider-Man movies — Cassie survives a near-death experience at work and gains the ability to see glimpses of her own future. Her newfound and unpredictable abilities also reveal that three young women played by Celeste O’Connor, Isabela Merced, and Sydney Sweeney are all being targeted by a man in a black and red costume named Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim). Could this have anything to do with the fact that Ezekiel was in the Amazon with Cassie’s mom when she was researching spiders right before she died 20 years ago? It seems quite likely! Cassie will need to figure out how to harness her abilities if she hopes to beat Ezekiel and protect her new charges. Easier said than done — in order to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding her mother’s disappearance, Cassie will have to leave these women alone for a week while she travels to Peru without them to figure out what her mother was doing in the Amazon. Cassie is such a bad hero, in fact, that she abandons Ezekiel’s potential victims on multiple occasions while she goes off on her own to research Amazonian spiders and their magical venom. Not that Madame Web is much more useful when she’s around; most of the time she just yells at these innocent girls for not listening to her advice. (“You’re so entitled! You should be so sorry!” she yells in a typically cranky scene.) This makes Cassie a very odd sort of superhero. When she’s not berating these women she’s complaining that she just wants to be left alone and doesn’t care about anyone but herself, which is a weird statement from a person who has chosen to save people as an EMT for a living. Johnson’s performance is mostly along those same exasperated lines. While she doesn’t exactly elevate the material, it must be noted that she is playing the surly grump that was written for her (by a group of five credited writers, including Clarkson). Clarkson provides a few fun directorial flourishes, like when the camera rotates 180 degrees to follow Ezekiel as he flips upside down to hang from a ceiling. Moments of visual interest are very few and far between, though; it feels like half of the movie takes place in ambulances and taxis while Cassie drives the other characters around. Madame Web’s finale, set beneath the giant Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens, is a mess of phony CGI and shameless product placement. While that sequence resembles the sort of action-heavy climax we’ve come to expect in this sort of superhero film, a lot of the rest of Madame Web is much smaller scale, closer in size and scope to a PG-13 horror movie. Cassie’s visions of the future are violent and sudden, and many arrive with irritating jump scares. Unexpected jolts of noise surprise Cassie so often you’ll swear you’re experiencing déjà vu in the theater. In a better movie, I might argue that was an intentional stylistic choice meant to mimic the protagonist’s powers. In this movie, it plays like a desperate attempt to keep the audience awake in the midst of a very snoozy storyline. Various media reports have suggested that Madame Web underwent some tinkering in the editing room as Sony weighed how much or how little to connect it to their other Marvel projects. What they landed on never involves Spider-Man in any meaningful way; just enough to leave the door open for Cassie to return in a future film in a role closer to the one she traditionally played in Marvel comics. But after this boring and unsatisfying debut, it doesn’t take clairvoyance to see this franchise has no future. -The Ezekiel character from Spider-Man comics is this fascinatingly enigmatic figure who appears in Spider-Man’s life with uncertain motives and hints at offering the answers to all sorts of questions Peter Parker may have held about his past. The Ezekiel of this movie is just an off-the-track super-villain. He committed horrible acts to get his hands on the spider that gave him his powers 20 years ago. Decades later, he is obsessed with killing these three women. But why did he want the spider so bad? What did he do with it in the meantime? The film never pauses for even a second to consider any of that. -One character tells Cassie that her mind has “infinite potential.” In practice, she’s not a very effective superhero. Her main move is stealing a vehicle and running Ezekiel over with it. She does this enough in the film they might as well have called her The Cabbie, and given the movie that title.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2024"," Madame Web doesn’t seem particularly interested in being a great superhero movie. It is not particularly committed to the tropes or trappings of the genre at all. Rather than that being an out-and-out weakness, it is something that makes the film stand out – for better and worse – in an oversaturated and wrung-out superhero blockbuster landscape. In fact, while it is far from perfect, Sony’s latest attempt to start its own live action Spider-Verse is at its strongest when it is embracing the strange supernatural-tinged teen thriller it really wants to be. Opening in the Peruvian Amazon during the 70s, the film creates a new origin for Cassandra Webb, a deep-cut comic book character who has been both ally and antagonist for Spider-Man throughout the years. Here, her mother is attacked while looking for a spider with strange powers and, although she dies, her daughter Cassandra is saved by a local tribe of 'spider-people' known as Los Arañas. It is a pulpy beginning that ultimately feels like it comes from another movie. Soon the action moves to New York in 2003 where a 30-year-old Cassie – played with an impressive deadpan awkwardness by Dakota Johnson – is now an EMT working alongside the future uncle of Spider-Man himself, Ben Parker. Adam Scott brings a charm and gravitas to the role, and the pair's banter-heavy chemistry does a lot to keep the film moving until we meet the younger cast of Spider-Women who are at the heart of what Madame Web does best. After a near-death experience, Cassie begins to have visions of the future and becomes entangled with three teen girls: the shy, lonely Julia (Sydney Sweeney); the rule-breaking skater Mattie (Celeste O'Connor); and booksmart, independent Anya (Isabela Merced). Their chemistry is so fun and watchable that you'll be hoping for the spin-off film almost as much as Sony surely is. The trio are being targeted by the superpowered Spider-villain known as Ezekiel, played by Tahar Rahim. The actor seems to be having a lot of fun crafting an operatic foe for the girls, who regularly makes dramatic proclamations and uses state-of-the-art 2003 CCTV technology to hunt them down. Once the trio of teens and Cassandra collide, Madame Web picks up speed, throwing our heroines into a threat-filled supernatural romp that often feels more like a Final Destination-style teen horror than a Marvel film, and that's definitely a good thing. Cassie's powers manifest as strange visions, meaning that the film often flits between time or repeats sequences. While it is generally effective, your mileage may vary as it is an unusual twist and at times becomes repetitive as Cassie tries to get a handle on them. As superhero movies have become the ultimate Hollywood currency, fans have often wanted something a little different: a new genre or a twist on the stories that they love. Madame Web ambitiously attempts that with a charming found-family story wrapped in a violent, horror comedy about an angry, often unlikeable woman coming to terms with her new role as a mentor and potentially a superhero. Even as it tries to do something new, it suffers from some of the problems that have long impacted the genre. Reshoots, story edits, and automated dialogue replacement work become more noticeable as you get deeper into the film, and there are moments that the computer-generated imagery looks closer to a TV series than a big-budget film. But the charming cast, spooky supernatural tone, and often genuinely funny script – Madame Web is definitely in on the joke – make this an enjoyable popcorn film that's likely to become a bit of a comic book cult classic in years to come.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," The story: New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) discovers she has life-changing abilities beyond administering first aid in this Marvel Comics stand-alone origin story.
 And while Johnson is an appealing actress, director S.J. Clarkson’s debut feature is bland with cut-rate visual effects action once Cassandra begins to experience telepathy after a near-death accident.  Her visions weave together alternate dimensions within the Spider-Man world, as well as the sister-power destinies of three lonely teens, each with supernatural potential of their own: bratty Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), saucy Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and timid Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney). The story is set in 2003. Cassandra will mentor the girls into becoming future iterations of Spider-Woman. But, for now, the sheroes have nothing more interesting to do than collectively fight off a boring villain (Tahir Rahim as Spider-Man foe Ezekiel Sims) in pursuit, who crawls on ceilings wearing a spidey suit but, rather stupidly, no mask. The story: Orion (voiced by Jacob Tremblay) is an 11-year-old American schoolboy terrified of the dark, who appears one night in the form of a gentle black-cloaked giant (Paul Walter Hauser) and whisks him away on a nocturnal adventure around the world to show him there is nothing to fear but fear itself.
 DreamWorks Animation’s Orion And The Dark is scripted by Charlie Kaufman, the visionary surrealist who entered the portal of movie star John Malkovich’s mind in Being John Malkovich (1999) and conceived Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004).
 So, one wonders, could Orion – who is scared of dogs, bullies, rejection, heights, the ocean, cancerous cellphone waves and just about everything – be the screenwriter revisiting his own childhood psyche with all his signature neuroses?  Sounds bleak. But such is the inner world of an anxious child, and Kaufman has reinterpreted British author Emma Yarlett’s 2014 picture book as a witty and imaginative bedtime story a-swirl in existential dread. There is much of Pixar’s Monsters Inc (2001) and Inside Out (2015) in Dark and his Night Entities co-workers Insomnia (Nat Faxon), Unexplained Noises (Golda Rosheuvel), Quiet (Aparna Nancherla), Sweet Dreams (Angela Bassett) and Sleep (Natasia Demetriou).

"Feb 14, 2024"," ""Madame Web"" is an utterly baffling comic book to feature adaptation, built out of an utterly baffling series of wrongheaded moves. It's not just a dreadful movie, it's an incomprehensible one, the culmination of so many misguided decisions that it's confounding. A lot has to go astray to come up with something as mystifying as ""Madame Web,"" and it's not often when so many things at the movies go this phenomenally, spectacularly bad. If anything, it could become a case study in how to ground a franchise before it begins. The extended series of ""Spider-Man"" adjacent titles have produced their share of stinkers in recent years — the ""Venom"" titles, ""Morbius"" — but ""Madame Web"" represents a new low for superhero content writ large. So at least it has infamy going for it. Dakota Johnson, who at times appears openly disdainful of the material, stars as Cassie Webb, an EMT worker in New York City. Her mother died during childbirth, while she was in the Peruvian Amazon searching for a rare spider whose venom somehow holds the key to potentially curing untold human diseases. After locating the spider she was shot by her assistant Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), who stole her research — and the precious spider — and left her for dead. Cassie was born with the help of a race of spider-people who live in the treetops. You know, normal stuff. Now it's 2003 and Cassie is beginning to have flash-forward visions of the future, not long term, but only about 10-20 seconds or so ahead of the present. (Nicolas Cage had similar powers, although they were non-spider related, in 2007's ""Next."") At the same time Ezekiel, who has apparently not aged in 30 years, is having visions of his future, of his own death at the hands of three young women in spandex spider-suits. His premonitions are detailed enough that he can make out their faces exactly, and from his descriptions he has his assistant Amaria (Zosia Mamet) hunt for them using emerging NSA technology that can track anyone, anywhere by hacking into a complex surveillance grid. And this is all pre-smart phones to boot. Those three ladies are Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), unrelated teens who are all randomly together on a train when Cassie, who is on board as well, has a vision of them being attacked. Cassie hastily convinces them to de-board the train and come with her and soon they're on the run from Ezekiel, who is dressed in a dark spider-suit and exhibits super strength and the ability to climb walls and ceilings and wants them dead. Time to go! These are all the somewhat standard machinations of a superhero movie — powers, danger, all-knowing tech — and no one is holding them up to the scrutiny of real world litmus tests. But there's a concrete-level stiffness in ""Madame Web's"" presentation, where no one in any situation acts or behaves like a living, breathing human being would act or behave, or that anyone who's ever observed human interactions would recognize as relatable human behavior. These are characters who are there only so the sponsored products (Pepsi, specifically, but Budweiser, too) won't look lonely on screen, or to mention related content tie-ins (Cassie, apparently, is a big ""American Idol"" fan) in casual conversation. Should we even go on? Cassie steals a yellow cab and takes the three girls out to the middle of the woods, where she figures they'll be safe — three teen girls in the middle of the woods, what could possibly go wrong? — and leaves them there and asks them to stay put while she drives back to the city to figure some things out, including how to hone her powers. But they get hungry and wander to a nearby diner where they flirt with boys and dance on tables to Britney Spears' ""Toxic,"" which wouldn't be released as a single until early 2004, but pop music continuity is honestly the least of ""Madame Web's"" problems. A sense of tension, humor or purpose, those are the big picture areas where ""Madame Web"" lacks. There's no excitement in the quick-cut visuals, which are filmed with reality TV aesthetics. There's no feel to the characters, who are lost when they're not holding or otherwise engaging with Pepsi products or signage. There's no logic in the script, credited to first-time feature helmer S. J. Clarkson and three others. And there's nothing driving the story forward, or an indicator of where this story fits into any larger universe, our own or otherwise. It all seems like an overly elaborate backstory just to arrive at the place where the characters don their spider-suits, which doesn't arrive until the very end. By that time ""Madame Web"" has spun viewers in circles and left them with nothing to hang on to, not even the campiness one would hope for in a production this far off the rails. Experiences this lousy should at least be fun. But ""Madame Web"" is so comically bad it can't even manage to get being bad right.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2024"," Clearly stated messages of empowerment that are emphasized by the story: The power of your mind has infinite potential. No matter what path you're on, your future can always be changed. When you accept great responsibility, you will find great power. You are stronger and more capable than you know. To see the future clearly, you have to heal the past. Cassie is a first responder whose strongest characteristic is her desire to save lives. When she realizes the lives of three teens are in danger, she does whatever it takes to protect them, demonstrating courage and integrity. By film's end, the four main characters are working together as a team. Ben is a caring and dependable friend. Female-centered and empowering story from a female director and co-writers. Features a female superhero whose strength is her intuition. A pregnant scientist is intelligent and fearless. Three female teenagers are depicted dealing with challenging circumstances: A wealthy Black teen feels the neglect of parents who are constantly away for work, a White teen is caught in the middle of her family's health crises and experiencing the neglect of a father who's started a new family, and the Latina daughter of an undocumented immigrant suffers from the harsh consequences of government policies. Additional Latino characters include a woman with a powerful government position and a male villain. Cassie and Ben's shift captain is Black. The movie is set in New York City, and background and supporting characters reflect the diversity of the location, representing a range of races and backgrounds. Gunshots, including one to the head, with some blood. Stabbing. Intense action violence, including punches, kicks, and slamming bodies into hard objects. Fire. Explosions. Drowning. Strangling. Poisoning. Car accident with victims scraped up, but not gory. Intense peril. Cassie's mother died in childbirth. Two people who just met are shown walking into an apartment together and then waking up in bed together in bra/underwear, under the sheets. Their hookup sets the stage for violence, although the threat isn't sexual in nature. Teens flirt. Parents need to know that Madame Web is a stand-alone origin story that adds spider-women into the greater Marvel universe. It's also the fourth installment in growing the Sony Spider-Man Universe (SSU), following Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and Morbius. Main character Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a 30-year-old EMT whose spider-enhanced abilities don't give her super ""powers,"" but rather a super mind. Once she realizes her visions are real, her first-responder training takes over, and she does whatever it takes to protect three vulnerable teen girls who are being stalked by a male killer. Violence isn't constant, but characters are shot dead, stabbed, strangled, poisoned, and in car accidents. There's some blood, but it's not gory. A nameless character is seen in a bra, in bed with a man she just met, and the situation becomes dangerous. Language includes ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" ""s--t,"" ""goddammit,"" and ""Jesus"" (as an exclamation). The plot is centered on young women finding their strength, but the movie has lots of encouraging messages that apply to everyone, including that no matter what your future looks like, it can always be changed. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In MADAME WEB, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a paramedic who never knew her mother, an arachnologist who died during childbirth. After a near-death experience, Cassie starts having déjà vu experiences. When she has a vision of a mysterious enemy who's set on killing three teen girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor), Cassie vows to keep them safe while she investigates what's really going on. Director S.J. Clarkson smoothly weaves four diverse female characters into the Spider-verse, but Madame Web ultimately lacks bite—and credibility. On the plus side, Sony's parallel/independent Marvel Universe is doing well when it comes to superhero inclusivity. For parents of daughters, there can never be too many inspirational fierce female characters, and the ones here are all from different walks of life in terms of race, socioeconomic class, and family status. But will this web of positivity catch kids' attention, or will they fly right through it? Cassie's abilities become more and more far-fetched, effects that might read well on the page but are difficult to depict on screen without making audiences scoff. (Even in a fantasy feature, there are limits to suspending disbelief.) And at times, the dialogue calls attention to its lack of imagination as well, sometimes provoking unintended laughs. On the other hand, the writers have fun with the 2003 setting, an era that was particularly challenging for women. When the girls dance to Britney Spears, it's a wink to those who appreciate the symbolism of four women banding together to stop a ""Toxic"" man who puts his own needs over their own. Families can talk about women's roles in comic book/superhero films. What makes Cassandra Webb a role model in Madame Web? Do you think having a female director and writer working on this film affected the way she was portrayed? What elements did the filmmakers use to set the story in 2003? Do you think it would be easier or harder to create a ""period setting"" that's in the relatively recent past? What do you think about the way superhero movies depict violence? Is there a difference in the way you react to realistic vs. stylized violence? What's the impact of media violence on kids? How do the characters in Madame Web demonstrate courage and teamwork? How does Cassie act with integrity and empathy? Why are those all important character strengths?

"Feb 14, 2024"," Llevamos 16 años en una vorágine de películas de superhéroes y, pasado este tiempo, tengo varias sensaciones cuando entro en una sala de cine para ver una nueva entrega del género. En primer lugar, que todo el mundo está buscando su nueva Vengadores: Infinity War -y, en consecuencia, su nueva Endgame-. Buscan volver a sentir lo que sintieron aquella vez con la cinta de Vengadores. Algo imposible, por otra parte. En segundo lugar, que la gente ya entra dispuesta a odiar la película o, en algunos casos, directamente aburrida por tener que ver otra historia de orígenes. Ambas cosas condenan cualquier estreno desde el primer minuto y es algo que estamos viendo en el conjunto de valoraciones como las de The Marvels (2023) o Aquaman 2 (2023). Ahora llega el turno de Madame Web, una cinta dentro del universo Spider-Man que está desarrollando Sony Pictures y que resulta en un grano de arena en el desierto que se ha convertido el cine de superhéroes. Una historia de orígenes más, esta vez sobre Cassandra Webb. Ella es una mujer huérfana que siempre ha estado en busca de respuestas sobre su pasado y que, al desarrollar poderes de clarividencia y encontrarse en una situación de vida o muerte, decide ir a buscarlas. Madame Web es una cinta pobremente construida, todo hay que decirlo. El guion es torpe, desordenado e ilógico en algunos puntos. La filmación parece barata y alberga algunos momentos que provocan risa involuntaria. Todo en su conjunto parece sacado de la década de los 90, de un modo de hacer películas del género mucho menos esforzado que el actual. Solo hay una cosa que destaca y es la interpretación del reparto más joven. El trío formado por Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor e Isabela Merced podría haber dado mucho más de sí, pero vemos lo suficiente como para saber que entre ellas hay una dinámica muy enérgica y un gran potencial. Y con todo esto, aún encuentro un valor a la película. Creo que el público al que está dirigido no se encuentra en una sala de cine llena de periodistas que ya han cumplido 40 años. Lo que propone la directora S.J. Clarkson puede ser una aventura entretenida para espectadores en la pubertad que aún no están hartos de 15 años de superhéroes. Madame Web puede ser a los niños de ahora lo que fue Batman & Robin para la generación de los 90, una película mala que ver con cierto regusto culpable.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2024",Madam Web lacks any originality&#46; There&#8217;s nothing new here that we haven&#8217;t already seen in the surplus of Spider-Man related movies&#44; let alone the larger Marvel universe this sits in&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024",Madame Web suffered from a messy plot and poor dialogue&#46; There were too many scenes and character decisions that felt convenient rather than earned&#46; ,NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," At no point throughout Madame Web does Dakota Johnson say the magic words you came to hear her say — that internet-infamous line reading that launched a thousand memes and promised that, before long, it would be Morbin time yet again. That’s the bad news for connoisseurs of bad dialogue, the Rifftrax crowd. The good news is that nearly every line of dialogue in this remarkably crummy comic-book movie is about on the level of “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died.” If there’s a convincing way to utter such clunky exposition (the handiwork of four screenwriters, somehow), Johnson never finds it. Maybe she isn’t trying to. The star, who’s locked down Valentine’s Day the way Will Smith used to be the King of July 4th, is no stranger to delivering howlers — not with three E. L. James adaptations on her resume. But as Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, a paramedic beset by visions of impending calamity, Johnson evinces a commitment that seems to waver from scene to scene, even shot to shot. When she tells a gaggle of teens, “You’re gonna die if you stay here,” it’s with a flat indifference that makes the T-800 sound emotionally invested. But then, how much effort should she expend on this material? Half-assed is above and beyond. Like its heroine, Madame Web often seems torn between time periods. On the one hand, it recalls the era in which it’s set, the early 2000s — an age when superhero cinema often amounted to deeply lousy, gimcrack non-events like Daredevil, The Punisher, and Catwoman. On the other hand, it’s a movie that could only have been made in present-day Hollywood, convinced, quite falsely, that anything Marvel-related — no matter how back-issue obscure — is a foolproof recipe for box office success. In terms of name recognition, the title character of Madame Web makes Morbius look as widely known as the friendly neighborhood superhero whose comic introduced them both. A 1970s prologue set, you guessed it, in the Amazon explains the source of Cassie’s clairvoyance — it comes from those spiders her pregnant mom (Kerry Bishé) was researching — while establishing the film’s penchant for B-movie hokiness, gobbledygook, and cut-rate spectacle. In the present day, Cassie’s flickers of foresight put her on the warpath of the man who killed her mother, a kind of “evil Spider-Man” with premonitory visions of his own. The villain, played by Tahar Rahim, is after a trio of teenage girls who he dreams will off him years later, after they’ve become conspicuously spider-themed superheroes. Cassie ends up babysitting this nest of future crime fighters, which includes snarky rich-kid skateboarder Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), nerdy Julia Cornwell (Anyone But You star Sydney Sweeney, whose glasses are doing most of the nerding for her), and the trait-deprived Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). There’s not a solid personality among the three, who speak in generic movie-teenager snark sprinkled with tidbits from their characters’ Wikipedia pages. The villain’s visions tell us what comic fans will already know: all three are destined to become some version of Spider-Woman (complete with costumes that look too cheap even for the CW). Not that anyone ever calls them that, nor is there any hint of how they’ll acquire superpowers. Guess they have to save something for the sequel that will probably not get made. There’s a germ of a fun idea in Madame Web: In rough outline, the plot is basically The Terminator by way of Minority Report, with a little of the shuddery omens of a Final Destination movie. But for that pastiche to work, we’d need a more intimidating bad guy, not this ineffectual arachnid-themed placeholder; so believably menacing in A Prophet, Rahim delivers an awkward, petulant performance, wrestling with his dire dialogue when the rubbery CGI avatar of him isn’t being blasted aside by automobiles no fewer than three times. And the film’s chase narrative has no momentum. It screeches to a halt every time Cassie leaves her band of adolescent charges to go drum up more pertinent exposition, including an origin-story field trip to South America that looks as quick and easy as a bus ride across town to run an errand. The special effects in Madame Web are anything but, and the action stretches the definition of “directed.” S. J. Clarkson, a filmmaker who’s worked entirely in British television before now, captures the skirmishes in disorienting close-ups and cuts them into ribbons. It takes a particular unfitness for the job to set a close-quarters showdown to the skittery snake-charmer pulse of Toxic (a song that didn’t hit the radio until the year after this film is set, but never mind) and get not a drop of cool out of the sequence. Meanwhile, the big finale on the side of a building is borderline incoherent; it’s enough to make you long for the muddy but comparably legible imagery cinematographer Mauro Fiore lent the final minutes of the last actual Spider-Man movie. Speaking of Spidey, he’s nowhere to be found in Madame Web, though that doesn’t stop the movie from shooting shamelessly thin strands of gossamer in his direction. We get Adam Scott, touchingly pretending he’s in a real movie, as a significantly named coworker of Cassie’s; a pregnant relative whose coyly unnamed baby “keeps leaping around in there;” and an immortally remixed line of superhero wisdom, “Once you take on the responsibility, great power will come.” Dancing around Easter eggs is a particularly pathetic attempt to make the events here seem like a vital chapter in some larger Spider-Verse. All it really does is underscore the Peter Parker-shaped void at the center of Sony’s parallel franchise, an alternate Marvel Cinematic Universe headlined by variably renowned B-listers and adapted from leftover intellectual property. Madame Web is the kind of bad you don’t see that often in the modern age of machine-tooled, quality-controlled superhero fare. What interest it holds is nearly scientific — the fascination of discovering a rare, endangered species in the wild. Just don’t confuse its clumsiness of conception or execution, the failures shouldered by all involved (including a movie star perversely disinterested in the nonsense she’s making), for any kind of secret virtue. More than Morbius or those fitfully entertaining Venom movies, Madame Web is less than the sum of the memes it inspired. And there’s bigger fun to be had laughing at a line in its trailer than there is in blowing two hours waiting for Johnson to say it. The last time a studio decided to build a film franchise out of a vampire from the Marvel Comics world, 1998's Blade paved the way for the Marvel Cinematic Universe we know today. This year's long-delayed Morbius, however, feels more like a stake through Sony Pictures' superhero-loving heart. Madame Web may be the first heroine to star in her own Spider-Man spinoff movie. And if you're wondering who that character is, then you're not alone. Regardless, Deadline is reporting that actress Dakota Johnson is in negotiations to headline the movie as the titular character. Deadline's report seems somewhat mystified by Madame Web because the original character, Cassandra Webb, was an elderly woman who was severely disabled with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder. The character, first introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man No. 201, was never a headliner of her own comic book series, and she was only a supporting cast member in Peter Parker's adventures as Spider-Man. She possessed telepathic and clairvoyant powers that allowed her to have glimpses of the future. The sci-fi genre owes much of its evolution to a myriad of television series that have shaped and redefined it over the years. These influential shows underscore the power of the small screen to captivate audiences, particularly through sci-fi's distinct combination of innovative storytelling and ambitious visuals. Whether viewers are fans of futuristic technology, extraterrestrial encounters, or dystopian futures, there's something for every kind of sci-fi lover among the genre's best entries.

"Feb 14, 2024"," No deja de ser paradójico: justo ahora que el futuro de las películas de superhéroes es más impredecible que nunca, la última superheroína de Marvel es una pitonisa. El nuevo estreno de la hasta ahora prolífica y rentable factoría, Madame Web, se enfrenta a una bola de cristal opaca y difícil de descifrar ante el evidente declive del género que ha copado hasta la extenuación las pantallas de cine de los últimos años. En ese lugar incierto se sitúa una película que funciona como presentación de un nuevo personaje situado en la órbita de Spider-Man o, para ser exactos, en eso que se llama Universo Spider-Man de Sony, es decir, la franquicia creada por Columbia Pictures, Marvel Entertainment y Sony Pictures a través de una amalgama de películas (Venom, Morbius) que giran alrededor de personajes conectados con las aventuras del Hombre Araña. Y así llegamos a esta Madame Web, inspirada en un personaje secundario —una anciana ciega con poderes para adivinar el futuro— que nació en 1980 de la mano de Denny O’Neil y John Romita, Jr., y que ahora revive en la piel de Dakota Johnson, lejos de ser una anciana en esta nueva película situada en el Nueva York de principios del siglo XXI. Tras un prólogo en la selva amazónica peruana, donde la madre de la nueva heroína da a luz, la historia se sitúa en un mundo de nostálgica inocencia. Con sus botas Dr. Martens y su cazadora de cuero de mercadillo, Cassie Webb —una urbanita solitaria que solo aprecia la compañía de su gato— conduce una ambulancia en una ciudad que aún permanece aferrada a la última década del siglo XX. Se trata de una mujer cuyos poderes se presentan bajo la premonitoria estela del déjà vu: efectivamente, todo lo que ocurre en la pantalla también parece algo vivido anteriormente por el espectador. No deja de ser curioso que además las huellas del pasado se presenten a través de iconos de la publicidad, ya sea un anuncio de Calvin Klein en mitad de una de las secuencias de acción de la película o, sobre todo, la omnipresente Pepsi Cola, evocada a lo largo de todo el filme con el aroma vintage del famoso anuncio noventero de Cindy Crawford a través del letrero de 1936 que estaba situado, antes de su demolición, en un edificio industrial del barrio de Queens. De nuevo, se nos presentan las marcas como referencias globales de una supuesta cultura popular dispuesta como patrimonio para unas nuevas generaciones acríticas con el consumo que, según parece, solo saben guiarse por la iconografía corporativa. Pero Madame Web es sobre todo una película que avanza la llegada de un escuadrón de superheroínas adolescentes cuyo trazo grueso va acompañado de referencias tan poco originales como el tema Toxic, de Britney Spears, incluido en el álbum In The Zone. En ese disco también estaba Everytime, que cantaba y bailaba otro grupo de adolescentes perdidas en la salvaje y nihilista Spring Breakers, la película de Harmony Korine que hace ya más de una década avanzaba los peligros de la desafección milenial. Dirigida por una impersonal realizadora curtida en la televisión, S. J. Clarkson, Madame Web se queda en un lugar sin techo propio, entre el mero avance en los intereses de una franquicia y ese déjà vu parapetado tras las marcas. Y si por algo merece la pena es gracias a Dakota Johnson, una actriz con la auténtica aura de una estrella, capaz de hacer soportable una película envuelta en la decadencia de un género incapaz de escapar de la trampa de su propia tela de araña.",NEGATIVE

By now, you probably already know that the viral line of dialogue from the first ""Madame Web"" trailer — ""he was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died"" — doesn't actually appear in the finished film. The robotic line reading became the easiest thing to mock about a film that arrived fully formed as a cultural punching bag, latched onto largely because it appeared to suggest that the actors in superhero films were as fatigued by the genre as audiences were. And yet, not only does it not appear in director S.J. Clarkson's film, but it retroactively sounds like it was awkwardly stitched together from several separate lines of dialogue, which when placed in tandem, makes it sound like star Dakota Johnson has no enthusiasm to offer. 





Now, I'm not going to suggest that ""Madame Web"" deserved much better than having its fate sealed by such a clumsy marketing campaign — hell, I'm not even going to argue that it's particularly good — but there are sparks of creativity and a sense of ambition in ""Madame Web"" that this genre has been lacking for a while, which at least makes for an intriguing curio in places. It stumbles far more than it takes off, but it doesn't deserve to be written off as a whole, despite the various embarrassing faults that, alongside those moments of genuine inspiration, frequently derail the movie.

After a prologue introducing villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim, having the time of his life hamming it up in an underwritten role), who was in the Amazon researching spiders with Cassandra Webb's mother right before she died, we flash forward to 2003, where we get to meet Dakota Johnson's anti-social paramedic. Following a near-death experience after she plunges into the Hudson River trying to save a man trapped in a car, her perception of time begins to shift. She frequently witnesses premonitions of pivotal moments before they take place. When on the subway, she has the most vivid one yet, as three teenage strangers (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced) are torn limb from limb by a man in a spider suit. This is Ezekiel, who has been experiencing his own premonitions every night, witnessing his death at the hands of these three girls who don't yet know each other, let alone know they're going to become a super-team — Cassandra steps in to save them, and suddenly, they're on the run.





In interviews promoting the film, S.J. Clarkson has tended to describe it as a ""psychological thriller,"" more stripped-down than the typical comic book movie due to the relatively grounded nature of clairvoyance as a superpower. When ""Madame Web"" fully leans into this, it proves more arresting than anticipated, each subsequent set piece built around one of these premonitions more ambitious and hallucinatory than the last. The aforementioned subway sequence is best at placing us within a warped headspace, weaponizing the familiarity that comes with the incessant repetition of events to create a nightmare that only continues to fracture and fold back in on itself.
When utilized in a more conventional fight scene, such as a diner brawl scored to Britney's ""Toxic"" — some points deducted here for the fact that the song was released a year later than the film is set, in 2004 — there are earnest thrills built around the way Cassandra refines plans of action that didn't work out the first time, like a more grounded take on ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or ""Source Code."" Unfortunately, the film itself doesn't seem to acknowledge that these moments are the obvious highlights, and so we trudge into a third act that avoids utilizing this unique power in favor of a cliched, thrill-free showdown at an abandoned Pepsi factory, a hilarious climax considering the surely record-breaking amounts of Pepsi product placement in the two hours preceding it.





Before I pivot into outlining the film's numerous missteps, I do need to make one thing clear: ""Madame Web"" is significantly better than ""Morbius"" for the crucial reason that, while it is often as howlingly bad, it is at least entertaining to watch. ""Morbius"" had to be transformed into a meme to obtain a certain kitsch factor absent from the snooze of a movie itself, whereas ""Madame Web"" is endearingly stupid at face value, which may be why the critical knives feel sharper this time. I'm of the belief that a fun-bad movie is of higher artistic worth than a boring-bad movie, so despite everything I'm going to say about it now, do know that it is practically ""Citizen Kane"" when placed next to Jared Leto's anti-hero outing.

""Morbius"" had to be transformed into a meme to obtain a certain kitsch factor absent from the snooze of a movie itself, whereas ""Madame Web"" is endearingly stupid at face value, which may be why the critical knives feel sharper this time. I'm of the belief that a fun-bad movie is of higher artistic worth than a boring-bad movie, so despite everything I'm going to say about it now, do know that it is practically ""Citizen Kane"" when placed next to Jared Leto's anti-hero outing. 
Within the first 10 minutes, via Ezekiel's nightmares, we see the three girls in their superhero costumes, appearing to set up their transformation by the film's end. It is less of a spoiler and more of a word of warning to say that this does not happen within ""Madame Web,"" as this premonition instead appears to be pre-empting their eventual evolution in a later franchise entry, one it's safe to assume will not happen. Even within a superhero movie purposefully designed to be stripped-down from the bloat plaguing Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC efforts of late, it can't help but tease either the establishment of a wider universe or its fundamental place within a pre-existing one. That proves every bit as egregious in ""Madame Web"" as it was in the recent Marvel series ""Echo,"" which was trumpeted as a standalone effort just to spend the first episode recapping ""Hawkeye.""





Take Cassie's co-worker, played by Adam Scott, whose name has been purposefully left out of the marketing even as it's revealed within the opening 10 minutes (other reviews have spoiled it, but I'll play fair and talk around it). He's a fundamental figure within the lore of another Marvel hero, but in attempting to minimize ties with that looming franchise, the film tries to have its cake and eat it, consciously alluding to recognizable names and iconography linked to Spider-Man without actually saying them outright. It's fan service straining not to be regarded as something so cheap despite its inherent laziness, which is why you don't get to hear, for example, the name of the woman Scott's character has started dating, or the name of the son his sister (Emma Roberts) is heavily pregnant with, even as one moment is built around a baby-shower name-guessing game designed to get audiences so frustrated they start screaming it at the screen. By the time Cassandra goes on a pilgrimage to the Amazon, where she meets a man who tells her, Yoda-style, ""with great responsibility, great power comes,"" you can almost hear the final nail being placed in the coffin of superhero origin stories.





Every moment of campy enjoyment is punctured by the death rattle of the franchise machine it's been forcibly placed within, which only makes its graver narrative flaws harder to overlook. I want to be able to recommend ""Madame Web"" as a good time at the movies — which is, to be clear, different from being a ""good movie"" — but the mechanics of the wider cinematic universe undercut its inspired silliness at every turn. It's a frustrating case of a film neither living up to its potential as an uncomplicated so-bad-its-good romp nor capitalizing on its unique moments to become something that transcends the franchise it's encased in.

"Feb 14, 2024"," In the Marvel Comics universe from which she springs, the character is a minor entity, a blind, older clairvoyant telepath who uses a wheelchair. Further, she’s Spider-Man-adjacent, interacting with the web-slinger on a regular basis. Not here. Spidey is nowhere to be found in this cinematic “Web.” And the makers have shaved decades off Cassandra’s age, given her sight and banished her paralysis to transform her into a young, generic heroine working as a paramedic in New York City. Got to attract that all-important youth demographic.  Cassandra is called upon to save the hides of three young women played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor who will grow up to become three Spider-Women, presented in the pulp pages as Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin. Each has a distinctive superpower, only glancingly alluded to late in the picture. They’re all being pursued by a maniacally obsessive villain extravagantly overplayed by Tahar Rahim. This bad news dude has the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings and fly though the air with the greatest of ease in the manner of, you guessed it, Spider-Man himself. (His form-fitting black costume is a knockoff of Spidey’s signature crimson get-up.) His power comes from the venom of a big red magical spider found only in the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It’s there that he stumbled onto the bug while on a research trip with the pregnant scientist mother of Cassandra. He kills the mom but not before the spider chomps the woman and sends super powerful venom into mother and fetus. The mom dies, the baby lives.  His future vision allows him to see that the three teens will somehow evolve into Spider-Women and will be dedicated to killing him. Kill or be killed is his operational philosophy, so the girls have to go. Not, however, if Cassandra, who also has the ability to see into the future courtesy of that prenatal jolt of spider venom, can help it (though her previsions are scattershot and often unreliable). So the battle is joined.  The action is accompanied by a whole lot of prominent product placement, none more egregious than the picture’s climactic battle that takes place across a gigantic rooftop neon sign for a famous soda pop. Advertising several stories high is what’s on the menu here, though the fact that the extended destruction of the sign nearly kills the main characters might not be quite the message corporate executives had in mind when they OK’d the use of their signage. By the end, it’s made glaringly obvious that the people who made “Madame Web” intended it to be the prelude to sequels featuring the three proto Spider-Women. Spare us. What it represents instead is the nadir of the ongoing decline of Marvel’s box-office power. After the well-publicized underperformance of the recent “The Marvels,” it’s pretty clear that creative exhaustion is well-advanced in the current Marvel superhero universe. It’s past time to give costumed crime fighters a well-deserved rest. With Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, Adam Scott. Directed by S.J. Clarkson from a screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and Clarkson. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence/action and language. Multiple theaters.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," Let’s get one thing out of the way first: Madame Web is not as bad as Morbius, a movie that seems manufactured to be one of the worst things ever put onscreen. But it is bad. The screenplay is credited to four people—Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and director S. J. Clarkson—but the fault lies with Sony, who greenlit the film every step of the way, from conception to the mess you will see (or, probably not see) in theaters.  MADAME WEB ★ (1/4 stars)
Directed by: S. J. Clarkson
Written by: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S. J. Clarkson
Starring: Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, Adam Scott
Running time: 116 mins. Madame Web is ostensibly an origin story for the comic book character, played woodenly by Dakota Johnson, who takes the exact opposite approach of Jared Leto’s intense, method performance in Morbius. Johnson plays Cassie Webb, an awkward New York City paramedic who is uncomfortable around children and has a chemistry-free friendship with her partner Ben Parker (Adam Scott, who somehow got roped into this). Cassie grew up in foster care after her mother (Kerry Bishé) died in childbirth while researching spiders in the Amazon. After an accident on the job, Cassie’s dormant powers awaken, allowing her to catch glimpses of future events. This becomes useful when she encounters Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim, who deserves better), the generic villain has also harnessed some of the Amazon spider’s powers.  Cassie’s future vision is not helpful for the audience, who are forced to watch scene after scene on repeat. Even the opening sequence, about her mother’s history with Sims, gets replayed midway through the film. This means that in essence Clarkson and her editor Leigh Folsom Boyd use an hour of footage to create a two-hour movie. It’s exhausting and it depletes the story of any dramatic tension. What’s at stake if we’ve already seen the action play out once, coated with hazy CGI? The action itself is far worse. Cassie’s powers are limited to her seeing things a few minutes in the future, but she hasn’t been imbued with super strength or venom like Sims, so basically every action sequence is Cassie anticipating the villain’s next move and then doing something else. It’s tedious and frictionless.  The plot, which is a generous word for what unfurls in Madame Web, follows Cassie as she attempts to protect three annoying teenage girls— played by Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced—from Sims, who has had visions of them as Spider-Women killing him. He’s kept himself young with spider venom (or something like that) and he doesn’t want to yield his strength. His assistant (Zosia Mamet, admirably doing her best with almost nothing) uses facial recognition technology to track them, but she’s limited since the film is set in 2003 and Cassie is always one step ahead.  The film is fine for the first 30 minutes and you almost wonder if it might not be as bad as everyone is imagining. But then it somehow gets worse and worse until you just feel embarrassed for the cast, who probably couldn’t tell you what Madame Web is about if asked. Emma Roberts pops up as Ben’s sister-in-law Mary Parker, who is very pregnant. She’s seemingly there as a reference to Spider-Man’s own origin, but without any explanation in the film she feels randomly placed. Same goes for the character of Ben, who is presumably Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben. Is this an Easter egg? Are we getting another Spider-Man reboot? Why does Sony keep making these villain origin stories that never add up to something larger? How bad will Kraven the Hunter be when it comes out in August? Who is the person at Sony who keeps saying, “Yep, this is a good idea, let’s make another one”?  We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Feb 14, 2024"," Dakota Johnson isn’t an obvious choice for a superhero. Best known for “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the actress mostly exudes a laid-back, half-lidded, even soporific energy that only rarely rears up with intensity, as it did in her acclaimed supporting performance in “The Lost Daughter.” But that may be precisely the best argument for casting her as the title character in “Madame Web,” a surprisingly low-key action-adventure movie based on one of the more enigmatic and peripheral characters from the Marvel universe and its ever-expanding sub-realm, the Spider-Verse. The character is Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, a woman whose superpower, at least when it first reveals itself in this entertaining if understated origin story, seems to be nothing more than a nagging sense of déjà vu — a.k.a. the Spidey-sense we are all familiar with from the Spider-Man movies. Cassie, you see, is the orphaned daughter of Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé), a spider researcher who, the prologue tells us, was bitten by one of her subjects while on a field trip to the Peruvian Amazon in the 1970s, when she was pregnant. Fast-forward 30 years, and Constance’s daughter is now a paramedic with the New York Fire Department, partnering with Adam Scott’s Ben Parker. Fans will catch the unsubtle allusion to Spider-Man/Peter Parker’s paternalistic and doomed Uncle Ben. It’s not the last wink or nod that this movie will make to that adjacent cinematic world, even if the timelines do not seem to sync up. Cassie’s powers, triggered by a near-death experience on the job, will continue to develop as she finds herself thrown into the role of a mother figure and mentor to a trio of rebellious, under-parented teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced) who have been targeted by the film’s villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). Ezekiel also has some spider-venom-induced abilities: not just clairvoyant dreams of his own — he sees himself dying at the hands of the three girls — but more conventional wall-crawling skills. There will be no web-slinging here, but plenty of adolescent angst and eye-rolling. For much of the film, which was directed in un-showy fashion by TV veteran S.J. Clarkson, making her feature debut, there is refreshingly little of the testosteronal bluster, bombast and ballistics of most comic-book movies. A central theme in this screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless and Claire Parker is motherlessness and the maternal instinct. That’s a nice, unexpected thing to find in a Marvel movie, albeit one that’s perhaps a little too underplayed. Some fans may simply miss all the CGI candy we’ve been conditioned to expect from movies of this ilk. I have no doubt that Johnson is talented enough to handle a little more heavy lifting, but Cassie hasn’t been given much to explore here emotionally, even in a story that sends her back to Peru for some extra-dimensional communing with the spirit of her dead mom. At times, the movie has the moody feel of a supernatural suspense thriller, not a comic-book-style showdown. (By the way, that’s not a complaint.) It is while watching the 1951 version of “A Christmas Carol” on TV that Cassie has an epiphany about the strangely prophetic visions she’s been having. Scrooge (Alastair Sim) asks the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come: “Are these the shadows of things that must be, or are they the shadows of things that might be?” It is only then that Cassie learns the film’s central lesson: The future is not yet written (other than the near-certainty of a sequel). It’s a lesson that she eventually imparts to her young protégées, still struggling to find their crime-fighting place in a male-dominated society. “Madame Web” is no blockbuster, but in its own quiet way, it manages to break down a few barriers.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," 
	Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe started going downhill in the wake of Avengers: Endgame, the most popular Marvel character appearing in movies has reverted back to Spider-Man. With Sony in control of all of the surrounding characters in the Spider-Verse, they have attempted to capitalize on Spider-Man’s appeal by giving stand-alone movies to those lesser-known heroes and villains.
 
	The two Venom movies and Morbius were less than successful, so they’re back for another bite at the apple with Madame Web, which centers on Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), a New York City paramedic whose mother died giving birth to her while in Peru studying – you guessed it – spiders. Following an accident in which she is saved by fellow paramedic Ben Parker (Adam Scott), Webb starts noticing the strange ability to have visions of the near future.
 
	At the same time, evil guy Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who has spider powers because of (spoiler), is seeing visions of three women who are currently teenagers – Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) – in their own Spider outfits killing him at some point in the future. Ezekiel goes on the hunt to kill them before that ever happens, with Cassandra trying to block at him at every turn with her growing powers.
 
	Written and directed by S.J. Clarkson, and co-written by Matt Sazama, Buck Sharpless, and Claire Parker, the film initially shows some promise before being taken over by many of the same problems that have plagued other Spider spin-offs. The film’s set-up, in which Cassandra’s mom meets her demise, is relatively solid, as is the introduction to the work friendship between Cassandra and Ben, which has a fun vibe to it.
 
	However, once the action starts in earnest, Clarkson and her team seem to have no idea how to make the film dramatic or even interesting. The way they chose to show Cassandra’s visions is not that confusing, but the back-and-forth between what might happen and what actually does keep the film from having any kind of momentum. There’s also a sameness to the sequences that take any surprise out of the equation, lessening the excitement in the process.
 
	Even though the film has four credited writers, none of them come close to having anything clever to say with their dialogue. Much of what the actors are required to say is overly expository and/or repetitive. The film is an origin story for Cassandra, Anya, Julia, and Mattie at the same time, which is a lot for any movie to support, much less one as poorly written as this one.
 
	Johnson has done well in other films, most notably The Lost Daughter, but she is not a good fit at all for this role. She shows almost no emotion, part of which is called for by the character, but when the film’s bigger moments need her to show some star power, she has none to give. Merced, Sweeney, and O’Connor are entertaining as a trio, but the film overpromises and under-delivers on what they’re allowed to do as budding superheroes.
 
Like so many other comic book films in recent years, Madame Web can’t live up to its potential thanks to decisions of the filmmakers. It does have one positive to offer, though: An abundance of CPR scenes gives anybody who sees the film enough of an education to probably get certified themselves.

"Feb 14, 2024"," This is the first feature for Director S.J. Clarkson who has 20 years of directing quality episodic TV on her resume. (Succession, Orange is the New Black, Marvel Netflix shows Jessica Jones and The Defenders). There are lots of spiders here, but no Spiderman heroes. This one, suited up in a black spider costume, fails to impress as villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim).  The plot covers events starting with Cassie’s Mom’s backstory in the Amazon in 1973 where she discovered a spider with a venom that could kill or heal. But then gets into gear with Cassie careening through the streets with her her NYC EMT partner Ben Parker (Adam Scott – Severance), to save a woman who’s been in a car crash. Cassie placidly leaves while the family is trying to thank her.  Cassie’s precognition begins to reveal itself when she goes to take the New York subway. She sees danger for 3 teen girls before they even walk onto the train. When they enter the car, she realizes trouble is coming and springs into action. That’s when Sims in his black getup goes after the girls. The rest of the film is Cassie with Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Amy Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Maddy Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) trying to elude the murderous villain. At first they don’t know if Cassie wants to kidnap or protect them. Cassie keeps one step ahead of the frustrated Sims which makes him put pressure on his IT specialist Zosia Mamet (Molli and Max in the Future) to keep tabs on their whereabouts. Mamet is wasted in this film basically just sitting in front of a bank of monitors. Script by committee doesn’t always work. This screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, with Director S.J. Clarkson is hard to follow. And the editing doesn’t help. We also found the use of flash frames and quick cuts with special effects more confusing than eye catching. And we think Clarkson’s direction didn’t give the characters enough emotion, especially from Johnson and Scott. Johnson is gorgeous, but both seem to go through the movie with vacant expressions. And Johnson’s makeup is always picture perfect, even after nearly drowning.  There are a couple of scenes that seem so out of place. The one where the girls disobey Cassie and go to a diner ending up dancing on a table rimmed with drooling teen boys is one in particular. And the product placement is blatant during the climactic fight scene with the girls and Sims on top of a building bearing a huge neon lit Pepsi Cola Sign. We didn’t know it the logo would be foreshadowed with Cassie drinking a can of Pepsi with the logo perfectly placed earlier in the film. In every battle, Cassie gets to use her newfound power of seeing things before they happen, good at giving specific orders to run, duck, stop, jump, and even pulls a piece of sheep metal off a wall to use as shield at the very last moment. It’s Marvel taking you down the rabbit hole of inane action sequences again. Although the gorgeous Johnson provides important lessons in how to administer CPR, this messy film couldn’t save itself. This Spidey spinoff spins no well-constructed web. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," We have, in recent years, come to view the bits of the live-action Spider-Man empire that Sony has retained – heads, thumbs and inner organs floating in jars – as near-annual gifts for those in need of a punching bag. The wretched Morbius? The chaotic Venom? You remember flinging uneaten nachos at them. Right? Nothing about the lead-up to Madame Web has inspired confidence in a reversal. The trailer was laughed out of cinemas. No press show was scheduled for the circling vultures. Dakota Johnson has just about avoided rolling her eyes at nerds from flunky-monkey.com on the junket circuit. I bring little good news from the first commercial screening. The dozen or so paying customers and I gaped at a bad film that feels cobbled together from failed attempts to make five or six mostly worse films.  To be fair, the first sequence in the main body is genuinely entertaining. Give me the romantic comedy with Johnson and Adam Scott driving an ambulance about New York City. They josh. They save lives. They don’t cause you to rub your eyes in dismay. Sadly, that takes up about 10 minutes. The rest concerns itself with four origin stories, a bio-horror fantasy, mad scientists and hints at an apparent connection with the core Spider-Man story. (Pay attention to Scott’s character and his sister, if you can be bothered.) Any comprehensive outline of the plot would require a lobotomy, but let’s give it a go. We start in Peru during the early 1970s. A pregnant scientist is searching for a rare spider with the aid of sleek, evil Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). There is a tussle. She dies in childbirth and, yes, 30 years later the baby has become Johnson’s nominatively determined Cassie Web.  Arithmeticians among you will have worked out that this takes us up to the millennial years. By golly, the film doesn’t want you to forget it. We see a Blockbuster video store in practically the first shot. We see a huge mural for Beyoncé’s first album (a Sony release). A key scene revolves around Britney Spears’s Toxic (see preceding parentheses). Sadly, you can’t just put everyone in crushed-velvet loons as you might when making a film set in the late 1960s. Anyway, after immersion in the East River, Cassie starts to develop signs of what is never explicitly called spidey sense. Essentially, her life takes on the quality of a film watched while sitting on your remote control. Unexpected rewinds abound. Out there, the near-robotic Sims – Rahim uncharacteristically delivers each line as if a cord has been pulled in a nearby Action Man’s chest – is tracking down three young women who, if unstopped, may grow to be his Spider-nemeses. One of them is the suddenly unavoidable, here underused Sydney Sweeney. The other two aren’t. Cassie becomes their protector. Lost you? Sent you to sleep? No longer reading? Never mind. The clattering mess makes little sense to itself. If the recent travails of Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe suggest the Fall of Rome (and they probably don’t), then the increasingly barking Sony Marvels call to mind some smaller, more demented empire on a windy isthmus untroubled by classical elegance. The line “When you take on the responsibility, great power will come,” as someone actually says, feels like the Roger Corman straight-to-video version of the MCU’s “with great power comes great responsibility”. The comparison is not entirely unflattering. For all its gimcrack incoherence, Madame Web – which would be nothing without Johnson’s charm – is a darn sight less pompous and up itself than the overstuffed Disney content. Nothing can, however, wave away product placement at a level that defies satire. Not only are bottles and cans of Pepsi positioned for easy contemplation, but the film also ends with a fight on a giant sign advertising that beverage. Lip-smackin’, face-slappin’, brain-eatin’, dumb-makin’, money-wastin’ Madame Web. Ah!",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is Sony’s latest attempt at maintaining rights to the Marvel characters they purchased decades ago. It’s a film so miscalculated, so reminiscent of the pre-MCU age of comic-book cinema, that it reminds audiences averse to the Marvel and DC cinematic universes of how much sloppier and stultifying the genre used to be.  The problems begin with the decision to adapt the character of Madame Web in the first place. In the comics, Cassandra Web is a blind, paralyzed old woman who spends her life hooked up to life support issuing precognitive predictions to Peter Parker and his allies. Even within the extended Spider-Man mini-universe, Cassandra is an afterthought, a fourth-string character at best. This film completely revamps Cassandra, turning her into Cassie (Dakota Johnson), a young paramedic who suddenly develops psychic abilities that draw her into a world with metahumans all linked by astonishingly tenuous connections to mutated spiders. As Cassie begins to experience visions of the future, Madame Web morphs into a paranoid thriller. To her credit, Clarkson doesn’t fall prey to the bloat of recent superhero cinema, keeping the story relatively grounded. The TV veteran draws on her experience working on Marvel’s Jessica Jones in playing up the heightened tension between Cassie and the film’s villain, a fellow precog named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who also possesses arachnid-themed powers and is on the hunt for a trio of young women he believes may be fated to kill him. By coincidence or fate, Cassie ends up on a subway car with the women in question: Mattie (Celester O’Connor), Julia (Sydney Sweeney), and Anya (Isabela Merced). Cassie manages to whisk the girls to safety, causing Ezekiel to redouble his efforts to track them down. There’s potential here for a tense chase film—of Ezekiel pursuing the women as Cassie struggles to anticipate his actions. Almost immediately, however, Madame Web grinds to a halt as it gets bogged down in scene after scene of characters, both good and bad, standing around explaining their backgrounds, hang-ups, and desires. Every few minutes, Cassie the reluctant guardian reminds everyone that she’s experiencing visions, or Ezekiel monologues to himself about how badly he needs to find Mattie, Julia, and Anya and kill them before they can grow up to become threats to his power. Eventually, the film reveals a connection that binds Cassie and Ezekiel, at which point the two individually and jointly rehash that plot point as well. No one can make this kind of dialogue sound natural, but least of all Johnson, whose forte is playing young women who are awkwardly detached from others, sometimes even themselves. While that initially serves Cassie well in the early scenes that establish her as a misfit introvert, it becomes incongruous when she must assume the mantle of a hero. The film sets out a clear character arc for Cassie to develop from isolated shut-in to righteous protector, but Johnson never once conveys a sense that Cassie has any remote interest in anyone else’s well-being. On the rare occasion that Madame Web deigns to provide any action whatsoever, it consists largely of incoherent bursts of overlaid images that are rendered all the more nonsensical by camera movements that knock the frame askew in a reflection of Ezekiel’s wall-crawling antics. The film’s attempts to counter the story’s wearisome exposition also spiral into the absurd with snap zooms occurring on nearly every cut during tense conversations. The nicest thing you can say about the action is that it tones down the CGI overload common to modern-day comic-book cinema, at least until the final act when things come to a head in such a farcical climax of animated sparks and explosions that it literally takes place in an abandoned fireworks factory. Madame Web’s unremitting tedium is only exacerbated by having to play by the complex rules dictating Sony’s current deal with Disney, in which its standalone Spider-Verse movies have to broadly fit within Marvel’s plans for Peter Parker but can never show him or even mention him by name. It’s like being at a party where everyone has decided to shun someone and that someone is the host. But even more egregious is some of the most egregious moments of product placement in recent cinematic memory, with Pepsi products shown so frequently that the brand even factors into the film’s finale. Everything about Madame Web reeks of cynicism, a collection of tax and IP loophole exploitations masquerading as entertainment.

"Feb 14, 2024"," WHEN I’M WATCHING COMIC  BOOK MOVIES, I have a general rule that has served me well over the years: If, by the end of the film, I cannot adequately explain precisely what powers (and, hopefully, what weaknesses) the heroes and the villains have, the movie has failed on such a fundamental level that something went terribly wrong somewhere in the writing, shooting, or editing of the picture. The film starts strong, at least in the sense that it starts so off-the-wall goofy that you can’t help but kind of cheer for it. A scientist (Kerry Bishé) is in the Peruvian Amazon searching for a spider whose bites heal; she happens to be very late in pregnancy. A man accompanying her is looking for the same spider in the hopes that it will give him powers. They find the spider, he shoots her, and she is grabbed by a tribe of spider-people who are all dressed in what can only be described as spiderweb-loincloths and they swing her back to a cave like so many spider-Tarzans where they try to save her by letting one of the spiders (which gave them their powers and has healing properties) bite her. She dies, but the baby lives, and we flash forward to New York City, 2003, when the baby has grown into Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), ambulance driver extraordinaire. She’s having weird visions that turn out to be glimpses of the future. She can see what happens and her failure to change what happens leads to the death of a friend, demonstrating to her that with great power comes, you know. By film’s end, the visions have somehow transformed into an ability to astral-project herself into multiple places at the same time, which I guess the director and four credited writers threw in there because the film’s final set piece involving the dodging of fireworks and sheet metal seemed kind of lame. Also seeing glimpses of the future is Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), the man who killed Cassie’s mother all those years ago. In his visions, three spider-women are hunting him, eventually killing him. Why? We have no idea, but neither does he. Who are they? He has no idea, but he has hacked the 2003-era NSA, which provides him 2023-era tracking abilities, and he has aged-down his artistic renderings of his visions, which have allowed the NSA program to track them. Don’t ask questions, just roll with it. But ask questions we must! Because here we see the second key factor for any serviceable comic book movie: the villain must have a motivation we understand. And I have no idea what Ezekiel’s motivation in this movie is at all, at any point, other than “I don’t want these spider-ladies to kill me.” Which, fair enough, but why do they want to kill him? How has he gotten rich in the intervening decades? Did the spider bite turn him into a genius businessman? Is he a villain, using his powers for ill? Has he become a spider-protector like the spider-Tarzans from earlier, and feels he must kill the spider-women to keep saving the city? No idea, we have no sense of him or his life outside of the very narrow role he plays in connecting Cassie with the teen girls who will grow to be the spider-women. In short, Madame Web is a bad movie. It could have been an extravagantly goofy bad movie as promised in that opening sequence with the spider-Tarzans. (Venom was also a bad movie, but at least it had the saving grace of Tom Hardy arguing with himself in two different voices like an intoxicated derelict suffering a psychotic break.) Instead, it devolves into the same sort of dark, sloppy CGI mush, with action scenes stitched together in an editing room after the fact rather than composed thoughtfully beforehand, that we’ve seen a million times before.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2024"," It was an inevitable collapse after a reign of such unwarranted length and unparalleled indulgence, superhero movies totalling eight a year during the 2010s, a lucrative yet tiresome stronghold. There were brief highlights within the flurry but such lazy overreliance left little room for other blockbuster genres to flourish and led studios to scrape barrels, giving us more and more of something we’d ultimately had enough of. Last year saw an overwhelming rejection (The Flash, Shazam 2, The Marvels, Ant-Man 3, Aquaman 2 all underperforming) and now the fallout, the first of the year doubling up as a Powerpoint presentation on what went wrong and how not to fix it. Developed back in 2019, given a green light in 2020, filmed during 2022 and then allegedly undergoing reshoots last year, Madame Web was envisioned as a way to extend Marvel and Sony’s Spider-Man universe: a business, if not creative, sense decision after the surprise success of both Venom and Into the Spider-Verse in 2018. An elderly clairvoyant known in the comics for assisting Spider-Man is now turned into a young paramedic, played by Dakota Johnson, who doesn’t even know that Spider-Man exists, in a film desperate to pretend that it’s something it isn’t. Such confusion was on display in the launch of last year’s trailer, immediately going viral for its laughably unsure tone, convoluted plot and checked-out leading lady. Grimly aware of the sea shift, it’s now being referred to as a gritty suspense thriller in press materials with Johnson insisting during press that it’s a standalone movie in its own standalone universe. The tangled mess that has all created will surely lead to a fascinating oral history years later but for now, with everyone involved fearfully and contractually insisting that the finished product is exactly as intended, all we have is a 110-minute head-scratcher, a baffling string of question marks that remain unanswered. A clumsy opener set in 1970s Peru is our first red flag, junkily directed and shoddily written, setting up our heroine’s absurd backstory which has something to do with spiders as well as spider-people. Thirty years later, she’s a paramedic working alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott), also known to most as Peter Parker’s uncle, except for in this movie, or at least this version, with all references to Spider-Man scrubbed from the end-product. After a near-death experience she discovers that she can briefly see into the future which allows her to save the lives of three teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor) being targeted by a madman who also has ties to her past. With a script written by four people, including its director, SJ Clarkson, a location that’s mostly Boston doubling up as New York, and a lead who looks like she’d really rather be anywhere else, there is something sickly compelling about how disjointed and thoroughly incompetent Madame Web is, less as so-bad-its-fun Midnight Movie and more studio film-making in the 2020s at its very worst case study. The attempt to reposition it as a “suspense thriller” ultimately does the film more harm than good not just because there are absolutely no suspense or thrills here but also because if we were to take it as something more grounded, with no ties to the heightened superheroics of the world it comes from then we would find it even harder to suspend our disbelief throughout. There is nothing gritty or believable about any of it. The film is as dumb and schlocky as the worst of the genre, with lousy network TV effects, uninvolving action and unfunny and inelegant dialogue, its characters drowning in poorly written exposition (even if the much-memed viral line from the trailer is sadly not in the movie itself). It also contains some of the most egregious examples of product placement I have seen in a long time, the worst of which has Pepsi and Pepsi ads show up at key dramatic moments, including an entire final set piece involving the actual Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens (before a coda involving the characters enjoying some ice-cold bottles of Pepsi). As teased by the trailer, Johnson is distractingly disengaged. She is an actor who can work so well if used in just the right way by just the right director, here showing us the real limit of her abilities, one of the most ill-fitting tentpole leads I can remember. There’s such misjudged lethargy to her performance, not helped by her co-star Sweeney, in bizarre schoolgirl cosplay, and a small, odd role for Zosia Mamet, three actors who play as far too internal and muted for the frantic urgency of a flashy film such as this. Their casting is just one of many baffling decisions made here, the most baffling of which is the removal of any Spider-Man reference, made seemingly late in the day. An entire subplot has Emma Roberts as Ben Parker’s pregnant sister about to give birth to a baby whose name is never revealed (we almost hear it might start with maybe a P in one poorly edited scene) while the finale awkwardly rushes through the three teens in superhero costumes in the future (all play characters from the comics, including Spider-Woman). There’s even a strange butchering of the classic line about power and responsibility, its words scrambled around like we’re watching some janky rip-off made by people afraid of legal action. What the average cinema-goer is supposed to get from this unholy mess, made curious only after a read of its torturous Wikipedia page, is a mystery. Superhero films are not dead (just today the trailer for Deadpool & Wolverine broke a YouTube record) but the age of superhero films like Madame Web surely is – soulless boardroom product made by no one who seems to care for no one who wants to watch.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," “Madame Web” has a lot to recommend it, and for a while — a good long while — it seems like it’s going to be one of the best Marvel superhero movies of the past few years. It has the superhero thing, but it’s more like an action thriller with supernatural elements. And it has a heroine who is interesting in her own right, with a life and a personal history that would make us want to watch her in any kind of movie. Dakota Johnson plays Cassandra, who grew up in foster care, because her mother, a research scientist, was murdered on the day Cassandra was born. Thirty years later, she works as a paramedic, and in a terrific little sequence, while rescuing someone, she becomes trapped in a car that goes over a bridge and plunges into water. Cassandra clinically dies for a few minutes, and when she is brought back to life, she finds she has a peculiar new power. Cassandra’s power (I hesitate to call it a superpower, because it’s barely even useful) is that she sometimes knows what’s going to happen two or three minutes into the future. As often shown in superhero origin stories, she can’t control this ability. Sometimes she has it, but sometimes she doesn’t, and the sheer randomness of her clairvoyant capacity makes this gift more of an annoyance than a blessing. But it’s the very limitation of her power that makes Cassandra a lot more fascinating than, say, Captain Marvel, who can do absolutely everything, but who cares? One afternoon, she is on a commuter train in New York when she envisions an immediate future in which three teenage girls, who happen to be sitting in her train car, are beaten to death by a mysterious dark-haired man (played by French actor Tahar Rahim).  It would be easier for her to walk away and mind her business, but she can’t let that happen. Instead, she persuades the girls to get off the train. The rest of the movie is about her effort to keep them safe and prepare for battle against the man pursuing them. Up to and including that moment, “Madame Web” is going along beautifully. But from this point on, it’s like there’s a slow leak in a tire. Something has been lost, and gradually it becomes clear that a movie that was promising, smart and adult has shifted into something trivial. That shift coincides with a shift in emphasis, from Cassandra to the three girls she’s trying to save. The actresses playing the girls — Sydney Sweeney of “White Lotus” and “Euphoria” fame, “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” star Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor of “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” — are engaging, but they’re playing silly people, and so the movie becomes silly.  It’s no fun watching them to the finish, and the end of the film itself is disappointing — too bland for a superhero movie and too ridiculous for an action thriller. Ultimately, the movie leaves us with the impression that a sequel is planned, but don’t bet on that ever happening. Still, for much of “Madame Web,” even when it turns bad, it’s a pleasure to see Johnson in this kind of movie. Like Robert Downey Jr. in “Iron Man” — and unlike Brie Larson in “Captain Marvel” — Johnson doesn’t simplify herself or dumb herself down but takes her complexity with her. She elevates the superhero genre — until the genre pulls her back in.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," Dakota Johnson brings an appealingly grounded sense of humour to Madame Web, a somewhat spirited superhero origin story that mostly plays as the first chapter of a saga that does not inspire enthusiasm for subsequent instalments. Making her feature debut, television director SJ Clarkson crafts some solid action scenes in this tale of a New York paramedic who is suddenly blessed and cursed with the ability to see the future. Anyone who has closely followed comic-book cinema for the last two decades will also be able to anticipate the twists and turns the story will take. Sony releases Madame Web in the UK and US on February 14, with early tracking suggesting the film will not reverse the recent downward commercial trend of superhero films. (The studio’s most recent Marvel production, Morbius, grossed only $167 million worldwide, while Disney’s female-driven comic-book picture from last year, The Marvels, collected a paltry $206 million.) Johnson’s connection to the Fifty Shades Of Grey franchise may add marquee value, but this Marvel project lacks the name-brand recognition of the company’s more famous characters. (Madame Web is connected to the Spider-Man universe, although the Webslinger does not make an appearance.) Expect lacklustre reviews and lukewarm returns. Set in Manhattan in 2003, the film stars Johnson as Cassie Web, a paramedic who is good at her job despite a general discomfort around people. (The cause may very well be traced to her single mother dying during childbirth, sending Cassie into foster care.) After nearly drowning, Cassie is brought back to life and is shocked to discover that she can now suddenly (although unpredictably) see future events — including the fact that a murderous stranger named Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) wants to kill three seemingly ordinary young women named Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced) and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor).  One of Madame Web’s advantages is that it does not require the viewer to possess knowledge of any outside comic-book properties in order to follow the plot. (That said, those familiar with Spider-Man will recognise the importance of a few of this film’s supporting players.) Bolstered by Johan Soderqvist’s booming, boisterous score, the picture does its best to capitalise on Cassie’s mysterious power, offering fun time loops as she plays out a scenario, realises what will go wrong, and then corrects her actions as she prepares for the actual encounter. Cassie does not have incredible strength or speed, but Madame Web makes the case that the ability to review your mistakes before they happen is a special gift. Often, when second-tier superheroes get standalone films the resulting picture tends to be self-deprecating or irreverent, acknowledging the fact that the character is not as compelling as, say, Spider-Man. Madame Web is not overly joke-y, but Johnson does give Cassie an ironic detachment, which alleviates the story’s strained gravitas. It also helps that, although Cassie is only in her early 30s, she finds herself exasperated by the immaturity of these teens she is determined to protect. Sweeney, Merced and O’Connor are delightfully bratty, and their annoying-kid-sister rapport with Johnson provides some of the picture’s intermittent laughs.  As we will learn, Ezekiel has the same power as Cassie, although he also possesses the qualities of a spider – including climbing walls and killing his adversaries with a toxin. His desire to eliminate Julia, Anya and Mattie is tied to a concern he has about what they will do in the future, and Rahim exudes a snarling menace. Unfortunately, his monotone line readings are frequently unintentionally hilarious, and the Cesar-winning actor feels ill at ease in such an underwritten villain role. Clarkson, who directed episodes of the Marvel series Jessica Jones and The Defenders, focuses on the relationship between the women, who learn they have more in common than expected. (In addition, Cassie finally has to care about others, an unoriginal but effective character arc thanks to Johnson’s empathetic performance.) The filmmaker works with a relatively modest budget to devise a few choice fight sequences that are elevated by Cassie’s growing understanding of her powers. She cannot see the future on command, but as she becomes more comfortable with her abilities — and discovers the reason why she acquired these powers — the more she can channel them. But those diversions fail to distract from yet another origin story meant to open the door to a larger narrative universe. No matter how likeable Cassie and her friends are, they are powerless in the face of a plot that goes through the motions, revealing ‘shocking’ twists about her past and building to an overblown finale. Madame Web argues that no one’s future is written, but it is very easy to see exactly where this film is going. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Feb 14, 2024"," Quick Take: Madame Web should've been a fun and fantastical origin story for a dynamic comic character with real spin-off potential. Instead it’s a mishmash of barely interesting plot points, disjointed visual trickery, and underwhelming performances. More than anything else, Madame Web proves it’s not enough to throw all the “expected” set pieces in a movie, you actually need to know what to do with them. Official Synopsis: Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present. Madame Web, Sony’s third standalone spin-off of a Marvel comic character, opened the door for the studio to fully reimagine the origins of its titular character and set the stage for robust worldbuilding in its Spider-Man Universe. The Cassandara Webb of the comics is an elderly woman, with a neuromuscular disease, connected to a life support system that resembles a spider web. She’s fully in control of her clairvoyance and precognition.  Webb’s an exceptionally powerful mutant and infrequent supporting character in the Spider-Man comic book series. There’s very little known of her beginnings. When carving a lane for future stories, it doesn’t get much better than having firm grounding in source material but an otherwise clear field to play.  There’s something to be said for nostalgia in movie styling (we won't talk about those reshoot blunders). Setting a story in the recent past opens the way for the sleight-of-hand of soft revisionist storytelling often beneficial when telling a story with supernatural elements. For audiences, everything feels familiar and contemporary but the edges are just blurry enough to make way for a world full of magic, mystery, and untold danger existing alongside the mundane. What Madame Web gets right(ish) is blending an intentionally pulp-esque vibe into a recognizable version of the contemporary New York City circa 2003. The story moves at a digestible (and thankfully relatively quick) pace of a thriller. So it’s a shame that absolutely nothing else; not direction, editing, character arcs, visual effects, cast performances, or story direction, amounts to more than a “comic movie” checklist neither the screenwriters nor the director knew how to navigate. The movie opens with a flashback, because of course it does, of a pregnant Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) deep in the Peruvian Amazon in 1973. She’s on the hunt for a spider said to have miraculous healing properties. She’s whip smart, driven, and desperate. So desperate she misses all the glaring red flags that her impatient head of security, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), isn’t really there to protect her waving in her face. Through hamfisted dialogue, a lore info-dump about a secretive indigenous people with powers, known as Las Aranas, (that would’ve carried more weight as naturally occurring revelations), and scenes of a furtive tent search practically lifted from Tomb Raider, it’s obvious Sims’ intends to acquire the spider for his own ends. The action sequences that follow shortly after the expected doublecross are a reminder that staging and filming action and stunts is a skill not all directors possess. Director S.J. Clarkson relies on quick cuts, odd camera angles, and bouncing shots of rustling foliage and blurred glimpses of people leaping from great heights to simulate action and fast-moving “spider people” traveling through the trees coming to the rescue. It’s the first sign, of many, that Madame Webb’s practical and visual effects are a detriment to an already poorly conceived storyline. And although the flashback is a smart entry point for Webb’s origin story, it’s also the movie's first failure. Ezekiel Sims, a character also pulled from the comic Spider-verse, and his connection with Constance Webb offer a rational way to introduce the various mystical rites and ceremonies associated with the arachnid-based superpowers. In the comics he’s proven to be knowledgeable about spider-derived powers and resourceful, if selfish. His powers are stolen and that theft carries far-reaching consequences. But instead of taking a beat to really dig into both his background and the society whose secrets he’s hunting, Madame Web sloppily paints Sims with an imminent “villain of the week” energy and yada-yadas Constance Webb’s first (and last) contact with Las Aranas; reducing it to a failed attempt to save her life that manages to spare her child.  Even without knowing Sims’ background - or his importance - in the comics, it’s painfully obvious that his character’s poorly thought out. The script written by Clarkson, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless and Claire Parker never fleshes out his motivations beyond increasingly annoying rants about needing to “protect” all he’s built. The storyline sheds absolutely no light on how he escaped the jungle without incident thereby wasting an opportunity to: 1) reveal more about Las Aranas and/or the rites involving the spider and 2) explain how and why this French-speaking mercenary is even in Peru hunting superpowers to begin with. This failing, regrettably, is a hallmark of all the character development and worldbuilding from this point forward. Brace because it becomes intrusively tiresome. There are other important elements along the way treated as throw-aways moments rather than touchstones essential to sticking the landing in the second and third acts. The timeline soon jumps to 2003 and a thirty-year-old Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson). Cassie’s an EMT with attachment issues and a fast-approaching future as a Manhattan cat lady. She’s cynical, reckless, and, after (an unexplored) childhood in foster care, purposefully emotionally unavailable. Everything she knows about her mother fits in a suitcase kept under her bed. Johnson’s portrayal of Cassie does a barely serviceable job of embodying a woman who actively avoids personal connections outside work. There are a few scenes - and relationships - intended to be both Spider-verse easter eggs and demonstrate Cassie actually does care about her circle of friends particularly her EMT partner Ben Parker (Adam Scott) and his family despite her aversion to fully being present as a friend. Sadly, Johnson’s perpetual smoothed-faced delivery results in an emotionally dead and inauthentic portrayal. Her middling efforts can't overcome the script’s flimsy dialogue, joyless quips, glaring worldbuilding inconsistencies (like a New York cab without lojack or CPR that never includes clearing an airway) and constantly unfinished looking and/or awkwardly executed visual effects or stunts. Johnson lacks the range to play a character that simultaneously requires make believe to bring the story/world to life and the ability to make us believe in them.  Compounding the errors baked into the opening, Madame Web skips over everything related to showing how Ezekiel Sims actually fits into the world in the present day. Beyond a few moments meant to show the lengths he’ll go to preserve his power; including plotting murder based solely on a vision. His entire part of the story lacks depth. That might not be so unforgivable had the time been spent adding texture to this world through the story arcs of the teenage (future) dynamos: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor).  So, transitioning from the, Cassie’s spidey senses activate, portion of this adventure to Cassie not only embracing her powers but becoming the type of person who selflessly leaps in to save three teenage strangers, never really clicks the way it needs to. That misfire leads to an entire latter half that requires a level of belief suspension not even amnesia can accomplish. The stakes don’t feel real. The journey lacks the kind of compelling grit to keep you invested and rooting for anyone’s survival. This might be the first time that including a training montage - instead of a wholly unbelievable and lackluster trip back into the jungle - might’ve served to better bridge that gap.  But alas, no. The end result is a tangled and fragmented narrative that trips over its own plot holes on a joyless slog to nowhere. The anticipatory energy of the movie's final moments is entirely unearned. No one’s buying this as the origin story for a person meant to assume the role of mentor and powerful oracle to those destined to wield powers in the Spider-verse. Because Madame Webb’s built on the type of shoddy character development and disjointed storytelling often blamed on the “shortcomings” of comics as source material. But in reality, is indicative of a weak pen-game, a complete lack of respect for the genre and no vision, creativity, or talent behind the scenes. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," The latest “Spider-Man” spin-off feature—connected with the MCU but not a part of it—is the third title in the series, following the inexplicably popular “Venom” movies and the deserved bomb “Morbius.”  Based on the postscript, “Madame Web” hopes to become a franchise, but it’s more likely to go the “Morbius” route and disappear after a single misguided outing. The movie is a clumsy origin story for a minor-league Marvel character whose elevation to major movie status is but the latest example of how filmmakers have been scraping the bottom of the comic company’s barrel to come up with new figures to topline now that the real stars—Spider-Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Iron Man, X-Men and the like—have been run into the ground.  In the comics Madame Web, usually playing a supporting role, is an elderly, blind woman in a wheelchair whose main power lies in being clairvoyant.  Now (or more properly in 2003, when most of the story is set)  she’s twenty-something Cassandra (like the Homeric prophetess), or “Cassie,” Webb (Dakota Johnson), a NYFD paramedic who starts to have premonitions about events in the immediate future after she nearly drowns to death rescuing a man whose car has crashed on a bridge.  The flash-forwards are depicted in messy collages contrived by director SJ Clarkson (in her first feature after years of TV work), cinematographer Mauro Fiore (“Dark Phoenix,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home”) and editor Leigh Folsom Boyd (“Black Widow,” as well as the two most recent Spider-Man movies). Ezekiel, meanwhile, has used the stolen spider to gain powers that help him become a megalomaniacal mogul of some sort—but one troubled  by dreams he takes to mean that he’s going to be killed by three spider-girls who, as depicted in  these visions, look like the creepy, low-rent special effects they are.  He kills a government agent who’d been inserted into his circle to secure information on his nefarious activities and uses her ID to gain access to all the government’s security apparatus.  He then instructs his security head (Zosia Mamet, in a thoroughly thankless role that keeps her constantly seated at a bank of computer monitors) to employ its facial recognition systems to identify and locate the teen girls—geeky Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), over-privileged Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and spunky Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced)—from his dream.  His goal is to kill them before they kill him. He does find the trio, but by then all have coincidentally, if briefly, bumped into Cassie in various ways, and by the time he’s located them, they’re all—again coincidentally—gathered in the same subway car she’s just boarded.  Foreseeing Sims, in his black spider-man costume, arriving to kill them, Cassie forces them all to run from the train with her, gradually persuading them of the danger they’re in.  From then on the movie becomes one long chase, with Cassie desperately foiling Sims’s assaults and the girls acting, for the most part, very stupidly; in the big final confrontation the Parkers, to whom Cassie’s entrusted the trio, get involved as Mary, inevitably, has to be driven to the hospital to give birth, giving Sims the chance to find his prey.  In the end, the script cops out, as the villain’s visions are abruptly revealed to be utterly wrong.  It’s just the last instance in which the screenplay, attributed to director Clarkson and three others, proves to be sloppily constructed and illogical even by very loose comic-book standards.  It also raises some questions about Spider-Man mythology: Ben Parker is Peter Parker’s uncle, whose murder leads the orphaned kid to become the costumed hero.  But his wife is traditionally May, not Mary, which was the name of Peter’s deceased mother, wife of Richard.  Perhaps we’re dealing with some alternate portion of the overused Marvel multiverse here.  But in a movie this bad, who cares? In any event, Johnson tries to keep the soggy narrative afloat with some canny line readings and plenty of energy; she’s easily the best thing in the picture, though Scott adds notes of deadpan humor that are welcome.  All three of the girls are too old to be playing teenagers; Sweeney, for example, recently starred, playing close to her actual age of twenty-six, in the surprise hit romantic comedy “Anyone But You,” and her geek persona here is strenuously overdone.  O’Connor and Merced face no less difficult demands, the former as an overprivileged preppie and the latter as a kid trying to make it on her own, though both are otherwise attractive.  (In another coincidence, all three effectively play orphans—Cornwall’s mother is institutionalized, Corazon’s father had been deported, and Franklin’s parents are rich globe-hoppers who ignore her—so it’s fine for Webb to “adopt” them as her new, prospectively crime-fighting family, although the script never explains how they’ll get their spider-powers.)  Rahim is pretty much wasted as Sims; unmasked, he just fumes and rages, while in costume he, or his stuntman, comes across as a pale imitation of Venom.  (Ngila Dickson designed the journeyman duds.)  The only other cast member of note is Mike Epps, who plays, in his usual voluble way, Cassie’s captain, who’s killed in an accident and immediately forgotten. As already mentioned, the movie’s effects are second-rate, as might be expected of a project whose budget was but a fraction of that regularly poured into an MCU picture.  Production designer Ethan Tobman has the opportunity to inject some period stuff into the piece, though—a Calvin Klein street advertisement and a vintage neon Pepsi sign that plays a major role in the finale, presumably offerings to the gods of product placement.  Johan Söderqvist’s music follows the customary beats of superhero scores, though except for Sims’ spider-guy and the Peruvian spider-people of the prologue—along with Sims’ visions and the occasional flash-forwards—the characters remain in ordinary dress.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," Since Sony began loaning out Spider-Man to Marvel Studios in 2015, they’ve released four superhero films that don’t involve Spider-Man but rather characters who are connected to him, which has been satisfying in the same way that seeing Elvis Presley’s backing band perform without Elvis is satisfying. All four films—Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Morbius and now Madame Web—have two things in common; they are all terrible and Spider-Man is the most influential character in a film in which he does not appear. Not only are the four women who topline Madame Web (which Sony is calling a “psychological thriller”) Spider-People in training, but one character is Spider-Man’s future uncle Ben (Adam Scott), and that newborn baby is certainly Peter Parker. Someone even puts a spin on Spider-Man’s signature proverb by telling our lead heroine “when you take on the responsibility, great power will come.” It all points to the Sony’s increasingly desperate assumption that even the wispiest side mention of the web spinner will make us think its garbage films are connected to Marvel Studios’ much more accomplished Spider-Output.  But Madame Web, with its eye-rolling dialogue, miscast lead, and dime store psychology, is more proof that Sony’s bandwagon attempt to cobble together a cinematic universe strictly for the benefit of its quarterly earnings reports has been dead since day one. Screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose work on 2022’s Morbius was so bad that Sony naturally rehired them to co-write Madame Web, try to finagle their way around the “where is Spider-Man?” problem by setting the majority of the film in 2003, years before the Tom Holland version of Spider-Man makes his appearance.  Our guide through this convoluted mess of Britney Spears references and bargain basement IP is Dakota Johnson, who somnambulates her way through a role she is simply not right for. She brings her decidedly non-heroic chill vibe to Cassie Webb, a New York City paramedic whose spider-induced clairvoyant powers are activated when she falls into the East River trying to rescue a motorist. Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced play teens who require Cassie’s protection from the villain du jour before fulfilling their destiny as various incarnations of Spider-Woman. At least we think that’s what happens because of all the missteps in director S. J. Clarkson’s feature debut, the most bizarre is that neither Sweeney, O’Connor nor Merced are seen in costume, except for a handful of brief moments half-obscured by special effects. This is strictly a street clothes affair, the origin story of an origin story, ostensibly allowing Clarkson to focus on its central girl power quartet. Unfortunately, getting these four disparate women together in a plausible fashion is not much of a concern; the movie confronts its storytelling obstacles with varying levels of confusing solutions and just plain nonsense. This is critically the case with the movie’s generic villain, Ezekiel Sims, played by French actor Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) in a performance that looks pieced together by editor Leigh Folsom Boyd to mitigate disaster and hide his ADR’d dialogue. Sims sets the story in motion twice; first during a prologue set in the Peruvian Amazon in 1973 when he double-crosses Constance (Kerry Bishé), a scientist pregnant with Cassie and searching for a rare spider with venom that can cure diseases because, you know, “peptides.” Thirty years later, Sims, having stolen the spider and used it to gain a bunch of ill-defined superpowers, experiences recurring nightmares of his own murder at the hands of three female superheroes. So he decides to kill them before they kill him, which leads to numerous scenes in his dimly-lit, big money penthouse where Zosia Mamet sits in front of a bank of computers of the kind you only see in movies, ones that can find any piece of information about anyone anywhere in two seconds. The fact that Sims is such an incompetent bad guy that, even with superpowers and the highest of high-tech surveillance, he can’t find and dispatch three teenage girls makes him one of the least menacing villains ever to don a supervillain costume, which, in this case, is a down-market version of Spider-Man’s spandex duds. Of course, these aren’t just teenage girls nor are they just future superheroes. They’re three characters with very little chemistry and saddled with banal dialogue in dire need of an age-authentic punch up. They‘re also manufactured to appeal to all demographics and given unexplored parental issues that connect with Cassie’s mommy problems. The white, Lolita-wardrobed Julia (Sweeney) has a mother living in a psych ward, the Hispanic father of Anya (Merced) was deported, and the Black skateboarder Mattie (O’Connor), whose preferred method of communication is a middle finger, has absentee parents who may or may not return from their trip to China.  It’s up to Cassie then to protect the girls from Sims and be their surrogate parent, something this loner who “hates family stuff” and prefers staying home watching American Idol is loath to do. Soon, she’ll be teaching them the fine art of CPR which doubles as a bonding exercise and a talent that’ll come in handy later. Clarkson, whose credits include Netflix’s Marvel show, Jessica Jones, delivers murky battle scenes that take place at night presumably to hide bad effects work. She unleashes her to-go move of flipping the camera 180 degrees to mimic Sims’ acrobatic fighting style so often she must think she’s reinvented Bullet Time from The Matrix. And more than once, a fight features Cassie stopping Sims by plowing a vehicle into him, as if “my superpower is hitting people with vehicles” is enough to gain her entry into the Avengers. The climactic battle between Sims and all four women atop the giant Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens is, aside from vulgar product placement, an all-time laugher. It’s a comical and incoherent dump of explosions, noise, and dialogue set (I am not making this up) at an abandoned fireworks factory, which is about as apt a metaphor for the current state of the superhero genre as you’ll find. Although no accident of timing could render Madame Web anything but awful, its release at this precarious moment only further advances the argument that Sony, Warner Bros, and Disney have killed their superheroic golden goose by force-feeding us bad product under the assumption that we’ll love anything pulled from their respective trash bins of IP. Then again, if the inevitable financial failure of Madame Web motivates Sony to take a cue from its Oscar-winning Spider-Verse animated gems and give us live action superhero films with the same level of creativity, surprise and energy, they could do something Cassie, Julia, Anya, and Mattie couldn’t; make the world—or at least the rapidly diminishing part of the world with any interest in superhero cinema—a better place.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," Once upon a time, comic-book movies used to be camp, riding the line between silliness and sincerity that would suit the cinematic adaptation of a slim, illustrated story about superheroes and their exploits. But around 20 years ago, the superhero industrial complex rejected camp, becoming dark and gritty, then sarcastic and flip, then cycling back to wholesomely earnest again for a time. However, in today’s moment of waning superhero enthusiasm with audience fatigue setting in, it seems there’s an opening for comic-book movies to be stupid again — stupidly fun, especially if “Madame Web” can tell their fortunes. To get a little pretentious about this latest ultra-silly Sony Marvel movie, Susan Sontag would have loved “Madame Web.” Or maybe she would have found it offensive, but either way, it perfectly fits the rubric Sontag lays out in her famed 1964 essay “Notes on ‘Camp,’” because, to borrow her phrase, “Madame Web” is a comic-book movie “in quotation marks.” It is also the purest form of camp in that it is unintentionally so; certainly director and co-writer S.J. Clarkson, the maker of dozens of television episodes, including the two Marvel series “Jessica Jones” and “The Defenders,” didn’t intend for “Madame Web” to be as ridiculous as it is. Two of the credited writers (there are at least four) are Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who also co-scripted the last baffling Sony Marvel movie, “Morbius,” which was meme’d into infamy in 2022. They’re responsible for the film’s campiness, in that the dialogue on display here is laughably cumbersome and unnatural. But the most important element of the camp on display in “Madame Web” is the madame herself, Dakota Johnson, who has a preternatural ability to apply quotation marks to a line reading with the combination of her guileless blue eyes and a smirk on her lips, a skill she deploys to viral fame during almost every press appearance. It is a performance akin to Michelle Williams’ turn in 2018’s “Venom” (yet another silly/fun Sony Marvel flick), in which the actor is in on the joke but is also taking her role very seriously. Is “Madame Web” a good movie? No. Is it hilariously delightful? Often. The film follows an obscure Marvel character who has the ability to see the future because she was bitten by a poisonous spider in utero while her mom was researching spiders in the Amazon. The year is 2003 for some reason, probably having to do with the age of a future Peter Parker, that other kid famously bitten by a spider. Johnson plays Cassie Web, a FDNY paramedic in Queens, whose main personality trait is “mean to children.” The screenplay pins her social awkwardness on the fact that she grew up in foster care, after being born in a mystical grotto in Peru while her mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), died in childbirth. Constance was, of course, researching spiders in the Amazon — as one does — before her security guard, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), turned on her, shooting the team of researchers and stealing the spider and its magical peptides. Though wounded, a heavily pregnant Constance is rescued by a secret team of indigenous Peruvian “spider men” known as “arañas,” but they can only save the life of the baby. Evil Ezekiel, meanwhile, hoards the spider peptides for himself, and 30 years later, he’s now a sort of cursed dark Spider-man, tormented by premonitions of being killed by a trio of spunky Spider-women. He attempts to track down these future assassins using surveillance tech pilfered from the NSA, which is commandeered — wait for it — by Zosia Mamet of “Girls.” We’ve mapped out 27 of the best movie theaters in L.A., from the TCL Chinese and the New Beverly to the Alamo Drafthouse and which AMC reigns in Burbank. Cassie is having her own terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. First, she plummets into a river while saving a passenger in a car wreck, triggering a hallucinatory near-death experience. Then she starts having terrifying visions and harrowing déjà vu, which leads to her inadvertently abducting three teenage girls from a Metro-North train in order to save them from Ezekiel’s dark Spider-man. To evade Ezekiel, she’ll have to harness the previously unknown powers of her peptide-enhanced mind. As Cassie, Johnson is so compellingly weird that you can’t take your eyes off  her. She delivers every clunker of a line with her full chest voice and a twinkle in her eye. The three other gals — Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced — well, they were clearly cast for a potential future standalone film, which has to be DOA at this point. They’re all a bit awkward and forced, and none are working on the galaxy-brain level of Johnson. Sontag wrote that to talk about camp is to betray it, and she’s right. It’s impossible to persuasively describe the bad-good charms of “Madame Web,” an appreciation of which requires the kind of sensibility that celebrates the unnatural, the artificial, the exaggeratedly “off.” Johnson gets it, and for those who do as well, it’s kind of a thrill to get tangled in her web.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 14, 2024"," Appropriately, it's pretty easy to see exactly
where Madame Web, the origin story of a clairvoyant superhero, is
heading. These kinds of movies are so similar in structure and aim that it's
really the specific type of superpower that serves as the only major
distinction. The power discovered by Dakota Johnson's
Cassandra (That's a little on the nose, even for a comic book hero)
""Cassie"" Webb (Now, this is just pushing it) is somewhat unique, at
least. Cassie has no superhuman strengthjust whatever one would expect of a
New York City paramedic. She doesn't possess some physics-defying degree of
agility or the ability to shoot some sort of projectilelike, say,
webbingfrom her wrists. Those powers, presumably, will belong to the
nephew of Cassie's best friend and co-worker Ben Parker (Adam Scott) some 16 or
so years from the now of this story. Even when these movies try to tell a
standalone story, it's as if the filmmakers or studio executives can't help but
try to cram in some more recognizable idea or figure into the mix. Do they
realize how much such moves undercut the characteror, in this case,
characterswhose story they're trying to tell? Little is more deflating than
to be constantly reminded that a background characteror, in this case, a
character who hasn't even been born yetis probably more interesting than one
in the foreground. Here, that very well might be the case, though.
Cassie and her eventual team of not-yet-superpowered protégés are at the
center of co-writer/director SJ Clarkson's movie, and even they seem to be
waiting for something to happen to them and for some future in which they'll
have something to do. Cassie has a little advantage over us in this
regard. She can see a future in which the trio of Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela
Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor) will have spider-like superpowers, pull
off all sorts of daring moves, and fight bad guys with an assortment of
equipment and/or physical alterations, such as harnessing electric bolts or
sticking to walls with an extra quartet of long legs. In the meantime, they're
mostly running and hiding and stopping everything so that Cassie can get some
more specific details about how and why she ended up with the power to see the
future. We learn why immediately, by the way, during a
prologue set in the Peruvian Amazon in 1973. Cassie's pregnant mother (played by
Kerry Bishé) is searching for a rare spider with venom that could have a
multitude of revolutionary medical uses. Instead, she's betrayed by her guide
Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), shot, and seen through labor by a group of local
spider-people, who have used the venom to gain powers. They try to save the
mother with one of those spiders, but apparently, the venom only affects Cassie
just before she's born. Thirty years later, Cassie has a near-death
experience and, after Ben revives her, finds herself regularly experiencing what
she think is déjà vu. While trying to leave the city for some time alone to
figure out things, she has a vision of Ezekial murdering Julia, Anya, and Mattie
on the train. Cassie stops it from happening, and the four now must evade a man
with superpowers who wants to murder three teenage girls before they can kill
him at some point in the next ten years (How Ezekial and his tech whiz, played
by Zosia Mamet, know even this broad range of a timeline from a recurring dream
is one of a few details the filmmakers hope we'll ignore as a blatant
contradiction of the story's own terms). The screenplay (written or cobbled together by
the Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and the director) does have an
intriguing hook, then, as Cassie can foretell when and how Ezekial will attack
next (There's also the amusing and completely ignored notion that the villain is
fulfilling a prophecy by taking action, because acknowledging and reconciling a
paradox like that takes a little effort). Without any other powers, she and the
teens have to use their wits to outmaneuver this foe, but they mostly keep
putting themselves needlessly in harm's way so there can be some action. That action isn't convincing, either, in terms
of the visual effects, the staging, or the editing of these sequences. The cuts
between certain bits make it obvious Clarkson is editing around logistical
and/or budgetary shortcomings, similar to the way a lot of expository dialogue
is clearly the result of post-production recording sessions. Madame Web
may look cheap, then, but its messy plotting and half-considered characters are
arguably cheaper. Ultimately, the movie is so interested in its potential
franchise future that it doesn't bother to tell an engaging story in the here
and now.
",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," At some point during my screening of Madame Web, I started looking for the fastest exit. I got a spider bite in Kerala, India, that turned into a mottled, purple-red blister and eventually sent me to the emergency room. That was better than this. What’s scary is that Madame Web herself might have picked me up in the ambulance. Then I’d have been stuck reliving the plot points the way she does—hoping for a better outcome. In Madame Web, Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a New York paramedic who gets a clairvoyance reboot after a near-death experience. Seemingly against her will, she finds herself fighting a mysterious Spider-villain, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), to protect three teen girls while dealing with her unresolved past. I’m not sure where to start. Let’s go with the good. The cast is genuine, and they play their parts with faith in the material. No matter how much the dialogue crumbled in their mouths like a leftover box of Fruit Loops from the 90s, they kept going. That must be applauded. I’m hoping to see our trio of future Spider-Women—Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor—in more. There’s a spark here for each of them. This movie just couldn’t supply ignition. Instead, the script makes their personalities so similar they become basic traits: the shy one, the rich one, the smart one. When you factor in—like most Spider-Verse characters—the four leads are connected by being orphaned figuratively or truly; the girls come off as “insert teen stereotype here.” [deep breath] Okay, since Usher says if you’re gonna tell then you have to tell it all, I’ll add that the writers don’t seem to recognize the emotional intelligence of teen girls. It’s a missed opportunity. Maybe that’s why the movie is so thin. It’s missing the layers that make superhero stories compelling. There’s no symbolism, no parallels, no B-plot (other than a tie-in to Peter Parker). Nothing is hidden; everything is surface. That’s why after an hour full of false starts, you can’t believe you still have an hour left. When I tell you there is no reason for this movie to be 120 mins, it is perjury proof. When I tell you the story should have started on the train, you’ll know it when you see it. The filmmakers stretch their story out until it’s a stringy cheese pull without the satisfaction of the pizza slice. It’s a shame because there’s a “war zone” scene near the end that works. Something there clicks because, during all the madness and explosions, the characters realize their powers have a purpose, they only need to learn to use those gifts to their advantage. But the person who teaches them that is the villain. Ezekiel, our barefoot baddie, strolls through scenes with the vaguely human styling of an A.I. creation. You may want to check his hands. The voice, the movements, it’s so disconnected. And he’s meant to be a poisonous spider, but his true power is being illogical. Master Oogway from Kung-Fu Panda taught us: The path you take to avert your destiny will lead you to it. How did Ezekiel, who has visions of the future, miss that? He ends up being the best teacher our heroines could ask for, showing them how to use their powers more effectively than any mentor figure (including Cassie). It’s like watching a supervillain self-destruct seminar. By the way, I should mention the villain is introduced with a red flag in the form of a red umbrella. So, maybe there is some symbolism. Can you hear how loud I’m blinking right now? To make it even messier, there’s a moment when a Black character is sacrificed to send Cassie on her hero’s journey. Yup. Let’s leave that there. Madame Web is mostly but not completely a waste of time, but it runs out the clock without scoring. There’s just not enough here to sustain our interest or a franchise.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," … a strong premise, a talented cast and some of the dopiest moments on the big screen in recent memory. It’s a bit of a mess, although not without its notable moments. There are good movies, there are bad movies and then there are movies that have a lot of potential but somehow squander it in ways that are both fascinating and baffling. Madame Web, the latest iteration in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (aka Spidey adjacent gear that doesn’t actually contain the webslinger) is a prime example of that latter variety, featuring a strong premise, a talented cast and some of the dopiest moments on the big screen in recent memory. It’s a bit of a mess, although not without its notable moments. Madame Web is the story of Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) an aloof paramedic who after an accident in which she briefly dies, begins manifesting powers of precognition. Almost as if she has some kind of… spider sense. These new, and unwelcome, abilities put Cassie in the path of three teenage girls, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Said girls are being hunted by a wealthy serial killer with inexplicable powers, Ezekial Sims (Tahar Rahim), and it’s up to Cassie to save them, despite her complete disinterest in forging personal connections or embracing her destiny. Broadly speaking, there’s a solid, albeit slightly fiddly story hidden within the 116 minute tangle that is Madame Web. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, that narrative was lost (either through reshoots or panicked last minute editing), leaving an uneven, leaden and often confused pile of story beats that barely fit together. It’s a pity too, because performances here are pretty good. Dakota Johnson shines throughout, gamely struggling with some truly risible dialogue with a lot of charm and Sydney Sweeney is a highlight as the rather gormless Julia. Further compounding the problems is first time feature director SJ Clarkson’s pedestrian helming of the project, delivering flat, uninteresting exposition dump scenes followed by often incoherent, cheap-looking action sequences. The film takes a huge dive in the third act too and never recovers, offering a conclusion that had the preview screening audience howling with mocking laughter. So, where does Madam Web sit in the SSU? Well, it’s better than the Venom films (although those have their defenders and we’re not here to judge). It’s less competently made than Morbius, but honestly it’s more enjoyable, due to some great performances and unintentional hilarity. That’s not a recommendation, mind you. This is yet another Sony Spider flick that does little to distinguish itself or even justify its existence. At this point, maybe Kraven should come along and hunt the whole thing into extinction.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2024",In the ecosystem of superhero movies&#44; we need earnestly cheesy films like this to keep things afloat&#46; Something about this mess just won me over&#46;,POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2024"," When EMT Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) introduces her colleague as Ben Parker (Adam Scott) as Ben Parker, your spidey sense better be tingling or this movie is going to be a slog. Not that this origin story of Marvel superhero Madame Web is just another Spider-Man variation. It’s way different. Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, and Madame Web is bitten by a natural but imaginary with magic powers spider. Got it? Cassie (short for Cassandra, which should tingle your spidey-sense, too) is a loner. Once she delivers a patient to the hospital,  She cares very much for Ben Parker and for their boss, O’Neil (the always instantly-appealing Mike Epps) but she does not want to spend much time with anyone outside of work. Cassie’s mother died in Peru, where she was researching a rare species of spider with peptides that could have healing powers for humans, and Cassie, who grew up in foster care, has always felt abandoned, even rejected, by the mother who was so reckless in exploring the wilds of South America when she was eight months pregnant. We know there is more to the story than that. We saw her mother (Kerry Bishe), betrayed by her assistant, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), shoot her and steal the spider she has worked so hard to find. As she dies, a member of a spider-enhanced tribe thought by most people to be a legend appears, and he is able to deliver her baby before she dies.  Cassie and Ben rescue a man from an overturned car hanging over the side of a bridge, but the car flips into the water with Cassie inside. Ben rescues her, but while under water her heart stopped, and the experience has triggered in her a power it will take a while for her to understand; she can see a few moments into the future, enough for her to make a difference and prevent disaster. Meanwhile, Sims is having his own visions of the future, where he will be murdered by three young women with spidery superpowers. He is determined to prevent this by killing them, when they are still teenagers. He gets access to government databases and cameras and hires tech whiz and morally bankrupt Amaria (Zosia Mamet in a thankless role that consists of peering intently into screens and saying yes to Sims’ demands) to find the girls. She does get to wear elegant necklaces while she’s doing it, though.  Somehow, Cassie and the three girls, who do not know each other, end up on the same train and when Cassie sees visions of Sims killing them she gets them off the train and away from him. Keeping them away from him takes up most of the rest of the movie and unsurprisingly that means chases and explosions and at least two vehicles crashing through buildings. The girls are played by the exceptionally talented and sadly underused Isabela Merced, Sydney Sweeny, and Celeste O’Connor.  It’s not an awful movie but it is not very good. The origin story spends too much time on the origin, with Cassie getting used to her powers, which involves a detour to Peru that slows down the pacing. What we really want is more time with Cassie and the girls. If it’s going to be an origin story, let’s get their origins, too. There’s an irresponsibility and lack of even the most limited consequences to the mayhem that goes beyond the usual suspension of disbelief we grant a comic book movie. The dialogue is pedestrian, occasionally laughable, and the references to the Spider-Man universe or one of the Spider-Man universes are clumsy. And what should be the strongest part of any superhero movie, the villain, here is the weakest. Sims, who at times sounds like his dialogue has been dubbed by someone else, is just not that interesting. If you could see ahead like Madame Web, you might fix your future by waiting to see this on streaming.  Parents should know that this movie has extended comic book-style peril and violence with guns, poison,   chases, crashes, fire, and explosions. Characters use some strong language and there are sexual references and situations as well as two scenes of childbirth or labor. Family discussion: How did what Cassie learned about her mother change the way she thought about herself? What did Julia, Anya, and Mattie have in common? What superpower would you like to have?

"Feb 13, 2024"," Is Madame Web safe for kids? Is Madame Web OK for kids? Read the Madame Web Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parents guide and mom review of the all-new Sony/Marvel superhero film Madame Web 2024, starring Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, and Isabela Merced. No spoilers! #MadameWeb May contain commissioned links. Director SJ Clarkson is feeling the love this Valentine’s Day with a genre change from the usual Marvel superhero origin story to an intense suspense thriller with spider like features (maybe in hopes of catching the Spider-Man/Sony success vibes?). As one of the veteran female Marvel directors known for Marvel’s Jessica Jones and The Defenders television mini series – there’s hope that feminized energy can give Marvel the boost it sorely needs to stay relevant. But can this web of thrills wow fans with a renewed love for Marvel superhero films? In this Madame Web Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, I’m breaking down the visuals, the story, a full PG-13 age rating explanation for violence, adult themes and language, and what kids’ age recommendation is suggested to watch in this new 2024 Madame Web parents guide to the new Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios’ live action suspense thriller film. A no-spoiler parent review of Madame Web 2024, is this the final Marvel superhero film that breaks the spider’s web? Visually speaking Madame Web is turning – and turning – and turning. Taking a page turn (*slaps knee*) from Spider-Man franchise this Marvel film at least brings so visual interest and creative liberties to the screen.  Though I can’t say that all of the CGI and special visual effects were successfully pulled off. Definitely some questionable CGI choices were made in the overall design of Madame Web’s character and powers. At times Madame Web is overstimulating between bright flashes of light, twisting camera movements, and what feels like a constant blinking sensation on screen. But certainly the CGI is not worse than say Aquaman 2. Photosensitivity Warning. For viewers prone to epilepsy and photosensitivity, there are multiple scenes with dizzying and fast spinning camera movements that could be nausea inducing for some. Bright flashing and/or strobing lights and CGI special effects are used to visually simulate Madame Web’s powers and lights also flash on subway cars. I would warn those prone to seizures to proceed with caution. Director S.J. Clarkson (Marvel’s “The Defenders” and “Jessica Jones” television series) returns to direct Madame Web in an all-new suspense thriller film Marvel superhero origin story – in a Sony switch from the usual superhero genre. Marvel’s Madame Web 2024 stars Dakota Johnson (“Fifty Shades of Grey” franchise) as heroine Cassandra Webb, alongside co-stars Sydney Sweeney (HBO’s “Euphoria“), Isabela Merced (“Dora and the Lost City of Gold“), Celeste O’Connor (Amazon’s “Selah and the Spades“), and Tahar Rahim (“Napoleon“). Based on the Marvel comic book character and the Spider-Man spin-off, Madame Web unveils the origin story of Cassandra Webb – and how she ultimately discovers and harnesses her superpowers of seeing the future. Sounds like a cool premise. Until you watch the story unfold before your eyes. Director S.J. Clarkson seems to have a major problem with showing the audience how Madame Web’s superhero-ness works. Between choppy and constantly overstimulating visuals, confusing flashbacks and flashforwards, and an underused star actress at Sony’s fingertips – this messy web unravels fast. And not in a good way. Is Madame Web safe for kids? A Marvel suspense thriller rated PG-13? Should parents be concerned? It’s no secret that I am highly skeptical of all MPAA ratings (um hello, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not disclosing any language??). And as we know, not all movie and TV age ratings are the same. As a parent, it’s been rather heartbreaking to witness how ratings have shifted over the years with a G-rating no longer an option to help guide parents. PG ratings now oscillating between Turning Red intense to Christopher Robin calm, and even PG-13/TV-14 age ratings teetering on the edge of R or MA ratings (Moon Knight and Werewolf by Night, I see you!), there’s a wide range between the age of 0-14 years old for parents to consider. Having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or show is kid friendly – and safe for the whole family to watch together. Why is Madame Web rated PG-13? In this Madame Web Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, this 2024 suspense thriller superhero origin film from Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios is rated PG-13 for “violence/action and language.” With film and TV ratings also unpredictable these days, having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or television show like Madame Web is kid friendly. Is Madame Web too scary for kids? Is Madame Web not for kids? Let’s breakdown that PG-13 age rating in this Madame Web parents guide. Violence/Suspense. Gun violence including gunshot wounds, injuries, and death are common. Expect hand-to-hand combat (including choking and sounds of broken bones), multiple chase scenes, and vehicular accidents through New York City. Peril and jump scare suspense is overall mild. Also expect lots of possible medical trauma as well – including ambulance and hospital scenes and the presence of medical equipment and devices. Adult Themes. There is one scene with mild alcohol consumption – including beer bottles. No drug content. One verbal reference to a “psych ward.” Toilet humor includes one line referring that a character “peed outside.” Sexual innuendo is present in Madame Web. There is kissing between characters and inferred “sleeping together” scene where a woman is seen wearing a bra only. No full nudity. One scene of a woman giving birth – nothing is shown. Language. Does Madame Web have a foul mouth? Well… Foul language phrases and swear words include: 2 “@sshole,” 1 “@ss,” 4 “sh!t,” 1 “b!tch,” 1 “g-d d@mmit,” and 2 “H-E-double-hockey-sticks” which is surprisingly very low for a Marvel film. With a runtime of 1 hour 54 minutes, this Madame Web 2024 film runs a short for what I would expect for a Marvel superhero film. But the overall lack of superhero moments and positive life lessons for kids – Madame Web is not what I would call kid friendly.Even with car chase scenes and multiple scenes depicting violence, Madame Web is a suspense thriller Marvel film that’s actually a little light on the superhero action department. Almost campy and cliché, the lack of exciting sequences for kids and multiple flashforward scenes may leave kids feeling confused, antsy, and/or bored. No, there are no mid credit scenes in Madame Web. If you decide to sit through this Marvel film, you can immediately exit when the credits start to roll. Based on my Madame Web parents guide and mom review above, I would not recommend Madame Web to kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old. With some language and multiple scenes depicting violence/suspense, Madame Web is a Marvel superhero film that is more like an old school DC film than a 2024 Marvel release. I advise parents to prescreen the film for language and violence.Considering the full PG-13 age rating breakdown above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Madame Web to kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old. This Madame Web PG-13 rating is overall light for a 2024 Marvel superhero film. But confusing plot points, overstimulating visuals, lack of superhero action, a weak villain, and the critical thinking needed to understand the flashforwards – you and your child may benefit from skipping out on this Marvel disappointment. Since when did the new Marvel become the old DC? A useless villain. An underused star actress. A pointless plot. And the most disappointing ending I’ve seen in a long time. I haven’t been this upset over a superhero film since the old Batman & Robin days (*cringe*). Honestly, I have no idea where Sony thinks they’re going. Another spider-induced but weak franchise? Or does the director have a serious vendetta against the Madame Web comic books? Either way I’m sad to report that Madame Web is 100% ABSOLUTELY the worst Sony/Marvel film ever made. Worse than Eternals, Thor: Dark World, and Iron Man 3 combined (yes, I am making the MCU and Sony/Marvel comparison). Don’t fall for the dark web of deceit. Skip this movie and hold onto the old Marvel glory days. This is Fifty Shades of Messed-Up.

Do your research. Thank you for your care, concern and most importantly your pageview for this movie review. Not here to argue your very strong and what seems to be an angry standpoint over the distinction between Sony/Marvel and MCU. You’ll notice that nowhere in this Madame Web review do I ever mention MCU. Yes, I know this is actually produced by Sony. I compare my Madame Web assessment to MCU film because you’ll notice that I actually write these reviews for parents, who are looking to see if Madame Web is ok for their kids to watch. I therefore choose movies that maybe their kids have seen versus say a Morbius. If MCU and Sony/Marvel films have never been compared before, then congrats. You may be witness to one of the first. I just wanted to let you know that this movie, along with other Spider-man spin-offs like Venom or Morbius, are produced by Sony – not Marvel Studios. Sony owns the film rights to Spider-man, and only have a deal with Marvel Studios to let them use him in their films. So when you say Marvel movies have gotten bad, then lump it in with Eternals, Thor: The Dark World, and Iron-man 3, it actually isn’t related to any of those. This movie is not part of the MCU, nor will the upcoming Kraven movie. Thank you for your care, concern and most importantly your pageview for this movie review. You’ll notice that nowhere in this Madame Web review do I ever mention MCU. Yes, I know this is actually produced by Sony. I compare my Madame Web assessment to MCU film because you’ll notice that I actually write these reviews for parents, who are looking to see if Madame Web is ok for their kids to watch. I therefore choose movies that maybe their kids have seen versus say a Morbius. I do compare Madame Web to MCU films, because that is more likely the films that kids have seen. I have clarified to say “Sony/Marvel.” But honestly, kids will only care that Marvel is attached to the film and the character – not Semantics.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024"," If you don’t know the name Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), “Madame Web” will be a waste of your money. Are you familiar with Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), or Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor)? No? “Madame Web” is yet another Marvel outing, but this one’s from Sony (meaning it’s separate from the MCU), and it’s being pitched as one of those “standalone” features, which implies that you can go in with little knowledge and learn about the new heroes. But outside of Webb, this movie doesn’t even identify the other superheroes who populate the prophetic visions of villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). It assumes you already know them and their backstories. I knew not one iota of Cassandra Webb lore going in but gleaned what I could here; if you’re worried about spoilers, proceed at your risk. Sims’s mission is to murder Corazon, Cornwall, and Franklin. They’re the costumed characters who have come to kill him in his premonitions. In addition to seeing the future, Sims has powers that give him super strength, super speed, and spider-like reflexes. I think he also has poison in his hands, but don’t hold me to that. In any case, Sims is ruthless enough to shoot Constance (Kerry Bishé), a pregnant researcher in the Amazon jungle who trusted him as her guide, and he spends much of his screen time violently dispatching people with no regard to innocent bystanders. He’d be a compelling antagonist — I mean, who wouldn’t want to prevent their own death? — if the barebones screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and director S.J. Clarkson bothered to flesh him out. Turns out Constance was Cassandra’s mother. She gives birth to Cassandra before she dies, assisted by some mythical spider people who live in the trees of Peru. Why was a massively pregnant woman due to give birth at any moment roaming around the rain forest, you ask? She was looking for a magical spider. Unfortunately, so was Sims. Fast-forward to 2003. Cassandra is now a surly, unlikable EMT. Years in the foster-care system have hardened her, though she tries to be sociable with her colleagues. She also appears to be very good at her job. When not tending to a cute stray cat who deserved more scenes in this movie, Cassandra pals around with fellow EMTs O’Neil (Mike Epps) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Yes, that Uncle Ben Parker, the one from “Spider-Man.” Cassandra first realizes she has superpowers when she envisions O’Neil’s death minutes before it happens. She also sees Sims brutally murdering those three teenagers over and over and over, giving the film the feel of an ′80s slasher. “Madame Web” also appears to share some DNA with ′80s teen sex comedies: At one point, we see those same teens salaciously dancing on diner tables to Britney Spears, and Cornwall wears a skirt short enough to send Catholic school nuns into cardiac arrest. Webb assumes the role of spoilsport adult when she becomes the teens’ protector. Johnson tries her best, and O’Connor is good for a few laughs, but “Madame Web” is a lost cause. The special effects are confusing and the action scenes are poorly edited. By the time we get a rote explanation of Webb’s powers, it’s too late to care. Oddly enough, the most fascinating thing about this movie is its Pepsi product placement. The blue cans are everywhere, and at one point, Johnson holds up a can as if she’s in a commercial. What struck me as intriguing was Pepsi’s role in the film’s climax. This is the first movie I can remember where someone is killed by product placement. You’ll never be able to look at a Pepsi-Cola sign the same way. That is, if you’re unwise enough to see “Madame Web.” Directed by S.J. Clarkson. Written by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and Clarkson. Starring Dakota Johnson, Tahar Rahim, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Kerry Bishé. At AMC Boston Common, Landmark Kendall Square, Alamo Drafthouse Seaport, AMC Causeway, suburbs. 117 minutes. PG-13 (comic-book violence, more vicious than usual).",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," The downside of Sony maintaining its grip on Marvel’s Spider-Man rights is they have a plethora of characters to flush down the toilet. Let me be clear: it wasn’t always this way. The Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy continues to be amazing, and the Andrew Garfield movies are underrated and Sony shouldn’t have panicked with it. But they continue to struggle with their own corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sure, Venom was bonkers fun that captured the crazy tone of the comics, but that character is already popular and has a ready-made audience. The same can’t be said for Morbius, the upcoming Kraven the Hunter, and the unfortunate Madame Web, which takes multiple fantastic female Spider-heroes and squashes them like bugs on the bottom of a boot. The hilariously atrocious Madame Web doesn’t even have the decency to be so bad it’s good. Sure, the clunky dialogue, obviously disinterested cast, one actor’s horribly dubbed voice, insufferable teasing of a better movie, and messy plot will have you laughing with your buddies at the ineptitude. But the overwhelming feeling is disappointment over the wasted potential. I’m a fan of all of these characters, and have been reading some of them for years. And the cast is superb…elsewhere. Just not here, given elementary-level scripting by an army of writers who must not have communicated with one another about crafting a singular vision. What the Hell is this movie supposed to be, anyway? Dakota Johnson, who has become a meme for her apparent disdain for the film, sleepwalks through her role as Cassandra Webb. A clunky intro set in the jungles of Peru establishes that her mother (played by Kerry Bishe) was pregnant with her while on the hunt for a rare spider with incredible healing properties. Tagging along was Ezekiel, played by the typically great A Prophet actor, Tahar Rahim. Turns out, Ezekiel was just a baddie waiting for his moment to strike. He attacks and ultimately kills Cassie’s mom, but not before she’s rescued by some weird jungle spider folks, who are dressed like arts & crafts Spider-Man. They deliver Cassie into the world and then…well, I guess they just ship her back to America through the mail or something. Who knows? As an adult, Cassie is a New York EMT who can’t connect with other people. We know because of her shitty bedside manner, awkward treatment of kids, and nonexistent sense of humor. Or that could just be the terrible script, which has her and co-star Adam Scott, who plays…well, I’ll leave that reveal alone because Sony thinks they’re clever, bantering with some of the most unnatural human interaction ever. Seriously, the dialogue in Madame Web might’ve been written by AI that was homeschooled by an AI. How did four writers get credited with this? Part of the problem could be confusion over the setting. While the film begins in 1973 when introducing Cassie’s mom, the story doesn’t get moving until 2003. There’s some talk out there that it was actually set in the ’90s, but was moved up so that fans could draw a closer connection to Sony’s current Spider output. While the musical needle drops are mixed up enough that you can see them trying to have it both ways era-wise, some of the other references are so shoehorned they’re cringe-worthy. In one scene, Cassie for no reason informs us “she’s gotta get home in time for Idol”. Product placement is everywhere, including a gigantic billboard for Beyonce’s “Dangerously in Love” which I guess strokes her ego but also shows that Sony can spend millions on some really terrible Photoshopping. I wonder what was under that billboard in the earliest versions of the film? I bet it was Smash Mouth. After Cassie survives a near-fatal accident, she suddenly gains the ability to see the future. Let’s be honest, it’s a spider-sense even though it’s never named. Madame Web is good about never being clear about anything, probably to avoid the very confusion they are creating. Ezekiel is a pretty lame baddie all around. He’s used the spider to gain powers similar to Spider-Man. No webbing, but he can poison you with a toxin from his hands. He’s got a suit that resemble’s Spidey’s black Venom costume, which would look much cooler if the VFX weren’t so shoddy. Plagued with terrible visions that three female Spider-heroes will eventually kill him, he uses his vast wealth to have Girls star Zosia Mamet track them down. How? Using cutting-edge facial recognition tech, like this is one of those early Mission: Impossible movies. Poor Zosia Mamet, by the way. She never gets up out of her damn chair. Turns out the three future heroes are current annoying teens:Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Ezekiel tries to kill them in the tamest subway attack ever, but Cassie uses her newfound abilities to come to the rescue. Keep in mind that this supposedly brilliant, wealthy villain with advanced technology can’t find three teenagers with no resources at their disposal, and even when he does he looks like a clown and sounds like someone speaking into a fan. Everyone comes off poorly in this. Dakota Johnson wasn’t meant for this sort of role and she clearly didn’t like doing it. Her wheelhouse is something like Cha Cha Real Smooth, a challenging mix of drama and humor with a bit of an edge. Sydney Sweeney looks way too old to play a teenager, no matter how short they make her skirt. O’Connor and Merced, both fine actresses, aren’t given enough to work with. At least they were allowed to use their own voices…lookin’ at you Tahar Rahim. Fire your agent. Madame Web brings a bunch of really popular Spider-heroes together in a tease of a fun all-female team-up flick. I should note that this is one of the many regurgitated ideas that Sony had from back in the Andrew Garfield years that they are pretending is new. But they don’t give you any of that. This is barely a superhero movie. Trailers tease glimpses at the heroes to come: Spider-Woman, Arana, Julia Carpenter in their familiar costumes. If you pay to see the movie based on that, be prepared for about 30 seconds of enjoyment. It’s a chase movie, one in which Dakota Johnson chauffeurs a trio of snot-nosed kids around in a taxi cab while fleeing the most inept psychopath in all of NYC, and that’s saying something! There are times when Madame Web feels like someone is pulling a prank on us. Like the excruciating amount of time spent watching Cassie teach the girls CPR. Or when Mike Epps is introduced into the movie only to be written out 90 seconds later. Or when Emma Roberts, another actor gone to waste, repeatedly teases the name of her child, a fairly significant character in the Spider-Man universe, in a manner that seems to be for us and makes no sense in the context of the film. Madame Web is a total joke of a movie, and if Sony had aspirations of a franchise, the joke is ultimately on them. The final showdown takes place in a fireworks factory, with so many explosions Michael Bay would be jealous. And somehow through all of that, the film still manages to have no spark.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Directed by S.J. Clarkson.
Starring Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, Adam Scott, Zosia Mamet, José María Yázpik, Kerry Bishé, Kathy-Ann Hart, and Josh Drennen. Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present. Her déjà vu senses are tingling! Set in 2003, following a perilous incident on the job as a paramedic, Cassandra Webb’s (a disappointingly bland Dakota Johnson) unique spider powers are awakened, courtesy of her mom, who died during childbirth while researching special insects in the Peruvian Amazon with the intent to cure diseases. Directed by S.J. Clarkson (and a crowded screenwriting room consisting of herself, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker), Madame Web has the right self-contained origin story approach in that if the rules of the ability don’t make immediate sense to the viewer or the protagonist, part of the fun should be discovering and coming to understand those ins and outs. In this case, the superpower is a gift that allows Cassandra brief glimpses of the future, sometimes in the form of déjà vu. There is no clear rhyme or reason as to why these instances of déjà vu happen, what triggers time to jump back, how long they last, or how she comes to harness and control any of this. What this means is that much of the action set pieces here quickly become about sitting back and letting whatever happens happen without questioning anything. At a certain point, it seems to cease being déjà vu altogether and just becomes an ability to see a short window into the future, allowing the set pieces in the back half of the film to come off slightly more consistent and reasonable within the rules of this universe. However, there are two major frustrations with all of this, the first being that Madame Web is so devoid of personality, compelling stakes, threatening urgency, and multidimensional characters that, again, one remains passive and disinterested in everything occurring on screen. In theory, the story should be engaging to a degree, as it mostly does away with excessive CGI bombast to tell a more grounded tale of a woman learning what these powers are and attempting to use them responsibly out of the inherent goodness within her by saving three teenage girls from a targeted murder attempt on New York City public transportation. What I’m about to say could be considered a spoiler, and hell if I know, considering the awkward screenplay that gradually reveals information about the three girls as if viewers are already supposed to know about these connections and their future superhero alter egos, so here goes: they are Sydney Sweeney’s Julia Carpenter, Isabela Merced’s Anya Corazon, and Celeste O’Connor’s Mattie Franklin. Now, most of us are used to contrived storytelling as a means to get the narrative off the ground or spark a connection between key characters, but Madame Web takes this to a ridiculous level with heaps of exposition, explaining how all three of these girls have no family or anyone to go to for protection, and others solely up to Cassandra to keep them alive. As for why these three teenage girls are wanted dead, that comes down to a vision by tech-savvy, filthy, Spider-suited/superpowered, rich criminal Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), where the three of them are killing him while dressed as superheroes in the future. So not only is Madame Web a rather dull origin story for Cassandra, but it’s also trying to set up a presumed sequel for these heroes. Unfortunately, there isn’t anything interesting to say about them either; Anya and Mattie are more extroverted and quick to run off, assuming that when Cassandra temporarily leaves them in the woods to go do some investigating, they are abandoned. Julia is more introverted and trusting but succumbs to peer pressure anyway to run off, act out, and draw attention (Ezekiel has also murdered his way into stealing technology that allows for easy tracking.) This does pave the way for one of the more mildly exciting action sequences, where Cassandra has to once again save them from being killed, this time inside a diner blessing Britney Spears’ Toxic, working with her déjà vu and adapting to the situation to figure out how to accomplish this while keeping them alive. These are solid ideas for action sequences, but the filmmaking never fully takes advantage of the déjà vu aspect, and the fighting typically stops as fast as it begins. There is a lack of momentum in the combat, choppy editing, and practically no thrills. It quickly becomes the second major problem with the film, causing one to wonder if Madame Web would have worked better as a video game since, at least there, this deja vu superpower would have been built into the core philosophy of gaming as a medium, which is to try difficult encounters over and over until identifying and mastering the best approach. Regarding Sony’s recent disastrous track record with any Spider-Man adjacent film not made alongside Marvel Studios, Madame Web is far from disgracefully bad. It is to be admired that it wants to be less of a superhero film and more of a survival thriller about protecting three teenage girls from a villainous knockoff of Spider-Man, but it has no energy or exciting characters. When there are special effects, such as whenever the film heads to the Peruvian Amazon, the CGI does, however, look blurry and bad. The script is also filled with dreadful line readings and clumsy instances of Cassandra talking to herself out loud as if the filmmakers are worried the viewers need the most obvious visual information explained to them. There is a point where Cassandra saves a bird from death by reacting differently following an event of déjà vu, where she literally says, “You survived!” If only the filmmakers could have used déjà vu while shooting to fix everything wrong with Madame Web here.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," But co-star Tahir Rahim is so awful, cast as the villain, that one sits in slack-jawed awe at the number of times the production plainly and clumsily had him re-dub his lifeless line-readings. From the looks of things, it’s a wonder anyone even bothered. “Madame Web” is joyless, a “Jonah Hex/Morbius” level disaster of a comic book movie. Sony’s umpeenth trip into arachnophilia isn’t about multiverserses or living up to your responsibilities because Uncle Ben would have wanted you to or Mary Jane would expect nothing less. It’s about seeing the future as time stops long enough for our titular heroine to do that. For the viewer, time stops a couple of minutes into “Madame Web” and doesn’t restart until we’ve stepped outside of the cinema in dumbfounded shock over the s–tstorm TV director S.J. Clarkson (“Jessica Jones”) presided over, that the admittedly-limited Johnson let herself be talked into and that content-starved theaters desperately need to be a hit. One doesn’t wonder so much at where the time spent watching this went as ponder if one’s cell phone has any charge left as we’ve switched it on so many times to see if indeed time has stopped. This film is a fiasco, pretty much from the start. A laughably derivative origin story takes us to spider-bite-central, the  Amazon of 1973 and then Queens of 2003 where the daughter of a pregnant arachnologist bitten by a spider 30 years before discovers her “super” powers. Sydney Sweeney, still taking calls from her business manager about the cash cow that was “Anyone But You,” former “Dora the Explorer” Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor of “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” are three young women targeted by spider-obsessed villain Ezekial Sims (Rahim). A near-death experience gave Cassie this foresight, and she saves the three teen strangers from their fate. And then she saves them again. And again. She wasn’t able to prevent her boss (Mike Epps) from driving his ambulance into an accident, but once Cassie figures out she can change history/fate, she sets out to do just that. The tedious tale told here is about Cassie’s learning curve, how she comes to understand her powers and use them to compensate for the fact that she’s not super strong, spidery or given a form-fitting body suit. “Did I die?” Johnson’s Cassie asks her paramedic partner Ben (Adam Scott) will all the emotion she can summon. Which isn’t much, and never has been, to be honest. Sweeney is given a short skirt and big glasses and even less to play than her swimsuited turn in “Anyone But You” demanded, and further underwhelms.  The dialogue is dusty, inane and laughless. The period piece setting may have some further purpose than showcasing the mostly ’80s vintage cars, the still-standing Blockbuster video stores and an attempted table dance to Britney’s “new” hit, “Toxic,” but damned if I can see one.  Still, in the interest of bucking up the theaters, which are playing to empty houses these days, just let me suggest that if you’re still into superhero movies, go see it and tell me I’m wrong.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Here’s the thing. No one wants “Madame Web” to be bad. This critic is certainly not rooting for it to fail. I would love to write a surprisingly glowing review on a movie centered on a pretty obscure character not only in the Marvel comic book universe but in the slightly smaller ‘Spider-Man‘ comic book universe. That director S.J. Clarkson and the other four writers with a story or screenwriting credit found a way to make the origin story of Cassandra “Cassie” Web a thrilling and maybe even funny 116 minutes at your local movie theater. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Not only is “Madame Web” a mess of a movie it doesn’t even qualify as a “it’s so bad it’s good” moment of escapist entertainment. It suffers from a much worse fate: it’s utterly forgettable. That’s good news for the plethora of wasted talent Clarkson and her producers convinced to make this flick. First and foremost is Dakota Johnson, who is center stage as Cassie, a New York Fire Department paramedic who, when we first meet her, is anti-social and full of appropriate late-stage Gen X angst (it is 2003, mind you). One of her few friends is Ben, a co-worker played by Adam Scott, who is barely hinted at as an ex-boyfriend and a uniformly good guy. Moreover, do the math and he could also conveniently be another Spider hero’s Uncle. But we digress. On a routine call, Cassie gets stuck in an upended car that falls off a bridge into one of New York City’s rivers. Before Ben revives her, she has several premonitions in a confusing world of digital CGi-webs plucked right out of an early ’00s visual effects house. But wait, we’re getting ahead of ourselves, before we ever get to the “contemporary” events we need to endure one of the worst filmed and acted prologues in recent memory.  “Madame Web” really starts in 1973 where, in the jungles of Peru, a very pregnant Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) is on the hunt for a mythical spider with the ability to modify a human being’s cellular structure. Her guide is Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), an antsy sort who projects his sinister motives so loudly you can hear it in a jungle on the other side of the continent. When Constance joyously returns to camp after capturing one of the powerful arachnids, Sims kills all the faceless participants on the expedition and mortally wounds our heroine. Swooping in from the trees to save her is a mythical tribe of people with super spider abilities. They attempt to save her life with the bite from one of the spiders but are only able to assist her in giving birth to her child before she passes. And, yes, that baby grows up to be Cassie. How does the infant Cassie get back to the States, let alone NYC? Does she have any other family? Who’s her dad? Who cares! This is a movie trying to live off tangential Spider-Man fandom in any way it can. Logic doesn’t matter! Meanwhile, back in the “present,” Sims, also conveniently in New York, is living off his considerable swath of spider-powers (imagine Spider-Man without the webs, but a poisonous death grip). Life ain’t so great for our slightly greying villain, however. He’s plagued by a vision of three Spider-Women who will hunt him down and kill him. Conveniently, he finds a way to access ground-breaking 00’s facial recognition technology (right out of an early “Bourne” movie) to track these three women down. Assisting him, and clearly not getting paid enough to do it, is Amaria (Zosia Mamet, girl why), a tech genius who realizes these women are actually teenagers and she can find them by tapping into camera systems all over the city. Three young women who are, you guessed it, somehow connected to Cassie.  Coincidentally, our heroine is on the same subway train where Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) are about to be attacked by Sims. Cassie’s future spider-sense (it’s never given a specific name, by the way, nothing is) helps her get the girls out of harm’s way. And, before she knows it, she finds herself responsible for the safety of three young women who either have absent parents or none at all. If “chosen family” was a more common term twenty years ago it would have been uttered out loud and we’re honestly surprised they didn’t use it anyway. There is a lot more plot to unravel that we won’t spoil here, but you can expect car chases, some appropriate period references (Britney Spears’ “Toxic,” a billboard of Beyonce‘s “Dangerously in Love” album art, a DKNY subway entrance ad), Emma Roberts showing up as a very pregnant member of the Parker family (again, do the math), and a lot of exposition. There’s incredibly bad ADR (dubbing) of Rahim. Oh, and his character wears a black version of the original movie Spider-Man costume and we never know why. Cassie drives a damaged, stolen taxi cab without plates all over the greater NYC metro area without getting pulled over. Cassie goes to Peru and back again over the span of a week and Simms is such a terrible villain he can’t find the girls while she’s gone. And that’s just the tipping point. There is a ton of plot in this almost two-hour movie and it still feels like nothing of consequence is ever happening.  If we can give the filmmakers any appropriate credit, “Madame Web” at least does its best to explain Cassie’s deja-vu-ish, future spider-sense parties in an almost cinematic way (emphasis on “almost”). Jackson and editor Leigh Folsom Boyd do a good job of not overwhelming the audience with too many visual effects in these scenes and making sure they are not over-paced. In other hands, this is where you’d chop the movie up to bring the runtime down, but the filmmakers know if this movie is gonna make any sense the audience is gonna have to understand her powers. It’s not perfect and it’s not groundbreaking, but it’s enough. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," The long version is this. After spending 1 hour and 57 minutes with MADAME WEB, the word that floats to mind is insipid. Written by a committee, and showing all that is wrong with that approach, it flouts any sense of logic, internal or other, while delivering an origin story that requires no more than one-quarter of that running time. Plot holes abound, the performances are uneven, and the dialogue, even the egregious expositions, is irritatingly cloying and oddly repetitive rather than informative. For me as a reviewer, the first clue that there might be something amiss was when we were ushered into the smallest theater at our local multiplex for the press screening. It’s as though they didn’t want us to get a good gander at anything, even the special effects, some of which, I must say, were pretty interesting.  Confusing as far as what they were trying to convey about the nature of time and reality, but interesting. The requisite intro as prequel finds us in the Peruvian Amazon, where a plucky, and very pregnant, arachnologist (Kerry Bishé), is searching for a rare spider whose venom can cure a plethora of diseases. Actually, it’s the peptides in the venom, and points for using scientific terminology. She finds the spider and the nefarious plot her travelling companion (Tahar Rahim) has hatched at the same time, leaving the baby an orphan despite a ritual involving shamans and the very spider she has captured. There’s more than peptides at work here. The spider’s bite confers superhuman speed, strength, and the ability to see the future. It also confers the ability to crawl up walls, though how, why, and to whom is murky. Fast forward thirty years or so to 2003, and that baby, Cassie Web (Dakota Johnson), has grown up to be an EMT with exceptional driving skills and a sardonic sense of humor. She also has the makings of a seer (hence the full name of Cassandra) and it all has to do with that rare spider her mother tracked down (hence Web). It’s the Marvel Universe. Names are going to be self-referential. Further hence, Cassie’s EMT partner is named Ben Parker (Adam Scott). If you know, you know. Still smarting from having been cheated of a mother, Cassie has become a loner despite Ben’s cajoling her into being more sociable, and the obvious esteem in which her colleagues hold her. When Cassie has a near-death experience, her carefully ordered world falls apart when she begins having déjà vu experiences that predict some very bad things. Science fails to explain why this is happening, but eventually Cassie, being a smart cookie, figures out that not only can she see the future, she can change it. And that future involves three teenage girls whose paths have crossed hers, and that traveling companion of her mother’s, Ezekiel Sims, now wildly wealthy and keeping one of those rare spiders in his extravagant Manhattan apartment while enjoying the superpowers it has given him. But he is not content with this posh life. No, as he tells a stranger (Jill Hennessey) he picks up at the opera, he is troubled nightly by dreams in which he is killed by three young women, whose faces haunt him. No slouch, he’s stolen the then-nascent facial recognition technology from the government, and hired a tech whiz (Zosia Mamet), to track down those women so that he can kill them. Never mind they are just teenagers now. It quickly descends into general silliness, with Cassie driving a stolen cab in mid-town and not getting stopped; gathering the three teenagers emotionally fragile Julia (Sydney Sweeney), fiercely independent mathlete Anya (Isabela Merced), and skateboarding firebrand Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) and not being picked up on the kidnapping charge leveled at her; and somehow making a pilgrimage to Peru while being sought by the authorities here in the United States. The action is just so much killing time between showdowns with Ezekiel (there are many of them both actual and putative) during which Cassie returns to the scene of one of her crimes with no consequences, and we never do learn why Ezekiel prefers to go about barefoot (except when he’s sporting a Spiderman costume). Johnson seems out of her depth when essaying strong emotions, or engaging in superheroine derring-do, but credit is due for the way she handles the early scenes when she’s just a loner with iffy social skills. There’s something good happening and perhaps there will be a film one day where that can shine. I will give MADAME WEB this. It has one of the niftiest product placements I’ve even seen. Not only prominently displayed, but also integral to one of those showdowns. That company surely got its money’s worth. As for ticket-buyers for this bloated morass, I can’t say the same.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 13, 2024"," The folks in Sony’s marketing department, saddled with the uphill battle of trying to make us care about yet another Spider-Man spin-off that’s neither Marvel Studios, animated, nor Venom, have a better sense of what audiences want to see than the filmmakers do. So if you’re tempted to go and see Madame Web in hopes that it will show you three hot young actresses in skin-tight super-suits and spider-goggles flipping around, at least be forewarned. Everything that you’ve seen in trailers is pretty much all there is in the movie, and it’s a flash-forward, to boot. The girls do dance on a diner table in their regular clothes, but that’s about it. By the time Madame Web is done, the teen trio — Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) — still aren’t superheroes yet, in one of the worst cases of origin-itis this sort of film has ever seen. Once again, we’re back to the pre-MCU mistake of spending so long on the origin story that by the time the movie gets to the part we want to see, it’s over. Actually, Madame Web doesn’t even get that far, offering only the origin of the title character, played by Dakota Johnson. Comics fans know that the character looks quite a bit different on the page than Johnson’s 30-year-old EMT. Rest assured, the movie knows this, too, though it’s not going to age her up to her 60s.  Not yet, anyway — the film is pointedly set mostly in 2003, so it can hint at yet another origin. Cassandra Webb (Johnson) has a partner at work named Ben Parker (Adam Scott), who takes her to his sister-in-law’s baby shower, at which she remarks the fetus keeps “leaping around” inside of her. Boy, that Ben just can’t wait to be an uncle, though to whom may be in question. The timeframe only even vaguely works for Tom Holland’s Spidey, unless it’s an entirely new Peter. In Spider-Man 2, J. Jonah Jameson wondered what the odds were that a man named Otto Octavius would wind up with eight arms. In full hindsight, they seem more likely than that a woman named Cassandra Webb gained the power of pessimistic prophecy from her pregnant mom getting spider-bitten in the Amazon. If the Peter Parker of this universe is surprised by his powers at any point, it’ll be a wonder — the Amazon rain forest isn’t just full of spider-people, but there’s also an evil one roaming around New York City. That would be Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a corrupt former partner of Cassandra’s late mom, who got bitten by the same spider and survived. Now, every night, he dreams of being killed by three young women in spider suits — in true Greek tragedy style, he sets out to prevent the prophecy by killing them first, thus bringing them into conflict with him in the first place. The seemingly random interference of Cassandra Webb, who has developed a clairvoyant spider sense, complicates matters. Fortunately for him, in this world of 2003, he has an inside track on the kind of surveillance technology all spy movies take for granted in 2024. And he can walk on walls. For his work in A Prophet and The Mauritian, Rahim has been nominated for and won many awards globally, so we can only assume he simply did not care to put in any effort here, as he seems to be reading his lines from cue cards. Each word is perfectly pronounced; not one has an iota of honest feeling behind it.  Like Morbius, Madame Web seems to have been scripted without the sort of knowing humor that elevates the MCU, which plays against Johnson’s strengths. She’s good at looking confused but mostly gets laughs by delivering gratuitous exposition that should have been omitted and could have been written by AI. (Officially, the blame goes to Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless and Claire Parker & SJ Clarkson, from a story by Kerem Sanga and Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless.) Only during one of the very last scenes does Johnson get to deliver an actual in-joke, and it’ll make you wish she had more. Incidentally, there are no credits scenes or big surprises, so feel free to leave any time. Writer-director-executive producer SJ Clarkson previously directed the pilot for Marvel’s Defenders, among other A-list TV and streaming shows, showing little of that ability here. We might generously suggest the movie’s awkward story editing and time-wasting scenes that add nothing to the narrative indicate executive producer meddling or a patchwork script in need of salvaging. But since Clarkson’s name is attached to all those roles, she may not merit the grace. Madame Web picks up when it isn’t actually about Madame Web but the Spider-Women. All are actually in their twenties but playing teens, and Sydney, Merced, and O’Connor have the easy chemistry of defiant youth. Judging (correctly, at first) that Ms. Webb is not a reliable guardian, they quickly bond under pressure. It may prove to be Sony’s biggest misstep that they didn’t simply skip ahead and make the movie primarily about this trio, who do not get nearly enough screen time because apparently Dakota Johnson narrating her thoughts out loud to herself is more interesting to somebody at Sony. Venom was fun. Morbius was bad. Madame Web is sometimes so bad it’s fun. Wait until it’s safe to enjoy it in an impaired state, and you might get through it. Luke Y.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Somewhere lost within the jungles of S.J. Clarkson’s strangely miss-aimed superhero adaption is an idea about the web of life, how it catches people despite themselves and binds them together. Saying that is what Madame Web is about would be overly generous to the finished film.  It’s the kind of movie destined for repeat 10 p.m. viewings on TNT or Netflix: a product of talented professionals who have gathered together to create something empty and disposable. Built around the supporting mythology or a central character it cannot name, Madame Web is left to try and build up a group with little central identity with whom it could do anything but ultimately does nothing. There’s a hope up front that it could at least be entertainingly insane as it dives into the Amazon where scientist Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) and her helper Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) search spider webs for a mysterious super spider, throwing around the word ‘peptide’ liberally and talking about supercharging cell structure before being abducted by strange web covered spider people descending from the trees. At least, I think that’s what happens. But Mauro Fiore’s (Avatar) camera whips past its subjects and spins around as soon as something amazing happens, and Leigh Boyd cuts it up into short pieces with smeared highlights and wooshing sound effects: the standard procedure when the filmmakers don’t want to be clear about what is happening either because they think it won’t hold up or is silly or both. It could be that everyone is attempting to ape the milieu of the early 2000s that Madame Web is set in when action and horror journeymen tested how quickly they could cut and how briefly they could show an image and still have information flow. In a lot of ways, Madame Web is a refuge of that style, escaped to the modern day but – like Cassandra herself – not fully present in it. Having survived her strange Amazon birth, Cassandra has grown to be an EMT in New York City, paradoxically spending her time saving lives while refusing to engage in life herself, self-protection against potentially being abandoned again. When a near-death experience opens up some latent abilities, Cassandra begins seeing visions of the future, including a trio of young women being attacked and killed by a strange man in a spider-like costume who climbs on walls and is super strong. Against her own nature, Cassandra saves the young women but, beyond the initial heroism, is unsure of what else to do. Her movie has the same dilemma. As wonderfully bonkers as the central conceit is, Madame Web spends most of its time running from it, trying to hide its superhero/fantasy roots and re-iterate itself as a grounded origin story. Which isn’t to say there isn’t plenty of silliness. What Cassandra can do is entirely dependent on what the plot needs at any one moment. Can she see the future before it happens and then try and change what she has seen? Sure. Can she relive past events from before her birth in order to understand relevant back story? Why not. Can she have psychic conversations with Ezekiel while sleeping in a motel? Yep. There is no consistency from one moment to the next, just an endpoint that must be reached no matter what. But that’s about all. Ezekiel’s spider-imbued powers have also given him dreams of the future, in his case, the ability to see his own death at the hands of the three teenagers he hunts, grown to costumed spider-women and hunting Ezekiel down for some reason. It’s a wonderfully bizarre hint of what Madame Web could have been, but the film will only hint at it and spend the rest of its time running from it faster than Cassandra from the thanks of a heart attack victim. The result is not aggressively stupid like Argylle or wonderfully stupid like The Beekeeper; it’s just listless. No one wants to go too far out on a limb or focus on the inherent ridiculousness of the story being told for that. Instead, the cinematographer of Avatar is left putting everything in as much shadow as possible while the costume designer of The Lord of the Rings looks for various sweaters and jackets that match the color scheme and pattern of the heroines’ future outfits. If this were the 2003 the film is set in, it would not be remarkable one way or the other. It would be completely par for the course for these kinds of movies at that point in time. But time has moved on. Talking raccoons befriend tries, and rock monsters attack dragons; there’s no benefit in being coy. Madame Web may be able to see the future, but she is stuck in the past.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Madame Web is a laughable affair. Intentionally so, at times. But for much of its two-hour runtime, the laughs come at the expense of the arguably capable work being put in by its charming lead, and the ridiculous dialogue she’s reduced to uttering with the best semblance of a straight face. To Dakota Johnson’s credit, she emerges if not unscathed, at least having had a fun enough time playing the film’s titular character. Alas, that’s not enough to save Sony’s ill-conceived attempt at broadening its Spidey-verse. Johnson stars as Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (yes, really; this movie is nothing if not thick with its cues), a most aloof young woman who sounds and behaves like a Californian and not, of course, a New York City EMT working the streets  in 2003 after making her way out of the foster system. Cassie doesn’t know (though we do, thanks to a listless opening prologue) that she’s the daughter of a dogged scientist. One who’d decided to travel all the way to Peru while eight months pregnant in search of a mythic spider whose venom could potentially heal all sorts of ailments. She’s killed, though, and her untimely demise (are there any other kind in these stories?) comes because she’s double-crossed by a man named Ezekiel, who shoots her after securing said spider for himself (why remains a mystery the film seems uninterested in exploring).  And so, Cassie is born with the help of Las Arañas, a group of super-powered beings who can climb treetops and have a sixth sense about them (you might call them spider-men) along with a bite from one of the famed spiders her mother had long been searching for. And then, presumably, she’s shipped back as an infant to New York City, though not before an elder Spider-folk says she’ll eventually come back and he’ll be there to help her. Odd to thing to say to a baby, but that’s the least odd part of this entire screenplay. That preamble, clunky and ripped straight out of a vintage pulpy B-level (maybe C-level) comic book character’s origin story feels especially extraneous when, set in 2003, the entirety of Madame Web feels like mere prologue. Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim, who may well have had every single  utterances dubbed with the worst ADR you’ve seen on a big-budget blockbuster) is awakened every day since he superpowered himself with his stolen spider by one constant dream. In this dream, three young women in different-looking Spidey suits that look straight out of the Schumacher Batman era of comic book costuming, attack him at his lavish apartment and kill him. He’s been having this dream daily: he knows when and how he’ll die. And he’d rather not, obviously. So why not hijack the then novel technology used by the TSA to track these would be supes? Which he does, though none of the girls have yet been bitten by spiders (radioactive or otherwise). In 2003, they’re just one-dimensional teenagers. One is shy and awkward but also knows Taekwondo (Sydney Sweeney’s Julia). One is a bit of a science geek and a math whiz and rightfully wary of the cops (Isabela Merced’s Anya). And one is spoiled and impulsive but good on her skateboard (Celeste O’Connor’s Mattie). If only Ezekiel can get to them before they grow into the heroes he sees in his vision he may … live a long and fruitful life devoted to …? Well, it’s unclear. He’s truly a villain just because. There’s very little motivation here for anything. Every scene and character is a cog in the machine that we call plot, with little rhyme or reason, let alone character consistency. That applies to Cassie, as well, who finds her powers awakened after she falls into the river. When Cassie begins experiencing a time-looped world  where some events  repeat themselves, letting her possibly alter what’s to come, she realizes her mother’s adventures in the Amazon (looking decidedly un-Amazon on screen) may not have been as farfetched as she’d long believed. Hers are premonitions, she soon discovers. Or, as she eloquently puts it in one of the many pieces of dialogue that Johnson miraculously makes believable, even if that somehow makes the whole enterprise feel rather weightless: “I can see the future, kinda.” It’s those visions that bring Cassie into the orbit of Ezekiel’s three targets and, despite hating pretty much all other people (save, perhaps, her co-worker Ben, played by Adam Scott in a much too thankless a role), Cassie is thrown into being a reluctant parental figure to these variously orphaned and endangered girls.  Wanting to be many things at once (a Madame Web origin story; a franchise starter for a trio of Spidey women; a Millennial/Gen Z odd couple/buddy comedy flick; a chance to witness Johnson’s knack for being above the material she’s in and somehow rising above it while clearly making it obvious we may find it risible), this S.J. Clarkson-directed dreck of a movie is not even bad enough to be enjoyable.  At the press screening I attended in New York City, there weren’t just audible groans of despair and sighs of discontent. There was outright cackling and many a “you’ve GOT to be kidding me!” yells peppered throughout a collective two-hour exercise in disdainful shock  that this all made it onto the screen. Much of this was prompted by the dialogue, but also by the shaky and self-consciously deployed music video-like cinematography and the schlocky visual effects which make Madame Web look not too far from a CW show without, sadly,  the winking sense of humor  to pull off such a camp-adjacent sensibility (this is textbook failed self-seriousness).  If or when you find yourself seated for Madame Web (by choice I hope; though perhaps I may dissuade you from such a choice), you will be compelled to laugh. Not with the film—try as Johnson and her co-stars may—but at it. It’ll come from lines like “us strays have to stick together” (delivered to a cat but also, presumably, as a thesis for the film as a whole); and from bonkers action sequences (did you know the Pepsi Co. sign—its S and a P, in particular—plays a prominent role in its climax?) and sometimes from the sheer tonal whiplash of it all (the utter waste of a Britney needle drop for a teenage dance party turned toothless fight is utterly shameful).  This laughter will feel indicative of something larger, another nail in the coffin of the great era of comic book blockbusters of the 21st century, yes. But also of something bleaker. About how much harder it is, perhaps, to thread the line between sentimental earnestness (this is a film about mothering!) and sheer absurdity (did we mention the mythic Peruvian spiders?). What we’re all left with is a conveyor belt of story beats and IP milestones and coy winking reveals designed to whet our appetite for more without failing to make us care about any of what’s in front of us; the limit case of a way of making comic book adaptations that has truly run its course. Like Madame Web herself, the film is often so hurried or so preoccupied with what’s to come that it ignores what’s happening in the moment. It may explain why there’s no post-credit sequence, for who else would want to see a future vision of this world? ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," The good news is Madame Web is not the worst Spider-Man spinoff. (That would be Morbius.) It’s not even the worst action movie I've seen this month. (That'd be Argylle.) And it's far from the worst superhero movie of last year. (The Flash sucked.) However, Madame Web is still far from good.  Part of the problem is it plunges into the inexplicable pitfalls the superhero genre has forced on female-led entries. That makes it overloaded with ideas, choking the life out of the part that works best: Dakota Johnson in ""That’s not the truth, Ellen"" mode. Johnson stars as socially awkward paramedic Cassandra Webb, who — after a brush with death — develops the power of premonition. When she sees a vision of a dapper yet inexplicably barefoot man (Tahar Rahim) abruptly and mercilessly murdering three girls on a train, she steps in to save them.  Sweet Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), sharp Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and sarcastic skater girl Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) are now under Cassie's care, whether any of them like it or not. But to uncover not only why this shoeless guy wants them all dead, but also how to best use her new abilities, Cassie must trace her long-dead mother's footsteps back to the Amazon, where her mom was researching spiders, right before she died. Like Birds of Prey, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and The Marvels, Madame Web is not just about one superpowered female hero, but several — all at once. For Birds of Prey, this worked thanks to director Cathy Yan's kinetic energy and her cast, who created distinctive characters that made the ensemble explosive fun — like fireworks. The other two, notably both sequels, had previous movies and TV shows that established their characters, and while this can admittedly feel like homework for the audience, at least it gives context. Though named for Cassandra Webb, Madame Web also folds in three incarnations of Spider-Women in Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Yet most of the film isn't about this quartet coming into their powers or uniting as a team. Instead, it's about three thinly sketched teenager archetypes and their reluctant babysitter running from a relentless and rich villain called Ezekiel. If that sounds confusing or tedious, just you wait until the flashbacks, future visions, and exposition dumps about peptides come into play.  Following in the footsteps of DC (Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman 1984) and Marvel (Captain Marvel), Sony pitches its female-led Spidey spinoff into the past. Often, this is done by studios who have already established a universe in which superheroines don't exist, so to make any sense of that you gotta throw them back into the past where they might’ve been forgotten about by the time the big brawny dude heroes showed up. Thus, Madame Web is set in 2003 — long before Peter Parker (or Miles Morales) were swinging around the outer boroughs of New York. Unfortunately, director/co-writer S.J. Clarkson offers a rather ambiguous early 2000s, where Blockbuster Video is still thriving, '90s jams like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" play on the radio, and teens gather to watch 1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer on TV. Essentially, this feels like a '90s setting that was switched part-way through production, and so references to American Idol and Britney Spears are haphazardly wedged in. The lensing of New York is similarly superficial in Madame Web. Sure, the film captures (or recreates) real NYC locations, like Grand Central Station, the subway system, or the Long Island City building where a giant Pepsi Cola sign blazes bright on a rooftop. But they may as well have shot everything against a greenscreen, as the cinematography fails to ground the characters in their surroundings, making everything feel like backdrop instead of environment.  It's bad. There's multiple scenes of Cassie racing around New York City in various stolen vehicles, but none of them get the adrenaline pumping like a Fast and Furious film or even Ambulance. Much of the showiest fight scenes are in brief flashes of the future, which are undercut as soon as it's revealed they didn't really happen. Much of the urgent action is Cassie fleeing with the girls — while yelling at them. Not only does this make for some boring repetition, but also it means three of the four heroines get limited actual hero action to act. Lost amid flashbacks and flashforwards and exposition dumps, Madame Web frequently forgets to be an action movie. As such, Sweeney, O'Connor, and Merced get little to do beyond playing sulking teens. What a waste of talent and charisma!  Whether in her performances or on a press tour, Johnson has a giver of no fucks energy that is intoxicating. It gives her an air of spontaneity that suggests anything might happen next, be it dressing down an endlessly energetic talk show host or mixing it up with a lost tribe of Spider-people. But Madame Web asks too much.  Boasting five contributors including Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S.J. Clarkson, and Kerem Sanga, the script pulls its characters not only across decades and far flung locations, but also through wildly different tones. Sometimes, it's an espionage thriller with high-tech doo-dads and a steely Zosia Mamet glaring at a keyboard. Sometimes, it's sci-fi mystery with characters arguing about science or misunderstood backstory. Sometimes it's a cringe comedy about an anti-social thirty-something who isn't interested in the hassle of being a hero. And here is where Johnson shines.  Johnson is sharply funny when she can lean into the uncomfortable comedy of forced socializing. A scene of baby shower games feels both wildly out of place in an action movie, and absolutely the movie's strongest, most entertaining scene. When Cassie makes a deeply impolite observation while pointing at the mom-to-be, Madame Web is alive. Here's where you can see why Johnson may have signed onto the script, this space where the heroine isn't likable or noble. She's kind of a dick! And it's hilarious, but beyond that actually daring for this genre.  Unfortunately, Johnson is weighed down by too much bad dialogue — and she seems to openly resent it. Delivering lines like, ""Hope the spiders were worth it, mom,"" while staring into a trunk of mementos, Johnson's voice is outright hostile. It's easy to imagine it's not so much Cassie at her long lost mother, but Johnson at the management team she has since ditched. Perhaps there's not a meta meaning behind these scenes of churlishness. But at least imagining there might be makes the movie a bit more interesting.  If only Sony believed in a version of Madame Web that gave Johnson the space to lean into her unique brand of smirking mischievousness! There might have been a movie that thrilled with wit and sparkled with energy. But as it is, Madame Web is burdened by too many threads and not enough fun. Still, it could be worse.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Within 5 minutes of Madame Web, I just heard in my head: ¨It’s Morbin Time.¨ Going to the screening, with a bunch of critics, was like going to Six Flags with your cousin that hates rollercoasters. They were ready to bash the felt ridiculousness we all knew was coming, but Madame Webb spins a really good time by being entertainingly terrible or, what some might call….camp. Franky, I LOVED IT and it is out Feb 14!  I was lucky to have sat next to a critic that, like me, grew up loving comic books. She understood that they are goofy, in essence. They are crazy, colorful, moving, but not, necessarily, in an existentially meaningful way: beyond whatever message you want to take from them. Immediately, you can feel in the air how our fellow critics would pan the writing and that is because its dialogues felt like they were straight from a comic page, which is not always a smooth transition. After all, comic book characters may be human, but they do not talk like real-life ones. They are just trying to get the story to progress, and you got the feeling, especially with how heavily Spiderman was insinuated but never named, that Madame Web was doing the same. Dakota Johnson is a pretty solid Cassandra Webb, and my only wish was that she or, perhaps, the whole movie more fully embraced the snark and silliness of its comic book world. Immediately, I felt echoes of Raimi´s original, Spidey visuals and aesthetic in director SJ Clarkson´s touch, and I wanted MORE: something I would say, often, throughout the film. GIVE ME MORE CRAZY! Still, Johnson carries the film with a dry wit that is very charming and enthusiastically anchors what others might, too easily, deem as stupid. In simpler perspective, this film is about a pregnant woman who goes to Peru and finds spider people, of which one has visions that 3 New York teenagers will kill him with spider-powers and decides to travel where he KNOWS he will die and end their lives while we have no idea how they will actually get their powers. Oh, he also kills the pregnant woman who then births a daughter that has visions of those girls, as well. This movie is the definition of when bad is good, when fun is just insane, and that some films thrive on how you swim through their floundering. For all the exiting grunts and giggling bashes from the theater, everyone was entertained and certainly talking.  I would see this movie with a WHOLE BUNCH of my funniest friends and a side splurge of cash for popcorn and a coke. It is truly the most unserious film, and that is why I left super excited for Kraven. I am SO READY for that movie, and a shirtless Aaron Taylor Johnson, after seeing Madame Web. It is going to be camp galore! Yet, I did leave the theater seeing why Sony is struggling in embracing the roots of the very Spidey world they, technically, originated. They are NOT MARVEL! They are Sam Raimi, and if you remember the original Spiderman films, they were camp and colorfulness. For GOD¨S SAKE! Tobey Maguire villain dancing is a classic internet meme, and Madame Web will CERTAINLY produce some quotes and memes, but that is its super-power. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Dakota Johnson ha hecho todo lo posible por alejarse de su experiencia ""psicótica"" rodando la saga Cincuenta sombras de Grey (2015-2018) y se ha ganado a la crítica con su trabajo en producciones indie y de autor como Suspiria (2018), La familia que tú eliges (2019) o Bailando por la vida (2022). Sin embargo, la actriz ha decidido volver ahora al Hollywood de alto presupuesto fichando por el género que domina la taquilla: la ficción de superhéroes. Tras la saga Venom (2018) y Morbius (2022), Sony expande su Spider-Verso con la telaraña de Madame Web, primera apuesta protagonizada por una mujer, con una veterana de la televisión, S. J. Clarkson (Jessica Jones, The Defenders), detrás de las cámaras. Johnson se mete en la piel de Cassandra Webb, mentora vidente de ‘Spidey’, representada en las viñetas como una mutante ciega y paralítica de avanzada edad.  La película de Sony ahonda en el origen del personaje y nos trae a una Cassandra más joven que trabaja como paramédico en Manhattan. Tras sufrir un accidente de trabajo, obtiene la habilidad de la clarividencia y, a través de sus visiones del futuro, conecta con tres chicas destinadas a desarrollar poderes arácnidos. Estas heroínas son Julia Carpenter (Sydney Sweeney), conocida por los lectores de los tebeos como Spider-Woman y futura Madame Web; Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), sobrina de J. Jonah Jameson y otra Spider-Woman en las páginas; y Anya Corazón (Isabela Merced), alias Spider-Girl, de origen latino. Juntas deben enfrentarse a Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), un explorador con poderes de araña, vinculado al pasado de Webb.  Es prácticamente imposible salvar una película sin un buen guion. Se puede perdonar una dirección sin autoría, algo cada vez más habitual en el cine de superhéroes, o disimular unas interpretaciones perezosas. Sin embargo, un libreto flojo incapaz de sacar jugo a una extensa colección de tebeos desemboca irremediablemente en desastre.  Lo más frustrante de Madame Web es que en todas estas áreas se percibe el propósito de hacerlo bien. Lo vemos en las decisiones en dirección, desde los movimientos de cámara que nos ponen del revés para después darnos la vuelta, como si fuéramos una araña (aunque la calidad del CGI no acompañe), hasta una estética 'dosmilera' con una banda sonora que es un gozo millennial.  También lo vemos en la disposición de su elenco, capitaneado por Johnson en un papel rara avis, irónico y huraño, que le va como anillo al dedo. Incluso lo vemos en el guion, por momentos atinadamente cómico, sin miedo a reformular un personaje sin mucho bagaje en las viñetas para, además, usarlo como tela de araña que entrelaza la vida de otros héroes.  Todo ese potencial aleja a Madame Web del sinsentido de Venom: Habrá Matanza (2021) o el despropósito de Morbius (2022). Sin embargo, esa sensación constante de déjà vu que sufre la protagonista debido a sus visiones contagia el patio de butacas y sentimos inevitablemente que esta historia ya la hemos visto mil veces. Tal vez se deba a que la trama, perezosa y conformista, lejos de fingir saberse autoconsciente o jugar al despiste de la libertad creativa, se deja arrastrar descaradamente por el pesado sello de Marvel.  Madame Web es un amasijo de lugares comunes de la clásica historia de origen, una búsqueda fallida de virtuosismo visual, un pastiche de supeheroínas sin tiempo para brillar en un relato demasiado coral. Tiene buenas ideas, frases punzantes y ganas de hacerlo bien, pero todo ello no hace sino más dolorosa la certeza de que su potencial está desaprovechado.  Queda prohibida toda reproducción sin permiso escrito de la empresa a los efectos del artículo 32.1, párrafo segundo, de la Ley de Propiedad Intelectual.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Decía Dakota Johnson en la gira de presentación de 'Madame Web' que era  “Como si la I.A. generara la película perfecta para tu novio” y no se equivocaba en cierta forma. Hay muchos momentos que parecen escritos por una inteligencia artificial —eso no es nada nuevo en el blockbuster actual— y su casting femenino parece dirigido a saciar la mirada de hombres ansiosos de ver a bellezas de moda —ay, la sospechosa escena de la cpr—, más que presentar una historia de empoderamiento frente a un villano masculino. Da la impresión de que la actriz tenía que decir algo por intentar justificar cómo afrontar su campaña para un proyecto dudoso, que nace dentro de un declive general del género que se ejemplifica bien en el improbable universo que está construyendo Sony a partir de personajes secundarios de Spider-Man, en el que tuvieron un tropiezo considerable con las dos entregas de ‘Venom’, convirtiendo a uno de los grandes villanos de Marvel en un grosero vertedero de bromas de despedida de soltero. Sin embargo, el límite por el fondo se lo lleva ‘Morbius’, una pésima traducción de uno de los personajes oscuros más interesantes del mundo trepamuros, que se recuerda en redes por un par de memes de Jared Leto y Matt Smith que hacen parecer la película más disparatada y atolondrada de lo que es. No ha llegado ‘Madame Web’ para cambiar la tendencia de este universo, pero por lo menos el accidente que supone hacer una película de superhéroes que no lo es realmente tiene un poco más de interés. Porque ‘Madame Web’ puede ser vista como una consecuencia inesperada, un signo de los tiempos, la prueba final de que Hollywood no se mueve por ideas sino por intuiciones, datos y algoritmos que aseguran cierta rentabilidad antes de proponer una nueva propuesta. El personaje original, una anciana ciega en silla de ruedas con poderes de clarividencia, no ha tenido sentido ni para una serie de cómics propia en Marvel, pero la audacia de Sony con tal de llevarse su pedacito de pastel es inaudita. Nada como contratar al dúo de Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, más conocidos como los responsables de ‘Dioses de Egipto’, para darle forma a una de las operaciones industriales más absurdas del Hollywood reciente. En cierta forma, ‘Madame Web’ es como una especie de ejercicio de clase de guion en la que el profesor ha encargado hacer algo donde se supone que hay una personaje con capacidad de ver el futuro y tres acompañantes que en algún momento del metraje deben llevar trajes a modo de variaciones de Spider-woman. ¿Cuál es el reto? Que en realidad no sea una película de superhéroes, sino la evocación de una, algo difícil de explicar sin spoilers, pero la forma correcta de enunciarlo tiene que ver con la idea de la posibilidad de una película del género que no acaba de realizarse nunca. Casi un experimento que tiene la heroína principal limitándose a que el destino se ocupe del supervillano en escenas de visiones que permiten no utilizar la violencia típica de las escenas de acción tradicionales que hemos visto mes tras mes en los últimos 15 años. De alguna manera, la película nos está diciendo que el cine de superhéroes está roto, agotado y tan machacado que la única salida es… no hacer más cine de superhéroes. Parece que, en su estrategia sinvergüenza de no ofrecer lo que promete en el tráiler está comunicando que la salvación del género es relegar sus elementos más esperables a una posición terciaria y dedicarse a explotar otras posibilidades. ¿Es consciente de todo ello? Seguramente no, pero lo único que los productores tienen claro es tener una escena con Sydney Sweeney bailando Toxic de Britney Spears llevando minifalda encima de la mesa de un dinner por exigencias del guion. Y es que la película está ambientada en 2003, pese a que apenas se note por elementos de ambientación, más allá de que tanto en puesta en escena, montaje y fotografía, luce exactamente como un producto barato, olvidado y anacrónico de aquella época. No es de extrañar con la experiencia en series de la directora, S.J. Clarkson, que parezca confundida aquí con el piloto para una serie del canal CW que nunca llegará. Una pereza que se transmite en la actitud casi sardónica de una Dakota Johnson consciente de que está ahí como casi todos los demás, un “toma el dinero y corre” que se resuelve con cierta profesionalidad, pero no sin algo de sorna. Más pena da ver aquí a Tahar Rahim, un actor destinado a hacer un gran villano que se queda funcionando en piloto automático con un guion que no le sirve ni para construir a un chulopiscinas con clase. Tampoco va más allá un Adam Scott desaprovechado y relegado a ser el nexo de unión con el universo Marvel de una forma tan arbitraria como todo el resto de decisiones. Tanto es así que las conexiones con el universo Spider-man se acaban resumiendo en el momento más bizarro y escatológico que pudiera asociarse nunca a los orígenes —en el sentido más literal de la palabra— del superhéroe más popular de la factoría Marvel. Y por ello, la película no deja de ser una excentricidad divertida, más o menos funcional, a la que se puede mirar con cierta fascinación. Es más una secuela blandita y para todos los públicos de ‘Destino Final’ que una producción de superhéroes. Lo improbable de los medios tecnológicos del villano para localizar a las chicas con las que sueña que acaban con él, al estilo profecía de Poncio Pilato, tienen derivaciones tecnológicas tan implausibles que parecen estar riéndose de los sistemas “científicos” y “creíbles” de ‘El caballero oscuro’. Hay viajes de Nueva York a Perú que transcurren en un parpadeo que parece desafiar a las transiciones caducas de blockbuster de los 2000 de ‘Aquaman’ y escenas de acción que no llegan a suceder nunca que parecen estar diciendo que lo que importa al público de este subgénero ha dejado de ser relevante más allá de justificar una marca, unos guiños que conecten una mitología compartida o el nombre presente en unas páginas de cómic. Quizá ‘Madame Web’ ha nacido para exponer de forma descarada que ya da igual mancillar lo escrito en viñetas de páginas de oro, que las “infancias violadas” valen tanto como el número de entradas de cine que un estudio pueda sacar gracias a los que en algún momento han pensado que ir a ver la adaptación de un personaje terciario o cuaternario ha sido una buena idea. Puede que sea la película más caradura y la más honesta del año, o bien la gran obra llamada a hacer estrellarse para siempre a un género que no encuentra el camino de regreso en las salas de cine.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024"," 
	The Spider-Man universe has a cadre of supporting characters in its vault. Cassandra “Madame” Web is one such character who first appeared in the Amazing Spider-Man issue #210 in the fall of 1980. Created by Denny O’Neil and artist John Romita Jr., Cassandra is an elderly, disabled woman with precognitive abilities who helps Peter Parker find a kidnapping victim.  
	Years later, in early 2000s New York City, Cassie (Dakota Johnson), is an EMT worker following in her mother’s footsteps. One day while saving an innocent man on a bridge, she falls into the river below and is suddenly connected to metaphysical web of future scenarios, which ignites her ability to see the future.  
	Ezekiel, now in NYC with advanced technology, seeks to kill three young women: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced). Having gained the magical Spider’s powers, he sees the future of his death at the hands of the girls, once they achieve their Spider powers. Cassie, having crossed paths with the girls, foresees Ezekiel’s attack on them, steps in to save them and changes their futures. 
	Clarkson’s cinematic endeavor into Cassandra’s world acts as an origin story for these characters, but and at the heart of the Madame Web film only lies a singular redeeming quality: the depiction of Cassie’s visions. These glitch-like edits, intended to mirror her psychic experiences, stand out as a rare instance of care in the film’s production. This also highlight the overall lack of attention to detail. 
	Exposition dominates the narrative landscape for a heavy-handed delivery of plot points devoid of urgency. There’s a sequence where Cassie’s journey to Peru results in an encounter with wise Indigenous people who, with a heavy dose of dialogue, guide Cassie towards her powers. So not only are we doing the magical person of color trope, but they have to be the ones to explain everything?! If the robotic performances were stronger, maybe some feeling could be gleaned from these exposition dumps. 
	The ADR mishaps are so pronounced that it transforms the viewing experience into something akin to watching a poorly dubbed foreign film, particularly with Ezekiel’s character, where the audio and actor are misaligned. The special effects seem unfinished, which made me wonder if they were ever fully rendered to begin with. Such blatant oversight not only distracts but also detracts from the storytelling, making the audience painfully aware of the film’s unfinishedness. 
	Spider-Woman (particularly Julia Cornwall) play a much larger part of the Spider-Man comics mythos, (she has her own comic for crying out loud), and fans have been asking for Julia to leap off the page onto movie screens for years. Unfortunately, there was no intentionality behind creating lasting characters with the aim of existing in a larger cinematic world. This embodies the pitfalls of mainstream superhero cinema: films not driven by story and character but seemingly by studio mandates, and franchise considerations.  
Madame Web’s failure to engage on any meaningful level serves as a reminder of the importance of passion, care and authenticity in filmmaking. This movie comes across as a vehicle to maintain stake in the Spider-Man universe, rather than a genuine attempt to offer a refreshing take on the Spider-Man history that champions female protagonists and introduces a narrative filled with tangible suspense.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Her baby miraculously lives, and we see her adult self when the story moves ahead to 2003. That’s Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson, miscast) who works as an EMT alongside her platonic partner Ben Parker (Adam Scott of “Parks & Recreation” fame). Cassie suffers a near-death experience while saving a man trapped on a bridge, and she suddenly has the power to see the near future. If things go south in her vision, then she can choose a different course of action to avoid that fate. That gift still comes in handy when she runs into Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a man obsessed with killing three young women who pose a threat to his evil plans. “Madame Web” starts poorly and never finds its footing. The opening scenes induce unintentional laughter, and it won’t be the only guffaws echoing in the theater. Johnson remains an endearing on-screen presence, but she lacks the charisma a genre film demands. That’s still superior to her nemesis. Rahim delivers one of the worst performances in a superhero film … ever. Blame director S.J. Clarkson, who never gets a proper handle on the material and clearly could have coaxed better line readings from Rahim and co. In her defense, she’s forced to work with a script she penned alongside three collaborators. This script might have passed muster for an “Afterschool Special” of yore, but for a film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe it’s soul crushing. The story may be set in 2003, but the villainous Ezekiel taps into technology that’s very much of this moment. Then again, plot chasms litter the film and prove a constant distraction. The film falls flat during rare attempts at character development. Cassie is shown as distant, even rude, to the patients she helps save in her line of work. The action scenes do little to pick up the slack, and the foreshadowing employed during one scene is so obvious your eyes will roll like a slot machine during the inevitable callback. Alternately silly and clunky, “Madame Web” brims with cringe-worthy scenes. If you can watch the endangered trio dancing on a table for the bemusement of some horny young men you’ve got a steel spine. Cassie takes a quick solo trip to the Amazon and, well, it’s hard to even describe how ludicrous this detour proves without spoiling what could be a killer cult film highlight in 2034. One Dumpster fire after another that Disney investors are ignoring. It is so bad, most movies are being reworked for release in 2025. What’s really upsetting for Disney-Marvel is that movies cost millions to produce, but lose Billions in Boxoffice hits.  Do they just have so much money to burn? This is what happens when you allow directors to write a script instead of writers and I am not talking about the screen writers guild of Hollywood hacks.  Just to pick a name most people should know, take for example Michael Chrichton.  The man was an author who sold millions of books in many languages around the world and still does years after he’s been dead.  In addition to writing solid novels, he created the St Elsewhere TV Series which was an amazing show.  He wrote the original Westworld as a screenplay, not a book but had nothing to do with the new TV Series that had so much flash and absolutely no soul.  He wrote the novel and screenplay for Jurassic Park.  The mark of an actual writer that directors and the screen writers guild do not have, in Chricton’s own words, “I wrote a screenplay about cloning a pterodactyl from fossil DNA in 1983, but the story wasn’t convincing. I worked on it for several years since, trying to make it more credible.”  Hollywood has no patience for that kind of dedication.  You want a super hero movie?  Get a super hero comics author to write it.  You want a solid super hero feel to the movie?  Let a super hero comics storyboarder to do the movie storyboard.  Then you get an actual movie director to direct it, not one of these policitical woketivists who want to make a statement with their ‘art’ … some one like, say… Frank Capra, John Sturges, or maybe John Huston. Marvel has sacrificed its billion-dollar brand and can’t-miss name on the altar of the Diversity Cult.
On behalf of straight white men everywhere – Ha ha ha ha ha ha! For anyone keeping score, Hollywood is now 0 for 3 on these all-female team-up comic book movies: Birds of Prey, The Marvels, and now Madame Web. All of them made by a female director no one’s heard of, because in the new woke Hollywood, gender segregation is more important than hiring people who know what they’re doing.  Sony’s “Madame Web” does not fill the quota for a superhero film with heart and soul. Not only is the latest addition to the Marvel canon lacking a true emotional core.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," “Madame Web” is the first Marvel-affiliated movie for which I feel truly sorry. Most of its problems are quality-related. But some aren’t; some relate to audience fatigue and OK, well, here’s another one.  Sony Pictures’ piece of the Marvel pie, separate from the official, Disney-branded Marvel Cinematic Universe, includes  the “Spider-Man”  movies plus “Venom” and a few others. That pie has been sitting out on the counter, unrefrigerated, for a long time now. This is not “Madame Web’s” fault. The director and co-writer S.J. Clarkson makes her feature debut here; her extensive TV credits include the Marvel series “The Defenders” and “Jessica Jones.” “Madame Web” feels like it should not have been conceived as a movie — with its modest visual scale, the wobbly dramatic stakes, Dakota Johnson’s small performance, Sydney Sweeney’s small performance, Tahar Rahim’s small performance. It plays like a bland, third-season Marvel series as watched on a 12-year-old TV set playing in the wrong dramatic aspect ratio, which I realize isn’t a real thing. But now it is. Typically these Marvel-derived origin stories (the Madame Web character was introduced in 1980) have an advantage over the average JAS (Just Another Sequel), even if job No. 1 is to tee up the hoped-for franchise. In this case, it’s a narrative about three teenage girls with gradually revealed superpowers and their extremely powerful guardian/pal, New York City paramedic Cassie Webb (played by Johnson). Cassie is the orphaned daughter of the intrepid Peruvian Amazon rainforest spider-hunter who dies in childbirth, assisted in the worst way by a gunshot wound. We learn the identity of the perp straight off. With “Madame Web,” the audience knows everything the characters take forever to learn themselves. Most of it unfolds in 2003, with the grown-up Cassie and her fellow paramedic Ben Parker (Adam Scott) saving lives but nearly losing Cassie in a near-death incident. She comes through, but is now haunted by strange time-loop hiccups and uncertain powers of clairvoyance. She can see the future, but only a few seconds into that future. At first, anyway. In the right state of mind, i.e., high crisis mode, Cassie flits from past tense to future tense to present, without much control. She’s like the movie, in other words. The villain Ezekiel (Rahim), who stole the red jungle spider in the prologue, wants to harness its power for bad, not good (that’s why he’s bad, or at least misunderstood). He and his assistant (the deadpan Zosia Mamet) spend a fair amount of screen time looking at screens, searching for the whereabouts of Webb and the three young women who will kill him someday. He knows this because the super-spider’s venom runs through his veins, just as it does with Cassie, enabling him to foretell future events. The young women at the center of all this are played, gamely, by  Sweeney (Julia), Celeste O’Connor (Mattie) and Isabela Merced (Anya). In stronger moviemaking circumstances, they’d be all right. The script, with four credited writers, and the filmmaking lack an activating spirit. Director Clarkson leans into the teenage characters’ frustrations and confusion for genuine feeling and pathos, but they’re dramatized with distressing flatness. Also, the frequent depictions of Cassie’s dream state, or subconscious, where she’s able to vision-quest all over the place and even commune with her late mother, resemble a waterlogged waiting room just outside an auxiliary quantum realm. I generally like Johnson on screen, but her low-stress underplaying is not quite right for this stuff. Nobody in this movie pops, or crackles, or snaps, or finds ways to energize the blah blah. The action’s not much; the acting’s minimalist bordering on somnambulant. During one corporate event a few years ago, Sony used the phrase “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” in reference to its future slate, with an acronym of SPUMC. It’s fun to say — “spummk!” — but it evokes something less than fun to watch. And here we are.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," This is a character who goes back to 1980 and whose powers of clairvoyance helped Peter Parker at some point. She’s elderly and blind and sits atop a web throne that keeps her alive. But to be honest, reading about her didn’t help give any more meaning or urgency to the Dakota Johnson movie that’s heading to theaters Wednesday. You’ve been warned. “Madame Web” is striving to be a classic superhero setup movie, about how the future Madame Web — now just single gal paramedic Cassie Webb — comes to terms with her newfound power that allows her to see the future. Well, sometimes at least, when it involves a death or something extremely violent.  It’s also about the origins of a few other Spider-Women who are now just a couple of teenage girls, played by 20-somethings Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Celeste O’Connor (Mattie Franklin). Watching the flash-forwards to these three in their Spidey costumes makes you feel like there’s some Marvel TV show you forgot to watch that might make you care more. A scene in which they try to sell the idea that all four women are connected in some cosmic way is so wildly strained (“you live in my building,” “you ran in front of my truck”) and inconsequential, you wonder if whichever screenwriter wrote their run-ins initially was even talking to the one who had to try to sell these coincidences. It’s impossible to know what exactly the four credited screenwriters (and three “story by” credits) are responsible for, but “Madame Web” feels like the stitched-together product of a bunch of people who weren’t actually collaborating. There is also an alarming amount of repetition in just under two hours. Part of this is because Cassie is learning about her powers and sees various incidents play out over and over, which, by the fourth set piece, starts to get very tedious. You forgive it, a little, because Johnson is just always fun to watch and it at least serves a story purpose in theory. But then there’s all these scenes in which the bad guy, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), is either seeing his future death at the hands of the Spider-Girls (or whatever we’re calling them) or barking at his associate (Zosia Mamet) to find them with her “Dark Knight”-era surveillance setup in his blandly cold penthouse. We know Rahim to be a talented, charismatic actor, but Ezekiel is one of the dullest, most thinly sketched superhero villains in recent memory. The movie doesn’t even withhold his own cosmic connection to Cassie as a reveal — it literally opens with him killing her mother (Kerry Bishé) who is on a spider research trip in the Amazon while very pregnant with her. The venom, and some Amazonian spider-people, save the baby though.  Johnson’s singular performance style can make almost anything watchable. Her cool-girl deadpan is always interesting and funny and, thankfully, filmmaker S.J. Clarkson has the good sense to keep the camera on her as much as possible. She makes gems out of nothing and finds humor even while the script and story are crumbling around her. It’s too bad because there could have been a more fun movie in here — Clarkson imbues it with a distinctly feminine and teenage energy that makes good use of its soundtrack. But it spins itself into a knot trying to justify a silly story instead. The studio, it seems, is playing a very long game with this one. Cassie’s paramedic colleague is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), whose sister-in-law Mary Parker (Emma Roberts) is about to give birth. But one has to imagine after seeing “Madame Web,” that, ironically, whatever payoff was planned may be a vision that will not come to pass. “Madame Web,” a Sony Pictures release in theaters Feb. 14, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “violence/action and language.” Running time: 117 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," ""Seriously, don't do dumb things."" This quote is a call to action that Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) instructs upon three teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced) as she leaves them stranded in the woods to figure out her next steps. This is after Cassie saved them from certain death aboard a New York City subway circa 2003. Cassie was recently gifted with the power to see the near future, and what she often sees is a spider-like villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), and his vengeful plan to murder the girls before they murder him. Thus is the premise of ""Madame Web,"" the newest offering from Sony's Spider-Man Universe that never reaches its full potential, nor does it even try. Laced with not-so-subtle references to Peter Parker's Spider-Man (Tom Holland), this movie serves as a prequel to 2017's ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" in the worst possible ways. Billed as a suspense thriller within the Spider-Man Universe prior to Spider-Man's arrival, ""Madame Web"" is a torturous two hours that becomes quite a waste of its supreme talent. Fast forward to 2003, and Sims is rich, powerful, handsome, and beyond cartoonish. The spider has proven to be a blessing and a curse for the magnate as he's somehow gained superpowers similar to a spider but has nightmares of his eventual murder at the hands of three women in capes. He enlists the help of assistant Amaria (Zosia Mamet) to track down the three women, currently teenagers in 2003, so he can kill them before they gain superpowers to override his advances. Cassie is the only thing stopping Sims from achieving his killing spree, though she's pretty effective at doing so at the last possible second before any of the girls are harmed. These semi-heroic actions are usually performed by drinking a can of Pepsi, running Sims over with a car (in multiple instances), driving said car through a diner, billboard advertisement, or whatever you can think of. It's unclear how Cassie got her one power, as there wasn't a spider bite, radiation, or the standard ways Marvel superheroes morph during her transformation. Her gravity-defying scene-stealers are laughable at best. The low-stakes quality of ""Madame Web"" serves as a jumping-off point for Dakota Johnson to appear bored throughout the film, especially when external characters try to give her advice that seeps into the Spider-Man lore we've heard a thousand times over the decades. Think, ""With great power comes great responsibility…"" and you'll know where this film is headed. We even get glimpses of Peter Parker's mom pregnant with the future web-slinger, Uncle Ben, in tow. Even those sub-plots feel forced and pandering. It's apparent that this film sets up future installments that tie into the Spider-Man Universe, but I beg Sony not to go through with them. The eye-rolling dialogue, cliché action sequences, and tedious characters lacking variety or valuation make it challenging to see why we need more from this world. Cassie is an unlikable character who never dons a cape and is never referred to as the titular Madame Web. Sims is a confusingly weak villain who evokes ""Final Destination"" vibes and is the only character to wear a costume and be barefoot at the same time.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Madame Web isn't the worst film to come out of the Sony-Marvel experiment; that title still lovingly goes to Morbius, but for every good idea it has, the film executes it poorly. Madame Web has some good ideas, but poor execution mimicking the worst aspects of early 2000s comic book movies drags down the entire production into something as thin and flimsy as a spider web. Director: S.J. Clarkson
Summary: Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present. Madame Web was a concept that seemed strange for a big-screen adaptation. This character is not a good fit for action scenes and the sort of VFX stuff we see in films. Those familiar with comics were even more confused when the casting was announced, and those unfamiliar were confused about why they should care and why this had a Marvel logo attached to it at all. At its core, the ideas that Madame Web plays around with aren't bad. A villain who is trying to prevent his own murder by heroes who aren't heroes yet, a central character whose powers are completely cerebral, and three teenagers just being teenagers with hints about what their futures could be. However, there are so many ways that this film fumbles its own premise. The main one is our central character, Cassandra. Dakota Johnson does what she can with a script that gives her absolutely nothing to work with. We don't learn much about Cassandra's life or her motivations. For example, we don't know why she decided to be a paramedic or how her experiences in the foster care system shaped her. Before we know it, she is starting to develop her powers, leading to awkward encounters where Cassandra is experiencing things twice, and we see people react to her being strange about it. We learn more about her when the film decides to completely forget the ""show, don't tell"" rule. It's never really explained why she forms this bond with these three girls, aside from the fact that she doesn't want to see three kids murdered. All of her moments with the girls are stilted and awkward in a way that isn't written into the story. Johnson seems uncomfortable with everything happening around her, and the most believable moments of the film for Cassandra aren't until she fully accepts her powers and starts speaking in that slightly amused and smug voice of someone who knows something you don't know. Our three teenagers are teenagers. Madame Web does its best to give each of them personality and backstory, but there isn't enough time to know each of them individually. As a trio, they work well together and have decent chemistry. They are believable as teenagers who barely tolerate each other to care about one another. Adam Scott is fine playing Ben Parker, but every time he shows up on screen, the movie seems to get really proud of the fact that we have a young Ben Parker on screen. This is even worse for Emma Roberts as Mary Parker and the way the movie thinks it is being super cute about who her baby is. It's fun the first time the film makes that reference, but by the fifth, it gets very old, very fast. However, out of everything, poor Tahar Rahim might be saddled with the worst role out of everyone. His dialogue is somehow even more stilted than everyone else. Ezekiel and his motivations could have been really interesting if the film had explored them better. He sees the girls murdering him every night, and, like anyone else, he doesn't want to die, so he figured the only way to live is to kill them first. A better film could have explored this idea with a level of nuance, maybe showing Ezekiel having some doubts about slaughtering three teenage girls in cold blood for something they haven't done yet, but apparently, being evil is super awesome. There is not an ounce of hesitation from him, which takes away any sense of sympathy or understanding we might have for him. There also must be some deleted scenes because he talks about having motivations that aren't related to saving his own life, but Madame Web doesn't take the time to explore them. So Ezekiel is running around in a suit trying to murder three teenagers because he saw Minority Report the year before and decided that was the best way to solve his problems. The core of the matter is that this film takes great care to remind us that it is set in 2003 and feels like a superhero movie from that time. In the late '90s and into the early 2000s, comic book movies were becoming a thing, but studios and some of the people making the films still seemed like like they were a little ashamed of the fact that they were making films based on comic books [see the ""yellow spandex"" joke in X-Men]. Everything about this film felt so constrained and like it was fighting against its own premise. They never really take advantage of Cassandra's powers to do something fun with time like Tenet. It's all framed as Cassandra being in the right place at the right time, which is such a boring way to show clairvoyance on screen. It's a tough power to present on screen, but there had to be a better way than Cassandra telling everyone when to duck. Madame Web isn't the worst film to come out of the Sony-Marvel experiment; that title still lovingly goes to Morbius, but for every good idea it has, the film executes it poorly. There was potential here, and maybe this could have come together in different hands. The movie in theaters, however, is just another miss for Sony in the live-action Marvel films. This is strike one; they have two more before the end of this year, but you have to wonder what happens if they hit strike three. All three of the Sony-Marvel films this year are at some level of failure. Unlike Cassandra, we can't see the future, but in the present, Madame Web falls apart and will ultimately be forgotten before the summer hits.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024","  Madame Web swings and misses badly as a standalone superhero origin story in the Marvel universe. One-note characters bumble around in a poorly conceived plot rife with terrible dialogue and bewildering visual effects. A capable cast has their talent squandered by the questionable directorial execution of a weak script. The film strikes a silly tone while desperately trying to be serious. It also lacks the blockbuster action scenes expected in a big-budget genre film. There's little to like or recommend apart from the unintentional bad humor. You'll laugh out loud for the wrong reasons.   Set in 2003 New York City, paramedic Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson) races through the streets with her ambulance siren blaring. Her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott) – you read that right – performs CPR on an injured woman. They arrive at the hospital in the nick of time. Cassie's uncomfortable accepting a hand-drawn thank you card from the patient's son. Raised in foster homes since birth, the orphaned Cassie never had a family.   Meanwhile, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) has the same nightmare that has been plaguing him for years. He must find three women that decide his fate in the future. Sims has extraordinary abilities from an event that happened in the Peruvian rainforest 30 years ago. He uses his powers for evil and to enrich himself. Sims has procured the technological means to find the phantom enemies of his dreams. Amaria (Zosia Mamet), his loyal assistant, can now achieve this task through facial recognition.   A horrible accident triggers clairvoyant visions in Cassie. Something deep inside her has been unlocked. Cassie can now see the future for herself and everyone in her presence. A trip to Grand Central Station leads to an encounter with three very different teenage girls. Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) are in immediate danger from a relentless villain.   Madame Web reimagines the protagonist from the comic books. Johnson's Cassie is healthy and fit but emotionally withdrawn as an outsider. The script attempts to portray her as a loner who struggles to make attachments. Ben and her fellow paramedics are highly inclusive. She's one of the gang and gently ribbed as such. The idea of her being a lost soul doesn't ring true with the given exposition. Cassie has a dear friend who can be trusted and plays a pivotal role in the climax. These early scenes make little sense because Cassie is surrounded by people who care about her well-being.   The supporting female leads are cardboard cutouts at best. They are destined to be superheroes for some unknown reason. The girls have no backstory and depth except for summary explanations to Cassie once they're all together. Julia is the shy blonde, Mattie's a skateboarding rebel with a starter afro, and Anya's a brainy Latina who speaks in math formulas. They say and do little, apart from their generic stereotypical personalities. We're meant to accept that the girls are disowned and need Cassie as their valiant savior. They're the family she's been missing. It's like watching an after-school special with sappy, contrived melodrama.   Madame Web challenges for the worst dialogue in recent superhero cinema. The interactions here make Fantastic Four and Eternals look Oscar-worthy. Cassie talking to a cat in her apartment is the first sign of verbal disaster to come. The characters don't sound natural. Their witless banter feels staged, especially as the plot thickens and violence ensues. The girls arguing with Cassie after literally running for their lives is absolutely absurd. Then we get an earful of Sims chastising Amaria in a scene so bad it could be studied.   It's déjà vu all over again as Cassie repeatedly relives tragedies and tries to change their outcomes. The film's visual effects are disconcerting by design. Cassie's flooded with baffling imagery and sounds before each occurrence. The rub is that she has to learn to control her powers, or they're all mincemeat. The training of her spider-sense in the second act is stunningly stupid. This is when the already struggling narrative falls off the dumb tree, hits every branch, and lands with a thud. It also marks a negative change in how her clairvoyance is portrayed.   Madame Web switches chance for fate as the primary story driver. There's nothing random to Cassie's arachnid evolution. It was her destiny to become a mystical mother hen. The film's primary tenet allows for shoddy script work. She can pop around anywhere, and action will find her like a plot-seeking missile. This gets old pretty fast and has numerous logic flaws. There are significant issues with how she deduces her adversary's identity. It's a total copout that can't be ignored.   The struggle to find anything positive is a fruitless endeavor. Madame Web disappoints in every regard. A bad script can spell doom, but there had to be a further disconnect between filming and post-production. Thankfully, you don't have to stick around for the non-existent post-credits scene.   Madame Web is a production of Columbia Pictures, Marvel Entertainment, and Di Bonaventura Pictures. It will be released theatrically on Feb. 14 from Sony Pictures. Watch the trailer below.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years.

"Feb 13, 2024"," S. J. Clarkson’s flaccidly conceived Madame Web presents itself as a superhero origin movie but unfolds nothing like one. In taking on a stalk-and-chase structure, where the big baddie (Tahir Rahim) does his best impression of Robert Patrick’s T-1000, the film hopes to inject a narrative wrinkle into an otherwise familiar tale. But in the process, it unearths a newfound low for the genre. Its attempts at gravity ring hollower than its blatant product placement. At its best, Madame Web unfolds as a trashy, big-budgeted slasher flick cobbled together from the weakest elements of other movies—lacking any and all ambition to forge an identity outside of them. As a result, its more lighthearted moments recall the canned laughter of a cheap network sitcom, while its melodrama becomes as trite as any soap opera. What makes matters worse is that it takes itself far too seriously. Madame Web reeks of a film that’s in dire need of a cogent vision, often sacrificing its odder, more enticing moments for mass appeal. What remains is an experience that lacks a pulse and a soul across each of its 116 minutes. The screenplay, co-penned by Clarkson, follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), an orphaned New York City paramedic. After an accident, she develops clairvoyant abilities that allow her to peer into the future. After she foresees a grizzly fate for three young women —Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced)— she takes it upon herself to save them from their spider-powered assailant, Ezekial (Rahim). She confronts a hidden past that sets her on a path she could have never predicted. Madame Web banks on the surface-level nostalgia of its early 2000s setting to help set it apart from its contemporaries. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes an arbitrary detail that actively pulls viewers out of its story. It trumpets Britney Spear’s “Toxic” while its characters embody Gen Zers who somehow have time traveled back to 2003—often speaking in quippy colloquialisms popularized by social media. It’s an inconsistency indicative of a film grasping for straws, mightily struggling to cultivate a personality out of worn-down cliches while it runs the gamut of superhero tropes. Madame Web’s glaring plot holes only detach us from its rapidly sputtering tale, making us believe that a quick, two-day trip to Peru was possible in a post-9/11 America. By the time Cassandra taps into her true powers, we’ve already lost the ability to emotionally invest. The sloppy storytelling is propped up by even shoddier filmmaking. Clarkson and her cinematographer Mauro Fiore seem unable to decide on a visual throughline, rapidly shifting between styles at random, stifling any chance of a memorable set piece through its piecemeal construction. In one breath, it’s defined by quick zooming, docu-style camerawork while the next is abound with over-polished and flatly lit slow-motion. In attempting to be everything, Madame Web manifests as a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas that fail to become much of anything. Where Sam Raimi’s Spiderman Trilogy leaned into its eccentricity, Clarkson’s take on fellow spider-hero feels markedly afraid to do the same, never fully leaning into its stalker framework. Resulting in unintended laughs when Rahim’s nemesis enters the frame to the tune of a high-pitched jump scare. It also doesn’t help that the characters populating the screen are just as lifelessly constructed. The three teenagers, each with their share of familial trauma, often bleed into one another, morphing into one amorphous, caricatured whole that garners more eye-rolls than earned emotion. Johnson’s feigned gasps and protracted, blank stares only serve to heighten how underdeveloped her character truly is. Rahim’s supervillain, whose commitment to altering his fate amounts to little more than a steady stream of exaggerated scowls. Madame Web’s utter lack of originality is a testament to how corporatized and soulless it feels. In attempting to tap into the framework of “stalker” films, Clarkson’s misfire retains none of the style, palpability, and sense of risk that makes them so memorable. Madame Web is the cinematic embodiment of the term “Superhero Fatigue,” emblematic of the tired, overwrought films superheroes are increasingly occupying. We can only hope it serves as a warning to the right people—a dire indicator of where superhero cinema is heading if greater storytelling chances aren’t embraced.

"Feb 13, 2024"," LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13 (UPI) -- Madame Web, in theaters Wednesday, is bad in ways even debacles like Catwoman and Batman & Robin never broached. In 2003, Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) is an EMT who avoids connecting with patients or her partner, Ben (Adam Scott). But, after a near-death experience, Cassie begins to see glimpses of the future. Her nemesis, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), can see the future, namely the three women who kill him. Their paths cross when Cassie rescues Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) before Sims gets to them. For Cassie, psychic visions are merely a plot device. The viewer witnesses violence as Cassie sees it, then she's able to act differently and escape danger. But Madame Web loses its way long before Cassie ever gets her powers. The exposition establishing the film's mythology and connections to Spider-Man play like temporary dialogue in a first draft that never got revised. The film begins showing Cassie's mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), exploring the Peruvian Amazon in 1973 while pregnant. Sims was her assistant, who betrayed her and managed to get some spider powers he uses for evil, but the Peruvian spiders saved Constance's baby. Comic books, and comic book movies, forgive a lot of farfetched technobabble, such as the radioactive spider that originally gave Peter Parker his powers. The joy of movies like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Iron Man or Captain America is how they explain themselves with sincerity. From the moment Sims asks Constance about the spiders she's looking for, it does not sound like a conversation any human beings would have, let alone two partners. They're literally telling the audience the information required for the story, but grudgingly so. Someone who's been living with that nightly prophecy could probably think of a more organic way to break the news. Later he says, ""Every day that goes by, my appointment with death gets closer."" Maybe if Sims stopped cackling so hard, the superheroes in his vision wouldn't have a reason to kill him. Sims also keeps repeating his vague backstory, that he came from nothing, but it's not important enough to specify any of the details. Sims' personal hacker, Amaria (Zosia Mamet), hacks into the National Security Agency and marvels at their surveillance, for the first time in 2003. Rather than a commentary on the surveillance state that evolved, it feels like a TikToker just summarized a Wikipedia entry. To show how driven Constance is, she says her kicking baby is trying to keep her from working but she won't be deterred. This is not only a terrible line, but a trick so the movie can reveal Constance's true motivations later in the film. The premise of a loner discovering she actually does like a chosen family is a sound staple of narrative fiction. However, Cassie only befriends the three girls because of the plot, not any connection they make. Cassie wants to keep Sims from killing them, and she teaches them CPR, but they never get to know each other. Each of the three girls has a different scenario that separated them from their parents, but they recite those stories as more exposition, not an emotional need. The action is mainly Cassie and the three girls on the run from Sims, but a mediocre version of a chase movie. As an ambulance driver, Cassie has some useful vehicular moves, but they're barely fast and hardly furious. It takes the entire movie to reveal what Cassie's real superpower is, besides her visions. Imagine if Superman didn't fly until the last scene, or if Spider-Man didn't sling a web until the end. On the positive side, Madame Web features more location work than standing in front of screens. They filmed in New York, some action scenes in Boston, additional shooting in Los Angeles and Mexico, which must have doubled for Peru. At least Catwoman and Batman & Robin believed in what they were doing. They were wrong, but Madame Web just feels like a cynical copy of the bare minimum to qualify as a comic book movie.

"Feb 13, 2024"," The month of February is not particularly known for the top echelon of studio releases and is usually reserved for more of the light, fun, and quirky films of the year. Some you’ll never think about again, while others may stay with you throughout the year. Or maybe Sony will try to hook us with a supposed standalone Spider-Man story that you can enjoy without having watched all of the previous films and television shows, only to end up feeling like they’re throwing things at the Marvel wall to see what sticks. Sorry to say, Madame Web will not. Spider-Man has been a staple across animation and film for decades. Heck, we’re already on our third iteration of Spider-Man Sony reboots (not even counting the Spider-Verse universe) since the 2000s. Madame Web opens with *gasp* an origin story of sorts, if you can even call it that. It’s 1972, and Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) and Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) are in the Peruvian jungle looking for a familiar radioactive spider said to have healing powers. Webb is pregnant and determined to find this spider that is said to be a cure and give humans superhuman strength. If that’s not vague enough and clinging to the idea that you know previous Spider-Man films, get ready for even more fluff. In a not-so-surprising turn, Sims, who has funded this fun expedition, reveals his true intent when the spider is found, and shoots everyone, including Constance. She is left for dead and is rescued by the indigenous Las Aranas, who give her the power of the spider but only enough to save her baby, who will undoubtedly have some powers and will “come back searching for answers.” Directed by S.J. Clarkson (Anatomy of a Scandal), the film gets off to a literal shaky start with cheap-looking VFX and odd zoom camera angles that don’t add anything to the sequence except make you feel disoriented and not in a good way.  The film jumps forward to 2003 and introduces Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), a paramedic in Manhattan who has a chip on her shoulder because of her childhood upbringing in foster care. She’s tough and funny, and her EMT partner just so happens to have a familiar name, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). While they are in the middle of saving someone’s life, Webb gets stuck in the car that tips over the bridge and into the river. It is in this moment of dying that Webb’s spidey senses are unlocked. These aren’t the normal spidey senses, though. It’s more of a Final Destination premonition of future-telling power. Webb begins to experience disorientation after Parker saves her life and even goes to a doctor to tell her to “go watch some TV” and that she’s a-okay. If that all sounds a bit hokey, it’s because it is, and Madame Web never fully finds its webbing or place.  It’s hard to even place where Madame Web is set. We know it’s 2003, and with the exception of a few wannabe needle drops like Britney Spears’ “Toxic” playing in a diner, there’s no sense of time in this world or texture or world-building. Cassie lives in Manhattan, but her apartment doesn’t feel like something she could afford on a paramedic’s salary. It doesn’t feel gritty or lived in, and it’s much like the rest of the film; it all feels like a set piece. There are no layers to the world, and it feels staged, hollow, and lacking depth.  Madame Web spins the idea that Cassie is tough, a loner, and has a tough time connecting to others because of her foster child upbringing and not having a mom. During her grief of the loss of her coworker and the revelation that maybe she could have saved him, Cassie decides to head to the funeral in an attempt to possibly turn back time or be there for her friend’s wife? On the subway, she sees the immediate future death of three teenage girls, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and is faced with a choice: embrace this power and save these girls or ignore it and do nothing. This decision is meant to be a turning point for Cassie and while she does end up saving the girls, she begrudgingly does so and spends a good chunk of story time telling them why they are so lucky she did. It feels whiny and confusing given the line of work is saving and helping people.  The strength of Madame Web lies in the supporting cast of these three including the dynamic between Sweeney, Franklin and Corazon and Johnson. Even through the awkward “tough love” storyline that Johnson is given to hone in the idea that “she doesn’t care” and will dump these cares when she gets the chance, they all have a fun chemistry that shines even through the lackluster material they are given to play with.  We aren’t served a proper “training or powers” montage, Cassie learns of her powers through a few disorienting premonitions and one fatal one where she could’ve saved her fellow coworker had she known what was going on. We’re also meant to believe that the journal that her mom had on her expedition was saved and passed along to Cassie, who clearly never really read it. If your mom, who died in childbirth, left one thing to you, you wouldn’t dissect that whole thing front to back? From a story standpoint, it seems silly that the only time Cassie really deep-dives into this one very personal thing of her mother’s wasn’t until she started having these powers and finding the link between her and Sims.  Clarkson is no stranger to the superhero genre having directed two episodes of Marvel’s Jessica Jones. Not sure whether it’s Clarkson’s extensive directing of television background, a low budget or both, but there are plenty of awkward and abrupt edits that impacted the scope of the film. There is a lot of tell and no show which is more of an old television tactic – when Cassie decides to go back to the Peruvian jungle to find answers and follows her mother’s journal, she enlists Ben to look after the three girls. We see Cassie drive off in the stolen taxi cab and whoosh she’s in Peru in the Amazon at the exact spot her mother was. The Amazon is a huge area of rainforest and we’re expected to believe that Cassie flew right in. Not to get bogged down by these kinds of details but they are the things that ground a film and or in this case, keep it fluffy.  Now, let’s talk about the villain in the room and the continuing problem of less-than-stellar Marvel antagonists in recent films. Can they never really get back to a Killmonger-esque level of complexity with these baddies or at the bare minimum give a reason for their actions. Madame Web does neither. The only explanation we are given for Sims’ mission to kill Julia, Anya and Mattie is a scene between Sims and a very underutilized Jill Hennessy, who, after picking her up from the opera sleep together, he is awakened by a nightmare of three women in superhero garb trying to kill him. Hennessy’s character, billed as ‘Beautiful Woman’, asks him what’s wrong? He then describes his dream and the pursuit of needing to find these girls before they grow up to kill him. It just so happens that Hennessy’s character works for the NSA that has CCTV-like technology and can be used to track and find faces through the use of cameras throughout the world. Sims kills Hennessy’s character and gains access to the NSA technology and uses his employee Amaria (Zosia Mamet) to locate the girls via the images he’s drawn from his dream of these girls. Why does he want this power? Why is he hell-bent on staying alive? World domination? No, it’s nothing that complex. It’s just this guy we see at the beginning of the film wanting a spider for no real purpose at all. The story feels all too lazy with these characters and their motivations. The film tries to bond Cassie, Julia, Anya and Mattie via their absentee parents, whether that be rich parents who didn’t want a child, a mother who went crazy after her husband divorced her, or a father getting deported. This should feel impactful and bond them to Cassie, who was left alone herself, but the writing never lends itself to fully forming the connective emotional webs between these characters and feels forced.  Origin stories and stand alone films in the super hero world can be fun and quirky (looking at you, Venom) but Madame Web is neither. It’s holding on to the Spider-Man lore of the past while not offering anything new, no spectacular fight sequences, no motivations or world building to look forward to with a sequel – it’s all very confusing. Yes, Madame Web very much stands on its own, but what it stands on is just as structurally unsound as the fireworks storage facility at the end of the film. While superhero films are built on suspension of disbelief, Madame Web doesn’t even want to give the audience enough credit to be worthy of its own world-building or characters. The lack of unique production design, soundtrack, and unpolished VFX makes Madame Web feel more like Madame, why? ",NEGATIVE

"Feb 13, 2024"," Maybe that’s inevitable, though, when you’re introducing a new character to a wide audience. Still, within these oversaturated times for comic book movies, “Madame Web” is blissfully breezy in its pacing, which helps make it a more enjoyable watch than some of the super-serious, end-of-the-world fare we often see.  The constantly on-the-go Cassie must become the reluctant protector of these disparate teens: shy Julia (Sydney Sweeney), bookish Anya (Isabela Merced) and rebellious Mattie (Celeste O’Connor). Johnson has such a way with a blasé, deadpan one-liner that it makes you wish the entire movie consisted of her dealing with these annoying kids, her impatience increasing with their impertinence. She brings a refreshing, grounded quality to her superhero vibe. Sweeney, Merced and O’Connor are mostly locked into one-note roles (and they’re all way too old to be high school students), but, together with Johnson, the four of them have a decent amount of chemistry.  Clarkson, whose many TV credits include the Marvel series “Jessica Jones,” keeps things moving at an exciting clip with fluid camera movements and high-energy transitions. A car door will slam shut, leading to another door flying open elsewhere, that sort of thing. And the moments in which we see Cassie’s powers entering and illuminating her flow with a trippy, mysterious sense of wonder.  It’s the big, noisy action sequences that bog “Madame Web” down. Yes, they’re crucial to the genre, but they’re also the least interesting part. And you don't need to be clairvoyant to know that more movies in this series are in store.  Christy Lemire is a longtime film critic who has written for RogerEbert.com since 2013.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Leading up to the release of Madame Web it’s safe to say that the word hasn’t exactly been overtly positive.  The usage of a certain line of dialogue regarding Dakota Johnson‘s character’s mother’s profession of working with spiders in the Amazon cemented the film’s meme status from the get-go – for the record, the line is paraphrased in the film itself and is far more naturally delivered – and after the critical mauling of fellow Sony/Marvel outing Morbius – a film that was so heavily lampooned online that the studio misguidedly assumed its popularity wasn’t ironic and re-released it in cinemas, only for it to tank again – S.J. Clarkson‘s superhero effort needed to defy enough expectation for the general masses to not “Morb” such an outing a second time. To say Madame Web is a better film than Jared Leto’s vampiric “thriller” isn’t exactly high praise, but it’s certainly enough to justify a modicum of positivity towards a film that squanders far too much collective talent on a script that never feels like it got past the first draft.  There’s also an editing process that doesn’t understand that less is often more, and a truly awful turn from Tahar Rahim as the villain of the piece – one who admittedly looks the part – who loses any of his intimidation and credibility through ADR that doesn’t remotely match his lip movement.  It’s a clunky, messy action film for the most part, which only makes the moments it earns legitimate shine burn even more, as we see what could have been. Those shining moments mostly come courtesy of Johnson herself.  The actress’s own awkward demeanour and penchant for deadpan humour are on full display throughout (there’s a sequence at a baby shower that truly allows her to flex her comedic muscle to good use), and it’s a real shame that she wasn’t afforded the Marvel vehicle she so clearly deserves.  Her Cassandra Web ultimately becomes the titular Madame Web, but for anyone expecting the star to battle CGI creations in coloured latex alongside the similarly attired Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced – whose Spider-influenced alter egos have all been teased throughout the marketing – will be deeply disappointed, as Madame Web, as a film, plays out largely spectacle-free. When we meet Cassandra she’s rushing about New York City as a paramedic – cue chaotic editing – alongside Adam Scott‘s likeable Ben Parker.  For those following the Spider-verse, that would be the eventual “Uncle Ben” to one Peter Parker, but as this film is set in 2003, which gives the licence for some enjoyable inclusions of time-appropriate references, such as Britney Spears’ “Toxic” getting a hefty shout-out, the future Spider-Man is merely cooking in the oven of Ben’s sister, Mary (Emma Roberts).  The film only lightly references the Spider-Man we come to know through a paraphrasing of the infamous “With great power comes great responsibility” line, but Clarkson mostly keeps this as a contained story, with the spiders that Cassandra’s mother was researching prior to her death honing different abilities than what we’re used to seeing through Peter Parker. Ultimately, Rahim’s Ezekiel Sims has certain powers that have been bestowed upon him by a particular Amazonian spider, one of which is the ability to see the future, and given that he is constantly seeing his own death at the hands of a trio of unidentified women – one guess as to who that trio is – he’s scouring New York City to find them and kill them before they tap into their destiny.  Cassandra also starts to tinker with her ability to see the future, though her power is in its infancy, so you just know it’s going to take the majority of the film’s 116 minute running time for her to properly harness such; the early stages of her power and its uncertainty does give way to arguably the film’s best sequence, where she boards a train and witnesses Ezekiel’s massacre on the three young girls he believes will kill him – shy teen Julia (Sweeney), rebellious rich kid Mattie (O’Connor), and orphaned Anya (Merced) – in a series of vignettes in her mind that she tries to puzzle together before it comes to fruition. But moments of promise are few and far between.  And we could probably forgive the film for some of its faults had it leaned into the temperament of what audiences expect an action film to be, which is, you know, one that actually has action.  There’s a large rinse-and-repeat mentality to the film that wears extremely thin after the first two-or-so times we realise that much of the apparent suspense is built off Cassandra thwarting Ezekiel’s plans after she literally sees it coming.  And though large noises and flying shiny objects don’t forgive a film of its sins, it can help mask a bit of the emptiness, but here, if Cassandra isn’t driving a vehicle of some sort then the action is non-existent; and there’s only so many car chases (and calling them that is being generous) one can sit through politely. As mentioned earlier, it’s a real shame Madame Web couldn’t overcome its own perceived reputation.  Johnson deserves so much better, and what she gives the film it doesn’t remotely repay in her favour, but her sense of humour takes the film further than we expect.  For that alone it earns points above the pariah of the Sony/Marvel canon that is Morbius, but not enough to support this as any kind of start of a new franchise that sadly feels bitten and down for the count before it’s even had a chance to rejuvenate itself.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Madame Web is a two-hour trailer for the movie you think you’re watching, but actually aren’t. If that’s confusing, welcome to the world of Madame Web, where everyone—the characters, the actors, the audience, and everyone in between—is confused about basically everything, all of the time. It’s a film that sets specific expectations in terms of story and payoff, proceeds to seed and tease those payoffs throughout the movie, and then never delivers on them. When a film has to pretend to be something it’s not to keep you interested, that’s not a good sign, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg with Madame Web. In Madame Web, Dakota Johnson stars as Cassandra Webb, a New York EMT who doesn’t like anything that has to do with kids or families. She’s a bit of a jerk, frankly, but her best friend Ben Parker—yes, that Ben Parker, played by Adam Scott—doesn’t care. He understands that Cassie, as she likes to be called, is the way she is because she grew up an orphan. You see, a prologue reveals Cassie’s mom died during childbirth while in the Amazon studying spiders. Spiders that, if captured, could give people superhuman abilities and cure many diseases. The mission, albeit noble, doesn’t go well for Mama Webb (played by Kerry Bishé) because once she finds the spider, the man she thinks is protecting her, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), betrays her and steals it. Decades later, Ezekiel has done quite well for himself in some vague, never-explained way, with one small issue. Every night he wakes up to the same nightmare: three super-women teaming up to kill him. So he makes it his life’s work to find the women and kill them before they get these powers. The women are the mild-mannered Julia (Sydney Sweeney), rebellious skater Mattie (Celeste O’Connor), and confident brainiac Anya (Isabela Merced), three strangers who, the dreams suggest, will eventually become Spider-Women. Madame Web has a lot of set-up to do before it even gets into the main drive of the film, which is Cassie slowly discovering her mother’s Amazonian adventure gave her mysterious powers of foresight which she uses to protect the girls from Ezekiel. Along the way, director S.J. Clarkson consistently leaves breadcrumbs to a larger story we expect to pay off, especially because the characters continually raise the same questions we have as the audience. We’re confused about who is who and how this all fits together, but so are the characters, so you assume that’s the point. However, worthwhile narrative cohesion largely goes out the door as Madame Web gets increasingly monotonous. Ezekiel finds the girls, conveniently all together. Cassie has a vision and saves the girls. The girls assume they’re safe and get caught again. Cassie has another vision, etc., etc. Which is repetitive on its own, but is also told via an inherently repetitive construct because the audience has to see each scene at least two times. That’s repetitive on top of repetitive and it makes up the bulk of the movie. Confused characters caught in a lazy story loop might be forgivable if those characters were endearing in any way—but unfortunately, they are not. As previously mentioned, Johnson’s Cassie is kind of a jerk, and the whole movie is structured so she becomes less of a jerk, which isn’t a particularly interesting arc. O’Connor and Merced have clear visions of who their characters are, but they’re so thinly written that you can really feel the acting. As for Sweeney, she just feels like she’s in another movie. Is she shy? Is she sad? Why did she mention martial arts? Is she being honest about her family? Her character and performance are a mess. Plus, everything in Madame Web is so, so serious. You keep hoping for some injection of humor to lighten the mood or a huge sweeping set piece to bring that superhero bombast, but neither comes. The biggest laughs are from awkwardly shoehorned product placements or awful, unintentionally funny dialogue. And when there is a big action beat, often it’s so random and dumb that it loses any of its excitement. (Three words: “Ambulance through billboard.” Three more words: “Condemned fireworks factory.”) Together, that makes for a dreary tone which, on top of the repetitive plot and bland characters, makes the whole thing feel excessively dull. Eventually, when the film hits what’s clearly its big, exciting conclusion, anything happening on screen is lost in the crushing realization that almost everything you assumed was going to happen in this movie is not going to happen. Major questions will not be answered. Huge reveals will remain a mystery. The whole thing has sort of been a lie. Then it ends, you sit there scratching your head waiting for some kind of redeeming end credit scene, only that never comes either. And yet, the saddest thing about Madame Web is that as bad as it is, it’s the type of bad you forget 10 minutes after you watch it. It’s never bad enough to be enjoyable and it’s (obviously) never good enough to be memorable. There aren’t any exciting comic book teases to break down (there are teases of teases more than anything else) or satisfying emotional achievements to latch onto. It’s a story that only makes sense if you don’t think about it, filled with performances that aren’t very engaging, and then it ends. That ending does tease there could be more Madame Web to come, but we’d be very, very surprised if that ever happens. Want more io9 news?

"Feb 13, 2024"," Many Marvel fans were surprised when it was announced that Madame Web was going to the be the main character in an upcoming film, although most still held out hope that they would be proven wrong with a great movie. Unfortunately, that is just not the case. Madame Web suffers from a poor script, a weak villain, and no real connection to the greater Marvel / Sony universe. There are a few bright spots sprinkled throughout, but not enough to save it. This movie follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), who was orphaned as a child when her mother died in the Amazon while researching spiders. She is now all grown up and a New York paramedic. When she survives what should be a deadly accident in 2003, her life is changed when powers to see the future manifest. After seeing the fate of three teenage girls – Julia Carpenter (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) – she sets out to stop them from being murdered. The man who is hunting them has very weak motives. His dialogue is some of the worst in the film, and while he does show off some great fighting skills, there isn’t enough about him to make him a good, or even memorable villain. This isn’t the actors fault, but rather what is on the pages.  Viewers see him in the Amazon with Cassandra’s mother, and then we jump forward thirty years with no explanation as to how he got his powers, his suit, or what he has been up to. It feels like a lot of the exposition was left on the cutting room floor. At the same time, Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor do what they can with what they were given, but that just isn’t enough to save this movie. They look absolutely incredible when suited up, however that is for only three scenes and less than five minutes of screentime. Their powers do not manifest during Madame Web, and what we do see of them in superhero action is during visions that don’t give us much.  These suits, and the “spider-people” friends and foe that briefly appear are the only things tying Madame Web to the greater Marvel universe. That and Adam Scott’s character (the best in the movie, by far) being named Ben Parker. If you removed about fifteen minutes of the movie, you would never even know it was part of the Spider-verse. And that is a problem.  One thing that is apparent, however, is that Pepsi was a sponsor of this movie. There is one scene, at a baby shower, where Dakota Johnson quite literally walks around holding a can of Pepsi, showing it off to every camera in sight, without even taking a sip. Just to bring it home that Pepsi paid Sony some money, the final fight takes place in front of a giant Pepsi-Cola neon sign.  Throughout Madame Web, there are several scenes with dialogue so cringe it is laughable, and not in a good way. Whenever something is happening, they make extremely sure you know exactly what is going on — for example, Cassie goes to the Amazon for a week and they tell the audience at least three times that she is gone for a week.  Bizarre decisions are made and there are many convenient plot points that are used just to drive the story forward. The two hour runtime is a bit too long, as Madame Web would have definitely benefitted from cutting it down by twenty to thirty minutes.  Adam Scott and the girls all suited up are the few good things throughout the movie. That and the fact that most of the action is entertaining, even if the visual effects are not up to par. While it certainly sets up for a sequel, unfortunately Madame Web’s future just isn’t that bright. In a switch from the typical genre, Madame Web tells the standalone origin story of one of Marvel publishing’s most enigmatic heroines. The suspense-driven thriller stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who develops the power to see the future… and realizes she can use that insight to change it. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies…if they can all survive a deadly present.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Please note that there are no mid-credit or post-credit scenes. You are free to leave the theater at the end of the film. Obviously, you’re more than welcome to watch the credits. After all, many people worked hard to make the film a reality. But again, there are no teases or tie-ins to the wider universe. If you excuse me, I’m now going to get into spoiler territory. What’s the next best thing to movies starring Spider-Man? Movies starring Spider-Woman. Or in this case, a movie starring three of them before they ever get any of their superpowers. Ultimately, the film is the most origin movie that any origin movie could possibly be. After the opening prologue in 1973, the film fast forwards to 2003 where we meet Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson). She’s working as an FDNY paramedic with her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott), in the years before he meets his beloved, May. You just had to know that they would find a way to incorporate the Parker family! After dying for three minutes and coming back to like, Cassie’s life will never again be the same. She suddenly has the ability to see the future. There are questions about her past and sure enough, they bring her to Peru. In the meantime, Cassie uses her new powers to protect three random teenagers–Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor)–from Ezekiel Sims (Tahir Rahim). Even before saving them from death, she had crossed paths with them in one way or another. “Being a Weaver means that she can weave together the strands of time.

"Feb 13, 2024"," Madame Web aporta nada nuevo. En los últimos diez años, Sony se afanó por crear un universo relacionado con Spider-Man, que, curiosamente, no incluye al héroe. De modo que probó suerte con el antihéroe Venom — y no le fue tan mal — y después, con Morbius, con el que tuvo pésimos resultados. El caso es que el estudio intenta armar, como puede, su propia franquicia arácnida, en el que espera, presumiblemente, incluir a la versión Tom Holland. Pero mientras eso ocurre, comete todo tipo de errores al ser incapaz de ensamblar un escenario cinematográfico compartido de calidad. Quizás, su intento más afortunado sea las aventuras de Miles Morales en animación. Pero por ahora, nada de lo que ha hecho en su irregular proyecto live action ha tenido el mismo éxito.  La cinta, es, hasta ahora, el intento más ambicioso de Sony por lograr el éxito que tiene con sus largometrajes animados. Para eso, pone el énfasis en lugares parecidos. En primer lugar, toma varias versiones de héroes dentro del mundo de Spider-Man, para mostrar la idea de una realidad más amplia. Cassandra Web (Dakota Johnson), es el centro de una narración, que fluye en varias direcciones distintas. En un evidente guiño al cómic, el personaje tiene poderes psíquicos precognitivos. Pero, a diferencia del original, se trata de una versión joven que está en busca de comprender sus capacidades.  Madame Web es un confuso intento de Sony por narrar el spiderverse, que falla por su guion mediocre y apartado visual caótico. Lo que comienza como una historia de origen, termina por ser una revisión a conceptos más amplios sobre la existencia misma del héroe arácnido. Pero la película falla en profundizar en un escenario tan ambicioso y termina por convertirse en un caos narrativo sin el menor atractivo. Al otro extremo, se trata de plantear la historia de origen de Cassandra como el comienzo de un universo mayor. Que empalma, además, con la existencia misma de todas las versiones de Spider-Man. De la misma manera que Miles Morales, el personaje de Johnson es parte de un hilo conductor de eventos en lo que no parece estar relacionada. Eso, solo más allá de su habilidad para predecirlos. Pero sin saber qué los provoca o hacia dónde se dirigen en conjunto. Por supuesto, esa solo es la primera capa de lo que pretende ser un argumento con varias que funcionan superpuestas. Una premisa que podría resultar, si el guion escrito a cuatro manos por Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker y la misma directora, fuera menos vago y genérico. La heroína con habilidades psíquicas que imagina la película, es lamentablemente limitada y torpe. Mucho más, cuando las fronteras entre la realidad y lo que puede percibir, se muestran en el argumento con una serie de escenas fragmentarias que no llevan a ninguna parte. Con efecto digitales mediocres, el mundo que Cassandra puede percibir, son más disolvencias entre escenas, que un misterio que resolver. De hecho, uno de los mayores fallos de la película, es la sensación que el pasado, el presente y el futuro, se complementan con torpeza en una cronología sin sentido. Eso, debido a que el intento de insinuar una precuela — después de todo, Cassandra, puede ver el futuro y predecir los posibles arácnidos que nacerán — se vuelve una confusión de premisas. ¿Es la paramédica de Nueva York algo más que el centro de una red — sí, así de obvio — que se extiende de su madre en adelante? La trama insiste una y otra vez en contar este importante matiz, dejando entrever que Cassandra esconde un misterio. Pero es tan obvio — tan poco trabajado y mucho menos, ingenioso al contarse — que para la primera media hora, ya la trama reveló todos sus misterios. A saber: que el personaje de Dakota Johnson es capaz de ver el futuro de sus — todavía sin revelar — congéneres arácnidos. Luego de, quizás, su única escena memorable — que recuerda directamente a la saga Destino Final — el argumento, que explica poco, pasa a incorporar figuras conocidas dentro del spiderverse. Todo en una manera caótica, desigual y hasta ridícula, que transforma a las esperadas apariciones de varios personajes legendarios en accidentes de guion. Una y otra vez, la trama subraya que todo se relaciona con el poder y la responsabilidad que este conlleva. Y por supuesto, deja entrever que Cassandra, que ve el futuro, tiene la mayor, al saber quienes son los héroes que habrán de nacer.  La cinta, pasa entonces, se vuelve cursi y con una insólita repetición de tópicos, contándolos al estilo de los clásicos de superhéroes de la década de los noventa. Del deber al amor, la responsabilidad y lealtad. La película se ocupa tan poco de sus personajes como para ser meras excusas para hacer avanzar la historia. Podría parecer un homenaje — después de todo, se ambienta a finales del siglo XX — pero, en realidad, es torpeza cinematográfica. La pésima edición empuja a la historia a un desorden que termina por ser su peor enemigo. En ocasiones, no hay forma de comprender si se trata de Cassandra en mitad de una visión o una escena que está ocurriendo.  Pero todo se vuelve aún peor al presentar al resto de los héroes. La historia central añade con tosquedad y sin demasiadas explicaciones a Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) y Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Todas, relacionadas con las visiones de Cassandra y que, en estructura adecuada, se complementarían unas a otras. Pero no solo no lo hacen, sino que aparecen en escenas de acción con mala coreografía y que la pobre fotografía de Mauro Fiore convierte en manchones de sombras y color.  Por separado, cada heroína está relacionada con Cassandra y la solidez de la película de eso, depende de eso. Aun así, el guion lo olvida con facilidad y todo parece ocurrir por sucesos que se explican fuera de cámara o directamente, no se explican. Tanto, que cuando hace su aparición el villano de turno, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), sus motivaciones se hacen nebulosas. De nuevo, Sony apuesta a una figura tradicional de Marvel, que debe, además, explicar su contexto y conectar con el resto del relato. Pero no lo hace, por lo que su persecución de las probables Spider Woman, queda como un añadido a la narración casi forzado.  Como forzada es la esperada aparición de Ben (​Adam Scott) y Mary Parker (Emma Roberts). No solo es un evidente y mal planeado fan service, sino que además, el largometraje se da el lujo de desaprovechar sus posibles implicaciones. Pero siendo que no describe del todo las capacidades de Cassandra — o cambia sus reglas — el argumento solo muestra a la pareja para, al parecer, complacer la posibilidad de la existencia de Peter. Por otra parte, ni ese futuro, ni la idea de lo que la predicción puede implicar, se profundizan, de modo que la película navega en la nada.  Lo que más se lamenta de Madame Web es el vacío en toda la trama y la sensación de lo mucho que pudo ser. Para el recuerdo, el trío de Spider Woman en pantalla y Cassandra, a la que Johnson brinda una vulnerabilidad llena de matices, que se agradece. Pero más allá de eso, la cinta es una combinación de pésimas decisiones de guion, un apartado visual barato y un final, que tiene el triste honor de ser de los peores de Sony. Otro intento fallido más para la ya extensa lista del estudio. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Admit it â you were hoping for a car crash. The trailers were terrible, teasing subpar special effects and expository dialogue so deliciously clunky (âhe was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she diedâ) that the Internet feasted on its carcass for maximum meme-ification. A car crash would be more interesting. Madame Web is a fender bender â nothing calamitous, just a time suck. An annoyance. A waste.  Pretty silly, too. The script â credited to Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and director S.J. Clarkson â tucks right into the Amazon-mom-researching-spiders soup with a Peruvian overture introducing eight-months-pregnant scientist Constance Webb (BishÃ©) and her local handler, Ezekiel Sims (A Prophetâs Rahim, whose mouth movements rarely seem to match his dialogue). Things go sideways, we briefly meet baby Cassie â Cassandra for the Greek mythology heads in the house â and then the story lurches 30 years in the future, to 2003, when now-adult Cassie (Johnson) is a hard-bitten paramedic with the New York Fire Department. After more things go sideways, Cassie gains the ability to see snippets of the future, and her fate becomes snarled with three teenage girls. Cue a series of uninspired, unintelligibly choreographed fight scenes made all the worse when, owing to Cassieâs soothsaying, we have to watch them not once but twice.  One of those teenagers is played by Sydney Sweeney, who, to be fair, rocketed to fame playing a teen on HBOâs Euphoria but is by now way too old to be cast as a high schooler, and dressing her up in thigh-high socks and a prep school mini skirt only makes it more awkward. Johnson at least has the good sense to move through the film with a beatific, âI canât be botheredâ smile thatâs standing in for the side eye fairly radiating off her person. Johnson will come out of this just fine, as will the other actors trudging through this joyless comic book spinoff. I doubt anybodyâs reputation will get dinged too much, save first-time feature film helmer Clarkson, a veteran TV director whoâs danced with Marvel property before on Jessica Jones and The Defenders. If you perked up at âMarvel,â note this is not an MCU property but rather part of Sony Picturesâ arrangement with Marvel to produce Spider-Man and Spidey-adjacent stories. The studio is contractually obligated to keep releasing new material in order to retain the rights, and boy does this movie feel like itâs just checking boxes and running the clock out â the cinematic equivalent of quiet quitting.

"Feb 13, 2024"," At this point in the superhero canon, it’s becoming harder to find projects that feel thoughtful and genuine. Projects that don’t feel like they’re the by-product of an exec’s great idea for a cash grab. Unfortunately, we’ll have to keep the search going, as Sony’s “Madame Web” does not fill the quota for a superhero film with heart and soul. Not only is the latest addition to the Marvel canon lacking a true emotional core, it’s devoid of many key elements that make a movie successful in the translation from the screen to the audience’s psyche.  Directed by S.J. Clarkson, “Madame Web” follows the story of Cassie (Dakota Johnson), a young paramedic living in New York City who finds herself at the heart of a wild goose chase when she has a futuristic vision in which three high school girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor) are all killed by a mysterious man (Tahar Rahim) who moves like a spider. Along the way, she has to come to terms with who she is and what she can do by unlocking the missing pieces of her fractured familial history.  It’s an interesting enough premise, even if you divorce the film from its comic book origins, but bland direction and awkward dialogue overtake the film and add a sheen of mediocrity to the entire thing. Plus, there are crucial flaws with the protagonist, ones that are harder to work around than others. As a character, Cassie is deeply unremarkable. Her origin story is just as flat and boring as she is—and at moments, the film’s cringe dialogue makes the genesis of her powers downright laughable. There’s really nothing in this film that shows us why we should care about her, let alone her ascent into her true heroic form. Not in the moves she makes along the way, nor her general character as we meet her in the beginning of the film. That’s not to say that a movie’s protagonist can’t be ordinary, but regardless of that fact, there’s always something to latch onto. With Johnson’s leading lady, there’s literally nothing to attach your web of interest to.  Johnson is aggressively fine. She does give a few solid comic relief moments but is otherwise so bland that even her signature sarcasm can’t bring color to the role. The three teens—Julia (Sweeney), Anya (Merced), and Mattie (O’Connor)— are a fun little trio and are certainly giving more to the performance than the script gave to them. They end up being underused and infantilized a bit, but I guess you have to start somewhere. No matter how the film short-changes these characters, I’d ultimately rather have watched two hours of that clan getting Charlie’s Angels-esque missions from Johnson, who serves as the group’s Splinter from “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” Presumably, we’ll get more stories in this style if “Madame Web” does well, but the fact that audiences had to suffer through a mediocre franchise opening to get it is frustrating to say the least. The film’s villain is, like in any Marvel movie, a crucial part in keeping the audience immersed in the stakes. But with Rahim’s Ezekiel Sims, that concept is completely dead in the water. Rahim is utterly toothless as the central bad guy, boring and cheesy in equal measure. OK, some of that is owed to the less-than-stellar dialogue, but unlike the women of the film, there aren’t really any moments where Rahim’s performance is overcoming the textual obstacles of the movie. Having a lukewarm villain just doesn’t fly in a superhero movie anymore, and this ends up as one of several areas where “Madame Web” flounders.  As far as the film’s effects and editing go, the intention seems to be to create a sense of disorder in an effort to put the audience in Cassie’s shoes. She’s figuring out so many things at once throughout the film, so the movie in turn puts the audience to task in the same way the vision sequences are all cut and edited together. It’s a smart notion that, unfortunately, needs to be paired with effects that are truly immersive and visceral, ones that don’t come off computerized and impossible. Sadly, these do.  The CGI and visual effects the film employs are tacky, choppy, and obvious, particularly when Cassie is tapping into her powers. But none of the movie’s framing choices are particularly good. This film is an attempt to find some sort of kinship—at worst in the story, and at best at the box office—with other “Spider-Man” films. There’s even a bastardized version of the iconic responsibility quote strategically placed in there to hammer the point home. But at the end of the day, the only things these two franchises have in common is spiders. And that alone isn’t going to hook the same folks who pledged their allegiance to Peter Parker all those years ago.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024",Madame Web spins a messy and chaotic experience that is WILDLY entertaining in all the wrong ways&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," 
Trailers are designed  to stir up excitement, the amuse-bouche that whets your appetite for the three-course meal. Occasionally, the oldest marketing trick in the book backfires. When Sony dropped a sneak peek at Madame Web, the newest addition to the company’s roster of Spider-Man–related films and another of their corporate crossovers with the good folks at Marvel Studios, the reaction was … not exactly what they hoped for. The same fans they were hoping to get riled up about a batch of fresh Spidey-adjacent characters began to mock the clip, ripping into everything from Dakota Johnson‘s extremely decaf line readings to the curiously low-rent look of the visuals. One deadpan line of dialogue — “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders, right before she died” — became a meme in all the wrong ways. Blood was in the water now, and the amuse-bouche had somehow become chum.  
	Then the trinity of hell-raising skate rat Mattie Fanklin (O’Connor), mousy goody-two-shoes Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), and characteristic-apparently-to-be-decided-later Anya Corazon (Merced) come into the picture, and not even the infusion of youth and promise of eventual consumed heroics can defibrillate this thing to life. The same goes for Rahim’s bad guy crawling the walls in an all-black Spidey suit, which doesn’t really jibe with any sort of cinematic-universe timeline to be honest, but why get hung up on details? As for Webb’s powers, she can see unprompted visions of the future ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes ahead of schedule, which the movie keeps rendering via jittery repeats of a DOA scene you’ve just suffered through once. Such intense bouts of déjà vu are matched only by the feeling of disbelief happening on the other side of the screen.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," There was a time in Marvel’s history when a female-led, female-directed film would be an instant draw. However, the moment has passed and those days are behind us. With a dreadfully dull, plot-heavy engine, ropey visual effects and an ensemble cast who look like they’d rather be reciting the phonebook, MADAME WEB manages to be one of the company’s (Sony Marvel’s) worst to date. Co-writer-director S.J. Clarkson along with writers Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless and Claire Parker (working from a story by Sazama, Sharpless and Kerem Sanga) turn in a turgid feature that values slapdash, paper-thin character development, unfulfilling scenarios and lackluster action sequences above all else. After a rescue call goes awry, NYC paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) develops a gift to see into the future. Unbeknownst to her, but shown to us, back in 1973, her mother Constance (Kerry Bishé) was pregnant with her while in the Peruvian jungles researching poisonous spiders. In a lame double-cross, she’s shot by Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) and promptly rescued a mysterious indigenous tribe of Spider people, who then attempt to revive her with a super-powered, peptide-enhancing spider which transferred its DNA to Cassie in the womb. Flash-forward to 2003, where baddie Ezekiel, who also possesses special spider powers from the one he stole decades prior, electronically surveys the city with the help of his intrepid assistant Amelia (Zosia Mamet) in search of three teen girls he fears are out to kill him. Through a confluence of contrived events that even the screenwriters can barely string together, Cassie finds herself on a train with the trio: Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced) and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor). She’s immediately plagued by violent visions and feels compelled to save these young women from death before Ezekiel, who’s trailing shortly behind, can get to them first. From there on out, these essential strangers – all with powerful girl-boss destinies – are forced to team up to defeat their shared current threat. Character construction is pathetic and, at times, completely antithetical to real human behavior. Cassie’s journey from selfish to self-less is weak, but not nearly as ham-handled and non-existent as Julia, Anya and Mattie’s, who rely on exposition to tell us who they are. Their arc coming into their own as an elite fighting unit manifests at a glacial pace. So much so, we don’t get to see them in top fighting form in their fancy spandex suits except in Ezekiel’s shredded nightmare sequence and a late developing clairvoyant vision of Cassie’s. It also suffers from a massive villain problem as it’s never made clear what his evil machinations and motivations are to do with this spider, inspiring more questions than we’re given answers. Plus, incorporating Ben Parker (Adam Scott) and his sister Mary (Emma Roberts) reeks of unabashed desperation to make this feature relevant in any way. Big action set pieces and aesthetic spectacle don’t fare much better. None of these sequences are memorable, immersive, or compelling. Techniques used to connote Cassie’s clairvoyance are nothing special, mostly comprised of quick flashes like animated slides on a projector. Our heroine’s use of powers during the climactic battle in a fireworks factory is ugly and turns nonsensical by sequence’s end. Unexplainable camera zooms occur twice, standing out for the poorer of the picture in their documentary filmic style. The soundtrack, filled with all female artists, also fails to stoke interest outside of the needle drop on Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” Performances vary in extremes, from O’Connor’s sass (who seems the only cast member to recite her lines with any sense of drama) to the flat delivery of Sweeney (who’s fantastic in REALITY), Merced (who’s terrific in DORA AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD) and Johnson (whose turned in better work on this film’s press tour). But it’s Rahim who’s been dealt short shrift as his performance through a majority of the film is poorly assembled and ADR’d. It’s not totally bleak as there are a few bright spots. Shattered glass is an interesting visual motif Clarkson highlights a few times as a smart way to emphasize humans’ web-like interconnectedness. The sentiment that the family we make is stronger than the family we’re born into is indeed strong. That a bunch of orphaned misfits can find each other in this mixed up world and find something hopeful to fight for is also fairly moving. Yet the filmmakers only faintly allude to these thematic byproducts right before the credits roll rather than weaving them through the film’s fabric.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 13, 2024"," The Sony-verse of Spider-Man movies tells us stories of some of our favorite Spidey-adjacent characters without really getting into the spidey senses of it all. At least with Madame Web we’re getting some more spider bites and characters we know as heroes instead of the villain standalone films. S.J. Clarkson’s superhero flick takes us into New York in 2003 when Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) is suddenly coming into her powers: When Cassie crashes into the Hudson in a car she had just rescued someone from (as a paramedic), she realizes in her “near death” experience that she has powers that allow her to see into the future. Filled with the cheesy dialogue we’re used to in comics, Madame Web recognizes the origin story that it’s trying to tell. In the Spider-Man comics, Madame Web is a character who is there to give advice to Peter Parker when the time comes.  While Madame Web does not bring Spider-Man into the Sony-verse, it still does make nods to a world in which Peter Parker could come to her for advice if needed—mainly because the film is set in 2003 and we get to watch as Cassie gets to know Ben Parker (Adam Scott) as her coworker. But what is actually fun about Madame Web is completely rooted in Johnson’s approach to Cassie as a character. She’s thrown into a situation that she has no control over. Once she gets her powers, she is on a train and sees the imminent brutal death of three girls and fellow passengers: Anya (Isabela Merced), Julia (Sydney Sweeney), and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor). Being someone who saves lives for a living as a paramedic, she ends up helping them fight off Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). Ezekiel Sims, who was working with Cassie’s mom in the Amazon (famously), ended up betraying her mother and taking a magic spider that with healing properties for himself, letting it bite him and give hims spider-like reflexes and abilities like climbing on walls—much like Spider-Man. But he also has a recurring dream that shows these 3 teenage girls, with spider powers of their own, trying to kill him. This setup puts Cassie in the role of a reluctant hero who has to take care of a group of people she really doesn’t want to—odd given her career choice, but still, it works because of how Johnson plays Cassie. On paper, this movie would 100% not work. But as you’re watching Johnson’s dry sense of humor shine through, you can’t help but love Cassie, and it irons out the parts of the movie that don’t make a lot of sense—like a Pepsi factory just having a bunch of fireworks, or taking a trip to the Amazon and back in a week’s time, or Cassie feeding a cat milk in 2003 when we knew that wasn’t an okay thing to do. As someone who was watching movies set in Spider-Man’s New York way back when in 2003, I will say that Madame Web reminded me how fun and cheesy this universe can be. Yes, some of the moments of power come across as superhero cringey, but it doesn’t feel like a movie that wouldn’t fit in with the over-the-top comic book stories we loved back then.  Did I love when a song that was released in 1993 played as Cassie walked into a baby shower she probably wouldn’t have been invited to? Yes. I did. Getting to see different characters in the Spider-Man universe show how their powers can differ from Spider-Person to Spider-Person is part of the fun of the movie. The core of the movie comes from Cassie being forced to take care of the three teenagers when Ezekiel Sims decides he wants to kill them before they even get their powers. With Mattie, Anya, and Julia acting like kids, not listening to Cassie when they should, and just trying to stay alive, the movie does work to show how Cassie still cares and wants to do the right thing even when she is cracking jokes. The more I think about this movie, the more I wonder how these characters would interact with other Spider-Man characters. Sure, it is far from a perfect movie, but there is joy to be found in Cassie’s dynamic with people in her life, the situations that these girls find themselves in, and the Spidey-ness of it all. Sometimes, you just want to watch Spider-People do their thing, and that’s what Madame Web was for me. And hey, I am woman enough to admit that maybe this was the kind of movie that was made for Spider-Man fans like I am who just love to exist in a New York that Peter Parker knows and loves. But honestly? Madame Web is fun to watch. It has “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes in it and Adam Scott! What else can a girl ask for?",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024"," Look out world, Madame Web (the character) is young, not blind, and socially awkward! In fact, Madame Web (the movie) spins such a new take on Cassandra Webb and so many other Marvel characters that it probably shouldn’t be called Madame Web at all! Separating its characters and their origins from their comic-book counterparts, this is a movie that makes basic decisions in dialogue and structure, and feels stuck in the year it’s set in, 2003. Sometimes that’s good thing! But most times it’s very bad. Madame Web is a waste of talent, a weak execution of its clairvoyant-hero-protects-future-Spider-Women conceit, and too focused on the family of the friendly neighborhood wall-crawler whose web truly connects this scattered cinematic universe. In the Madame Web trailer, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) recalls that her mother was studying spiders in the Amazon right before she died. While this fact about Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) quickly became a copypasta punchline, Cassie actually has a good reason to be fixated with it: After all, her mother did die on that trip, and she was still pregnant with Cassie! Although Constance dies from childbirth, her daughter survives with the help of Las Arañas (a.k.a. Spider-People) and their super-healing spiders. The incident leaves adult Cassie feeling abandoned, angry, and full of disdain, and she keeps other people at arm’s length as a result. Little does she know that Las Arañas granted her a clairvoyance that will lead her to adopt a litter of other spiderlings who similarly have no web to call home. We get very little background information on Cassie: She’s a New York City paramedic who likes American Idol and Chinese food, but hates “family stuff.” (Again, abandonment issues.) A product of the foster system (with no explanation of how she got back to the United States from the Amazon), she claims that she turned out fine, but “fine” is more like “surface level survival with a hard shell.” And underneath that hard shell? Just a slightly less hard shell? Cassie is a loner with horrendous bedside manner – but outside of professional settings, Johnson is perfectly cast in the role. She owns Cassie’s awkwardness and disinterest in pleasing other characters. I predict that Johnson’s delivery of canned retorts and clunky exposition will live on in the minds of the Terminally Online – it’s worth noting that only part of the “studying spiders in the Amazon” line makes it into the final cut – but she was made for this “reluctant mother” role.  The tone of Madame Web fits uncomfortably between psychological thriller and coming-of-age roadtrip dramedy, but the quips and visual humor – like Cassie’s attempt to climb walls – of the latter hamper the former. This is a movie where the plot is driven by a man trying to kill three future Spider-Women in very violent ways! As delightful as they try to be with the script they’re given, Sydney Sweeney, Isabel Merced, and Celeste O’Connor are portraying basic, mismatched archetypes. Sweeney’s Julia Carpenter is meek and worrisome, searching for the same type of support and validation as the character she plays on Euphoria. Merced’s Anya is intelligent, discerning, and wary of new people, but she eventually loosens up. Franklin’s Mattie is outspoken, impulsive, and rebellious. These are young women who share with Cassie the experience of being abandoned and forced to take care of themselves. After retreating inward, they pull together to find some semblance of a family – an emotional arc that I wish Madame Web explored more deeply, and from each character’s perspective, rather than being shared one-by-one when the chips are down. It’s a depressing motivation, but one that isn’t common in superhero movies. While it’s a true bummer, I appreciate the direction of having these girls find fulfillment with each other, even if it’s not fully developed. Madame Web could be commenting on how girls are forced to grow up at a young age, while men rebel against this show of maturity with violence and manipulation. But you’d have to search real hard for that. Of course, Madame Web bad guy Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) fits this mold: He wants to murder Julia, Anya and Mattie! But we also know he’s a bad guy because he has the most generic bad guy power, wealth, a calculating tech-wiz-hench-woman (Zosia Mamet as Amaria), and extremely stilted and generic villain dialogue, much of which makes Rahim feel like he’s talking at his co-stars rather than with them. Because if there’s one thing Ezekiel Sims is going to do, it’s remind you that he came from nothing. He came from nothing and no one is going to take everything he’s worked for away from him! If there’s another thing Ezekiel Sims is going to do, it’s not wear any footwear in New York alleys or train stations, which is disturbing. But like every other main character in Madame Web, we only ever get the most baseline information about Ezekiel: We don’t know what his passions are, or his purpose for life. He’s been cursed with nightmares of his death, but did he become a casually evil dude just to avoid being attacked and killed by Spider-Women? Does he have any technology or research he’s doing to show that he’s at least trying to survive through above-board means? Madame Web packs a lot into a nearly two-hour runtime when it really, really doesn’t need to. It’s weirdly paced and picks the wrong things to focus on – like Cassie’s co-worker Ben Parker (Adam Scott) and his very pregnant sister-in-law, Mary Parker (Emma Roberts). The whereabouts of Mary’s husband and Ben’s brother, Richard, are unknown, but his absence makes him look like a deadbeat father-to-be, which is unintentionally hilarious in a sad way because the movie takes place over the course of maybe three weeks? Cassie herself travels to Peru for a week to get answers from Las Arañas and returns in the time that Spider-Man’s dad, wherever the hell he is, is still gone on his own trip? The inclusion of Ben and Mary is shoehorning at its most meaningless. Venom as a character is inextricably tied to Spider-Man, yet those movies manage to tell stories without him. We don’t need Spider-Movies that make the Parkers the Skywalkers of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. Madame Web demonstrates that Spider-People are made in so many different ways, so why try to retroactively rope in not Spider-Man himself, but his relatives? A more natural connection to the Spider-Man movie exists in Madame Web’s major showdowns set on trains and rooftops, and all of the creative bobbing, weaving, and misdirection such settings require. You can tell that a lot of the effects and sets in these scenes are practical, which is nice and actually does make the movie feel like it takes place in 2003 (complimentary). The subway sequence featured heavily in the trailers is the first time Cassie truly takes action to prevent death after being bombarded with vision after vision as each of the girls enter the train. It’s a flurry of vision, real-time, vision, repeat that disorients both Cassie and the viewer. The depiction of those visions and the mystical realm of Cassie’s ever-connecting web is Madame Web’s most creative element. Director S.J. Clarkson borrows some stylistic choices from her work on Netflix’s Anatomy of a Scandal: Using diopter lenses and some practical stunts (which seemed a little too abstract for a straightforward legal drama series) works here to communicate Cassie’s clairvoyance, stuttering and slowing down the onscreen action to mimic the way a stray thought or memory passes through the mind. Despite my issues with Madame Web’s muddled tone, I can’t shake my head too much at a movie that pulls off an action sequence timed to Britney Spears’ “Toxic”. The fact that the scene is punctuated by Cassie crashing a stolen taxi into a diner tickled me. Whatever physical abilities Cassie didn’t get from her spider bite, she makes up for with her emergency vehicle driving. Her weapon of choice is any motor vehicle, and she will fuck up your shit. Drive off a second story garage floor? No problem. Get Dakota Johnson in Ambulance 2, Michael Bay! In many surface-level ways, Madame Web feels like Sony’s Doctor Strange. An abrasive, medical professional gets into an accident that (directly or indirectly) allows them to see beyond the natural limits of our reality. Both movies have a moment when an astral projection of the protagonist is thrust out of their physical body. They face adversaries on a mental playing field. And at some point they team up with youngsters even though they are definitely! Not! Babysitters! However, the approaches for introducing such a character with complex power set are wildly different. After the all-lady team-up in The Marvels, where our three interlinked heroes work together to face a common enemy, I was hoping Madame Web would deliver another fun, badass story about women bonding over their abilities and learning how to work together despite their differences. However, it only gives us the beginnings of how cool and powerful Cassie, Julia, Anya, and Mattie will eventually be. Considering that’s more than half of the major characters in this movie, it’s a total waste of a story. They never suit up in Madame Web, nor even get the powers they’re going to get. What was the point of all this? This feels like a sequel story. And while a sequel is less guaranteed from Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, Madam Web at least could've tried to tell a story that leaves audiences wanting to learn more, or leaves them with a sense of connection to this character. Madame Web tries to connect many plots and people together to a confusing, yet ultimately bland result. It tries to balance the comedic tone of a modern superhero movie with what could be a more interesting psychological thriller if it invested more time on developing its hero and villain, rather than spreading itself thin trying to connect all these new versions of characters together. It fails as a one-off and a franchise starter, not telling a fulfilling origin story for Cassie nor giving a compelling argument for the future Spider-Women. The weak dialogue unfortunately stands out, but the few action set pieces harken to the older Spider-Man movies of the early 2000s.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024"," A little under two years ago, the atrocious Spider-Man spinoff Morbius arrived to torture moviegoers, the nonsensical vampire flick so traumatizing a viewing experience that I was confident in labelling it the absolute nadir of superhero cinema. Today, I owe Morbius an apology, because it turned out that Sony Pictures just needed a little more time and a whole lot of misplaced confidence to make an even worse Spidey spinoff, the astoundingly abysmal Madame Web. Concocted by avaricious producers desperate to cash in on any Spider-Man-adjacent intellectual property – for those who absolutely must know, “Peter Parker” in any of his familiar cinematic forms never appears here, though he definitely kinda sorta exists – Madame Web is a dirge for the Marvel cinematic era. Stupendously stupid and never remotely in control of its faculties, the film represents a kind of weaponized incompetence, hostile and assaultive. The fact that it is being released into the world and not digitally incinerated feels like the cruellest kind of joke, with everyone – its makers and its audience – cast as the punchline. Such a violent response threatens to make Madame Web sound more interesting than it actually is, at least in a sado-masochistic way. Do not make the mistake, though, of trying to reclaim this film as a piece of ironically appreciated anti-art. Any random two-minute snippet of the movie will immediately prove its uselessness. Like, for instance, the opening sequence, in which heavily pregnant scientist Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) is shown traipsing through the Peruvian jungle circa 1974, on the hunt for a rare spider whose venom might cure all manner of diseases. She is accompanied by a shifty-looking guide, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim), whose motives are as evil as his lines are muddy – seriously, it seems as if 75 per cent of Rahim’s dialogue has been dubbed over, re-recorded in postproduction sessions for reasons unknown. The action that follows – involving a double-cross, gunfights and tree-leaping spider-men (but not, it should be noted, Spider-Man) – is visually incoherent, while the performances are so distressingly lifeless that it feels as if the cast got caught up in a Weekend at Bernie’s type of situation. Alas, veteran television director S.J. Clarkson doesn’t call the whole thing a wash then and there. Instead, she flashes the story forward a few decades to 2003 – for Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline reasons that are too confusing and frankly depressing, to detail here – where Constance’s daughter, Cassandra (Dakota Johnson), is saving lives as New York’s least charismatic paramedic. After a near-death accident on the job activates her latent spider-venom-gifted powers, Cassandra starts to experience visions of the future. This clairvoyance then leads her to save three motley teenage girls – including a badly miscast Sydney Sweeney and two other actresses who I’m sure have names but are best off being stricken from the record – from a seemingly immortal Ezekiel, who is back from the jungle and out for vaguely defined revenge. Did any of the above sound interesting or even mildly comprehensible? No, of course not. But that isn’t going to stop Clarkson and her screenwriters (two of whom were also responsible for Morbius) from plopping out another 100 minutes of assaultive nonsense. Particularly cruel is their decision to essentially give Cassandra the superpower of déjà vu. Perhaps that’s a useful gift for her when it comes to fighting crime, but it is punishing for the audience, as we now have to sit through the same scenes at least twice. There is so much more awfulness to Madame Web – including Sweeney’s fetishized schoolgirl shtick, the resigned complacency of Adam Scott in his role as Ben “future Uncle of Peter” Parker, and one of the worst product-placement deals in Hollywood history for the good folks at Pepsi – but unlike the film’s producers, I know when to pull the plug. Morbius, all is forgiven.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024","Mostly, the movie is a Pepsi ad strangely populated by performances turned to low volume. Johnson, so likable in fare as varied as 50 Shades of Grey and Suspiria, is a minimalist performer. Her casting here is an unfortunate mistake. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Madame Web might be the most shameless superhero movie of all time. Far from just the cash-in that it seemed like a few years ago when this movie headlined by an F-tier superhero was first announced, Sony’s latest Marvel offshoot is a two-hour post-credits scene, made only intermittently tolerable by Dakota Johnson’s underappreciated knack for comedy. Madame Web, as it turns out, is actually a woman named Cassie Web (Johnson). We discover in the movie’s 1970s-set opening that Cassie’s mom researched spiders in the Amazon while pregnant with Cassie. After a predictable betrayal, Cassie’s mom ends up at death’s door when a tribe of spider-people (yes, there are spider-people in the Amazon rainforest) save her baby’s life using special venom from a rare super-spider. The movie then cuts forward to 2003, when Cassie is a paramedic in New York City, working with her best friend Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Yes, that Ben. After literally dying one day during a call to save someone from a traffic accident, Cassie suddenly gains the power to see an indeterminate length of time into the future. Eventually, this power leads her to save the lives of three girls, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), from a strange man that she foresees trying to kill them. Cassie’s flashes forward in time are the most complicated part of Madame Web, and surprisingly, its most fun moments, too. While they’re often filmed in confusing ways, edited together too quickly for viewers to really track, and lacking a consistent enough visual language to be clearly legible, they’re saved almost entirely by Johnson, who reacts to these brief breaks from the fourth dimension with quixotic looks and genuinely hilarious sarcasm. Despite her press-tour uncertainty about the movie, she is far and away the brightest spot in Madame Web — at least when she isn’t buried under its wooden dialogue.  There are also flashes of promise from the trio of young women Cassie’s trying to save, but the movie somehow manages to squander the group’s remarkable collective charisma. Merced was surprisingly fun as live-action Dora the Explorer, O’Connor is one of the best parts of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and Sweeney is a full-on movie star. But Madame Web doesn’t seem to have any interest in any of them, never cutting to get their reactions to anything, and rarely giving their jokes enough time to breathe or to let the audience laugh. For all the wasted potential of Madame Web’s heroes, the movie’s biggest issue is its villain, Ezekiel Sims, played by Tahar Rahim in an astoundingly awful performance from an otherwise gifted actor. Ezekiel seems to have Spider-Man powers, which he gained by murdering Cassie’s mom in the Amazon and stealing her special spider. This is one of exactly two things we learn about him in the entire movie. The second thing we learn is that he has had a dream since the night he got his powers that three women who also have spider powers will one day kill him, so he’s made it his life’s mission to kill them first. In our glimpse of this dream, we get to see that of course the three women are Anya, Julia, and Mattie, all dressed as Spider-Woman variants from the Marvel comics. These three “heroes” reveal Madame Web’s real cynicism: The whole movie is just a backdoor pilot. When the three women line up for a group hero shot in Ezekiel’s dream, just after pushing him out a window, they’re practically a poster for a hypothetical Spider-Girls movie.  But Ezekiel’s dream sequence near the beginning of the movie and a brief vision from Cassie at the end of the movie are all we see of these three fresh heroes. They don’t get their powers in this movie, they don’t find out they’ll one day be heroes, they don’t even fight anyone. Madame Web, it seems, is nothing more than a craven attempt at inflating a cinematic superhero universe. It’s a trailer for the excitement to come someday, assuming fans love (and pay for) this movie enough for it to get a sequel or two.  Given how many movies nowadays are just Trojan Horses for future films, that could almost be excusable, if any of this post-credits-tease-in-movie-form were more interesting to watch. Director S.J. Clarkson (Jessica Jones) can’t find any life for her action scenes at all. Almost all of them boil down to a rote, slow-speed car chase. Even a brief sojourn back in the Amazon doesn’t lead to anything more interesting than a flashback to the movie’s bizarre opening scene. And the movie’s climax takes place at an abandoned fireworks warehouse, which eventually turns into a CGI light show of sparks and rockets that seem somehow both way too destructive — who knew a firework could blow a massive hole through a brick wall? — and never too dangerous to our characters if they happen to be standing next to them when they explode.  Yet for all the boring set pieces, bad exposition, and faulty universe expansion, Johnson, Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor still manage to find tiny spaces where their charisma can peek through. In the few moments these four are left alone, like a scene where Johnson deposits them in the New Jersey woods for safe keeping, they bounce off each other gamely with humor and charm. The scene is a sudden glimpse of the star power this movie never bothers to tap into.  Frankly, all those little jokes should have been enough to keep this movie ranked above the absolute dregs of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, laughless bores like Thor: Love and Thunder or Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But the sheer ickiness of Madame Web’s franchise-building is impossible to ignore. In a just world, Madame Web would be the death knell for this kind of IP strip-mining. But with two more Sony Spider-Man universe movies on the way this year alone, instead Madame Web is just a brief glimpse into our own future doom. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024","Madame Web might have sounded like an interesting experiment, and it sort of is, but the execution feels less like a fully realized film than an extended prologue for a movie to come. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Because if you thought “Morbius” was bad, buckle up for “Madame Web.” Directed by S.J. Clarkson (“Jessica Jones”), the psychological thriller (★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters now) barely clears the painfully low bar set by Jared Leto’s pseudo-vampire flick. Burdened by bad dialogue, negligible character development, a lackluster bad guy and assorted B-movie silliness, ""Madame"" stars Dakota Johnson as a New York City paramedic able to see the future. While gamely trying to venture outside of her drama comfort zone, she as well as others unfortunately get stuck in the film’s web of nonsense.  The movie centers on Cassandra Webb (Johnson), who in the Marvel Comics' Spider-Verse is an all-seeing elderly blind woman confined to a life-support chair, but here gets a superhero origin story that’s sort of Spider-Man lite. Cassie is an EMT who keeps mostly to herself and her cat when a near-death experience unlocks these weird psychic visions that she initially figures are episodes of deja vu but are actually glimpses into a potential future. (Also important to know: Like with Peter Parker, a spider bite is key to Cassie’s tale.) Fate, or a forced plot as it were, intertwines Cassie’s life with three youngsters – Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya (Isabela Merced) – and she ""sees"" them being killed by a strange guy named Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim). After saving the girls from being murdered on the subway, Cassie needs to decode her own traumatic past while keeping her moody new charges safe from this mysterious villain. Ezekiel inexplicably wears what looks like a Spider-Man suit, even though Spidey’s not really a thing (yet) in this 2003-set narrative, which is just going to annoy and confuse casual movie fans. Frustrated indignation is par for the course with “Madame Web,” given its mostly unexplained race of mythical spider-people, Cassie’s haphazard visions and a ludicrous denouement. Johnson gives her character, who’s not at all comfortable playing cool aunt to a trio of trouble-magnet kids, a sassy scrappiness in the more grounded sections. The superhero-y stuff is less successful, and not exactly subtle about its Spider-source material: Cassie learns about great power and having responsibility, and her ambulance partner Ben (Adam Scott) is about to be an uncle, so you don’t have to be a card-carrying Marvel nerd to figure out some things. And for fans of tight outfits and superpowers, “Madame Web” couldn’t come at a worse time as the latest in a cinematic genre spiraling with diminishing returns. This won't help: Instead of being a breath of fresh air akin to the Tom Holland Spider-flicks, “Madame Web” is instead a reminder of the Worst Superhero Times (aka the mid-2000s), when we couldn’t escape the doldrums of “Spider-Man 3,” “Elektra” and “X-Men: The Last Stand.”",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," 
	When I was a kid, my mom steered us toward toys that looked like G.I. Joe or Transformers action figures, but weren’t. Their faces were wack, the joints all wrong, such that the limbs didn’t move right, or else they popped out altogether. Sure, these off-brand imitations cost less than the real thing — that made a difference on my meager allowance — but no amount of imagination could turn my busted GoBots into Optimus Prime. 
	Even with an actor as clever as Dakota Johnson (who seems to suspect she could be caught in the next “Catwoman,” covering her bets with eccentric line readings), “Madame Web” was never going to touch the relatively high-concept, Disney-made “Avengers” movies. The script is confusing, the action stale and the visual effects cheap. A recurring device that places Cassie at the center of what looks like a giant plasma ball, surrounded by static tendrils, is downright embarrassing. But guess what? Tickets still cost just as much as they would for a more canonical Marvel movie. So why settle for the knockoff? 
	Betrayed by expedition sponsor Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), Constance dies in the jungle, but not before being bitten by one of the elusive spiders, who passes its powers on to her unborn daughter. Now, I know this is a comic book movie, but if you break down the plot, it sounds a lot more like Greek mythology: Cassie (short for Cassandra) grows up an orphan in New York, unlocking her future-forecasting abilities after a near-death experience at age 30. Unlike with her namesake, people tend to believe her.  
	Ezekiel also lives in Manhattan, obsessing over a recurring vision of his own (he stole a spider and got a slightly different set of hazily defined powers for his trouble). The monomaniacal bore has but one goal, and that’s to stop the three young women he sees killing him from carrying out that prophecy. Before Ezekiel can break their necks on a train, Cassie anticipates the attack and saves their lives. Ezekiel’s would-be victims are just teenagers — Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) — but they possess the potential to become Spider-Women, and he’s threatened by that. 
	Frankly, the world already seems a little overcrowded with arachnid-related superheroes, what with the seemingly infinite swarm of variations introduced by Sony’s recent “Spider-Verse” movies. Instead of clarifying all that confusion, Clarkson’s movie (co-written with three others) merely widens the web, teasing a future vigilante trio, plus whatever Cassie’s supposed to be by the end. 
	Future crossover potential aside, Clarkson’s approach feels like a throwback to the kind of unimaginative superhero movies Hollywood produced before Marvel got its act together over at Disney. But this was made at another studio altogether. Even when shooting on location, the movie feels like a backlot stunt show. While the ambulance-driving scenes are decent, taking advantage of a certain practical quality, VFX-heavy interactions with Ezekiel (whom the girls call “ceiling guy” because he crawls upside down) look laughably unconvincing. Even his costume is an embarrassment, though the mask does serves to cover Rahim’s mouth — it’s a shame to hide the gifted French actor, though his lips never seem to be in sync with what he’s saying, suggesting the performance didn’t go as planned. 
	By contrast, Johnson and Sweeney bring an endearing irreverence to their characters that could be read as camp, if needed. There are signs (loose ends, really) that “Madame Web” wanted to be more ambitious and eccentric than it turned out. One can imagine a version where the character was romantically interested in fellow paramedic — and future uncle — Ben (Adam Scott), which might have strengthened her connection to you-know-who. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," PLOT: Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a New York EMT who acquires clairvoyance after a brush with death. She uses her powers to stop a spider-powered villain (Tahar Rahim) hunting three girls who, he believes, will eventually end his life.  Of course, one of the reasons people aren’t hyped about Madame Web is that the character isn’t exactly a household name. For those who aren’t in the loop, in the comic, Madame Web is a paralyzed, blind clairvoyant, which is distinctly not what Dakota Johnson is playing here. She’s already appeared, in a manner of speaking, in Across the Spider-Verse as a guidance counsellor, voiced by Rachel Dratch.  So it seems Sony’s taken a loose approach in adapting the character to the big screen, which is fine. I think people have been down on it because of the meme-worthy trailer. Those posters, which looked whipped together, didn’t help, with everyone assuming this would be just another B-superhero movie. Madame Web is, unfortunately, a big mess. I don’t know exactly what happened, but the four credited writers, who include director SJ Clarkson, aren’t able to make a compelling addition to the Spider-verse. Like so many films of its ilk, it teases the movie fans actually want to see, which is a full-on Spider-Women team-up film, which is something we seemed to be promised by the trailer. Instead, this prequel establishes how Cassie Webb meets the three girls who later become costumed superheroes. There’s not much in the way of super-heroics here at all. Here, they are “teens” hunted by Tahar Rahim’s Ezekiel Sims, who has powers similar to Spider-Man.  We learn in the opening, which boasts a cameo by Kerry Bishé of my beloved Halt and Catch Fire as Cassie’s mother, that he murderously stole a sacred spider in the Amazon. He acquired certain powers, but they came with a curse. He’s clairvoyant, but he can see his death at the hands of three costumed heroines, who here are played by Celeste O’Connor, Isabela Merced and, hilariously, Sydney Sweeney, who wears thick sweaters and glasses to fool us into thinking she’s 16. Given how much of a star she’s become, audiences may find her playing such a young character unintentionally hilarious, but that’s not the only goofy part of this movie. It has to be said that some of the dialogue here is ROUGH. It’s jam-packed with so much exposition and references to other Spider-Man characters that it becomes cheesy. Adam Scott plays a guy – whose identity I won’t spoil here – who is a major character in the Spider-Man universe, so his full name is awkwardly said out loud a few times, just in case we don’t get the many hints being dropped, I suppose that’s for the benefit of those whose attention might waver. Fair enough, because that happened to me here more than a few times. In the lead, Dakota Johnson does all she can but seems an awkward fit for a superhero movie. She’s always seemed more at home with edgier fare, such as the Suspiria remake, but she gives it a go. She gives Cassie some attitude and is entertaining until the abysmal epilogue, where her performance becomes quite campy, which does not bode well for this hoped-for franchise. She’s being set up as the Professor X of the Spider-verse, but I’m not sure the role will fit her well. Merced, O’Connor and Sweeney bring the requisite spunk to their roles and may be excellent choices for a future team-up movie, hopefully allowing them to play the characters closer to their own age. Of everyone, the only one who comes off poorly is Tahar Rahim. He’s an excellent actor, having delivered a stunning performance in the film A Prophet, but something is very off, with it seeming like a lot of his dialogue was changed in post-production looping. It’s very noticeable and makes him come off as very stiff.  Indeed, it’s the writing that dooms this smaller-scaled film. Early on, Cassie is established as being on the run from the cops, but she can jet off to Peru without worrying about being caught. The movie is set in 2003, so it can justify the lack of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, allowing them to pepper the film with needle drops that mostly date back years before the film takes place. The only exception is an action scene set to Britney Spears’ “Toxic” because it’s set in the early aughts. You’ve got to have Britney. Director SJ Clarkson is noted for her excellent TV work, which includes the great Netflix Marvel show Jessica Jones. Still, the style she brought to that is absent here, with some strange choices, including a distracting use of shaky cam that comes in during some dialogue scenes. Perhaps it’s fitting it takes place in 2003, as that style was pretty dominant back then, but it seems bizarre now. Given the modest budget, there’s also very little in the way of action until the finale, which sets up future adventures for the cast. But I don’t know – I doubt anyone will walk out of this with a franchise.  Ultimately, Madame Web could have been a decent little B-side of a superhero film, but the terrible, cornball dialogue and lacklustre pace doom it early on. To note, the version of the movie I saw had no post-credits scene, so when the credits roll – you’re free!  Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

"Feb 13, 2024","  After a decade of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) with its inextricable, overlapping plotlines and multiverse, Sony Pictures' newest cinematic foray into Marvel, Madame Web, might come as a surprise. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and starring Dakota Johnson as the titular character, Madame Web ditches convoluted continuities and starts fresh by exploring the origin of one of Marvel's lesser-known and more mysterious characters. In the comics, Madame Web is a wise old woman who's paralyzed and blind. However, she has near-omnipotent psychic and clairvoyant abilities. She's also a matriarchal figure to the Spider-Women. But in Madame Web, young Cassandra Web is an ordinary paramedic working in New York City. When she's not on the job, she struggles with her unhappy past as an abandoned baby in foster care.   When an accident grants her the ability to see visions of future disasters that are all but doomed to come true, Cassandra seems resigned to fate. But when a vision leads to her protecting three very different teenage girls from a dangerous threat, Cassandra finds herself taking on great responsibility, and accepting great power as a result. A return to form for the superhero genre, Madame Web's brand-new-yet-retro approach to cinema and its creative take on Spider-Man's mythos make it a much-needed hard reset for the Marvel cinematic experience, while blazing new trails of its own.   Although it is connected to the same universe of the The Amazing Spider-Man films released in the 2010s, Madame Web is a tale that stands on its own. No previous plotlines, pre-existing continuities and introductions are needed. Only the basest, rudimentary knowledge of the Spider-Man mythos is necessary to walk into the theater. In this way, Madame Web took more cues from Sam Raimi's early 2000s Spider-Man films than the MCU, presenting a standalone, user-friendly entry into the wider Spider-Verse. Even with minimal context, those unaware of Madame Web or her Spider-Women in the comics can still comfortably enjoy this cinematic ride.   On the downside, this independent approach could be jarring to those who are accustomed to—or even disenchanted with— the mainline MCU's connectivity. Many filmgoers spent the last ten or so years conditioned to look at Marvel films, characters and their continuities a certain way, expecting everything to be explained or interconnected. Madame Web does not offer such hand-holding. Without any continuity lifelines to throw, these particular filmgoers will have a sudden shock to the system when processing the standalone approach of Madame Web and its isolated storyline. On the other hand, those willing to suspend these instincts might find this new take on Marvel refreshing, and feel free to enjoy the solid storytelling for what it is: a story, not a chapter in a long, ongoing and interconnected series, at least in the foreseeable future. As it stands, both seasoned comic book fans and the uninitiated—with a love of comics and ample curiosity—could walk comfortably into the theater blind, and emerge satisfied.   Even beyond its setting, specifically New York City in 2003, Madame Web has a distinct vintage flair, with a grittier, earthier and grounded edge that hearkens to the superhero films of the period. In many ways, Madame Web is a genre throwback, a back-to-basics approach that pares down the formula to its basest, simplest, yet most effective elements. It isn't without action, adventure, violence and explosions, but this is a comparatively down-to-earth, almost intellectual take on the Marvel mythos, particularly that of Spider-Man. There is a judicious balance between the grit of everyday life's demands, high-stakes action, supernatural elements, drama, and spots of effective dry humor in between. All these are backed by a leveled mix of both practical and digital effects. The result is a grounded and human yet dynamic cinematic experience.   Although Madame Web has a strong and solid storyline with intense and nail-biting sequences of suspense, it stumbles and hesitates at the starting line. The movie takes a good while before it hits its stride. The opening sequence is good and shocking, but the glimpses at Cassandra's pre-superhero life as a socially awkward paramedic are much slower and stall in comparison. While this approach makes sense to establish the isolation and sadness she feels, it deadens what could have otherwise been a guns-blazing starting sprint. Thankfully, once the supernatural elements emerge and the villain shows himself and his plans thus establishing himself as a compelling and real threat, Madame Web finally finds its sea legs and barrels forward.   Despite its headiness and complexity, Madame Web is a strong, cohesive narrative. Themes, symbols, motifs and plot threads are examined, picked up, and consistently woven throughout the film, creating a completed web rather than a tangled kudzu with hanging loose threads. These themes are explored both explicitly in subtext, in dialogue, or even visually expressed through Cassandra's many clairvoyant, psychic visions.   Maternal love is the strongest theme in Madame Web. Cassandra Webb's backstory hinged on her pregnant mother's excursion into the Amazon in search of the rare, powerful spider, its healing properties, and the mysterious tribe known as Las Arañas. The three young girls—delinquent, poor-little-rich-girl Mattie Franklin, meek ingénue Julia Cornwall and sassy smart-gal Anya Corazon—all struggle with parental abandonment, bereavement or loss. These traumas become the catalyst for their mentor-mentee relationship with Cassandra. Similarly, antagonist Ezekiel Sims is driven by his own sense of loss but unlike Cassandra, he chooses a path of selfishness, entitlement, ruthlessness and self-preservation. These traits make the hero-villain dynamic between him and Cassandra stronger and more personal. These themes of maternal and parental love, loss and redemption are portrayed with full aplomb by Madame Web's solid cast.   Dakota Johnson of Fifty Shades of Grey fame takes the mantle of the titular superhero like a duck to water. Her transformation from awkward, isolated, and fatalistic loner to confident protector, zen-psychic leader, and benevolent matriarch is seamless. Her deadpan and earthy delivery as pre-clairvoyant Cassandra sells the character's unease, social awkwardness, and barely-suppressed compassion. Likewise, her transformation into the more hopeful, determined, and somewhat playful Madame Web reads as the natural course of development for her character and circumstances. Her rapport with her castmates—Celeste O'Connor as Mattie, Isabela Merced as Anya and Sydney Sweeney as Julia—is the right balance between uneasiness, sweetness, frustration, tension, and amicableness. Each of the girls got the chance to expose and develop their individual personalities, hinting to the yet unexplored full potential of their future superheroic selves. Their development into a functional unit of superpowered Spider-Women has good payoff. Tahar Rahim as Ezekiel Sims is also excellent. He delivered a subtle and elegant performance that radiated cold effortless charm and stoicism. His Sims is unapologetically but formally malicious, restrained yet effective as an iconic villain. His physical presence as a darker take on Spider-Man is menacing and palpable, and his chemistry with Dakota Johnson's Cassandra perfectly captured the contrasting dichotomy of seflessness and selfishness between their characters.   Although Madame Web is as classic a superhero film as one can get, it's remarkably headier and more cerebral than the majority of its contemporaries. This is fitting, considering Madame Web's powers are entirely mental as opposed to physical. Beyond the intellectual and philosophical bent of the narrative, this headiness was also made clear through the visuals. Clairvoyance is a difficult power to translate from illustration to silver screen, especially the manner in which they are depicted in superhero comics. However, Madame Web managed to do just that, bringing to life Cassandra's clairvoyance, her real-time, overlapping visions of the future, and the iconic ""web"" formation of her intellectual, psychic realms, to dazzling effect.   Producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura, no stranger to action films, employed a combination of computer-generated images (CGI) and practical effects to create Cassandra's psychic visions, the web formations, and even Ezekiel Sims' powers. This combination of effects, and the balance between the practical and the digital, gives weight, tangibility and gravity to Madame Web. In lesser hands, Cassandra's powers could have easily been cheap and rendered with obvious and unconvincing computer effects. While the visual effects of Madame Web do not shy from or attempt to hide their digital origins, the sense of physicality and grace of their rendering gives this film that extra layer of grit and dignity.   Although it gets its feet a little tangled at the start, Madame Web weaves a strong and cohesive narrative, celebrating feminine leadership, a rejection of pessimistic fatalism, and the empowerment that comes with embracing responsibility. The result is an affirmative and earthy cinematic venture, and a fine return to form for a genre that has since spun multiple threads. Although missing the mark of a masterpiece and sticking closely to familiar beats, Madame Web has enough rewards for those who are willing to suspend preconceptions and follow its threads.  Cassandra Webb is a New York City paramedic who starts to show signs of clairvoyance. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she must protect three young women from a mysterious adversary who wants them dead.

Of course, if the answer comes down to a few songs and a shoehorned reference to a popular TV show, it doesn’t really make a single lick of difference when “Madame Web” is set — or if it was always supposed to be that way. And yet, it’s only by recognizing the sheer arbitrariness of this film’s non-aesthetic that a deeper truth becomes clear: Even if “Madame Web” had taken place in the 1990s, it would still feel as if it had been made in 2003.  It starts, of course, with Cassandra Webb’s mother (Kerry Bishé), who was in the Amazon researching spiders just before she died. She was killed, in fact, by a man named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim, shrewdly making the leap from “A Prophet” to “for profit” in a movie that no one will ever remember seeing him in), who had spent years hunting for a mysterious arachnid whose venom is capable of bestowing supernatural powers. Why would a spider evolve to make its prey more powerful? I don’t know, and “Madame Web” doesn’t care. All that matters is that Ezekiel murders the very pregnant woman he was hired to protect, and flees the scene unaware that an indigenous tribe — embodied by exactly one person — used the magical spider venom to save baby Cassandra from being stillborn.  Almost every superhero origin story includes a few scenes where its disbelieving hero rolls their eyes at their newfound powers and responsibilities, but few actors have ever had more fun with it than Johnson does here. I don’t want to spoil the best moment of a film that only has about three good ones, so let’s just say that Johnson manages to redeem one of the most gratuitous and worst-written scenes in the history of superhero movies — or modern studio movies of any kind, really — with a joke so wildly morbid and perfectly delivered that the otherwise half-conscious audience at my screening roared with laughter.  Are these characters at all interesting? They are not. Celeste O’Connor plays the spoiled and snotty Mattie Franklin, Isabela Merced plays obligatory STEM propaganda Anya Corazon (she wears a t-shirt that says “I eat MATH for breakfast,” which is more memorable than any of the lines that were actually written for her to stay), and Sydney Sweeney plays the goody-goody Julia Cornwall, whose nerd-Lolita styling feels like it’s engaged in some kind of ninth-dimensional chess with the horniest subset of Sweeney’s “Euphoria” fandom. “Madame Web” frequently alludes to — or more than alludes to — the fact that these girls are all going to be superheroes one day, but this movie, in its primitive understanding of what it can do within this space, seems to think that it’s incapable of showing us what that might look like.  The finale is strange for other reasons too, the most obvious of them being that it goes full CGI force-ghost in order to make good on the concept of a movie that otherwise tries to remain as grounded as possible. The clash between those two modes makes both of them feel glaringly, amateurishly fake in their own right, and undoes whatever scintilla of real human emotion might have been generated by the bond that develops between Cassie and her loyal trio of parentless adolescents.  I can’t say for sure that “Madame Web” has been hacked to pieces and diluted within an inch of its life by a studio machine that has no idea what it’s trying to make or why, but Sony’s latest swing at superhero glory stars an actress whose affect seems to perfectly channel their audience’s expectation for better material. Johnson is one of the most naturally honest and gifted performers to ever play the lead role in one of these things, and while that allows her to elevate certain moments in this movie way beyond where they have any right to be, it also makes it impossible for her to hide in the moments that lay bare their own miserableness.  By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Feb 13, 2024"," With some actors, it is a pleasure just to watch them think – to do virtually nothing but silently convey the process of wheels turning inside their heads. Dakota Johnson is not such an actor. I don’t say this because she seems stupid. On the contrary, in interviews she often comes across as unflappable, sharp perhaps to the point of cutting. It’s exactly this quality that makes visible calculation look out of place on her; if she puzzles things out in public, she conceals it very well. What she does most interestingly on screen is seethe and stew, as she does in The Lost Daughter and Cha Cha Real Smooth, both times playing young mothers whose possessiveness of their children competes with their weariness and regrets. In Madame Web, Johnson finds herself again caring for children, albeit those who feel more confident in their abilities to care for themselves. Cassie Webb (Johnson), a thirtyish paramedic working in New York City, has a brush with death that leaves her with short-term visions of the future, which in turn draws her closer to three seemingly random figures: Sweet, unassertive Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney); brainy, skeptical Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced); and independent, impulsive Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). These names may set comic book devotees’ hearts aflutter. Even more casual readers or movie-watchers may recognize how Ben Parker (Adam Scott), Cassie’s friend and coworker, bears a significant moniker in the world of your friendly neighborhood movie star Spider-Man, to which Madame Web is nominally adjacent. This is one of those Sony-produced “SSU” spinoff movies, like Venom or Morbius, where the webslinger himself does not appear – or does he? (No, not really, though the technicalities could make for some fun, nitpicky debates.) But for the purposes of attempting to watch a normal movie like a normal person who does not need assurances in one direction or another about how connected this all is to a broader cinematic universe, this is a big-budget vehicle for Johnson. It’s the first such thing since her Fifty Shades days – a gig that, to be fair, seemed to engender more contempt from her than this one. Here, she seems to be giving Cassandra Webb the old college try. Her presence is compelling in large part because she’s such a clumsy fit for the demonstrative stuff, like delivering exposition, pretending to assess her next move, or reacting with distress when she sees something horrifically violent. She’s most convincingly distressed in a more quietly irritable register, and her ambivalence about these powers, these young women, and this shadowy, menacing, Spider-Mannish figure called Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) all ring true. She seems well and truly uncertain about what she’s doing in a sorta-superhero picture. Johnson works so well in this department, in fact, that she renders the movie’s endless rerunning of her Next routine redundant; the audience gets the concept long before the movie realizes they do. Director S.J. Clarkson, a TV vet making her film debut, contributed to a multi-authored screenplay that’s as scattered in focus as Cassie’s visions. The core idea of Cassie reluctantly leading a future super-team (in a detail that sounds hastily fabricated but is actually just comic books, all three of the younger characters are fated to become different versions of the hero Spider-Woman) makes sense enough. The idea of a nightmarish alt-universe Bad Spider-Man coming after them, which is what Ezekiel essentially represents, is downright tantalizing, and sometimes staged with appropriate menace. The strands that are supposed to connect all of this together in a web of intrigue, however, don’t have much tensile strength. Ezekiel is rich, for reasons unexplained, and able to stalk the future Spider-Women by hiring an assistant played by Zosia Mamet, for reasons unexplained, who is in charge of a massive surveillance system that is, for yet more reasons unexplained, treated as a foolproof system even though it transparently only works within the confines of New York City. More attention has been paid to convincingly recreating the year 2003, when the movie is set. It would be inaccurate to call this meticulous, or at least this would be incomplete; it’s another New York-set movie where the train cars and the subway platforms and the street scenes all look a bit off. Yet certain period details are bang-on, especially on the soundtrack, which has been scrupulously curated to evoke 2003 (a song from the first Yeah Yeah Yeahs EP; a prominent ad for the first Beyoncé solo album), to the point where a radio-station needle drop of “Toxic” by Britney Spears takes care to note via unseen DJ that this is a new song that seems poised to blow up, presumably intended to remind audience nitpickers that while “Toxic” was a radio sensation in 2004, yes, its album In the Zone, was, in fact, released in the fall of 2003. One character repeatedly jokes that “you wouldn’t like me when I’m hangry,” which may not be a specific reference to the 2003 release of Hulk, but evokes it nonetheless. Cassie also drinks a period-accurate can of Mountain Dew Code Red – or rather, she fiddles with it, just as she later fiddles with a can of Pepsi. Perhaps there were some entertaining negotiations, or even bad blood, between Pepsi, whose products appear throughout, and Johnson, who appears wholly unwilling to consume them on-screen. To make up for this, the film’s climax takes place at a prominent (and real) neon Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens. (The location doubles as a literal fireworks factory, suggesting that the screenwriters are either fans of The Simpsons, or were somehow created by that show.) If this all sounds beside the point of a movie where a woman develops spider-based powers of clairvoyance and reluctantly uses them to protect a mini-platoon of fellow spider-women, I assure you, it’s no less the point than anything else in Madame Web. But the fussy period pieces may actually be the key to the movie’s peculiarities, which are more easily explainable as a superhero adaptation from, yes, 2003. Not Hulk, mind; nothing so gracefully strange, nor so crackerjack entertaining as X2. But Daredevil… yes, this does feel a bit like Daredevil, with a much better soundtrack. At times, it feels as if Clarkson hopes to turn the clock back 20 years, when comics-to-film continuity was still the province of specialists, and a glorified origin story provided all the sequel tease audiences needed. Maybe she figures that’s the best way to get permission for visual flourishes – twisty angles, inky blacks that practically bleed into the characters’ bodies – that would never make it into the MCU. Cinematographer Mauro Fiore also shot Spider-Man: No Way Home, and guess which movie makes better use of fake New York locations, of comic book color saturation, of the night sky? At times, the movie’s pleasingly jumpy visual scheme and nostalgic 2003-era cheese threaten to form an alliance and make Madame Web work in spite of itself. After all, the movie, even or especially in its worst moments, never gets dull (or weirdly smug, like its sibling Venom movies). It also never fully sheds a huckster-y addiction to pivoting, until it’s pretty far afield from what works about either a superhero movie or a loopy woo-woo thriller. Unlike Johnson, the movie’s visible calculations never make it look disengaged from the process, or even unconvincing. Just kinda stupid. Jesse Hassenger is associate movies editor at Paste.

"Feb 13, 2024"," With an awful script and not a single ounce of charm among the star-studded cast, Madame Web feels like little more than a Spider-Man movie knockoff.  Ever since Sony Pictures struck a deal to have Spider-Man join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the studio has tried to build up a cinematic franchise of their own based on related characters, the latest entry of which is Madame Web. Similar to Venom and Morbius, Madame Web follows a character originally introduced in relation to Spider-Man in Marvel Comics, but because of the nature of Sony's deal with Marvel Studios, it has to work around the lack of Peter Parker. In Madame Web's case, that means introducing four other Spider-People... sort of.  Madame Web is a superhero movie based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Taking place in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, the movie revolves around a clairvoyant woman who can look into different dimensions. Dakota Johnson stars in the lead role, with Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor comprising the rest of the cast.  Madame Web centers on Cassandra ""Cassie"" Web (Dakota Johnson), the daughter of a spider researcher who died in the Amazon after giving birth to Cassie. When Cassie is in an accident where her heart stops, she develops clairvoyant powers that lead her to cross paths with three young girls. Those three girls — Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) — are the targets of Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a man who gained powers from the spiders Cassie's mother researched. Convinced the three girls will kill him, Ezekiel sets out to kill them first.   Rahim's Ezekiel is saddled with even more ridiculous lines, all of which make him sound like a one-dimensional caricature of a Marvel movie villain rather than a fully realized character. Similarly, the three Spider-Girls are little more than their backstories, depicting three archetypes of teenage girlhood rather than actually developed characters - Mattie is the rebel, Anya the smart one, and Julia the awkward girl next door. They're given little to do besides make Cassie's job of protecting them more difficult, and even in the moments when they're meant to be building some kind of dynamic, there's no compelling chemistry.   In fact, the girls have a much more comedic dynamic with Adam Scott's Ben in a brief scene than they do with Johnson's Cassie. All told, there are no real standouts in the Madame Web cast, though it's not necessarily the fault of the actors, since it seems unlikely anyone could sell the movie's awful script.   Of all the Sony's Spider-Man Universe movies that have been released — Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Morbius — Madame Web easily has the strangest relationship to Spider-Man. Whereas Venom and Morbius, for the most part, acted as if Spider-Man doesn't exist, Madame Web is constantly wink-wink, nudge-nudging the audience about him. It's made worse because the movie includes three characters who become a version of Spider-Man, but relegates them to side characters. Madame Web clearly wants to be a Spider-Man movie, and comes closer than previous SSU installments, but it's still not actually a Spider-Man movie.   Unfortunately, Madame Web proves how difficult it is to tell the story of a Spider-Man-related character without Peter Parker himself, especially when the original worldbuilding is thin and contrived at best. Somehow, Madame Web makes getting superpowers from the bite of a radioactive spider sound more plausible and simplistic. Sure, there's no shortage of ridiculous stories in Marvel Comics, but the backstory for Cassie Web and her powers in Madame Web is so bafflingly nonsensical as to be laughable. Even with Spider-People in the movie, Madame Web can't make up for the glaring hole that is Spider-Man.   The way Clarkson brings Cassie's visions of the future to life is genuinely disorienting, which allows us to feel immersed in her powers. It can be a little frustrating at times, especially for those who already know what Madame Web's powers are, so this effect might work better for those who are unfamiliar. Clarkson also brings this style of point-of-view shots to some of the other Spider-People, especially Ezekiel Sims, which makes the movie look visually dynamic at times. However, there's too much confusing editing and murky darkness in the action scenes to say the cinematography is interesting.   In the end, Madame Web has very little to offer, even for those who tend to enjoy Sony's Marvel movies. Like Venom and Morbius, Madame Web seems oddly like a superhero movie written in the early 2000s — though, in this case, the film actually does take place in that time period.   While Venom still manages to be fun, in large part thanks to Tom Hardy's ability to sell the relationship between Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote, Madame Web is boring, unimaginative and dated, despite being one of very few superhero movies centering on female superheroes. All in all, Madame Web is a superhero movie you can absolutely skip.  Madame Web, which has been struggling to catch up with the box office opening of the Sony flop Morbius, finally passes that mark after three weeks. The sequel to the 1986 classic Labyrinth is facing some major challenges, but it's already guaranteed to beat the original movie in a big way.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," 
	There’s something so demoralizing about lambasting another underwhelming Marvel offering. What is there left to really say about the disappointments and ocean-floor-level expectations created by the mining of this intellectual property? Every year, studio executives dig up minor characters, dress them in a fog of hype and leave moviegoers to debate, defend or discard the finished product.  
Madame Web jumps to New York in 2023 with Cassie racing an ambulance through the city streets while her partner Ben (Adam Scott) tries to keep their emergency patient alive. Their communication is snappy and intimate, a sign, surely, of how long they’ve worked together under these stressful conditions. Madame Web doesn’t concern itself much with the kind of specific background that might lend its characters some depth. The film operates on a need-to-know basis, forcing people to explain themselves through inelegantly breathless exposition.  
	After trying to save a man whose car flipped on the highway, Cassie falls into the East River. The near-death experience activates her clairvoyant powers and kicks off the intrigue of the film. Already misanthropic, Cassie now feels even more alienated from society. She walks through the world with heightened senses and nagging déjà-vu. Clarkson experiments a little here using slick effects and off-kilter angles to underscore Cassie’s changed worldview and state of unease.  
	As Cassie adjusts to the new terms of her life, Ezekiel hunts for three teenage girls in the city. Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) don’t have anything in common until Cassie starts seeing visions of their death. Cassie doesn’t know why Ezekiel is after them, but she knows she must save them. The reluctant socializer becomes a den mother to three girls, who all realize they have been emotionally abandoned by people in their lives. Madame Web doesn’t capitalize on the affecting potential of this realization; most of these discoveries are relegated to corny exposition, and the girls never move beyond stock-character territory. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," It's safe to say that, in the twenty-plus years between when Sony's Madame Web is set and when it is being released, the landscape of female-fronted superhero stories has dramatically changed. In the 2000s — a decade that Madame Web exhibits an unabashed love for, both in aesthetics and in execution — a few ill-received superheroine solo movies were believed to be enough to kill the subgenre altogether. It would take at least another decade for the proverbial glass ceiling to break, and another handful of years to reach our current moment, in which more female superhero stories than ever have been told in movies and TV, albeit amid an onslaught of high standards and cultural misogyny. In a way, it's simultaneously impossible to imagine a movie like Madame Web existing twenty years ago, and incredibly easy to imagine its end product fitting in amid the experimental era of that time. While that sentiment does not absolve Madame Web of its shortcomings, it turns one of the most unexpected titles to come out of the current superhero boom into a fascinating cultural artifact. Both by design and by accident, Madame Web is a modern-day throwback to the superhero adaptations of yesteryear — with all of the good, bad, and baffling things that entails.  Madame Web follows Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson), a paramedic in New York City who unlocks clairvoyant abilities after a brush with death. Cassie's newfound powers not only force her to confront her past, but warn her of a deadly fate for three latchkey teenage girls in her orbit — Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). Together, the four women must protect each other from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who is hunting them for dark and obsessive reasons. From the second it was first reported to be in development in 2019, through its marketing campaign and release almost five years later, Madame Web has been a unique talking point in the superhero movies landscape. As the field of Marvel and DC blockbusters has gotten both literally and conceptually bigger, trying to feign audience fatigue with sprawling crossovers and overdesigned gimmicks, many have been skeptical about devoting an entire solo film to a lesser-known and largely static Spider-Man supporting character. Instead of trying to force Madame Web into an impossible ecosystem, the film dovetails back around to evoking the media, both superheroic and otherwise, of the 2000s. Comparisons will surely be drawn between Madame Web and the standalone and often-disliked Marvel and DC movies of the era, including Daredevil, Elektra, and Catwoman, which sacrificed comic accuracy and plausibility for misplaced spectacle. But that mentality undercuts some of Madame Web's charm, as well as some of the swerves it subconsciously takes in reaching its obvious story beats. A better point of comparison might be the superhero television shows of the same decade, like DC's Smallville and even its short-lived Birds of Prey series, which recontextualized the tights and fights of the comics in a soapy, earnest package. While the exact story of Madame Web absolutely doesn't exist in the comics, with Cassie almost-exclusively portrayed as a tragic elderly woman and the movie's three Spider-Women barely crossing paths, the movie is an admirable distillation of the spirit of the source material. Once Julia, Anya, and Mattie fully enter the story, the movie even has shades of the plucky, teen girl-centered romps of the 2000s (which the industry has largely fallen out of making), adding a youthful exuberance to the movie's immediate action-driven stakes. That isn't to say that Madame Web is without its flaws, particularly with regard to its narrative. The aforementioned obviousness of its story is undeniable, which proves to be both a blessing and a curse in equal measure. Some of those clear-cut story beats are still endearing, using the ubiquitousness of the Spider-Man mythos to earn certain laughs or heartwarming moments. Others give the movie — especially in its first half — a much slower pace than it easily could have. The nature of Cassie's new powers gets both repetitive and perplexing, only really coalescing into a driving force once she is united with her three wards. There are multiple instances where the narrative tension almost skids to a halt, repeating information we already know and dropping a new confusing narrative nugget in the process. As one example, it takes a good chunk of Madame Web for Cassie to even learn that, to quote the most infamous line from the movie's trailer, Sims was researching spiders in the Amazon with her now-deceased mother — something that the audience became aware of in the film's very first sequence. There's a hypothetical version of Madame Web that revels in the process of uncovering that mystery, but instead, it stops and starts the film's drive far too often. Once the third act of Madame Web synthesizes together, it is both the exact finale that suits its list of plot points, and the no-holds-barred culmination of something even more heartfelt and wacky than what we've actually seen. As the titular character, Johnson easily gives Madame Web's most enigmatic performance, delivering acerbic charm in one moment and an unfortunate flatness in the next. Much like her limited role in the comics, Cassie is at her best when she's interacting with those around her, whether that involves bantering with her coworkers or becoming a reluctant guardian to Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Luckily, Madame Web provides just enough of those moments for Cassie to exhibit earnestness and growth, which balance out some of her more awkward developments. Sweeney, Merced, and O'Connor all do right by the complicated comic histories of their respective Spider-Women, capturing their individual exuberances even in a deadly and unprecedented context. Even though Julia, Anya, and Mattie have only sporadically crossed paths in the comics, the rapport between them proves to be effortless, and leads to some of the movie's best sequences. Outside of our four main leads, Adam Scott proves to be the biggest highlight of Madame Web's ensemble, becoming a quietly reliable scene-stealer every time he appears on screen. Rahim, and other supporting players like Zosia Mamet and Emma Roberts, all do the best with what they are given, even if the end result does not prove to be particularly memorable. On a technical level, Madame Web is filled with a lot of highs and lows, but those extremes only add to the movie's overall mystique. The costume design from Ngila Dickson is easily the biggest highlight, delivering some of the most comic-accurate supersuits in recent memory, without being encumbered by a busy or militarized aesthetic that might come from existing in a larger cinematic universe. The production design, led by Ethan Tobman, also works wonders to seamlessly cement the movie within its mid-2000s setting, which is impressive given the amount that is filmed on practical locations. Although some of Madame Web's VFX comes across as overstimulating and underbaked, it never ventures close to uncanny valley. The cinematography from Mauro Fiore and the music from Johan Soderqvist are both unobtrusive, adding to the movie's disorienting quality without leaving much of an impact once audiences leave the theater. While Madame Web might not contain the heart-pumping tension, massive franchise connections, or painfully authentic verisimilitude of many of its modern contemporaries, it makes a convincing argument that an entertaining-enough story can still be found outside of those traits. The charisma of its lead heroines and the specificity of its premise prevent it from being too boring, too goofy, or too irredeemable to ignore. For better or for worse, Madame Web further illustrates that Sony's Spider-Man Universe has potential when not trying to be a modern cinematic universe at all, and instead being a springboard for the most niche genre stories imaginable.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024","  Credit where credit is due, Madame Web kicks off its runtime by giving the people what they want: a mom researching spiders in the Amazon right before she dies. The first scene of this comic book movie centers on the mother of Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb scoping out arachnids in the Amazon with the seemingly trustworthy Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) by her side. However, as these two characters begin to talk, something is immediately obviously wrong. Words are rigidly spit out of the mouths of the actors on-screen rather than delivered with verve. This pair of souls are speaking as if they've never engaged in a conversation before! Director S.J. Clarkson fails to instill any excitement or tangible humanity in their rapport. The stilted line deliveries here are enough to make one wonder if the projectionist has accidentally played a Neil Breen movie by mistake.   Alas, no such luck. This scene merely functions as a warning to the viewer about what the next two hours of Madame Web entail. A slew of performers look as lost Webb’s mom as they navigate a script (penned by Clarkson alongside Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker) that never feels fully comfortable in its skin. Whether it’s trying to be funny, exciting, or intense, Madame Web always comes off as awkward and in dire need of a human touch. Save for offering up an instantly memeable moment where Dakota Johnson says “You did it!” in an inappropriately condescending tone, Madame Web has little to give moviegoers.  Cassandra Webb is a New York City paramedic who starts to show signs of clairvoyance. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she must protect three young women from a mysterious adversary who wants them dead.  The critical flaw that deflates Madame Web is its lack of consistent tension. An urgency to protect these teenagers drives Webb to help a trio of people she initially believes are just strangers. Sims is a powerful man and they need protecting! However, on two different occasions, after this problem is established, Webb nonchalantly leaves the trio behind on their own so she can discover fragments of her backstory. One of those trips even involves our hero traveling outside of the country for a week! It’s hard to buy Sims as a threat if Webb feels comfortable leaving his targets unprotected in the forest for hours at a time.   Worse than a creaky narrative devoid of suspense, though, is how much Madame Web’s writing strains to emulate teenage girls cracking wise with each other or any other kind of positive human emotion. This is a screenplay that speaks in backstory and surface-level comic book references (like Sims always being barefoot). It doesn’t understand how people actually interact with one another.   A scene of Webb attending a BBQ with her pals, for instance, depicts “lively banter” containing all the naturalism of Peter Lorre trying to freestyle rap. This is supposed to be a gathering between friends, but none of the heroes and villains in Madame Web seem cozy with one another. Other lighter moments (like the three teenage leads dancing on a diner table for the approval of some boys) meant to flesh out characters are executed with discouragingly little spirit or believable humanity. Those diner shenanigans, for instance, come off as a rote recreation of teenage rebellion rather than something with real energy or passion (it doesn’t help that the personalities of these three individuals are tediously interchangeable even when they're bending the rules). In terms of ordinary interactions between human beings, only Johnson's genuinely amusing dry wit as she nonchalantly references her mom dying during childbirth at an otherwise chipper baby shower feels human.   Save for that one humorous sequence leaning on Johnson's best assets as an actor, Madame Web's attempts to flesh out its characters suffer from the same silted lines and awkwardly inhuman performances that plagued its prologue. Stan Lee once proclaimed that the creative impetus for Spider-Man in the first place was to put a teenager just like the reader into the world of superhero mayhem. Madame Web runs counter to that ethos with its batch of characters who never come off as authentic. They’re unrecognizably human individuals getting into antics that have no concrete emotional grounding. Good luck getting invested in anything on-screen.   Clarkson’s de facto visual style for Madame Web occasionally leans heavily on crooked camera angles and intentionally jagged editing by Leigh Folsom Boyd to communicate how Webb is now a woman permanently out of time. Her present and future are always colliding, so the images on-screen also overlap in what space in time they occupy. The most visually evocative scene of Madame Web depicts Webb and Sims talking about the trio of teenagers without ever moving their lips while occupying a sort of astral plane. This heightened conversation makes good use of that disorienting fusion of differing periods and personas.   Unfortunately, it’s the only real burst of creativity Madame Web offers. Otherwise, Webb’s superpowers are reflected through editing and camera angles reminiscent of so many other movies where people are aware of what the future entails (namely time-loop films like Palm Springs or Groundhog Day). Meanwhile, Clarkson, Boyd, and cinematographer Mauro Fiore disappointingly fail to lean into visual impulses that evoke the movie’s 2003 setting. Imagine if more of Madame Web’s filmmaking was reminiscent of early 2000s media like the “you wouldn’t steal a car” PSA. Perhaps then this superhero feature would finally have a sense of visual identity to it!   Reinforcing the blah visual aesthetic in Madame Web is the complete lack of colorful superhero costumes save for very brief glimpses into the future in just two scenes of the entire movie. Just eight months after Sony’s own Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse plastered movie theater screens worldwide with vibrant visions of superhero attire, Madame Web now has its leading ladies evading evil in completely ordinary outfits. This is a “grounded” superhero movie, with even the “evil” Spider-Man outfit donned by Ezekiel Sims drained of nearly all its color. Even darker weighty features like Certified Copy and The Northman have more variety in their color palette than this superhero movie blockbuster! Trying to lend “realism” to such an innately heightened character like Madame Web was always going to be a fool’s errand. Going this boring route merely solidifies Madame Web’s total lack of visual imagination.   The actors inhabiting Madame Web have done great work elsewhere, whether it’s Rahim in A Prophet, O'Connor in Selah and the Spades, or Johnson in The Lost Daughter. At their best, these performers have earned a positive reputation as artists for taking bold swings that stick in your mind long after the movies they inhabit finish playing. What a tragedy, then, that these actors have become trapped in Madame Web. The only thing that’s remotely memorable about this project is its most incompetent bits of filmmaking, like the distractingly awkward ADR work and editing surrounding Rahim’s performance leaving him rarely visibly speaking on-screen (think Val Kilmer in The Snowman).   Beyond even those staggeringly amateurish filmmaking flourishes, Madame Web has none of the laughs or thrills that general audiences come to superhero movies for. Much like Morbius from two years ago, it’s a pale imitation of comic book motion pictures from the past. In this case, Web cribs pools of magic water, unresolved parental trauma, teenage superhero antics, and other elements from the last two decades of Marvel adaptations. Going that route merely makes Madame Web feel like a half-hearted rerun, though, rather than automatically rendering it as good as The Avengers or Across the Spider-Verse. Not even immediately delivering that sweet “moms researching spiders in the Amazon before they die” action right away can salvage Madame Web.

"Feb 13, 2024"," In an age where the Marvel Cinematic Universe has categorically lost its luster, it’s tempting to imagine how green the grass is on the other side of the hill. To imagine that someone, somewhere, is doing inventive work with some of America’s most pervasive modern myths — without the heaving strain of an interconnected narrative, a cast of over-it actors, or visual effects teams stretched beyond their breaking point. You won’t find it, however, in the strangely-dubbed “Sony’s Spider-Man Universe” — that casually connected series of antihero films (the Venoms, Morbius) that attempts to cobble together its own Sinister Six from the contractual scraps Disney left Sony after its acquisition of Marvel Studios. And Madame Web, the latest grasp at superhero relevancy in a dying comic book movie landscape, is easily its messiest, most forgettable shrug in that direction. It’s astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022’s Morbius — a misfire of a mad-scientist picture that at least contained a few interesting images and the perverse sight of Matt Smith gnashing his pointy vampire teeth through a chopped-up villain performance — but boy, Madame Web manages it. It’s a passive whisper of a film, one that barely registers its own existence. The only reason someone would even deign to make it is because they’re contractually obligated to maintain a specific character’s intellectual property, not to mention a heaping stake of product placement from Pepsi.  The plot, such as it is, revolves around Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), a thirtysomething Gen-Xer sleepwalking her way through her life as a New York paramedic in 2003. (Important question no one raises: Was she there on 9/11?) Her only friend is Ben (Adam Scott, in a performance so half-hearted I expected him to turn to the camera and say, “Are we having fun yet??”), who excoriates her for being so grumpy and aloof all the time. She can’t even bring herself to look alive for Ben’s sister Mary (Emma Roberts) during their baby shower. (Three guesses as to who the baby might be, and how transparently Cassie’s adventures will tie into the origins of a certain wall-crawler.) This stems, or so we’re told, from Cassie’s dark past: her researcher mother (Kerry Bishé) died in childbirth while researching spiders in the Amazon — you know the meme — and she’s always been resentful of that, despite telling everyone she knew that she unironically had a great time in foster care. All this exposition spills from characters’ mouths so robotically it might as well have been written by ChatGPT — and based on the many shots of post-production-dubbed dialogue that clearly don’t match actors’ mouths, it might have had a hand at a rewrite. “Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom,” Cassie groans to her mother’s spider diary, in one of the film’s only sources of unintentional laughter. But as Cassie soon learns, the spiders may well have been worth it: You see, a bite from a mystical Amazonian spider during her birth may well have given Cassie the ability to peek into the future, a gift which materializes the moment her mother’s vaguely rich, vaguely evil killer Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) starts tracking down a trio of teenagers — nerdy Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), bratty Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and headstrong Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). They don’t know each other, but Sims is convinced via vision that these three will grow up to become Spider-Women who kill him one day. He wants to prevent that from happening, and only Cassie can stop him.  The notion of a female-led suspense thriller in a superhero universe is an enticing one: to its credit, Madame Web eschews a lot of the typical formulas of your caped crusader picture. For one thing, it’s not an action movie in the strictest sense. There aren’t really any superheroes in this — the gag becomes whether a group of mostly-ordinary girls can survive against, basically, Evil Spider-Man, using nothing but their wits and a barely-controlled clairvoyance.  Trouble is, director S.J. Clarkson (a TV director mostly known for episodes of British dramas like EastEnders and Anatomy of a Scandal) and the quartet of screenwriters can’t seem to view the proceedings with any sense of character, fun, or verve. From scene to scene, everything reads like a first draft dramatized and spat out on screen: You won’t find any dialogue that isn’t rote exposition or thunderingly obvious character or plot beats. Clarkson tries to spice up the proceedings with plenty of spiraling camera moves, and a couple of unintentionally funny crash zooms in the beginning, but it all comes across as hokey. It’s so horribly cut together, it’s hard to tell the continuity errors from one of Cassie’s time flashes.  Madame Web can’t even make its central quartet of women work, which is a damn shame, because if it had it might almost be enough to look over the rest of the film’s voluminous faults. Johnson sleepwalks through this thing with all the energy of a celebrity interview, her Cassie doing little to convince her trio of misfit young charges that she should be someone worth trusting or putting their lives in her hands. Her greatest superpower, besides seeing flashes of the future, seems to be crashing vehicles with pinpoint accuracy without getting herself hurt. The girls are obnoxious stereotypes of Gen-Z girlies, made more annoying by the fact they’re supposed to be millennials; this is 2003, after all, and one irritating sequence sees them flee their protector to dance on a diner table to Britney Spears’ hot new song “Toxic.” None of them have discernable personalities, and in fact feel like the same flavor of bratty, lonely, parentless loner copied thrice over. (It’s especially depressing to see Sweeney’s light so dim in this; like Johnson, she looks like she’d rather be anywhere else.) The three girls grow, ostensibly, under Cassie’s care, but the dynamic reads more like an irritated older sister babysitting her teenage charges under duress. Their banter lands with a thud, everyone delivering their lines like it’s community theater.  All of these problems compound as the movie progresses until its third, most ridiculous and rushed act, which fast-tracks a heaping helping of character growth for Cassie in a foreign nation just in time to come back and beat the bad guy. Rinse, repeat, put all the chess pieces in their proper place so they can most resemble their comic book counterparts, don’t bother with any postcredits sequences. The end.  What galls most about Madame Web is how much it fails even in the context of Sony’s previous failures. The Venom movies get by on Tom Hardy’s considerable charm, which does a lot to make up for its ’90s-movie hokiness. Morbius, for all its flaws, at least feels like it has a couple of characters in it, and wants to be its own thing. Madame Web isn’t interested in its title character, or the other Spider-People on either sides of justice that occupy its paper thin world. The product placement is so achingly obvious, a can of Pepsi feels like it has more character development than the person holding it.  Madame Web, sponsored by Pepsi-Cola(tm), feels like a transparent exercise in tertiary brand-building, and that’s because, well, it is. The only reason to defend it is through a misguided girl-power insistence that a superhero movie starring women is immune from criticism on its face. The film and its makers are not interested in anything else besides allowing Sony to at least use the iconography, background cast, and name recognition of Spider-Man, without actually being able to put him on screen (or even say his name). But boy, do they want you to remember Marvel’s friendly neighborhood mascot, and will wink and nudge at you harder than Eric Idle in a Monty Python sketch. The problem is, no one’s laughing this time.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",NEGATIVE

"Feb 13, 2024"," 
As we drift gently through the twilight of the superhero genre, something curious is happening. It seems to be drifting irresistibly closer and closer to the overwrought, ultra-stylized, almost-instantly-dated early-'00s era of the genre. There was a time when comic book fans were relieved to have escaped that phase, handily more comfortable with slick, expensive, deeply interconnected ""cinematic universe"" that Marvel began constructing in 2008. 

Now that said cinematic universes have lost the public's attention, superhero films are becoming cheaper again. The A-list was exhausted some time ago, and now the only characters filmmakers have left to explore ... well, one might need a putty knife to get them unstuck from the sides of the barrel. Audiences are now left with clunky, earnest, and weirdly charming oddities like S.J. Clarkson's ""Madame Web."" 
And make no mistake, ""Madame Web"" is an odd duck. Based on an obscure Spider-Man supporting player, and featuring three of the Marvel universe's Spider-Women — before they gained superpowers and costumes — ""Madame Web"" is a clairvoyance caper more than it is a superheroine movie. More time is spent with the four main characters panicked and on the lam trying to figure out what's going on than with fistfights, explosions, and the usual bland action pabulum that tends to feed the genre. 

For those portions, ""Madame Web"" feels like a slumber party about to break out. Like the perfectly decent ""The Marvels"" from last year, ""Madame Web"" is a testament to the power of young women hanging out, becoming friends, and forming sororal bonds. It's about three teens and their fortune-telling mom looking after each other while the (Spider-)Man tries to keep them down. The future is Spider-Female, and Madame Web knows it.

It's about three teens and their fortune-telling mom looking after each other while the (Spider-)Man tries to keep them down. The future is Spider-Female, and Madame Web knows it. Admittedly, ""Madame Web"" is a messy, messy film. Credited to four screenwriters and three story writers, ""Madame Web"" is a massive, clunky jumble, replete with some strange editing and pacing that makes it feel like the result of a lot of experimental tinkering. Stylistically, it's all over the map, sometimes pushing action/mystery and sometimes settling on scenes of disarming affability. While it takes place in 2003, ""What's Up?"" by 4 Non Blondes and The Cranberries' ""Dreams"" — decade-old songs at that point — feature on the soundtrack. At least there is some authenticity to the scene where the three Spider-Women-To-Be table dance to Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" in a Jersey diner. Kudos to the film's costume designer, too, for recalling the midriff-bearing shirts and low-slung jeans that infected the era. The dated pop music and whirligig tone keep the film murky and shabby. ""Madame Web"" narratively benefits, however, from staying focused on Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) throughout. ""Worldbuilding"" and ""mythology"" are mercifully distant concerns, and the film doesn't get bogged down in snore-worthy conspiracies, tired multiverse interconnectivity, or world-threatening doomsday scenarios.  Cassandra Webb was born under dire circumstances; her mother, nine months pregnant, was studying spiders in the Amazon right before she died. As she was giving birth, she was bitten by a rare and seemingly magical Peruvian spider whose venom can give its victims superpowers. Fast-forward to 2003, and Cassandra is now working as a New York ambulance driver with her deferent and affable best friend Ben (Adam Scott). A near-drowning on the job instigates Cassandra's latent superpowers, and she begins having uncontrolled visions of the immediate future. Her visions bring her into the panicked company of Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced) who are all being hunted by a wicked, black-clad version of Spider-Man.  This Spider-Man is not Peter Parker or Miles Morales, but Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), the man who double-crossed Cassandra's mom in the Amazon back in '73, and who gained his Spider-Powers from the same Peruvian bug that mom was searching for. He now can climb on walls but is afflicted with regular clairvoyant visions of being attacked and killed by the three above teens ... once they've grown up and become superheroes. He now aims to kill them before they have a chance to do that. Cassandra absconds with the girls — it's a very playful kidnapping — and they begin investigating. Throughout the whimsical kidnapping, the girls and Cassandra bond over their mutual orphanhood; each one of them has been neglected or forgotten by their parents in some way, and they are eager to form an ersatz family, even if it was achieved through sketchy, criminal, almost Coen Bros.-like means. Cassandra becomes their default matron, protecting them out of a natural sense of obligation. Motherhood needn't be baby showers and domesticity (as represented by a very pregnant friend played by Emma Roberts). Sometimes it can be a conscious effort to usher young women into their rightful place on top of the superhero world. One can't help but see a metaphor for insecure masculinity — the kind that has too often infected superhero fandom — at play with the Sims character. A male Spider-Man saw that he was to be replaced by a new generation of young women and targeted three teenagers to prevent it. Surely he is a stand-in for an aging fanboy, wholly uncomfortable with diversification in the genre. He senses his demise is on the horizon and lashes out at young women on the rise.  I can't imagine ""Madame Web"" not being a massive disappointment to many superhero fans, as I hesitate to describe it as a superhero film. It's more like a pre-origin story, a tale of who various Spider-Women were before they got their powers. Audiences are treated to several flashes-forward to the time when they'll be in costume, but ""Madame Web"" isn't about how they got their powers or stitched together their outfits. It's merely about the assurance that they will indeed be heroes someday. As such, there's no ""Big Fight"" at the film's climax. There's no prolonged scene of equally matched heroes wailing on each other using carefully choreographed martial arts. Indeed, some of the action sequences have more in common with ""Final Destination"" than they do ""Spider-Man."" There aren't even that many action sequences. This is a fantasy noir about psychics and sisterhood that gently and peculiarly riffs on Spider-Man lore, attempting to see how much can be stripped away from all-too-familiar tropes. One can look at ""Madame Web"" and witness the entire genre dissipating. Trust me, this is a good thing.  Lacking superhero grandiosity, however, all but assures we'll never see sequels or follow-ups where these characters grow into the heroines we know they'll be. ""Madame Web"" does not provide a crowd-pleasing bombast. This is a pity, as this odd duck makes for a fascinating watch. This may be one of the final films of the superhero renaissance. Enjoy it before it topples over entirely. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024"," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe movies have always felt less like movies and more like studio mandates — a sweaty, desperate attempt to milk as much cash off its precious webslinger as possible while he was on loan to Marvel Studios. It was only by a miracle of casting that the Venom movies managed to take off, thanks to Tom Hardy’s gonzo dual performances as Eddie Brock and his co-dependent symbiote, as well as his keen understanding of camp. Sony has been trying to replicate that bizarre chemistry ever since, but it turns out that you can’t synthesize camp in a lab. Not even a meme could save Morbius from being an utterly dull drag. And not even Dakota Johnson’s truly uninspired line delivery could turn Madame Web into anything more than a feature film version of a studio note. Madame Web isn’t so much a movie as it is the pretense of one — a collection of Easter eggs and prequel nonsense strung together by half-assed ADR and dialogue that feels like it was drummed up in Screenwriting 101. But the most alarming thing about Madame Web is that it is a movie that never really gets started. Instead, it’s just one long prelude to the actual story, like being trapped in one of Cassie Webb’s time-looping visions with no escape. Madame Web doesn’t begin with Cassie Webb but her mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), as she’s, yes, researching spiders in the Amazon right before she dies at the hands of Ezekiel Sims (a sadly underutilized Tahar Rahim, the movie’s greatest ADR victim). Sims steals the rare spider that Constance discovered in hopes that it will grant him the superhuman abilities the mythic Spider People of Peru are rumored to have — the same Spider People who recover the heavily pregnant Constance and help her give birth to Cassie. Thirty years later, it’s 2003, and Cassie is a socially awkward EMT whose only friend is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), the latter of whom is the source of some of the movie’s most excruciatingly dumb Spider-Man callbacks and references. When a rescue goes wrong, Cassie dies for a few minutes before being resuscitated by Ben. That’s when she starts to receive visions of the future that put her on a collision course with Ezekiel, who has been receiving visions of his death at the hands of three Spider-Women, and is dead set on killing them before they can kill him. Cassie solving the mystery of why her mom was in the Amazon researching spiders right before she died. (A line that is not in the actual movie.) Morbius co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless inflict the same brand of atrocious dialogue and baffling plotting on Madame Web, but with co-writers Claire Parker and director S.J. Clarkson contributing to the script, the film is nigh on incomprehensible. Characters spout exposition with all the conviction of someone being held at gunpoint — though who can blame them when each line of dialogue feels like a cliché dreamed up by AI? This is a movie that requires its cast to say with straight faces “Us strays need to stick together” or “Your thread didn’t start when you were born” — the kind of cheesy dialogue that you’d find in a direct-to-video movie from, well, 2003. The viral line from the trailer, “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,” doesn’t actually appear in the film, but every other line of dialogue has the same level of frantic exposition and clunky awkwardness. Clarkson, who makes her feature directorial debut with Madame Web after a successful TV career, takes the least responsibility for this film’s sins, though she’s not entirely blameless. While there are some genuinely interesting choices in how Cassie experiences her visions of the future — taking the film into full dream logic at some points — Madame Web quickly devolves into CGI goop. The chaotic editing cuts any semblance of a watchable movie to shreds, as if imitating the rhythms of a Michael Bay movie will hide the movie’s greatest weaknesses. (At least Bay has some kind of anarchic vision behind his choices. Here, the fast cuts and many, many canted angles only serve to muddy up each scene.) It’s such a baffling mess that even a talented cast can’t save Madame Web from itself. Johnson has proved her acting acumen with filmmakers like Luca Guadagnino, but she’s appallingly miscast in this role (though I struggle to think of someone who could salvage it), while Rahim, excellent in A Prophet and The Mauritanian, is cartoonishly bad. The three teens/future Spider-Woman, Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced, are given little to do other than act bratty and show off their washboard abs. Any sense of familial connection, or even chemistry, between them and Cassie is non-existent. You’ve got to hand it to Sony. The studio is so determined to revive the specific kind of superhero B-movie you’d find buried in the Walmart dollar bin that it simply sets its latest film in 2003 (complete with laughably on-the-nose 2003 needle drops and shoehorned pop culture references about how Cassie really wants to go home to “watch Idol”). But Madame Web doesn’t have the same early aughts go-for-broke charm as Venom does, nor does it have the self-awareness to even lampshade its particular brand of corniness. Madame Web is just about the worst movie you’d find at the bottom of that Walmart dollar bin — doomed to be forgotten as soon as it’s seen.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Sony’s animated Spider-Verse films have been amazing, which is more than can be said about the studio’s stabs at creating their own MCU-adjacent live-action movie series centered around Spider-Man. That process got off to a goofy start with Venom and its sequel before running aground with 2022’s Morbius, and it now fully crashes and burns with Madame Web, a torturous saga that haplessly spins about in circles trying to fashion a competent tone or coherent action sequence. No matter its heroine’s clairvoyant super-powers, it’s a debacle incapable of seeing—and thus avoiding—its every subsequent misstep. Madame Web (Feb. 14, in theaters) begins in the Peruvian Amazon circa 1973, with Constance (Kerry Bishé) searching for a rare spider that possesses potentially magical healing powers (thanks to its peptides!). Upon finding what she’s looking for, Constance is promptly betrayed by her bodyguard Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who wants the spider and its abilities for himself. Left for dead, Constance is rescued by the jungle’s legendary spider-people, who spirit her back to their spider cave, put her in a pool and compel their pet spiders to bite her—none of which protects her from death but does allow her unborn baby to live. This is as absurd as it reads, and director S.J. Clarkson stages it with all the grace of a runaway train, her snap zooms, whiplash cinematography, canted angles, and overly theatrical lighting turning this prologue embarrassingly comical. Thirty years later in New York City, Constance’s now-grown daughter Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson)—yes, that’s her last name, and no, no one makes a joke about it—is an EMT working alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott), aka the future uncle of original Spider-Man Peter Parker, whose name is never uttered but whose birth (courtesy of Emma Roberts’ expectant Mary Parker) tangentially factors into these helter-skelter proceedings. Cassandra is a fearless lifesaver if far from a people person, as she demonstrates when she rudely accepts a thank-you gift from a young boy whose loved one Cassandra has brought to the hospital. As clumsily embodied by Johnson, Cassandra is dedicated to her altruistic profession and also something of a loner jerk—a contrast that never meshes and isn’t helped by the headliner either under–or over-acting every moment in the film, thereby transforming it into a showcase of unintentionally hilarious expressions and utterances. Written by Clarkson, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless and Claire Parker, Madame Web is full of bad dialogue delivered badly by talented men and women stuck with crummy material and equally lousy stewardship, and no one is more poorly served than Rahim. The film’s villain, Ezekiel is imbued with spectacular speed and strength (and the capacity to dispense poison via his touch), as well as plagued by nightly visions of his death at the hands of three mysterious spider-enhanced women. Consequently, he’s consumed with staving off his forthcoming demise by locating and assassinating these individuals. At outset, that mission motivates him to seduce and murder an NSA agent (Jill Hennessy) so he can steal her techno-surveillance systems and hunt for his would-be killers. His ensuing efforts are marked by one nonsensical detail after another, beginning with his skill at fashioning picture-perfect drawings of his homicidal dream trio for his featureless henchwoman Amaria (Zosia Mamet). Rahim is a native French speaker but that’s no excuse for the awfulness of his largely ADR’d line readings, which sound as if they’ve been filtered through an AI voice program. Madame Web then draws further attention to this nouveau-spaghetti Western aesthetic device by hiding Rahim’s mouth in darkness in almost every shot in which he’s not wearing his costume—which is an obvious and pedestrian riff on Spider-Man’s signature suit. So similar are these two outfits that coincidence couldn’t possibly explain it, and yet Clarkson’s film doesn’t proffer a different explanation, ostensibly because it figures that all moviegoers will naturally assume that, were one to gain extrasensory arachnid abilities, this would be the sole design choice for a disguise. While rescuing a man from a car on a bridge, Cassandra suffers an accident that triggers latent psychic powers that she soon uses to save Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) from Ezekiel on a Metro North train whose plush interior is arguably the most fanciful facet in this unreal film. Defined solely by their cartoony appearances and demeanors, Julia is the gawky white nerd, Mattie is the brash Black skateboarder, and Anya is the non-descript undocumented Latina, and all of them are bonded by their (literal or figurative) lack of parents. Luckily, in Cassandra they get a surrogate mother, although before they can accept her as a caregiver, they have to engage in lots of petulant back-and-forths that would make your average ’90s TV teen drama cringe. Of the three, Sweeney fares worst, asked to awkwardly squirm and stutter while dressed like a coquettish schoolgirl, and it’s easy to imagine that had her star been as bright when production began (in 2022) as it is now, she’d have swiftly passed on the thankless part. Madame Web’s story involves Cassandra earning the trust of her charges and, in doing so, keeping them safe from Ezekiel, whose failure to kill three average teenagers quickly becomes a referendum on his third-rate villainy. Clarkson’s compositions are clunky, her musical cues are inelegant, and her period-specific flourishes (a Beyonce album billboard, a reference to American Idol) strained and unnecessary, since there’s no reason to call attention to 2003 except to underline that this is approximately two decades before the arrival of everyone’s favorite NYC wall-crawler. Cassandra’s eventual trip to Peru to find her spider-benefactors is ridiculous, as is the means by which she ultimately harnesses and wields her fortune-telling gifts during a finale that doesn’t grasp how dynamite works and drearily shouts out to the conclusion of Sam Raimi’s 2002 Spider-Man. In the end, everything hinges on Julia, Mattie and Anya demonstrating that they were paying attention when Cassandra taught them how to properly perform CPR. On the basis of Madame Web, however, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe is now completely lifeless—and in no need of resuscitation.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 13, 2024"," Maybe the current ennui towards superhero movies won’t be ending anytime soon, and certainly, the latest Spider-tangential film from Sony, Madame Web, isn’t likely to be the movie that saves the superhero “genre,” although you do have to give it a little bit of credit for trying to do a few things that are semi-daring and different. Even lifelong Spider-Man fans (such as myself) may not be that knowledgeable about Madame Web’s tangential place in the Spider-verse, though thankfully, the multiverse doesn’t play a factor in this movie, and any connections to anything else related to Spider-Man are relegated to the subtlest of Easter eggs. In other words, Madame Web is one of those rare superhero movies you can watch without ever having seen another movie. In this case, Dakota Johnson plays NYC paramedic Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, but before we meet her, we go back in time to 1973 with a prologue set in Peru, as her explorer mother (Kerry Bishé) is seeking a rare spider whose venom might provide healing qualities. It’s there when she first encounters Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim from Un Prophet), who wants the spider for his own nefarious purposes, and three decades later, he starts plaguing Cassie and a trio of young women – Julia, played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced‘s Anya, and Celeste O’Connor as Mattie – who Ezekiel believes will kill him. By then, Cassie has gained precognitive abilities that allow her to see Ezekiel’s plans ahead of time. Prolific television director SJ Clarkson (Jessica Jones, The Defenders) makes her move to theatrical with this origin story of a character that will be new to many, and may rely heavily on whether one is a fan of Johnson or some of the other cast. Those who aren’t fans may find that her normally flat delivery do little to help a screenplay that constantly falls to pacing problems. The other actors, particularly Sweeney, have all done better work, as well. It’s hard to fully accept Madame Web as some sort of groundbreaking female-centric superhero movie, since we’ve had quite a few of them before, for better or worse. Furthermore, the marketing for the film seems to suggest that it’s about gathering a group of young female superheroes, ala Birds of Prey, but that’s a bit misleading, since we only really see the three young women as their heroic alter-egos in Ezekiel’s visions and at the very end. There is action for sure, but otherwise, Madame Web is essentially a “Final Destination” movie where Cassie sees something that’s going to happen, then does whatever she can to stop it. It’s not an original premise by any means, but it’s one that’s also hurt by a screenplay fulled of cheesy dialogue with a pace that keeps it from ever getting too exciting. Even so, the movie has a good sense of humor, much of it conveyed by O’Connor’s Mattie, but also, with Adam Scott as Cassie’s paramedic co-worker, Ben, and that often makes up for what feels like quite a standard good-vs-evil origin story that never quite delivers. As far as Clarkson’s crafts team, Production Designer Ethan Tobman does a fine job recreating 2003 New York City (presumably without filming in the city), and the film benefits greatly from Clarkson having Avatar’s Oscar-winning DP Mauro Fiore by her side. Even with those two collaborators, the film never looks that spectacular or unique as its own thing. The film’s biggest problem may be that critics are going to be even tougher on Madame Web than they would be on any normal Marvel or superhero movie, and one wonders whether any movie can survive at the box office with critics seemingly on a warpath these days. (Saying that “the critics are revolting” is just too easy a joke.) Madame Web should benefit from being more female-centric, but it has plenty of other competition for women moviegoers, and who knows if guys will even bother to give it a look? It’s certainly a conundrum that must have puzzled those deciding on a production budget. Maybe saying Madame Web is better than Morbius and the two Venom movies is akin to a back-handed compliment, but it really does offer something quite different from other Marvel and Spider-Man movies, and the last act is pretty terrific as things do start coming together after far too much set-up time. Maybe some will question whether Sony needed to make a Madame Web movie at all, but in a business where big swings are sometimes necessary to jar moviegoers out of their doldrums, Madame Web does its best to not be another Catwoman.
