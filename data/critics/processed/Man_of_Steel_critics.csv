"Sep 20, 2023"," As you may or may not remember from my review of Superman Returns, I have never really had a strong connection with either Superman as a character or in any sort of cinematic experience. Obviously I’ve seen that film, and I’ve definitely seen the original Superman film at some point, maybe I’ve seen parts of the second movie, but I’ve just never had enough interest in the character to seek out all cinematic versions of him. If that wasn’t reason enough to have doubts about Man of Steel, the fact that the movie was directed by Zack “The Hack” Snyder didn’t get me super excited about seeing it either. Even though Snyder does have an interesting visual style, all of his films lack depth of character and story. Even though I had my doubts about this film being any good, I was actually quite intrigued by how Snyder would take a character that I had no connection with to see how he’d make Superman look “cool”, and from some reviews I had read, Snyder seemed to make a pretty good movie. Although the more good reviews came out, the more negative ones came out, so I was totally willing to let this movie either completely blow me away or be a steaming pile of shit. Ultimately the film ended up not really making me feel much of anything, with a slight edge being given to the “pile of shit” end of the spectrum. With the planet of Krypton being destroyed, scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) puts his baby into a spaceship and sends him out to a distant planet. Decades later, we see a man working on a ship fishing for crab jumping onto a burning oil drilling rig and saving everyone on it, despite it being on fire. That man, as you could expect, was Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), despite the fact that he doesn’t tell anyone his real name and quickly gets out of town after the rescue. Clark is a drifter, going from one job to the next and never revealing his identity to anyone. Clark is able to get involved with the mysterious discovery of a ship that’s been discovered frozen in the arctic that is from his home planet, and a hologram of his father explains who Clark is (his real name is Kal-El), where he comes from, and information about his people. This information is also seen by a reporter who has sneaked onto the ship, Lois Lane (Amy Adams), but Clark seems to trust her, despite then abandoning her and keeping his distance. While Lois tries to track down the origins of the mystery man, everyone on Earth is sent a mysterious message from former Kryptonian warrior General Zod (Michael Shannon) about how they need to turn in Kal-El or their planet will be destroyed. Even after Kal-El willingly turns himself in, Zod knows that Earth must be destroyed if there’s any chance to keep the Kryptonian species alive. Kal-El, a.k.a. Clark Kent, a.k.a. Superman doesn’t really agree with this and the punching commences! After the punching is over, the movie ends. Yeah, I’d say that about covers it. Speaking strictly from the plot, the movie follows more of a science fiction tone with the fact that Superman is an alien and the general public reacts to him as such. In that respect, it’s definitely a much more interesting origin story than most other comic book/superhero movies currently being made. I didn’t really mention the flashbacks that were shown to help give you a better sense of who the character of Clark was and his upbringing on a small farm in Kansas with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane acting as his parents. Well, those actors play the roles of the parents, it’s not like Clark Kent’s dad was actually Kevin Costner. Anyways, Clark parents want Clark to be safe so they emphasize how important it is that he refrains from using any of his superpowers, even if it means other people could get hurt from his inaction. I really, really liked the tone of some of the opening sequences where Clark has chosen a life of isolation so that way he can rescue people as necessary without bringing unwanted attention to his personal life or anyone Clark Kent might hold close to him. I also really enjoyed the character of Zod, as he wasn’t necessarily a figure of anger and vengeance, but merely as a character who was destined to do one thing and one thing only. In fact, some of the mythology of children who grew up on Krypton was that they were all biologically designed to fulfill one destiny, and in Zod’s case, it was to be a warrior. The ONLY thing he cared about was the survival of Kryptonians and he didn’t care what planet or species slowed him down. When it got towards the end and Zod’s plans were ruined by Superman, it was only then that he acted out of rage, and when he did, who better to have pulled that off than Michael Shannon? The character of the drifter and Zod’s character were both really strong, and the tone of the character who is a product of two worlds but feels alone in both were things I really enjoyed, but for as much as I enjoyed those aspects, they things I didn’t enjoy felt all the more terrible. I mentioned how I can generally enjoy Snyder’s films at an aesthetic level, but this movie looked terrible. I get it Zack, you can reduce the color saturation to get a “gritty” effect, but it’s become such a cliché with all of your films and it’s lost its appeal. There were sequences that were so washed out that it felt like I was watching something in black and white. I understand the departure from the more bright, colorful Superman films, but everything felt so unnatrually colored that it brought more attention to how fake everything looked. Superman and Zod are practically gods on Earth, so I appreciate the attempts made at showing the mass amounts of carnage and destruction that would result in the two colliding. When these two finally duke it out, everything looks so bad that I felt like I was watching one of the Transformers films or The Matrix Revolutions. OH MY GOD IT WAS SO BORING TO WATCH. In the climax of The Avengers, you have just as much carnage and collateral damage happening, but you see the active attempt to clear out the city so these people could stay safe, and every time you see a building get destroyed, its clear of people who were presumably evacuated. Not so much the case with Man of Steel, as you’re constantly seeing people running around the city, most likely dying by the thousands as Metropolis crumbles around them. Speaking of fighting, the opening sequence shows Jor-El and Zod going toe-to-toe with one another, and if Jor-El wasn’t designed to be a warrior, how did he get to be so good at kicking the shit out of Zod? Also, why was the scene where Jor-El opened up a closet and basically told Kal-El “Hey put this Superman suit on because I told you to,” so lame? Why didn’t Kal-El mind that a random lady just saw him learn his true identity after spending so much of his life avoiding the public’s attention? Hopefully without spoiling anything, why are we supposed to feel anything for Superman and how difficult it is for him to handle Zod without any prior information as to why it’s so difficult for him? Unfortunately, there are so many questions like that about simple things where, similar to Superman Returns, get you really frustrated at the good ideas and concepts that were presented, only to have them abandoned.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023"," The DC Extended Universe is nearing its end as filmmaker James Gunn takes over DC, and it’s time to look back on the series that started with 2013’s Man of Steel. There were great moments like the arrival of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman and terrible ones like the mangled version of Justice League that fans got in 2017. Ahead of this weekend’s The Flash, let’s take a look back at most all the DCEU movies that have come out within the past decade (with the exception of March’s Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, which we turned off after less than 10 minutes because life is simply too short). The film abandoned the gravitas that Snyder brought to the series in exchange for a watered-down version of what Whedon did in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with The Avengers. The film just couldn’t really do much to keep your attention past its paper-thin plot, and Johnson’s clunky performance as Black Adam doesn’t help anything. It’s a shame this film seems to already just be a relic of the past, as it doesn’t look like Johnson will be reprising the role anytime soon. Snyder’s weakest DCEU film was by far Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, an overwrought attempt to shoehorn Ben Affleck’s Batman into the Superman story Snyder started with Man of Steel. The film just never ties together its grim tone with its convoluted plot, a lot of the sweeping emotion of Man of Steel replaced with a grittier underbelly that never does anyone any favors. The film’s reputation is worse than its actual quality, but it’s still not good enough to hold a candle to what James Gunn did with the characters in 2021. It was a ton of fun to catch Zachary Levi’s irreverent take on Shazam, imagined here as a teenager who gets zapped into a superhero by a wizard’s spell. The film has more in common with movies like Big and 13 Going on 30 than it does some of the other films on this list, which is a good thing. The film’s sequel bombing at the box office doesn’t bode well for the future of the character, but the original did plenty to justify giving this character another spin. Birds of Prey gave Margot Robbie a proper vessel for her hilarious take on Harley Quinn, and the film was a joyous romp through the seedier corners of the DCEU. The film struggled to maintain relevance as it came out just a month before the COVID-19 pandemic started. However, it’s worth revisiting as a woman-driven tale of antiheroes with plenty of personality and style to spare. While the sequel to Wonder Woman wound up being one of the most divisive films on this list, it was a fun throwback to some of the sillier DC films of the 90s and still had much more going for it than a lot of titles on this list. Pedro Pascal was a great villain, one that embodied the unfiltered greed of the 80s. This one came out during the pandemic’s first year, but it’s worth another look if you had mixed feelings about it when you saw it at home. While the film owed a lot to the globetrotting spectacles that inspired it, filmmaker Patty Jenkins still gave the project a needed gravity to really underscore why it was such a historic moment in the genre. While this one isn’t quite as strong as Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy movies with Marvel, it’s still pretty great as a darker journey into Gunn’s love of the ragtag families that come from unwitting mashups. Man of Steel was Snyder’s triumphant debut with Superman, and it’s still a thrilling example of why Clark Kent can be an engaging lead for one of these movies despite the speculation for the opposite. Henry Cavill was a great Supes, even if it’s not likely he’ll ever be back as the role is recast in Gunn’s 2025 imagining. Michael Shannon’s General Zod also might be the DCEU’s best villain. After a lengthy internet campaign, DCEU fans got their wish to see Snyder’s original vision for Justice League. It’s unbelievably better than the 2017, and Snyder’s best movie since 2009’s Watchmen. Even as an HBO Max exclusive, the film was a bombastic epic and the kind of startling vision that can only come from a visionary filmmaker like Snyder. While it wasn’t a given that Jason Momoa’s take on the sea’s mightiest hero would go as well as it did, Wan really leaned on his horror roots to deliver something that was tremendously entertaining and full of thrill. Momoa is just delightful in the movie, and the film’s visual style is the most interesting in a DCEU film by a mile. It’s one of the best superhero films of the 2010s, and its sequel has a lot to live up to this winter.",POSITIVE
"Jan 15, 2023"," Batman Begins met with mixed response too. It took a sequel to set that right. Perhaps it is Nolan's way of treating a superhero origin story. Yes, I definitely missed Reeve's one liners (especially the part where he says 'bad vibrations') but we must understand the character from 1978 had found his sense of belonging on Earth from the start. Cavill's version of Superman had a backing of alien nature and initial isolation. And that forms the crux of this origin story. Having said that, I think the audience needs to place a bit more faith in Snyder & Nolan.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 2, 2022"," Necessary though it may be to reinvent Superman’s cinematic mythos for a new generation, Man of Steel contains no joy, even if it incorporates much-needed grit and gravitas into the comic book icon. Director Zack Snyder, the visualist behind SuckerPunch and Watchmen, is more interested in perpetuating visual mayhem than strong storytelling or building three-dimensional characters. Snyder relies on the audience’s inbuilt knowledge of Superman so he can focus his energies on expensive special FX and surface details, resulting in characters that feel underdeveloped and, therefore, make almost no impression. Produced by The Dark Knight Trilogy helmer Christopher Nolan and penned by Batman Begins scribe David S. Goyer, this latest attempt by Warner Bros. to rejuvenate Superman’s screen legacy arrives with few pleasures and several bothersome qualities, and never achieves the degree of pure delight or awe otherwise associated with or expected from the hero. Much like Sony’s comparable reboot The Amazing Spider-Man, the film is watchable but without delights, though it will inevitably launch a profitable new franchise. Now is a great time for superhero films, with filmmakers like Nolan and Joss Whedon deepening classic characters as they spearhead a movement toward grand motion picture filmmaking. And no hero is more instantly identifiable, more commonly associated with epic spectacles, and more pointedly all-American than Superman. And since Richard Donner’s 1978 version starring Christopher Reeve is still a gold standard for Superman on film, and Bryan Singer’s clumsy reboot Superman Returns failed miserably in 2006, the expectations for a new Superman film series “grandfathered” by Nolan couldn’t be higher.  Following Nolan’s outstanding Batman films, Man of Steel moves away from the bright primary colors of the original comic created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster and into deeper colors to reflect the film’s more pensive tone (just look at the new Superman’s getup: a burgundy red cape and an almost navy blue body suit). Played by chiseled British actor Henry Cavill, Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent are seemingly devoid of personality. Goyer’s script may have eliminated the silly standard where Lois Lane somehow never recognizes that her Daily Planet co-worker also happens to be Superman, but all forms of humor or energy have also been removed in the process of elevating the hero into a brooding figure. One, maybe two forgettable comic relief moments bring levity to this otherwise gloomy experience. Snyder and company start from scratch by retelling Superman’s origin story, again. Superhero movies have grown far too dependent on origin stories, so much so that today’s audiences should never expect their favorite franchise to get beyond a successful trilogy with the same performers who launched it (take Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man or The Dark Knight films, for example). Nolan virtually pioneered the reinvention concept, and thus far, he has yet to be outdone. As you might guess, Man of Steel opens on planet Krypton with a lengthy prologue, beginning with the birth of Kal-El, the first naturally conceived Kryptonian born in their Gattaca-like civilization in several hundred years. His father Jor-El (Russell Crowe), a top scientist, predicts the planet’s demise to the council of leaders who have expended all the planet’s resources and refuse to break tradition to save themselves. To violently force a change, the maniacal General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts to overthrow the council and finds he and his minions damned to the “Phantom Zone”—a penalty that exists more as a name than a place we actually see; only our knowledge of comic lore and Donner’s Superman II explains what the Phantom Zone is. Meanwhile, Jor-El sends his son to safety on our distant blue ball, and Zod vows revenge. Cut to Cavill’s bearded Clark Kent around age thirty, having drifted for years from place to place, unable to fit in anywhere and ever careful to hide his super-abilities. As he wanders, in flashback, he remembers moments from his picturesque childhood in Smallville, Kansas, where his parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) attempt to imbue their powerful alien son with an appreciation for the fear and frailty in humans and the vastness of his powers. His Earth-father suggests he should never reveal himself, as humanity remains unprepared. Young Clark also struggles with adapting to his developing powers; one scene in grammar school finds Clark coping with his X-ray vision and heightened senses, feeling frightened and alienated when he realizes he’s different from the other kids. Goyer’s script attempts to instill Clark with the humanity imparted to him by his father, but the film never packs the emotional wallop needed to truly bond us to the protagonist on an emotional level. Our reverence of Superman is superficial, based solely on how well Cavill wears the regal suit. And he wears it with dignity, to be sure. Unfortunately, he doesn’t do much beyond stand there looking almost ceremonial. Later, CGI takes care of his fast-paced battles. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane in a mildly plucky performance; it’s a superb piece of casting wasted on an underwritten character. Lois slowly gathers eyewitness accounts of a mysterious superpowered man for her news piece, which postulates that an alien is hiding out somewhere on Earth. Just as her story breaks online, much to the chagrin of her wooden boss Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), an alien spacecraft appears in orbit around our planet with an ultimatum issued by its exposition-obsessed commander, General Zod: hand over the one known as Kal-El, or your planet will be demolished. It’s a ploy, however—the elitist Zod wants to eliminate the pure-blooded heathen in an act of intergalactic racism and, in the process, find the film’s mysterious McGuffin, the Codex, a crusty, inexplicable skull whose function is ambiguous, to say the least. With Zod’s arrival, Superman better understands his origins, but he’s also faced with the reality that he’s neither wholly Kryptonian nor Earthling when Zod reveals his plans to colonize Earth through genocide. To stop him, our hero teams with the U.S. armed forces to create a wormhole—or something like that—while Lois joins in the fight, blasting aliens with a laser gun and acting more like a heroic FBI agent than an always-needs-to-be-rescued reporter. While the battles for Smallville, Metropolis, and humanity unfold in a shaky handheld style, the screen story allows for almost no development of the players involved. We know these characters—they’re ingrained in our pop-culture awareness—but the film doesn’t bother redefining them for the sake of our emotional involvement. Instead, everything’s assumed as the plot muddles through predictable and unnecessary situations. Surprising is the amount of time spent on dull Daily Planet intern Jenny (Rebecca Buller, playing a character meant to replace ginger-haired photographer Jimmy Olsen), who’s caught under rubble when Metropolis buildings collapse in Zod’s 9/11-reminiscent attack, whereas the romance between Lois and Clark garners almost zero screentime. It’s shocking that such a crucial element of the Superman story is left barely developed, making their eventual kiss strangely unmotivated. Never do we witness or believe that Lois and Clark have any romantic chemistry, which is necessary for these characters to feel more than one or two-dimensional. This can hardly be blamed on Cavill or Adams; it’s really Goyer’s script that fails to breathe life into the roles. Synder has never been much for in-depth characters, so it comes as no surprise that he seems to be asleep in the director’s chair during those dramatic, pesky non-action scenes. Conversely, he was evidently over-stimulated during the long, long action sequences where Superman engages Zod’s crew with blurred, lightning-fast motions, the scenes choppily edited by David Brenner and assembled with little shot-to-shot logic. Case in point: Late in the film, gravity drills threaten to change Earth’s atmosphere into a Kryptonian one, which makes Superman ill (a point made clear by Zod’s own German-accented mad scientist). Weakened, he somehow defeats the drill’s random mechanical arms in a flurry of haphazard images. And then, a moment after the hero realizes he’s vulnerable, he’s suddenly able to overcome his mechanical opponent, despite his weakened state, without reason or explanation. Sequences such as this are memorable only for how little sense they make. The director would rather concentrate on the visceral nature of the battles, such as Superman and Zod when they devastate countless buildings in Metropolis as they duke it out (no doubt the body count was high as several buildings topple over during the fight, but there’s no mention of the imaginable death toll in the aftermath). Perhaps it’s best not to complain—at least Snyder has chosen not to repeat his speed-up-and-slow-down visual effect, established on his debut, the remake Dawn of the Dead, and cemented in 300. Through the action, Hans Zimmer’s music is a far cry from the 1978 John Williams score, relying much on electronic sounds over an authentic booming orchestra. As suggested with the remarks above about Cavill and Adams, the cast of Man of Steel is a well-chosen lot working from an ineffectual script. Actors like Fishburne and Crowe serve their purpose by simply standing there and looking their part, while Shannon lends his crazy eyes to give Zod an unhinged quality. Still, there’s not much more to the villain than his madness, whereas Shannon usually excels at bringing layers to his complex, often mentally deranged characters (see Take Shelter or My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?). Giving the best performances are Costner and Lane in their down-to-earth, homegrown humanism; everyone else seems overstated or too understated by comparison. But as mentioned, these are problems with the script and overall vision of the picture, and not necessarily the result of poor performances. Onscreen almost as much as the supporting actors are incessant and obvious product placements: IHOP, Nokia, and Sears make distracting appearances—but then so does a LexCorp tanker, suggesting Superman’s unseen arch-nemesis Lex Luthor may have a role in an inevitable future sequel.",POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2022"," Perhaps no 2013 movie has been more hyped or more scrutinized prior to its release than “Man of Steel”. Maybe it’s the talent that’s been assembled both in front of and behind the camera. Maybe it’s the heartfelt desire of fanboys like me for a good quality Superman movie during this current age of superhero cinema. Whatever it is, “Man of Steel” seems destined to disappoint on some levels for some. Well it’s finally arrived and for me it didn’t disappoint even though its a film that I needed to digest first. This is certainly a different Superman movie than any of the others that we’ve seen which means it will definitely have to dodge its share of criticisms. Some will surely have issues with the different tone of this film and others will struggle with the creative liberties that do strip the picture of some of the things that the other Superman movies leaned heavily on. But when looked at as a clearly distinct Superman picture I feel it holds up quite strongly on its on. I certainly don’t want to discount the problems others may have with the film, but I think it’s a movie that offers a unique vision laced with fun summer action while also showing a level of respect for the source material. David Goyer and Christopher Nolan put together the story and the directing reigns were handed to Zack Snyder. Their Superman universe starts by placing us into a crumbling planet Krypton. It’s a vision of the planet unlike any we’ve seen before and we get some interesting doses of their society, political structure, and more importantly the danger they’re facing. Due to some ill-advised planetary resourcing, Krypton is on the verge of destruction. Understanding his planet’s fate, Jor-El (wonderfully played by Russell Crowe) and wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) shoot their infant son Kal off the planet destined for Earth. With him is a codex which will ensure the survival of the Kryptonian race. We also meet the megalomaniacal rebel General Zod (Michael Shannon), an old friend of Jor-El’s whose more violent solutions for survival seriously clash with the society. From there the movie jumps ahead 30 Earth years or so. Kal-El (Henry Cavill) now named Clark, is a wanderer who works as everything from a crab fisherman to a truck stop waiter. Along the way he has left behind numerous stories of his superhuman heroism. Now the tale of his arrival on Earth is familiar enough and the film doesn’t waste a lot of time going back over it. As a baby he’s found by Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) and raised on their farm in Kansas. We see glimpses of his childhood through a series of very effect flashbacks. I have to say I loved this approach and each jump back into Clark’s past offered an interesting look at the different struggles and hardships he faced. Costner and Lane both give fabulous performances and inject some real emotion into the story. As you probably guessed Zod and his followers track Kal to Earth and seek him out hoping to regain the codex and restore Krypton in their own genocidal way. It’s here that Clark must either embrace the destiny set before him and protect his new home or watch the human race be destroyed at the hands of his fellow Kryptonians. Through this we get a lot of mulling and conversation about whether or not the human race is ready to accept a super alien species. That’s soon tested after Clark saves the life of the spunky Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who insists on finding out more about her hero. This Lois Lane is quite different than the versions we’ve come to know and this leads to one issue that I know some will have with the film. There’s a wild inversion of events that takes place in “Man of Steel” than definitely effects the relationship between Lois and Clark. For me, their romance has always been a crucial function that makes his whole story work. Because of the chronological tinkering, I found their romance to be lacking. But it isn’t completely ineffective. Adams gives a nice performance. It’s just that her Lois feels so different than others. She’s also much more out of the element that we’re used to seeing her in. Overall it didn’t seriously bother me but it didn’t always feel right. While the Lois character may have raised questions, I had none when it came to Michael Shannon’s Zod. From his first moments on screen he comes across as unstable and menacing. Shannon goes after it and I never doubted him for a second. I also really liked Antje Traue as Faora, Zod’s loyal second in command. She’s dry and super serious and she perfectly compliments Shannon’s performance. In movies like this it’s crucial to have a strong villain and Shannon brings that. Many of my favorite scenes feature him and none are better than when he makes his first appearance on Earth. I’ve mentioned many of the performances but the real question mark for me was Henry Cavill. Could he capture the man of steel in a convincing way? The answer is yes. I liked Cavill here. I do think he’s helped by the screenplay which rarely asks him to do too much. But during the small scenes where he’s needed to exhibit some range he succeeds. This was a big deal because a poor performance from him could have derailed the entire production. Cavill has the look, the physicality, and the commitment to sell the character. There’s no denying that “Man of Steel” sports a much more serious tone and it lacks the lighthearted playfulness of the other movies. This has proven to be a hurdle that some just can’t get over. In many ways I welcome it. “Man of Steel” gives us a much more serious Superman story but it’s not without its share of funny moments. It just chooses to spend its time delving into some things we’ve rarely seen in the other films. I appreciated that and it’s one of the key things that keeps this from feeling exactly like every other Superman movie we’ve been given. And of course you can’t talk about “Man of Steel” without getting into the action sequences and special effects. This is where Zack Snyder’s fingerprints really show up. The film looks fantastic and it features some really fun science fiction. Everything including the space ships, Zod and his crew’s wicked armor and air mask apparatus, the destruction of buildings and vehicles, it all is beautifully crafted and realized by Snyder’s keen stylistic eye. And we see that eye at work a lot in this film. There is a ton of action here but most of it is pulled off to great effect. Snyder shows off his effects with skill except for in the big finale. It’s here that about 5 minutes of crumbling buildings alone could have been left on the cutting room floor and the movie would have been better for it. So how do I summarize all of this? Amid “Man of Steel’s” booming action sequences and sky-high expectations lies a very good Superman reboot that I think shines in its uniqueness. Yes, a few of its directional choices don’t work as well as I would have liked and the final action sequence can be a bit numbing. But this has all the ingredients of being a franchise I can latch onto. I also appreciate that it steered the material away from cartoony and ventured to give us a more stern and grounded story. And I like that it brings the character back from the waste that Bryan Singer left him in. “Man of Steel” gives us someone bound by morals and committed to truth and justice. In other words, “Man of Steel” gives us Superman. All if this led to an experience that I found most satisfying and I’m anxious to see what lies ahead for this franchise. Fair and balanced review. I think it was quite brave in many respects to take some of the liberties it took at time the better for it. Glad you liked it and good to see you picked out zods right hand woman, she was very good and that cavill didn’t get too much to say but got enough across. Nice one Keith! Thanks man. Really pleased with the film. To be honest I teetered back and forth between a 4 and a 4.5. I really enjoyed it that much. Good review Keith. I had a good time with this flick, but I will admit that I left more cold than hot. Still, I look forward to seeing what they can do with the rest of this franchise, aka, the sequels. Terrific post, I’m so happy you enjoyed it as much as I did. I really feel it doesn’t deserve all the flack it’s getting. Sure the balance could have been better, but like you said, it really lays a strong foundation for the future of the franchise. Just gave this a quick skim Keith as I’m not seeing this until tomorrow night, but I’m glad you enjoyed it. Even though a lot of reviews have actually been a bit mixed, I’m really looking forward to checking it out. Yep, a lot of mixed reviews out there. Many just can’t seem to get onboard with this films more serious tone. Personally I loved that they did something different. I do wish a few things had been done a little better but I still think this is a really good film. I’m glad you liked it. I loved it. I haven’t looked at many opinions on the movie yet, but whoever knocks it for being different than other Superman movies isn’t making valid criticism, IMO. The one thing I’ll say about the beginning of the movie is that it feels like the end of another one. It’s a little disjointed. Still, the rest is fantastic. I’m ready for the sequel. Glad we agree. I think much of the criticism from critics has been unfair. I still think the end becomes a bit numbing. That’s where Snyder just runs wild for several minutes. But that didn’t kill the movie for me. I can see that, and maybe I’ll feel the same after another viewing. Maybe there had been enough fighting by the time Zod decided to join in. I love love love how the super speed looked, though. Super speed, yes! Snyder does a lot of cool trickery which makes many of the flying scenes and effects shots work. I really liked that. Excellent post Keith, and I’m right there with you. I loved the film and could see right through some of it’s pretty obvious weaknesses. It was just too enjoyable of a very grand type of experience to let minor flaws bring me down. I agree with almost everything you discuss here. Exactly! The fun factor was sky high for me. That makes it easy to forgive some of its flaws. I was really close to giving this a 4.5 because I liked it that much. Nice review, Keith! I think the romance is necessary between Lois and Superman to balance out the coldness of Zod and the fight scenes. I agree the balance was off, but a fun film to watch anyway! Thanks Cindy. I guess I just wanted the romance to blossom a little more. The timeline tinkering didn’t really allow for it. But that didn’t ruin everything for me. I still really responded to this. Fun movie! I agree, Lois and Supes love was a little forced, I didn’t see how they built a connection amongst the chaos. All the characters lacked emotion (aside from the relationship between Clark and Ma Kent) but who cares right?  This film was insane, the action sequences from beginning to end were unreal. Great review Keith and I think we’re on the same page with this one. Awesome, thanks man. I only wish Snyder has calmed down a little at the end. Other than that the action blew me away. But I also love the performances and the more serious tone. Some have struggled with that, but it really works for me. It’s definitely worth seeing. I skipped the 3-D. In fact I always do unless I hear something profoundly positive about it and how its used in a movie. Definitely check it out. It’s a solid movie. OK, will do. I just hate seeing 3-D movies in non-3-D and then noticing things they do in the frame that obviously seems aware of the 3-D that’s not there. Wahoo!! We even agree on the rating Keith. I wish I could give it a 5/5 but I have to knock points off the CGI-action overload. I probably could’ve given it an extra half points for Cavill though 😉 I love what you said about him here “Cavill has the look, the physicality, and the commitment to sell the character.” Yes and from the interviews it sounds like he’s got the dedication as well as talent to pull off the impossible, which is to make a compelling Superman without resorting to simply channeling Christopher Reeve. I can’t wait to see the sequels for this. I really flirted with giving this a 4.5 due to how much fun I had with it. I really thought the performances were solid and I loved the seriousness it used in its approach to the story. I think a lot of the criticisms thrown at this film are unfair although it does have some issues (especially the ones you mentioned). I can’t wait to see this again and like you I’m excited for what’s next. I’m glad that you also pointed out the fact that Cavill isn’t asked to do much. Unlike you though, I thought that was a shame, given that he did show a lot of awesome acting abilities during the some of the intensely emotional scenes. (You know…)
Although, I guess one can argue that those scenes had move impact because of his more restraint performance throughout.  Thanks man. Appreciate it. I do think Cavill was used just right although you bring up a good point. He did show some range in a couple of pretty emotional sequences.  Some scenes seemed shorter than they were intended to be, like the Church scene. “I’m who they want.” Then he leaves without it seeming like the Priest’s advise did anything for him. Felt like there was meant to be more there.  I feel like most of the negative criticism is because it’s such a BIG movie, in terms of scale and impact to Superhero movies… that a lot of people are judging unfairly because loving it would be ‘too conventional’. Good job, Keith.  We are mostly in agreement about the film’s problem’s, but it was a solid reboot nonetheless.  I don’t say this often, but I can’t wait for a sequel! The only aspect that really sells me to see this is the fact that Shannon and Crowe are in this. I’m not too wild about super hero franchises, but the cast is pretty solid, so I may check it out for that reason. Good review, Keith! Great thoughts. I felt there was just enough humor spread through it to keep it from being draining. For me it was similar to the Batman films in terms of tone. Not as dark but serious. Like TDK trilogy it worked really well for me. I thought the chemistry between Lois and Clark was fine. I just think the story doesn’t offer them enough opportunities to flesh it out and let us latch onto it. It’s such a big part of the story but it was really underplayed here. I appreciate that we are being offered a more serious film with some grand ideas buried inside. The look of the film at times simply feels depressing. It’s as if the sun never shines in Kansas when Costner is on screen. Clark/Kal-el only shows up in the most dreary landscapes possible. The final battle is fought in a haze of soot and ash, because every Damon building in Metropolis is being destroyed. This movie is grim. Look, Batman is the Dark Knight, I get that, but Superman is the symbol for truth, justice  and the American way. He is a product of our Sun’s effect on his molecular make up, but he comes across like a little black rain cloud. I liked the film but I felt abandoned by the need to update so many aspects of the story. I thought the film portrayed hopelessness more than hope. You mentioned some funny moments by I can’t recall one. Great, we get a comic book that isn’t cartoony, that’s like a comedy that isn’t funny. I felt tension and anxiety, but not the fun kind in a traditional action film. It is well made but emotionally hollow where it should be ripe. I agree with your rating, but the more I think about it the less I enjoyed it. The movie was fine, it was not fun. I sound more down on it than I want to, I wanted to love it, I just didn’t. Fair enough but I couldn’t disagree more with some of your assessments. I never felt it was emotionally hollow. Quite the opposite in fact. And I welcome a darker take because Superman’s initial story is depressing. A doomed planet and the death of millions. An alienated boy trying to cope with otherworldly powers. An earthly father fearing what the world we do to his son if they found him out. A young adult with a strong moral compass discovering himself in the light of a great evil. His choice to do the right thing in light of the uncertainty. I suppose we could get another movie hamming it up in the Daily Planet offices. Personally I loved the treatment. And at the end I really responded to how it turned out. I didn’t feel depressed at all. As for cartoony I think you missed my point. It’s far from being like a comedy without humor. Comic books have many examples of being far above cartoony both in terms of art and story. My point was that it didn’t automatically fall into the same lightweight pattern of the other Superman movies. Now I liked some of them but this sought to be different and I really appreciated it for that. Nice review. We’re in agreement on this one. I gave it 4 stars too, and I really dug the more serious tone this one adopted. I’m a fan. Keith I have yet to see the other two guys portions of our Man of Steel review.  However, It sounds like you liked this a bit more than I did.  I was enjoying this film till about the point that Zod showed up on Earth.  I know this is going to be hard to believe coming from me but I thought there was too much action and not enough story after that point in the film.  Moreover, I found the pace of the action to be a distraction. I can see that. Believe it or not Zod’s first appearance on earth may be my favorite scene in the movie. I loved the way they built up the threat. The action didn’t bother me until the end. It seems Snyder just didn’t know when to let up! Good review, Keith.  You’re right in that there are some creative liberties that long-time fans have to cope with.  That’s part of what had me waffling between three and four stars on this; decided on the latter because, as you say, it leaves the franchise in a better place than Superman Returns did. As a long-time comic fan I’m always conscience of movies and the creative liberties. Some have done it really well and others have screwed it up. This film definitely changed some things but it respected the character and his history. I can handle that. Only a few more days and I’m seeing this puppy!! It doesn’t open until the 27th here in Australia, and the wait is killing me!!! I’ve skimmed this review, Keith, if only to find what your rating for it was. Glad to see it scored highly!!! Nice review, Keith, although I’ve rated it lower on my site, mainly for the stuff you outlined in your review, like the last part of the film going a bit OTT. The action overload kind of makes a mockery of that big decision Superman has to make. Ultimately, I was disappointed. Cavill is good as Superman though. I think they’ve got better actors in place than Superman Returns, so I’m interested to see what they do with a sequel.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," While distant to many, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe took control of the superhero genre, there was nothing hotter than DC films, especially Batman. After 1997’s Batman and Robin, comic book films became a thing of the past as studios failed to see the financial gain from promoting and releasing these films. Then 2005 came and director Christopher Nolan not only resurrected the comic book film, but in the span of 6 years, created one of the greatest trilogies of all time, directed the greatest comic book film of all time, and directed quite possibly the greatest supporting actor win in the history of the Academy Award. In 2012, prior to The Dark Knight Rises, fans were first exposed to the trailer to the follow-up to the Nolanverse, Man of Steel.  While Nolan’s production team, Syncopy was at the helm, Nolan would no longer be directing superhero films and the director’s chair was handed to Zack Snyder. At the time, Snyder was best known for directing the remake of Dawn Of The Dead and Watchman. While neither of those films was great, there was excitement for the release. However, that excitement turned to despair for the unblinded DC fans as the downfall of DC and the takeover of Marvel began with 2013’s Man of Steel.  While an unapologetic hater of Superman, as I find him to be the blandest mainstream superhero of the bunch, it was difficult not to be excited after what DC had been producing over the past 6 years. Outside of Green Lantern, it was hard to imagine a dud from DC. As the film opened on Krypton, I started to have a sinking feeling that we were in for a rough ride. While the origin myth is perhaps the most interesting part of any superheroes story, Snyder created a colossal, random creature filled work in Man of Steel. In 1978, cinephiles were shown that man could fly, and with that came a subtle Krypton that provided a stronger origin of Kal-El. Man of Steel‘s Krypton overextended its welcome and was nothing short of distracting. When watching these films, It is always great to suspend disbelief, however, Snyder’s vision of Krypton brought back green screen memories of the Star Wars prequels. One of Man of Steel’s glaring issues is the break from a linear timeline to jump ahead 33 years after the demise of Krypton. While attempting to be hip, It comes off unfocused as we find the adult Clark randomly working on a fishing trawler, with no reason as to why.  In its attempt to replicate the origin story told in Batman Begins, Man of Steel’s origin story comes off nothing short than unoriginal. The frequent cutbacks to Clark’s present and days as a child fail to work in developing a clear narrative for the film. The ironic thing is despite that, it still does a better job than Snyder’s follow up, Batman V Superman. An impressive feat for a director that is rightfully critiqued by everyone except the blind followers of his work that seem to see nothing wrong in his filmmaking. The finale of Man of Steel brings to light my biggest gripe with most of the superhero films – the catastrophic destruction. The film makes no bones about it. Superman and Zod are going to destroy any and every building in site and take every human causality with them. From Smallville to Metropolis, the destruction in this film and no consequences for them continue one of the biggest issues within the comic book film genre. While this may come off as a bashing of this film, not everything in Man of Steel is awful. Hans Zimmer continues to show his brilliance with a score on the level of his now iconic Dark Knight trilogy score. Superman’s theme sprinkled throughout is an effective use in preparing the audience for Kal-Els arrival. Along with Zimmer’s score comes Superman himself, Henry Cavill. As I sit back and watch the film, its hard not to feel bad for Cavill who is sensational as Clark Kent. Despite Brandon Routh’s attempts in 2006’s Superman Returns, he failed to channel the endearing qualities the late great Christopher Reeve did almost 40 years ago. Cavill owns the role and the character; He will be forever known as this generations Superman. If there is one word to describe Man of Steel, it would be a disappointment. The groundwork was laid as to what worked for a superhero film by Christopher Nolan. Instead of taking cues from the film and making it its own entity, Snyder took it in a direction that left much longing for a continuation of the franchise. What we didn’t know in 2013 is that Man of Steel was the beginning of what could be considered the most disappointing runs in DC’s film history.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 18, 2021"," I have a complicated relationship with Man of Steel, Zack Snyder’s 2013 big screen reboot of Superman. In the cinema I liked it, albeit with some caveats. On home video I felt the other way around: that those earlier caveats crippled the movie, and that the more positive aspects simply weren’t strong enough to redeem the film. Eight years on and I find myself somewhere in the middle: Man of Steel is one hell of a mess, but it definitely has something to it that has tempted me back yet again. ‘Curate’s egg’ is rather a stereotypical term to apply to a work, but in this case it is probably the most appropriate one to use. If you have never seen the film, and want to, I must warn you I will unavoidably spoil the film’s ending below. Very quickly: when his home planet Krypton is destroyed, an infant Kal El is safely hidden on the planet Earth where he is adopted by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). As the adult Kal El (Henry Cavill), now living under the name Clark Kent, tries to find his place in the world while hiding his super powers, Earth comes under threat from Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his soldiers – who plan to capture Kal and terraform Earth into a new Krypton. Here is the main problem: it is a solid movie, but a terrible Superman movie. Superman is an upbeat social justice power fantasy in which a super-human protagonist solves crimes and rescues people from disasters. If you go back and read the original Action Comics stories by creators Siegel and Shuster, he has a pretty limited power set: he can run faster than a speeding bullet, is more powerful than a locomotive, and is able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. That was honestly about it at first. Every other power associated with the character came as later generations of writers looked for methods of jazzing up the narrative, including flight, heat and x-ray vision, super-hearing, and the ability to hold his breath in space. Despite a growing power set, however, his core purpose remained: to fight crime in Metropolis, a thinly veiled replica of Manhattan. He cares about the little people. He is loved by the little people. He would never, ever kill. Along comes Man of Steel, riding the back of Christopher Nolan’s successful Dark Knight films and directed by rising star Zack Snyder (300, Dawn of the Dead). It has a very simple rationale to separate it from earlier Superman films: it will be a realistic take on the character. It will specifically be a post-9/11 take as well, relying heavily on that terrorist attack’s imagery as indelibly related through news media in 2001. This is already a terrible take for a Superman story. Superman is an upbeat, bright character. I have this half-baked theory that the comic book characters can be split into day and night types: the night characters work well in contemporary film and television, as they are grim and bleak and generally hopeless and can comfortably survive a shift from children’s entertainment to an all-ages product. Characters like Batman, the Punisher, Green Arrow, and Daredevil thrive in this environment. The day-time heroes are much harder to shift into an all-ages format, because adult audiences tend to struggle with anything too bright and silly. Superman is often described as a boy scout: a big, goofy, primary-coloured hero without physical limits but with a rigid code of right and wrong. Making the character more ‘realistic’ in Man of Steel‘s case means making him darker. A darker Superman can make for strong drama, but it will cause the core mythology of the character to collapse. Man of Steel reworks the character’s rural Kansas childhood, turning adoptive father Jonathan Kent from the noble farmer who teaches Clark right from wrong to a paranoid man full of fear, warning his son that the broader world will not accept or trust him. It’s a realistic enough take, but ignores the central element that Superman is innately trustworthy. This change leads into a second problem: that the adult Clark hides himself and his powers from the world. In Man of Steel, the world’s first experience of Superman is as an alien hiding among them who must be revealed upon the threat of more aliens devastating humanity. The public do not trust him, because he has done nothing to earn their trust. Compare this to Richard Donner’s masterful Superman: The Movie (1978) in which half an hour is dedicated simply to showing Christopher Reeve’s Superman doing good deeds around Metropolis. Man of Steel is particularly egregious when it comes to screen violence. Snyder directs a film where the powers of Kryptonians like Superman are taken to a logical extreme. When Superman battles Zod, entire buildings collapse. Huge explosions level city blocks. Literally billions of dollars in property damage is generated by a single fist-fight, and while Snyder goes some way to sanitise the effect it isn’t difficult to work out thousands of people will have died. At the film’s climax, Superman is given no option but to snap Zod’s neck. While promoting the film back in 2013 Snyder talked considerably about how this was part of his realistic take: that audience knew Superman wouldn’t kill, but why? That Snyder felt Superman needed a specific life experience to turn him against murder says an awful lot about why the director’s take on the character was so blindly misguided. Why doesn’t Superman kill? Why aren’t there more grim, realistic takes on Superman out there? Why does Superman fight crime when he could solve world hunger? If we change any of these things, then he is no longer Superman – just an identical power set and US$100 million’s worth of computer-generated effects. This is the problem with Man of Steel. The film is wonderfully cast. It has some absolutely jaw-dropping effects sequences. The climactic city battle is superbly realised, and executed on a near-unprecedented scale. Hans Zimmer’s score is close to a career-best, with a central theme that actually rivals John Williams’ celebrated 1978 version. It is simply bad Superman.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 17, 2021"," Man of Steel arrives with a great weight of expectation on its shoulders. It’s a reinvention of a much loved character, a brand new take on the world’s first superhero. The last cycle of Superman films started in 1978 with Richard Donner’s Superman, while Bryan Singer updated that world with 2006’s Superman Returns, but this is a rebirth of Krypton’s last son. We live in a time when the superhero film is the leading genre in modern cinema. Comic book adaptations have been sure-things at the box office; many have been successful though some have crashed and burned. Superman has long been a difficult character to update to modern tastes. He’s too clean cut, too noble. He lacks the darkness of Batman, the joie de vivre of Iron Man or the teen angst of Spider-Man. Warner Bros. handed the reins to Christopher Nolan, David Goyer and Zack Snyder, men who have made some of the most financially and critically acclaimed comic book adaptations of all times (The Dark Knight trilogy, 300 and Watchmen). The trio have successfully brought Superman back to the screen, updating the legend, yet staying true to the character’s core. It’s a movie that works on many levels, but it also has moments where it falters. Man of Steel gets a lot right. The casting of Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent is spot-on. He brings the right notes of heroism and earnestness to the role, as well as embodying the physical presence of the character. Superman Returns saw Brandon Routh (successfully) following in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, but Cavill takes a fresh approach. He has to be commended for this interpretation of the character. The film charts the Superman origin story in a non-linear fashion (like Batman Begins), offering a unique slant on the story. It covers many of the plot points from the Donner films, but gives it much more of a sci-fi orientated spin. The Krypton of Man of Steel has more in common with George Lucas’ Star Wars prequels than the icy crystal landscapes of Donner’s world. In fact, there are many elements of the Krypton scenes that are very reminiscent of Lucas’s second trilogy of Star Wars films. The gunships, creature design, inter-galactic politics (and even some CGI camera work) brings to mind Attack of the Clones. Could now be the time when Lucas’ Star Wars prequels have started to feed into the filmmaking psyche like the original films did? Few actors would be able to replace Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman’s birth father, but Russell Crowe manages to do it. He adds gravitas to the character and his role is much bigger than you would expect (but more on that later). Kevin Costner is Man of Steel’s emotional core. He brings the baggage of his onscreen persona to Jonathan Kent. It’s an underplayed and small role, but he’s the beating heart of the film, and he gives it its humanity. Lois Lane has never been a character that has translated well to the screen. On the surface, it looks like Amy Adams has been miscast as The Daily Planet’s fearless reporter. However, Adams manages to get across the right amount of bravery and weakness. She’s one of the film’s main surprises. Michael Shannon brings enough sneering anger to Zod, a general who takes his earthbound mission very, very personally. The film left me hankering for more Laurence Fishburne, and I’m hoping that Man of Steel 2 will be much more focused on The Daily Planet and its employees. Man of Steel has some great special effects – you really will believe a man can fly. The epic battles between Superman and his fellow Kryptonians are on an epic scale. Too epic. The sheer amount of onscreen devastation is off the cinematic chart. It makes the climaxes of The Avengers and Transformers 3 look small scale. It’s an exhausting eyeball fusing cacophony of CGI. Just because you can show something in the screen, doesn’t mean that you should. It would look much more impressive if there had been less of it. Do you really need to show the destruction of 100 buildings when you’ve already shown the destruction of 10? The man-to-man battles between Superman and Zod are much more human scale, they’re personal. Hans Zimmer was in a difficult position with his score. The John Williams theme has become so iconic that the film misses its grandeur. Zimmer has some great musical motifs (when they can be heard above the action), but it doesn’t quite match up to his work on the Batman films. He touches the same emotional areas that Williams did, but you can also sense that he’s too afraid to go there. A great theme would have connected the disparate elements of Man of Steel and unified them, bringing the action and the drama together as one. One of the greatest parts of Man of Steel is the use of Russell Crowe’s Jor-El. However, it’s also one of the plot’s greatest flaws. Jor-El is able to interact with characters from beyond the grave. He can have meaningful dialogue with his son, Lois and Zod. This leads to some great moments for Crowe (and a fun action sequence), but it takes away the haunting emotion of Superman/Clark/Kal-El’s relationship with his father. They could (hypothetically) sit-down, have a beer and shoot the breeze.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2021"," The film that kicked off the DCEU remains its most perplexing entry. Following the massive success of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, 2013’s Man of Steel essentially promised a grittier version of Kal-El than the ones seen either on television or through Christopher Reeves or Brandon Routh’s interpretations of the character. With Zack Snyder’s Justice League right around the corner, potentially bringing Henry Cavill’s time donning the red cape to close, a look at Man of Steel brings to light the highs and the lows of this complicated chapter in superhero filmmaking. Zack Snyder’s biggest strength as a storyteller in Man of Steel lies in his ability to weave through the murky waters of the origin narrative. The world knows who Clark Kent is. Snyder’s Krypton is more about Jor-El and General Zod than the planet’s sole infant survivor. The adults fail to make sense of the complex politics, leaving the children to pick up the pieces. With Snyder more interested in Kal-El’s past than his present, the director puts his star in a fairly untenable position. Henry Cavill may be the ostensible lead, but Man of Steel is not fully Superman’s movie. The film’s attentions are too preoccupied with everything happening around Clark that Cavill never really gets his moment to shine, the camera really only providing extended focus during the film’s many action sequences. The acting is predictably top-notch given the A-list talent involved. Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Costner make the most of every scene they’re in, giving the film a great sense of depth out of place with its aimless script. While Cavill never really gets a chance to make the film his own, the quality of the performances are enough to salvage the film’s many shortcomings. This dynamic is best on display through the underbaked relationship between Clark and Lois Lane. Cavill and Adams have great chemistry, leading one to wish that they’d been given a moment to breathe amidst all the chaos. There’s such a natural sense to their romance, carrying the inevitability that shapes their characters through decades of comic book stories, but Snyder steps on his messaging at practically every term. Snyder remains perpetually at odds with the seminal motto, “The S stands for hope,” that defines Superman as a character. Snyder’s grim template doesn’t leave much room for hope. The bland color palette in the cinematography robs Superman of one of his best assets from the comics, bright blues and reds set against a bright and sunny Metropolis. Superman exudes optimism, a sentiment Snyder has little use for. This conflict rears its head in two pivotal moments. The death of Jonathan Kent is beyond foolish, an unnecessary sequence that plays too hard for an unearned emotional response. The other more spoiler-heavy death remains deeply at odds with Superman’s core ethos. Snyder’s deviation carried little justification, an empty gesture that almost looks designed to troll longtime fans of the comics. As much as he steps on himself at times, Snyder did manage to craft a pretty decent film. The action pieces are overwrought, but well-choreographed. As a director, he’s constantly bailed out by his actors. While later installments in the DCEU bury themselves in needlessly grim aesthetics, Man of Steel remains relatively lighthearted by comparison. Almost a decade later, Snyder’s sixth directorial feature remains his most frustrating. Man of Steel could have been a great movie if it had picked a clear direction. It is a good movie, albeit a conclusion that requires one to add up all the various pieces to arrive at that destination. The experience should have been better, if Snyder merely got out of his own way. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 3, 2020"," ue to the success of the modern reinvention of Batman, it was only a matter of time before further superheroes received a similar treatment. With the decidedly more fantastical origins of Superman, the Christopher Nolan reimagining unwittingly tilts towards the Avengers over the Dark Knight, but the exceedingly serious tone results in an experience more impactful than that of the aforementioned amalgamation of protagonists. Calling “Man of Steel” overdramatic wouldn’t be inaccurate but the incessant and overwhelming action sequences are constructed proficiently enough to create grand spectacle at its best and mimic over-the-top video games at its worst. Both are still entertaining, however. The use of flashbacks and interactive memories in the storytelling is gimmicky, yet it allows the film to quickly engage in the adventure as well as pause to reflect on previous lessons learned and necessary history reminders. “Man of Steel” isn’t terribly far off from the effective formula found in Nolan’s Batman films, but the very extraterrestrial nature inherent in Superman prevents the tone from ever being as realistic. Upon exhausting the natural resources of the planet Krypton, its people turn to their leaders for answers. But a plodding bureaucracy and an insurgence by former military commander General Zod (Michael Shannon) culminates in the utter annihilation of the planet. Predicting such an outcome, scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) jettisons an escape pod into space carrying Krypton’s last hope – his son Kal-El. Landing on Earth and into the care of a loving family in Kansas, Kal-El grows up as Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) in the small town of Smallville. Perpetually shunned by those around him for his otherworldly powers, Clark wanders the countryside helping citizens in distress while searching for the answers to his true purpose in life. But when Zod arrives on Earth and threatens mass genocide, Clark must not only reveal his true identity to mankind, but also put his trust in them in order to save his adopted homeworld. Undeniably more “Green Lantern” than “Batman Begins,” this new retelling of the Superman origin is overwhelmingly science-fiction. Although never as grounded in reality as Batman, Superman has never felt so out of this world. Kal-El’s upbringing on earth is truncated with brief flashbacks (messing with the timeline is surprisingly productive) demonstrating his alienation and contradictory altruism, justification for intrusion in society, temptations to abuse power, and aspirations to override predestinated statuses. Each episode examining morality is eventually eclipsed by spectacular destruction, fueled heavily by jargon-oriented predicaments and verbally bombast-laced solutions. But the CG annihilation of Metropolis provides plenty of exhibitions to outplay deficiencies in plot, less convincing hand-to-hand combat, and ineffective narrations over montages. The technology in the film subscribes to the same theory of overusing extraterrestrial lexicon, resulting in boundless adversarial capabilities – though plunging back into the inception of Superman is pleasantly more simplistic, thanks to the acceptance of general knowledge of his beginnings. Details are visualized exponentially for his birthplace but trimmed for adolescence, increasing the opportunities for special effects and keeping the drab stuff to a minimum. The rousing music, formidable villains, bleaker situations, evenly paced action, toned-down costumes (he finds his accouterments instead of fashioning them) and influx of seriousness (thanks largely to story credits by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan) have forged a more contemporarily suitable superhero, despite his troublesome invincibility, and moderate inadequacy in achieving a truly affecting plot. There’s still the sense that anything is possible, since the alien species’ power is undefined. But the increasing, downhill foolishness of the Christopher Reeve series (leading to a nearly two-decade gap between theatrical adaptations) and the disappointing 2006 return has given director Zack Snyder and his team the lessons necessary to stick to a more sincere Clark Kent derivation.

"Sep 15, 2020"," There's only one problem. Man of Steel is not an action flick. Man of Steel is a Superman flick. Man of Steel is a superhero flick. Man of Steel is a film that's supposed to radiate the hope that the ""S"" on Superman's chest is supposed to symbolize. While I'd never fancy myself a true purist, Man of Steel is not supposed to be Transformers in a cape. It's also not supposed to be The Dark Knight, though the dialogue heavy and over-plotted screenplay from Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer might have you thinking otherwise. This is Superman not Batman, though between Nolan and Goyer's gothic sensibilities and Zack Snyder's inability to avoid bludgeoning nearly everything in sight the film feels like the orphaned child of The Dark Night probably sent down from Krypton and into the Batcave. There were moments in Man of Steel when we got a glimpse into the film this could have been and, perhaps, the film and inevitable sequel that Zack Snyder is setting up. The problem is that for every moment of spark and potential, Man of Steel has several other moments that are completely and utterly disappointing. I admire Snyder's attempt to move away from the traditional Superman vibe, a vibe that can be called folksy or even cheesy but a vibe helps manifest the awe, wonder and innocence that has made Superman one of the most beloved of the superheroes. Unfortunately, Snyder completely strips Superman of pretty much everything that makes him beloved in favor of turning him into simply another hardcore action hero with ridiculously solid six-pack abs and abilities that far transcend those of humans. The film opens rather refreshingly with a considerable amount of time spent on Krypton, where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have correctly predicted that their planet is about to end and have decided to send their newborn son into the universe in the hope that he can carry the future of Krypton into another land. General Zod (Michael Shannon), on the other hand, is a rebellious military commander who hasn't quite given up on Krypton and stages a coup that costs Jor-El his life and sets the stage for the remainder of the film once he is banished. Of course, we all know that Kal-El, as Superman was born, lands on earth and is taken in by the Kents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) and becomes Clark Kent. Man of Steel spends only fleeting moments in Clark Kent's childhood, mostly as a way to create a picture of Kent's inner turmoil as he increasingly realizes his gifts and struggles to learn how to use them. As a young adult, Kent (Henry Cavill) is mostly a misguided wanderer and occasional do-gooder until encountering Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and encountering a vision of his father that allows him to discover the truth about his past and glimpses into his future. It would be nearly impossible for Man of Steel to show up with too many story surprises, though it likely won't surprise anyone that a good majority of the film centers around the action-packed conflicts between Superman and General Zod's legion along with Superman's effort to convince humanity that he's one of the good guys. There are certainly considerable liberties that Snyder takes with the film, ranging from dramatic changes to Superman's outfit to slightly more subtle changes to the story's plot that will only likely be noticed by Superman purists. What's most disappointing is that Snyder has truly savaged Superman of the fantastical nature, fun and heart that is so prevalent beneath the surface of the seemingly cheesy source material and early films. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane give the film its desperately needed heart, while Amy Adams offers a slightly different take on Lois Lane by embodying her as a bit more action-seeking of a journalist and a Pulitzer Prize winner. Michael Shannon could play General Zod in his sleep, though to his credit he stays awake and turns in a credible performance. Laurence Fishburne is here as Daily Planet Editor Perry White, though his role is mostly one-note with the exception of a bit of a harrowing action sequence where he's allowed to show his humanity. Then, there's Henry Cavill. I'll admit I was more than a bit worried by the casting of the British actor. While he's done fine in his British television work, Cavill has mostly disappointed with his Hollywood film work. While he lacks the wit and vulnerability that makes Superman one of the more accessible superheroes, he does project a charisma and humility that plays nicely and is far more convincing than one might have expected. He's certainly convincing in the hand-to-hand combat, though Snyder floods the film with such combat and it becomes almost mind-numbing after awhile. At nearly 2 1/2 hours, Man of Steel is almost an exhausting cinematic experience with its non-stop battles, hand-to-hand combat, tossed buildings and vehicles, and overwrought special effects. Hans Zimmer's histrionic and forgettable original score overwhelms an already overwhelming film. Man of Steel isn't a horrible film, but it's a film that makes you long for it to be directed by someone who clearly loves the source material rather than someone who simply wants to reimagine it and create a hyped up action flick. It's possible to create a film that does both. It's possible to create a film that reimagines the Superman saga without stripping away everything that made us fall in love with Superman to begin with. This Superman is just so disappointing because this Superman is driven by ego rather than sacrifice and by power rather than love for his fellow man. It's impossible to admire the few scenes of heroics that the film offers because they are so frequently surrounded by scenes of complete devastation where Snyder seems to be glossing over the fact that for every one person Superman has saved thousands of others have clearly passed away.  Man of Steel is a decent action flick, but as a Superman flick Man of Steel is a reminder that it takes a whole lot more than muscle and strength to make a true superhero. ",NEUTRAL

"Jan 11, 2020", In this quick fast episode I go into a bit more on why I dislike the Man of Steel film and I cover the recently leaked and released Kanye West album Yeezus.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 19, 2019"," [xrr rating=2.0/5]His acting career (and life) tragically cut short, Christopher Reeve will be best remembered as Superman. Dismissed by many critics as a pretty face of very little substance, Reeve breathed life into the Superman franchise by deftly switching from the bumbling Clark Kent to the stoic superhero, embodying both iterations and clearly demonstrating the demarcation between the being from Krypton and the human alter ego he assumes to walk among the denizens of the planet Earth. Since Reeve hung up his cape and tights, three actors have attempted to assume the mantle of DC Comics’ iconic character. In Zack Snyder’s reboot Man of Steel, Henry Cavill shows us just how much Reeve still owns the role. Doing away with the campiness of the original Superman films and latching onto a Christopher Nolan-style aesthetic, Snyder and Man of Steel try to infuse darkness into a character and story that has no place for gloom. Clark Kent is no longer a shambolic newsman trying to keep his identity a secret while preserving the American way. Instead, he’s a broody drifter, a tough guy who makes a living working on fishing vessels and tending bar in the remote Canadian wilderness. The story is the same: In an extended prologue, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), with his planet self-destructing, ships baby Superman (aka Kal-El) off to Earth. After a failed coup, the insane General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his minions are banished into a black hole. As Krypton falls apart, it’s apparent that Snyder is more concerned with big special effects than a cohesive story. Rather than show the evolution of Kal-El into Superman in a coherent manner, Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer slowly reveal this progression in jumbled flashback, interspersing hazy vignettes into the main narrative. Discovered by loving couple Martha and Jonathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner—both endowed with lines dripping with cliché and platitude), Kal-El must learn to harness his power while concealing it from the close-minded occupants of Smallville. This general dismissal of the origin story pushes Man of Steel into its modern day plot: General Zod finds Superman on Earth and decides to turn the planet into another Krypton. The only catch is that the entire human race will succumb in the process. As far as plans go, it’s definitely a notch above Lex Luthor’s asinine plot to sell intergalactic real estate in the last Superman abomination and it certainly gives Zod the moral high ground so he can espouse his defense during fight scenes. But rather than instill the role with true menace like Terence Stamp did years before, Shannon turns his Zod into a blithering bore who actually believes his notions of genocide are justified. Action scenes of mass destruction take up a large part of Man of Steel. Smallville’s Main Street is leveled in a shitstorm of missiles, bullets and superheroic strength. Metropolis is pounded into the dust in a finale that never seems to end. Imagine Transformers, complete with Michael Bay’s inane direction, and that’s what you get here. On top of that, Snyder and Goyer interject a jingoistic sense of nationalism into most of their action scenes. Superman isn’t fighting to save his own people. He is fighting against his own people to preserve the American way. It’s not a surprise that Sears and the International House of Pancakes (among other corporations) are prominently featured here. Corporate cronyism is the modern American way. Is that what we’re trying to preserve? Even more insidious is the messianic subtext that burbles up throughout the film. Superman is 33 years old when the film begins. There are numerous scenes of Cavill prostrate as if stretched on an invisible cross. Shit, even at one point, Kent goes to church and Snyder frames his head in a stained glass portrait of Jesus. If that isn’t subtle enough, Jor-El mutters something about the baby being a god amongst the humans. We get it. But what’s the point really? The acting isn’t much better. As per every Superman adventure, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) pops up but this time around she learns Kent’s true identity almost immediately. She gets to shoot some folks with a gun and make dick jokes. The rest of the time she is placed in peril for Superman to swipe her away at the last possible moment. Meanwhile, Cavill turns in a leaden performance, given little to do but glower and fight while Shannon is hopeless as the maniacal Zod. Man of Steel is a pandering, monotonous mess that features an anachronistic character who may be best left a relic of the past. Let Christopher Reeve have Clark Kent. Henry Cavill and Zack Snyder certainly haven’t earned him in this mind-numbing, tiresome bore of a picture.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 27, 2019","  	Superman is lame. Fight it all you want to, DC Comic loyalists, but there’s a reason people cheer whenever Batman bests him. Consumed by a fetishized, flag-waving patriotism that makes his status as a full-fledged illegal alien somewhat hilarious these days, Superman is basically an American god. Invulnerable, infallible (at least in terms of his moral compass) and inapproachable to most of us (as we don’t relate to the first two adjectives), adaptations of the character have been tepid and repetitive. Insert some vanilla messianic themes, have a bald dude threaten him with a green rock, rinse and repeat.  	With one tiny twist in perspective, Man of Steel has reinvented the character, dominated the summer blockbuster season and invigorated the concept of rebooting a franchise. How? It’s a sci-fi movie, not a superhero movie. As such, it features an origin story, but not a superhero origin story. No, this is a sci-fi movie about the origin of a costumed persona known as Clark Kent.  	Writer David Goyer, who has been crushing science fiction since his brilliant Dark City, starts us on Krypton. This is no quick flyover: we see the grand scope of this dying world. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) squares off against General Zod (Michael Shannon) over the fate of their race. The former advocates an attempt to keep their species alive by embedding key elements into his newborn son and sending him to a hospitable world, the latter stages a violent overthrow of the government. You can guess how that argument ends.  	Suddenly, the film skips to full superhuman adulthood. No slow transition necessary because director Zack Snyder is not telling the story of a Kansas kid coping with magnificent powers. This is a fatherless alien deciding whether or not to pretend to be human. Flashbacks to Smallville are only used to show factors Superman (Henry Cavil) is weighing in this decision. His father (Kevin Costner) advised isolation and segregation from humanity; his mother (Diane Lane) didn’t much object. When Zod arrives and forces Superman’s hand, he must consider the intimate knowledge he has gained of human life through a brief relationship with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and the bigger picture of his alien nature.  	This self-exploration is done amidst hella action, more than has ever been included in a comic book adaptation. In escalating fight after fight, Snyder fully embraces the godlike attributes of his warriors. The spectacle is breathtaking in a way that no Superman movie has ever been. Even Lois, an unrecognizable character from previous incarnations, is not relegated to helpless victim, demonstrating intelligence, loyalty and bravery that isn’t undone by the narcissism of Margot Kidder’s version.  	Cavil is likewise fantastic, partially because this new approach leaves him free to make a version of the iconic character from outside the reach of Christopher Reeves’ shadow. Man of Steel is admittedly missing humor and fun, consumed by the seriousness of producer Christopher Nolan’s dark overtones and grey color palate. But the tone was a course correction, and the payoff is great. Unlike almost every superhero origin movie to date, the final frames don’t linger on a display of action, even if they show how a new identity came to be chosen.  When Clark pushes up his glasses and smiles, we see that this human costume is the true hero we’ve been watching rise.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2019"," Now the most anticipated blockbuster of summer has arrived, I wish I could embrace it with a review that’s more rapturous than mixed.  As someone old enough to have grown up on Superman comics when they were they were sold for a dime on newsstands, I’m ashamed to say I care deeply about this guy. I think my first ambition was to be Superman. And like a die-hard Maple Leafs fan, I’ve rooted for him over the years against all odds—from the original black-and-white TV show with George Reeve in a saggy suit through Christopher Reeve’s valiant run on the big screen. Superman is the prototypical and Almighty superhero. And trying to capture his virtue and invincibility in the flesh of film has always been a challenge. But after the dead-end reboot of Superman Returns (2006),  I was as excited as anyone by the Man of Steel trailer, and encouraged to see the franchise gain some heft with director Zach Snyder (300, Watchmen) and producer/co-writer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight). But there’s a dirty war going on in Man of Steel, and I’m not talking about the earth-shaking showdown between Superman and Krypton’s genocidal General Zod. It’s the war between carnage and character that now rages at the heart of every comic book blockbuster. And once again, carnage wins by a landslide. I know it seems perverse to complain that there’s too much action in action movies. But what is so magnificent about Man of Steel—the immaculate casting, the elegant design, the poise of the actors, the sweet spots of emotion—is overwhelmed by endless tableaux of destruction. The apocalypse has become just another blockbuster trope, as obligatory as the chase, the fireball and the fist fight. It’s no longer a question of “stopping” the apocalypse, just deciding how much of it to dish out before declaring victory over it. So before our Man of Steel can save the world from Zod’s alien army, it has to be all but demolished before our eyes. There’s no visible bloodshed, just acres of what you might call “steelshed,” as the towers of Metropolis/Manhattan are lacerated, shredded, toppled and crushed in a shameless marathon of 9/11 porn. Man of Steel is an origin story that deepens the mythology of the franchise with the Wagnerian complexity that has become Nolan’s signature. It takes Superman’s origin back to ground zero on Krypton, with the screams of his mother suffering through the planet’s first natural childbirth in 1,000 years—the first “origin” story to take its mandate so literally. Kal-El, our alien baby in a manger, is a Christ figure from the word go. The only son of Jor-El (Russell Crowe), he’s a born saviour, sent to rocketing to Earth as his people’s last shot at salvation. Krypton is about to vanish off the face of outerspace, imploding from bad environmental stewardship. As the doomsday clock ticks, Jor-El battles General Zod (Michael Shannon), then launches the Chosen One with a codex that contains the entire DNA of Krypton’s people. Before the planet goes boom, Zod is exiled for his crimes, which allows him to escape its destruction and hunt down Kal-El on Earth with his bad-ass army. The movie’s first act, which takes place on Krypton, unfolds as a space opera, in which super-advanced technology co-exists with warrior knights in armour. Shades of Star Wars. I found the Krypton sequences tedious and cheesy. Couldn’t wait to get to Earth. Once we’re there, the narrative jumps back and forth between flashbacks of Clark Kent’s troubled boyhood, as Firestarter Kid struggling to contain his powers, and his early adulthood as a bearded labourer trying to mind his own business, when not anonymously saving lives. The beard is a cool trick. It allows for the gradual reveal of an actor who is perfectly cast, even though he’s British. Henry Cavill is to the Man of Steel manor born. He looks stupendous in the suit, and with his chiselled features, he could be made of steel, ridiculously handsome in an other-worldly way. Also, when given half a chance, he can act. Behind the inscrutable good looks, his eyes flash with glimmers of intrigue, pain and lust. And he has something to work with. Born an alien but raised a human, his character is tormented by a conflict that is at once existential and global. And as he battles Zod for Earth’s destiny, he must choose between saving humanity or letting Earth become New Krypton. Superman eases into his mission, and the costume, at the same time that he meets the intrepid Lois Lane. Played with saucy smarts by Amy Adams, Lois gets an upgrade in the reboot: when not being a damsel in distress, she’s a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who comes armed with iPad and says, “I get writer’s block if I’m not wearing a flak jacket.” The idea is that she’s no dummy. And by the end of the movie, when Clark has finally signed on as a reporter at the Daily Planet, we know she’s not going to be fooled by those glasses. The cast is universally strong. Casting a black man as Perry White, the Daily Planet’s gruff editor, may seem like a colour-blind casting gag, but Laurence Fishburne lends the role a real-world gravity. Kevin Costner, who seems to be making a minor comeback with every role, makes a fine Pa Kent, the ideal dad, while Diane Lane gives some dimension to Martha Kent, the ideal mom—both nostalgic throwbacks to a mythic America of infinitely patient, super-tolerant farm folk. As the Kryptonian fascist, who’s really just trying to save his people, Michael Shannon chews the scenery with admirable gusto. But the more original and entertaining villain is his cohort, a dominatrix femme fatale played by German actress Antje Traue. She injects a super-wholesome movie with the kinky frisson of a young Angelina Jolie, while pointing out that her race’s lack of morality gives it an “evolutionary advantage” in the battle. That battle is interminable, and while it rages, Man of Steel spins on a moral axis that verges on the theological. Make no mistake: winning the war against Zod is about standing up for good human values against heartless alien values. Superman is the god who takes human form and votes human. He’s the patriotic alien. With his vote, humanity and America become synonymous. And when his loyalty is questioned, he says, “I grew up in Kansas. I’m about as American as it gets.” So there. Along with big action, Man of Steel likes big ideas. And the script is cluttered with exposition—not unlike Christopher Nolan’s Inception. It’s curious how the abstraction of CGI carnage and the abstraction of plot verbiage seem to go hand in hand.  But one thing missing from this resolutely earnest film is humour, which is odd when you consider it’s based on a comic book. You realize humour is missing in action when a shy joke finally makes an appearance in the dying minutes of the movie. Something about the Man of Steel being hot. He is. Too bad the movie isn’t as hot as he is. But fortunately, Man of Steel is hot enough, and good enough, to set in motion a new franchise that might still prove exciting and original once it learns to control its own superpowers and let the characters take charge.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 22, 2019"," BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE had it rough before it even released. Movie bloggers and critics were slamming it before going in and giving it a chance. Many of my colleagues were counting the days before they could crush it with their harsh words. That's not how film criticism should work -- a critic should always go in open-minded. If they can't, don't review -- but with today's online writers, people do as they please; reviewing a movie they are dreading to see is a part of the system. Most of us go on set visits, show off on social media about it, and then bash the film.  1) To understand comic book films, you need to know the comics. This goes with any film that has history of literature before it. I've only reviewed one film based on a book and made sure to disclose that I didn't read the book, so the reader knew that I only reviewed what I saw on screen, but perhaps didn't understand some content because I didn't read the book.  But violence and realism is what critics and fans begged for after the IRONMAN and THE DARK KNIGHT. Superman is a character who's hard to be dark, but director Zach Snyder made it happen with MAN OF STEEL. Superman couldn't stick to his code of saving every civilian as the large fucking buildings falling  because he was busy trying to save the world by geting rid of Zod and his team of Kryptonian assassins. Cut Snyder and Supes some slack. For BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE, where Snyder fumbled was in the editing process. The Ultimate Edition explains all of the plot holes and missed opportunities for the theatrical version. ""Why didn't Superman know there was a bomb in that wheelchair?"" The UE has a ten-second clip explaining Lex Luthor made it out of lead, so he couldn't see what was in it. ""Why did that young lady who was ""at the location"" where Superman saved Lois, lie about Superman killing civilians?"" Well, it's explained in one quick clip that Lex Luthor paid her to say it. Even gave her a script. These should have been in the theatrical version. The bundle of editing missteps fall on Snyder and his team. Lots of bad editing calls that would have made the film more understandable to the ones who just thought it was a stuffed turkey about two dudes set on beating the shit out of each other.  And people have got to let go of why the two team up after the big fight. The name of their mother's are in the comics, so you can't really blame the filmmaker for sticking with that. Sure, it's a little cheesy, but all superhero movies have cheesy moments.  In defense of the UE, it's three hours long and the average moviegoer would not sit through that. Hell, it's hard for me to sit through a two and half-hour film. I can't remember seeing a movie in a theater that's running time is under two hours.  Maybe the UE should have been the one to release in theaters. The leap of faith would have been worth it since it's two of the greatest comic book heros of all time, and people would perhaps tolerate the running time because these two were finally put together in the same film.  Snyder knows how to paint a picture, but perhaps needs to stay away from the writing process. BvS is a beautiful film, and deserves that recognition. As for the errors, he listens, which is why the destruction of Metropolis is explained in BvS. ",POSITIVE

Like Nolan's Batman films, Man of Steel serves up character conflict and plausible explanations for the more fantastic elements of the big blue boy scout's mythos, in an unabashedly sci-fi tale of the last Kryptonian raised on earth. But the biggest problem is that -- like Batman in The Dark Knight Rises, eclipsed by Bane, Catwoman and everyone around him -- Superman just isn't the most interesting character. The scenes between Russell Crowe's commanding Jor-El and Michael Shannon's glassy-eyed zealot General Zod crackle with tension and drama that the scenes with Henry Cavill's Superman just can't match. There's so much backstory to fit in, the film has to sprint through breakneck scenes of people standing around explaining to each other other exactly what's happening, with zero wit and only the most perfunctory love story -- an episode of '90s-tastic capefest Lois and Clark has more chemistry in its little finger. Then the film lingers forever over interminable special effects-drenched fight scenes.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2019"," So I did it!  I set a goal to watch all the Superman and Batman movies before Batman v Superman.  Watching Superman movies was interesting because most of them I hadn’t seen in a long time so it was kind of like watching them fresh.  I’ve never been that big of a comic book movie person and Superman was always pretty far down my list, but I do have nice memories of Christopher Reeves.  When I was in high school I read his autobiography and was very moved by his personal story. Superman is a fun character because he is so pure.  He’s practically the definition of a hero because his mere existence is to help humans and spread hope.  Some of the versions miss this sense of hope and some forget it in favor of ridiculous comedy.  I’d say you get a little bit of everything with Superman.  At his core he should be a hero. Just like with Batman, the Superman movies have their highs, lows and mehs.  And just like with Batman I am going to do it Best Shot style and pick one image from each film that summarizes my experience watching it. I’ll be honest this movie didn’t hold up for me the way I thought it would.  Richard Donner’s film was a trailblazer in the world of comic book movies but my problem was how long it took to get going.  It takes an hour before you meet Christopher Reeves’ Clark Kent/Superman and he doesn’t fly until almost the 1 1/2 hour mark.  That was too slow for me. Some of the origin story is compelling.  I like Marlon Brando as Jor-El and his role as a kind of Savior character is interesting, but it just takes so long.  I got bored.  Now once we get to Christopher Reeves it is wonderful.  He does such a good job differentiating the nerdy Clark Kent and the suave Superman. I also felt that Margot Kidder as Lois Lane was wonderful and her and Reeves have excellent chemistry.  My favorite scenes of the film was their date and the first time they fly together.  I’m not the biggest fan of Gene Hackman’s Lex Luthor.  I don’t mind a silly villain but he wasn’t charming silly but just annoying.  John Williams theme is of course iconic and overall it’s an entertaining film, just not quite as great as I remembered it. This was my favorite of the Superman films I watched.  I saw the Donner cut because Richard Lester took over as director and made it a lot sillier. I didn’t have time to compare the Lester version so take that for what you will. Still I liked that this film focused on Zod, Ursa and Non coming back to have revenge on Superman for their banishment.  They are strong villains but the movie wisely focuses the most on Superman and his inner struggle over saving humanity vs having a loving happy life with Lois Lane.  This gives a nice emotion and Reeves is very good in these scenes. Plus, you still have the great chemistry between Kidder and Reeves. There is a little bit of Lex Luthor but luckily it keeps it to a minimum and the violence is strong but in shorter bursts.  But mostly this film is great because of the journey of Superman and Reeves strong performance. Now we get into the bad films.  In Superman 3 Richard Lester is given full control and it’s not really even ‘so bad it’s good’.  For something to be that kind of guilty pleasure it has to be sincerely trying to be good but this is just a boring, lazy, stupid movie. Right from the beginning you know they are going for total slapstick with a pratfall routine where telephone booths are toppled over.  It gets worse from there. I felt bad for Richard Pryor because I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie where an actor looked more intoxicated while filming.  There were times you couldn’t understand what he was saying it was so slurred together.  He plays a programmer who is used by a CEO to do all kinds of dastardly deeds. Reeves is fine and there is an entertaining scene with him fighting both sides of himself- evil vs good Superman.  But they remove Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane and give us Annette O’Toole as Lana Lang who he has no chemistry with. I picked this shot of Richard Pryor because it showcases the problem of the movie with him skiing down the side of a building and then landing with no injuries.  It’s just so stupid. As bad as Superman 3 is, Superman 4 is even worse.  The production team famously took all the money out of the budget so everything looks horrible.  Everything from the costumes, special effects, script are horrible. I guess only good thing about it is you get Margot Kidder back as Lois Lane but it sucks that things had to go out this way for her and Reeves, who were so wonderful together.  You have so many cliches with the mean boss at the Daily Planet with the daughter who has hots for Clark (Superman/Clark Kent go on a double date with Lois/Lacy for a long segment). We get the return of Lex Luthor who creates Nuclear Man which is embarrassing.  Superman gives a speech at the UN and you can’t help but cringe.  Maybe some people find this ‘so bad it’s good’ but it’s hard when nobody was even trying to make something good. Bryan Singer took a break from X-men to make his version of Superman in 2006.  It’s not terrible but did we really need to see Lois as a bitter single mother?  Brandon Routh is fine as Superman but he is off screen for long segments of time.  It really could be called Lois Lane Movie because of the focus given her. We get Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor who I thought was surprisingly flat in the role.  He’s kind of a bully to his assistant played by Parker Posey (who cries most of the film) and not a believable foe for Superman.  Maybe I just don’t like the character of Lex Luthor?  We’ll see if Batman v Superman can change my mind. It does have a nice look to it and some impressive sequences.  I particularly liked a scene where Superman stops a crashing plane.  I liked it visually but also because it took brains and brawn to make it happen.  That was cool twist for the character.  Overall not a terrible watch but a little bit dry. It does have many homages to the Donner films and I don’t know if it quite got that balance of originality vs reboot right? It’s tricky. Honestly it is the most divisive movie in history.  I have grown weary discussing it with people, but I must own I didn’t hate it this time around.  I was more ‘meh’.  It’s takes Superman into a scifi direction and then adds a disaster movie component.  I said while tweeting ‘it’s Superman if you combined Star Trek and San Andreas’ and I think that is accurate. I hate the flashback structure and it’s not that the destruction exists it’s just gratuitous and repetitive.   Do we need to destroy all of Smallville and then destroy building after building of Metropolis?  Couldn’t the point be made more succinctly?  They also screwed up Lois and Clark relationship. There is not near enough time with them together to believe their relationship or what happens/how she is used. Michael Shannon is fine as Zod and his motivations are interesting.  He is trying to save his people and I liked that.  I also love Henry Cavill who is a very beautiful man.  I just wish they gave us a few more moments like the kissing scene with him and Lois where he jokes about kissing an alien.  It doesn’t have to be a joke but the whole movie he seems depressed. The breaking of Zod’s neck makes sense in theory but it’s at the end of one building after another and it feels gratuitous after such exhaustion. Snyder needs to learn the art of subtlety and that sometimes less is more.  This includes his Messianic imagery.  This shot really captured the film for me.  Cavill- great. Snyder’s excess- not so great. And there you have it.  I oddly had more to say about the Superman films than Batman.  Go figure.  I hope you enjoyed all of them. I guess Superman 2, by default. The old ones don’t really hold up for me either and the newer ones are problematic, to say at least. I feel you should watch a few episodes of Superman: The Animated  Series to see the best of Lex Luthor. None  of the movies do him proper justice since they always make him eccentric. Superman never really caught much of my interest until recently, since he always seemed like he was perfect. I should probably watch Man of Steel before Batman vs Superman comes out. My mother and my older relatives watched the older Supermans whenever they were on, so I do remember some aspects of it. They were alright, but nothing of note to me. After researching Reeves a bit more about a month ago, I have a new appreciation though. I would definitely see Man of Steel before Batman v Superman because my understanding is part of Batman’s animosity towards Superman in the film is caused by the destruction of Metropolis in Man of Steel.  One of these days you should do forgotten characters to all these superhero movies. That would be interesting since we tend to only focus on the heroes.  Superman 2 is my favourite: it has the best story and the best villains. I haven’t seen the Richard Donner cut but I will one day. I’m planning on watching all of them to prepare for seeing Batman vs. Superman in the theater with a girl I have been talking to. And I’m only seeing it because she wants to (and she’s more into Batman than Superman), I don’t expect to like it very much.  Yeah, she was always trying to talk to me in school but I was afraid to talk to her but now after she graduated we got in touch with Facebook so it’s not too late. I haven’t seen the other guy I mentioned who invited me to his house for a while, because he stopped coming to school and didn’t respond to my text messages. And I failed the driver’s ed quiz again but I guess things are looking up because this time she’s in the mental hospital instead of me XD. And Man of Steel is a horrible nightmare of a film. I just got through watching it for the second time this morning and throughout the entire last third act of the movie I kept screaming “Just end!” Mindless CGI, no character development, bizarre narrative structure, mindless action and destruction that goes on longer than anyone is interested, multiple plotholes and instances of characters acting unbelievably stupid, none of the spirit of Superman. What’s to LIKE? And I actually enjoyed Superman Returns again. It wasn’t a good movie, but it at least had some of the spirit of the original films and it felt like the creators were actually trying to make a good movie. They just didn’t come up with an interesting threat and didn’t do anything interesting with the characters, and mostly just ripped off the first movie again. Superman III and Superman IV were too obviously bad to even be worth reviewing. They honestly felt more like Saturday morning cartoons or movie serials than feature-length films. I honestly am so tired of discussing Man of Steel. I don’t really like it and agree with you for the most part. I guess this watch through I tried to see it from others point of view. It’s basically an alien disaster movie but it isnt Superman to me. I’d still rather watch it than Batman v Superman because Zod is better than annoying Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and the plot made some sense.  I never watched Batman vs. Superman because the girl I was going to with said she was babysitting the day we would see it and said “I don’t know, I’m just a mess” to my question of whether we could see it the next Tuesday, then stopped replying to me on Facebook about that altogether. So I can’t really compare the two. Superman: The Movie is my fave. When I was a kid it was II. But, as I became an adult I appreciated Donner’s approach far more than Lester’s. More realistic and less goofy. Plus, I became a huge Margot Kidder fan and she looked the most beautiful of her career in the first one, especially during the date/interview scene.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2019"," A disappointing restart to a franchise that was at its best in the first two Christopher Reeve films in the late 1970s and early 1980s, “Man of Steel” ultimately fails because it forgets its origins. It’s a film full of angst and devoid of humor. It also proves to be nothing more than a 21/2 hour backstory, tracing the journey of Kal-El (Henry Cavill) from Krypton to Earth, where he is raised as Clark Kent by an unassuming midwest couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Ladd). As the young man journeys to discover himself, he is threatened by a castoff from his home planet, General Zod (Michael Shannon), who is intent on annihilating Earth. “Man of Steel” feels more like a chapter of “The Dark Knight” franchise than a Superman film – director Zack Synder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan went for a much darker tone. I found it to be rather off-putting, completely sucking the fun out of Superman. This is a superhero franchise that works best when it is lighter, with great interplay between Kent/Kal-El and Lois Lane (played here by Amy Adams). Part of the charm of the first two Reeves Superman films was that interplay, but this film opts for more CGI battles and brooding and less fun. I will say the cast is fine, considering the limitations of the script. Cavill settles in well in the title role, while Costner and Ladd have perhaps the film’s best moments. The final scene promises a bit of the Superman most people remember. It’s a good start for film No. 2. Hopefully “Man of Steel” can return more to its roots in that second film. Part parody of disaster movies, part satire of Hollywood elitism – the directorial debut of Seth Rogan (he co-directed and co-wrote with “Superbad” partner Evan Goldberg) is everything that “The Hangover Part III” failed to be. The premise is simple: Rogan and Jay Baruchel head over to a star-studded party at James Franco’s house, only to get trapped in the house with Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson when the apocalypse takes place. There are plenty of other celebrities who get in on the hijinks, including Michael Cera – playing a coked out version of himself – and Emma Watson, showing a bit of a comedic touch. Other cameos litter the film, including several surprises best left unspoiled. But just when you think the movie is at its creative end, then comes a wrap-up that is sure to leave a smile on your face. “This Is the End” is rated R for crude and sexual content throughout, brief graphic nudity, pervasive language, drug use and some violence and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 12 and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow. — To get sportswriter/movie reviewer Micheal Compton’s up-to-the minute thoughts on all things movies, visit his blog at mcompton.wordpress.com or his Twitter page at twitter.com/mcompton428.

"Feb 26, 2019"," Superman, who originally hails from both a different planet and a different era, is often a tough sell with modern audiences who’ve gotten used to conflicted heroes, anti-heroes and intriguing bad guys. Superman — with a smile and a cape, the embodiment of a certain kind of American ideal — is just so good. Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel splits Superman’s goodness into two threads: On one hand, he’s a young man who doubts humanity’s willingness to accept him. On the other, he’s alien Jesus. David S. Goyer’s screenplay (Christopher Nolan shares story credit) never passes up an opportunity to draw godlike parallels, whether emphasizing that Superman has been on the planet for 33 years or having young, bullied Clark throw himself against a fence, arms open wide. At a key point, Clark (played as an adult by the chiseled Henry Cavill) seeks the advice of a priest, who gives Clark his answers while lit by a glowing stained-glass vision of Jesus. This alien god has to choose to trust humanity. His nemesis will do no such thing. Man of Steel shares a villain with Superman II; here, General Zod is played by Michael Shannon with glower and goatee. Condemned by Kryptonian leaders and freed by Krypton’s demise, Zod makes his way to Earth to demand Superman’s surrender. He’s still angry about baby Kal-El’s escape, but Zod has also been bred to defend Krypton, and all that is left of his home planet is embodied by our hero. In fighting Zod, Superman fights a whole host of ideas about freedom; these don’t always fit together with the religious elements, but you can’t say Man of Steel isn’t ambitious in its themes, no matter how tangled they may be. It also ambitiously emphasizes the science fiction aspect of Superman’s story. A long prologue explaining how Superman came to be on Earth gives us a fascinating vision of Krypton. Dark, geological, unwelcoming, it’s full of caves and tunnels, genesis chambers where children are bred and flying beasts that look like they’re half dinosaur, half dragonfly. Kryptonite technology looks alien, but has an eerie biological streak. It’s deeply other — and so is our hero.  But like so much else, this idea fades out in the film’s endless last third, a parade of broken glass and demolished buildings. The scope is huge, but the imagery might’ve come from one of Michael Bay’s Transformers flicks, except that it lacks robots. Superman is willing to submit to Zod to save humanity, yet the rampant destruction of the finale suggests heavy casualties that the movie pretends don’t exist. This thoughtlessness undermines the movie’s quieter, more effective moments, and runs counter to Superman’s driving savior complex.  Man of Steel isn’t going to win over those who are indifferent about Superman, but it does set the stage for Adams and Cavill to develop their chemistry, for Clark’s journalist alter-ego to emerge, and for future films with more interest in character than in spectacle (maybe they could take a page or several from Grant Morrison’s All-Star Superman). Cavill, who has an interesting, muscular stillness, is at his best when Kal-El is learning, not brawling; the movie’s neglected heart is his need to reconcile his origins and his upbringing — to learn to be Clark and Superman. MAN OF STEEL: Directed by Zack Snyder. Screenplay by David S. Goyer; story by Goyer and Christopher Nolan, based on characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster. Cinematography, Amir Mokri. Editor, David Brenner. Music, Hans Zimmer. Starring Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Diane Lane. Warner Bros., 2013. PG-13. 143 minutes. Three stars.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2019"," Sadly, screenwriter David Goyer seems to be making it up as he’s going along, throwing random robotic tentacles into the mix and forcing a relationship between Clark and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) that he doesn’t bother to build up to. The editing is similarly woeful, flicking from the past to the present to Zod knows where, with chunks of scenes seemingly being ripped out; Snyder carries on regardless, hoping, perhaps, that nobody will notice. In terms of performances, Shannon is no great shakes as the shouty villain and Adams does little with a thankless role. As for Cavill, he certainly looks the part but lacks crucial charm and charisma, surely the two essential qualities any ‘Man of Steel’ needs.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 22, 2019"," As much as I was looking forward to the most anticipated movie event of the year, “Man of Steel,” I was nervous with all the hype and especially with Zack Snyder (“300,” “Watchmen”), who is known for visual overload, at the director’s chair. But when I caught a footage shown at the 2012 Comic-Con, I thought this retooling of Superman had a chance to be awe-inspiring. Christopher Nolan, director of the groundbreaking Batman trilogy, acting as producer, might have a hand in grounding “Man of Steel” in reality. “Man of Steel” revolves around the issue of what would happen if Superman really did exist in real life, in our time. Unlike Batman, Superman has never been a dark character, but he’s hard to capture because of his perfect nature. Superman is an ideal that people strive to. The team of Synder, Nolan and David S. Goyer (writer) turn out to be a winning combination. The origin story doesn’t depart from the fundamentals, but it realistically tells a story that makes sense. It manages to tell a story about how this god-like being is not perfect. He is, instead, conflicted and alienated. He is struggling to trust, adjust and find his place in the world. The film balances the lighter nature of Superman with a darker reality of being an alien superhero in the gritty 21st century. “Man of Steel” revolutionizes Superman like “Batman Begins” did with Batman. The result is utterly phenomenal. “Man of Steel” first introduces us to Krypton; a whole other world alien to us, like Asgard in “Thor.” Baby Kal-El (future Clark Kent and Superman) is the son of Jor-El (Russell Crowe, “The Next Three Days“) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer); the first natural birth on Krypton in centuries. Kryptonians are artificially engineered, bred for a special purpose in their multi-layered robe and cape-wearing society, such as warrior, worker or leader. General Zod (Michael Shannon , “Premium Rush“) and his crew are exiled after staging a coup against the ruling council and facing off with Chief Scientist Jor-El. Ironically, because they’re banished from the doomed planet, they are the ones who survive when Krypton bursts into flames. Jor-El and Lara launch baby Kal-El to earth, bringing along Codex with him, the DNA code of Kryptonians. On Earth the scene opens with an adult Clark Kent (Henry Cavill, “Immortals“), a scruffy drifter and loner, hitchhiking and working odd jobs. While he’s anonymously doing some life-saving work during an oil rig explosion, we see flashbacks to his troubled childhood and adolescence. The special relationships between Clark and his parents, Jonathan (Kevin Costner, “The Company Men“) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane, “Under the Tuscan Sun“) are poignantly shown in a number of touching moments. An event that results in a painful personal loss could spark a debate of what Clark should have done. Alone and bullied, the lonely kid grows up being different, isolated because of the need to keep his superpowers a secret. The scenes are truly heartfelt and  it’s believable to see how unsettling it is to be so powerful yet powerless. He is shown as being confused and trying to control his overwhelming powers, having to hide his  identity while saving lives and pretending to be a normal kid. Fear of the unknown is a powerful thing and if the world is not ready, getting discovered could mean that Clark would be trapped and experimented on. Clark has to decide what kind of man he wants to become, and never doubt that eventually the time will come where he will have to decide what kind of world he chooses to live in. He will have to make a choice, and sacrifice, if he intends to become greater than society intends him to be. There’s a reason that he’s put on Earth and it is his destiny to change the world. In the Arctic Clark runs into Lois Lane (Amy Adams, “Leap Year“) for the first time. She’s there to investigate a spacecraft buried in ice. In the spacecraft, Clark encounters the spirit of his biological father and comes to terms with his identity and destiny. His journey as Superman begins. His first flight (and stumble) traipsing the varied landscapes of earth and soaring into space is divinely exhilarating. As far as Lois goes, she’s more than a love interest, or even a Pulitzer-winning reporter; she’s proactive and very involved in the world’s affairs, an active participant and a confidant right from the start. She’s someone with whom the private, guarded Clark/Superman, in all his extraordinary strength and vulnerability, can simply be himself. She is actually someone that Superman couldn’t help but fall for. When General Zod finds that Kal-El has been living his whole life on Earth, he and his army, led by ruthless Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), comes calling and demands that earthlings surrender him. What’s unique about Zod here is that he doesn’t have a villain’s typical motivation to conquer Earth. His motivation is refreshingly understandable and there’s a strange sense of honor in his brutally deplorable actions. The newly minted Superman must take a leap of faith and lead the way. As a symbol of hope, he must decide whether to trust and protect the skeptical humans, or join his own people and ensure the survival of his race. Spectacular destruction and explosions ensue; fiery all-out war on an unprecedented scale, surpassing even “The Avengers.” While they could seem repetitive for some, the extent of decimation is plausible when alien superpowers collide. Interestingly, the end of Zod ends on a personally agonizing note, but it fits with the theme of this film. Casting is absolutely impeccable. Cavill’s path to don the cape has been paved with trials. He was the guy who lost out. He first auditioned for the Superman role with one director over a decade ago. He was so close to being Edward Cullen in “Twilight” and lost out to Robert Pattinson. Again, he came so close to being James Bond and lost out to Daniel Craig. And finally, so close to being Superman himself and lost out to Brandon Routh when the project switched director. As it turns out, he was destined to be Superman. The guy who lost out is the right guy after all, a winner by all accounts with his human portrayal as Clark Kent, the last son of Krypton and savior of mankind. A real Man of Steel, Cavill carries the weight of the iconic superhero’s future franchise and potential for the all-star ensemble Justice League movie. In some ways, Christopher Reeve will forever be Superman, but Cavill is the Superman for this generation.  He is exactly how I’d imagine Superman would be, even without the suit. “Man of Steel” is grandeur and epic, but it’s also deep and personal. The vast scope, intense and extensive battles, modernized suit, extravagant visual effects and thunderous score are amazing, but it’s the powerfully realistic story that makes this Superman able to be related to, and thus an enduring superhero. The closing scene is perfect and shows great promise of what’s to come. Nathalia Aryani is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic (rottentomatoes.com/critic/nathalia-aryani).

"Jan 14, 2019"," 

	The problem with Superman has always been that the ability to lovingly accept him demands a lack of cynicism—something that we have in abundance, more and more every day. Yet fans of DC’s proclaimed “Boy Scout” are typically capable of casting off that mantel of suspicion when they talk about Clark Kent. And Man of Steel’s job, as a film, was to see if it could get the rest of the world to do the same, to remind us what makes him the first superhero who’s name every child learns.

	So I’ll spare you the suspense: It succeeds.


	The movie lays the foundation for Clark’s story much in the same way Donner’s film did in ’78, but the development of special effects since then has led to a meticulously rendered Krypton that promptly sucks the viewer in. The world and Kal-El’s people are gorgeously realized here, with more respect given to his alien origins than ever seen on film. One can only help thinking that if George Lucas had designed the Star Wars prequels with the same age-old, worn qualities that audiences might have been a bit more forgiving of their flaws. Russell Crowe’s touching portrayal as Jor-El is a stand-out in the film for sure, with all the poise and sageness expected of a Kyptonian, but a lack of coldness that some interpretations cleave to.

	There is a dream-like quality to the narrative, particularly in the first half of the movie. Clark’s current journey is interspersed with glimpses of his past, all of them painful and poignant, giving us an understanding of what shaped the character of the adult we see on screen. Henry Cavill is nothing short of enchanting, in ways that many may not have expected. While he has summoned all the boyish charm and goodness of Christopher Reeve (who he was always going to be compared to), he has suffused the character with a tangible sadness that tweaks an empathetic nerve. His fight with General Zod, while seeming perhaps a bit generic at the start is given surprising dimension by the end, particularly by way of understanding the General’s stakes in this tale. The themes of the film all ring true, and director Zack Snyder does an excellent job at juxtaposition in key moments. Particularly places where we see ordinary humans doing extraordinary things at the same time that Superman accomplishes something on our behalf: We are witnessing the many reasons why he wants to protect us as he is working to do so.

	In Amy Adams, Lois Lane has finally been awarded a portrayal that is worthy of all the inspiration she has provided over the years. Adams’ Lane is Pulitzer Prize-winning, absolutely no-nonsense, and imbued with all the courage required of her job description. Her decisions throughout the film frequently drive the plot, and her compassion rivals even that of Superman. Through all of this, the match seems a given rather than an awkward, swoony crush on a handsome stranger. Her connection with Clark grows throughout the film so naturally that it’s hardly a wonder they fall for each other. This is a romance that builds first upon trust, and that is a refreshing stance to take in a summer blockbuster, where relationships are often shoehorned in and barely a secondary concern, at least in terms of logical progression.



	It is odd to say that in this era of superhero cinema saturation, a film about the “most American” superhero seems to have the most global consciousness. We see more of how the entire planet gets caught up in Zod’s attack, and while Supes does hail from Kansas (and writer David S. Goyer has said in an interview that future DC movies will not ignore the fallout created by the world’s first super being claiming America as his home), he never spouts any odd jingoist rhetoric about U.S. values.

	There are a few unfortunates in the film: the “shaky cam” technique is used to death, to the point of potentially causing nausea, particularly in scenes that do not seem to warrant it. I advise people who are susceptible to motion sickness to sit further back in the theater to prevent focusing issues. More importantly, because Snyder is known for overdrawn action sequences, the film simply has too many of them. They take up too much time, precious minutes that would have been better spent getting to know Clark Kent better. What’s more frustrating is how similar the fights are—by the end they begin to wear on the viewer’s patience in a big way.

	Superman’s last fight with Zod, though. Ugh, it hurts. It hurts beautifully.

	In many ways the movie reads more like a piece of epic mythology when compared to other superhero romps, which couldn’t be more apt. This is an origin story that is rooted outside the actions of one—Clark Kent is not really even the central figure molding it. As such, we are left wanting more of him than the film gives us, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It simply means that we need another film. Good thing the sequel is already greenlit.

	Despite some flaws in the action, Man of Steel is a powerful opener to the DC pantheon of superheroes, and instantly prompts a desire for more. And in an age where it is so easy to be cynical about the red “S,” the insistence that the film makes over its meaning rings truer than ever.

	After all, we cannot afford to be cynical about hope.


Emmet Asher-Perrin just needs a sequel with Lex Luthor now, please. (There is totally a LexCorp logo in the film, btw.) She was recently on the Geeks Guide to the Galaxy podcast talking about Star Trek Into Darkness, and an essay of hers can be found in the newly released Queers Dig Time Lords.

"Dec 12, 2018"," Zack Snyder blends together the traditional “comic book” film with a sci-fi backdrop, political themes, and a strong adherence to the legacy and lore of Superman. From creating and displaying a distinctly beautiful Krypton, setting up a villain in Zod with true movivations that go beyond the “good vs evil” trope, and proving some of the greatest action sequences ever seen in a comic book film, Man of Steel truly delivers on multiple levels. Henry Cavill fits into the role of Superman perfectly with a mix of heartfelt, stoic and epic character moments. By concentrating on displaying Superman’s most human elements without disregarding his alien birthright, Cavill has set the stage for himself to be Superman for years to come. To give a small background, I have been a Superman fan all my life. Growing up in the late 90s, most of my reading came heavily from that era going forward. As a Superman fan and long time reader, there are a few major takeaways from Zack Snyder’s version of Kal-El. Snyder perfectly combined elements of the Post-Crisis Superman while respecting the legacy from the Golden & Silver Ages to create the most comic accurate Superman film of all time. While this Superman draws from mostly Post-Crisis Superman, from Byrne’s Man of Steel run to stories like Birthright and Earth One, his Superman also has a Golden Age stoic nature to him, without losing a Silver Age charm. For me, Zack Snyder’s Superman is a great amalgamation of the 75 years of legacy, lore and heroics that preceded it. Man of Steel kicks off the DCEU in the best way, introducing a Superman into a world that was not ready for him. By challenging the world to answer the question of Superman, challenging Superman to answer his own purpose, and challenging the audience to think beyond the level of a normal comic book film, Man of Steel sets the stage for what is to come. Man of Steel does not pull any punches literally or metaphorically. Up until this point, we never truly got to see the raw power of Superman like we did in the Comics or Animated series. While Donner’s Superman made the world believe a man could fly, Man of Steel showed that Superman is truly the most powerful character in Comics. For fans, Snyder drivers on some of the most visually pleasing, exhilarating fight sequences in film history, all backed with a bombastic score by Hans Zimmer which is my personal favorite soundtrack of all time. As said above, Snyder’s Superman does not pull any punches. While we covered how this accounts for amazing fight sequences and awesome displays of power, it is just as important to address the “why” of Superman. The world’s perception of Superman is just as important as Superman’s perception of the the world. While many recognize the utopian figure that is Superman, it is important to realize that Clark, a man who grew up among us, is just as human as us. This accounts for all the fears, imperfections, flaws and potential that comes with being “human.” In fact, that is the whole point of his natural birth. It makes it clear Superman can not be a cookie cutter perfect character. He needs to make mistakes in order to succeed and needs to fall before he can rise. The moment he kills Zod to save Earth, his scream shows how agonizing it was for him. As we see in future films, this plays into his character development. In short, Man of Steel simply delivers on what it is trying to accomplish. It rebooted Superman for a new generation. It brought it new and old fans alike and made them gravitate to this character even more. It delivered on some of the greatest action sequences in film and balances it out with some of the most heartwarming and hopeful sequences as well. The character of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman is the most comic accurate version ever brought to the scene with respect it to the lore and legacy that he embodies. It made Lois Lane, Martha Kent more than just the damsel in distress or Clark’s mother. It made them multi dimensional, powerful characters with their own agency and their own purpose. It has a villain that didn’t see itself as one. General Zod doesn’t have a blind ambition to take over the world, he wants to do whatever it takes to protect his people. An extension of the blind nationalism we see today but not without a sense of understanding of his mindset and his soul. Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel is my favorite comic book film of all time. It’s the quintessential Superman film and one that I will forever cherish. Man of Steel is the film that made me like Superman for more than just another character. I’ve always been a fan of Batman, but this movie/masterpiece delivered something I was not expecting. And like you said, “challenging the audience to think beyond the level of a normal comic book film” is exactly what I had to do once leaving the cinema back in 2013. I hope Zack Snyder knows how much this film and BvS and Justice League mean to us. Thank you for this truthful and well thought out review.",POSITIVE
"Dec 8, 2018"," It’s fair to say that Superman’s outings on the big screen over the years have been to varying degrees of success. Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980) were both, generally speaking, excellent works – expertly navigating the fine line between the wondrous and the kitsch in a conceit about a man clad in blue lycra, with a red cape and a Herculean “S” emblazoned on his chest. The films featured iconic John Williams scores; the first film’s opening Krypton scene with Marlon Brando and Susannah York was a sumptuous visual feast of lighting and design (something that might have inspired future Man of Steel producer, Christopher Nolan); Christopher Reeve got the Clark Kent/Superman dichotomy bang on, and Terence Stamp provided one of the great, camp supervillain performances. But while pretty much every other superhero conceivable has received some form of cinematic injection of life in the intervening 40 years, Superman has been allowed to stagnate. The Reeve iteration spluttered to an ignominious death with two woeful mid-’80s sequels, and Bryan Singer’s reboot Superman Returns (2006) was immediately tagged as a critical and commercial failure, though many commentators now cast this Brandon Routh anomaly in a much more favourable light. Man of Steel (2013) had something of an uphill struggle when it hit our cinemas four summers ago. Audiences were awash with popular superhero sagas (and blockbuster franchises, in general) at various stages of their runs, and it’s fair to say that the overwhelming millennial fanbase may have found the religious overtones of a messianic outsider with unambiguous, teutonic powers far less engaging than the very adolescent and angsty concerns of Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne respectively. The fact that Christopher Nolan, fresh from his genre-defining Dark Knight trilogy, was only on board as producer, and that the unheralded Brit Henry Cavill had been cast in the main role, all led to a feeling that Man of Steel was going to have a struggle on its hands to convince audiences and critics alike. The opening stretch of Man of Steel certainly doesn’t go very far to alleviate those concerns. Charting Kal-El’s birth and subsequent flight from the dying planet of Krypton, the film is subsumed in some of the crappiest CGI imaginable, echoing the Star Wars prequel trilogy at its worst. The scene where Michael Shannon’s General Zod ambushes the Krypton government is leaden and wholly unconvincing, and the escape of Jor-El (Russell Crowe) from said ambush, thanks to some naff dragon, conjures unflattering imaginings of some execrable NeverEnding Story/Star Wars mashup. Man of Steel doesn’t get much better when it hits planet Earth. The opening reveal of Kal-El as a grown man is sheer farce: there is absolutely no subtlety or buildup regarding his powers, as he’s immediately thrust into an epic saga of saving men on a burning oil rig, replete with walking through fire and lifting the whole rig out of its moorings. So far, so bad – but then something strange happens. Man of Steel suddenly becomes a meditative and cerebrally structured film. The flashbacks juxtaposing Kal-El’s reconciliation of his powers with his present-day crisis of conscience over assuming the mantle of humanity’s saviour (the “Superman” moniker is never directly mentioned) is stellar stuff. It’s clearly got the whiff of Nolan about it. All his films have used fractured chronology – often in very short, jagged cuts – to suggest the way the past informs the present. It’s almost as if Man of Steel’s structure acts as a microcosm for both the profoundly philosophical and the profoundly thuggish dialectic at the heart of the Superman legend. It’s Proust as written by Jerry Bruckheimer; In Search of Lost Time wedged inside the grammar of a brutally philistine action movie. Man of Steel manufactures a very strange sensory experience – a militaristic tone poem – and Zack Snyder’s material direction and Hans Zimmer’s pulverising score are fitting emblems for such a reading. The adult Clark Kent receiving counsel from a priest merges lyrically to a scene of his younger self being bullied while reading Plato (an ingenious touch). And then there’s the key sequence where Clark receives his crucial final “lesson” from his father – which, incidentally, is a cracking little cameo from Kevin Costner. While the adult Clark is ruminating at his father’s grave, a flashback reveals the cause of his father’s passing. It’s all very figurative, but it’s a quite brilliant concept, as Pa Kent is sucked into a void in front of Clark’s eyes. It comes moments after one final argument over Clark’s responsibilities, with his surrogate father demonstrating the very selflessness needed to be a hero. It’s a scene that takes dramatic licence to its extremes, but it’s a staggeringly clever visual metaphor, and Snyder – in a very loud movie – slows and quietens his diegesis right down here to communicate an abstract and moving idea. Man of Steel‘s other great asset is Henry Cavill. Sure, he may have been neutered and diluted amid the later, wider narrative canvas of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but here he is an assured and convincing centre of attention. He looks the part, with his suitably old-fashioned, classically heroic physique and facial features. It’s obviously implicit in the character, but it’s refreshing how Cavill eschews camp and is undemonstrative; a world away from the zany neuroses and tics of the majority of other superheroes and their alter-egos. In addition to Cavill and Costner, Man of Steel features an array of experienced Hollywood pros – Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane – who seem to “get” the ethos of the production. Their unfussiness and subservience to the plot mirrors Snyder’s industrial, yet plaintive, ambience. Compare this to the showmanship and lustre of the ensemble in Christopher Nolan’s last Batman work, The Dark Knight Rises (Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman), and you see the difference. At the centre of all that is good about Man of Steel is Cavill, and he is a fitting icon for this in many ways unusual film, which deserves much greater critical appreciation than it has currently received.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 21, 2018","  OK, fine; those lines from “Macbeth” are actually meant to describe life itself. But the Bard’s words came to mind as soon as I watched the credits roll on “Man of Steel.” And reflecting more generally on the billions of dollars of entertainment that Hollywood is offering audiences this summer, they seem particularly prescient.
  “Man of Steel” serves as an epitome of what takes over theaters in the months we’re most in need of their air-conditioned environs. Zack Snyder’s 2006 battle epic “300” changed the way many action films are now made, and his reboot of the “Superman” saga has been one of the most anticipated films of the year. But “Man of Steel” is a completely conventional piece of work, adding nothing new to the genre of superhero action flicks that arrive like clockwork every summer. Sure, it gives us plenty of big things to look at: vehicles, explosions, the hero’s biceps. But a few banal lines of dialogue here and there suggesting that all the death and destruction is being portrayed for a deeper purpose aren’t enough to justify $225 million — or nearly two and a half hours of your time.
  This reboot is an origin story, and it starts right at the beginning: A woman is giving birth to the baby who will become the Man of Steel. It’s the planet Krypton’s first natural birth in centuries, the father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), says, which makes the infant, Kal-El, the only Kryptonian not born to serve in a government-defined role. But the baby isn’t long for Krypton. The scientist Jor-El sends him — along with the “codex” of all possible Kryptonian DNA — to Earth just before the planet implodes.
  A few other Kryptonians have survived, however: criminals sent into exile, like General Zod (Michael Shannon), a nasty military leader who launched an unsuccessful coup just before the planet fell apart. He’s determined to find Kal-El and, along with him, the DNA to create a new Krypton.
  Thank goodness the baby’s spacecraft landed in the Midwest. He’s adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and instilled with the kind of values that will keep him from becoming a megalomaniacal maniac who would use his powers for evil. Clark Kent’s father insists the world isn’t ready to meet an alien with super strength, even if he is an inveterate do-gooder. He instructs his son to keep his talents secret, even if it means letting innocent people die.
  But the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) can’t quite manage it, and the reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is soon on his trail. And then Zod is, too, threatening to destroy humanity if Clark doesn’t surrender — or if humanity doesn’t surrender to him.
  It’s a variation on the dilemma posed to passengers of two ferries in “The Dark Knight.” “Knight” director Christopher Nolan helped develop the story for “Man of Steel,” but his ideas, if any remained, are rendered into platitudes mouthed unconvincingly by various characters, as when the Kansas farmer Jonathan Kent tells his son he will one day challenge what it means to be human.
  Much time was spent bulking up Cavill, and the effect certainly seems worth the effort. But perhaps some of that energy should have been put into the screenplay. When it’s not boring — I liked the fight in the air better when Clive Owen did it to the sounds of AC/DC in “Shoot ‘Em Up” — “Man of Steel” is either nonsensical or preposterous. (Or pointless, like the 3-D added in postproduction.) Jor-El talks a lot of bloodlines and insists Kryptonians be born free to pursue their own paths, not those assigned to them at birth. But he constantly demands that his son be the leader of an alien race that doesn’t even know of his existence. No one can figure out what Jor-El did with the codex until one of the bad guys suddenly just realizes where it must be. A government scientist informs us the Kryptonians have begun “terraforming” Earth to suit themselves, which makes no sense.
  Cavill does the best with what he’s been given. He’s mostly meant to look strong and serious, and he does. Shannon’s work here is just embarrassing — I expect a clip of him shouting, “NoooOOooooOoo!” to make it onto YouTube soon. Adams starts out a gutsy, daredevil reporter, only to spend the rest of the movie staring adoringly at Superman. The movie didn’t need to be nearly two and a half hours, either. The ending is particularly ridiculous, with a series of lines that the screenwriters obviously liked but couldn’t fit in anywhere else.
  I call the character Superman, but this reboot tells us the symbol on his inexplicable costume isn’t an “S” but the sign for “hope” on Krypton. But “Man of Steel” offers little hope that Hollywood will soon focus its vast resources on doing good.

"Nov 21, 2018"," Movie fans have always had a fascination with superheroes. For decades, we have suspended our disbelief while the web-slinger netted villains, the Dark Knight sped through Gotham, and the Man of Steel leapt tall buildings in a single bound. In the '90s, it was rumored that every single episode of Seinfeld—at Jerry’s insistence—had a visual or verbal reference to Superman. Everybody—and by everybody, I mean men between the ages of 18 and 36—loves superhero movies. And while this movie packs all the talent, special effects and gloss one would expect of a film with this budget and production team, something, unquestionably, is missing. Unfortunately, the movie lacks romance both in the broad and narrow sense of the word. In the broad sense, this film has none of the light-hearted, wink-and-a-smile aplomb we’ve come to associate with Superman. This movie is a darker, more introspective imagining focusing more on Superman’s character development than his one-liners. In the narrower sense of romance, the Superman-Lois Lane relationship lacks the spark and adrenaline bubbling over in every other aspect of the movie. Otherwise, the movie is stylish, entertaining, suspenseful and spectacular…oh and it’s also two hours and 28 minutes long. It would be nice to save the world and get the girl in less than two hours. It’s a 7.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2018"," Superman has had an interesting career in the film industry. Richard Donner’s Superman was the first film to translate a comic book to the big screen and do it well, setting the standard for all to come and still holds up to this day despite its occasional lapses into goofiness. Superman II was enjoyable as well, but III was bad and IV: The Quest for Peace is arguably the worst superhero film ever made. After taking leave from the movie world for a while, Bryan Singer brought the hero back in Superman Returns to mixed results from fans (I, personally, think it’s pretty good and anyone who still feels differently should probably give it another shot from a different perspective). But how does Man of Steel fare? Does it soar to heights never reach by its predecessors, or is The Man of Tomorrow yesterday’s news? The film’s story covers the basics that everyone and their dog knows about the story of Superman, but introduces enough new ideas and twists on familiar elements to keep it fresh. But on the whole, this is a fairly familiar plot on both a superhero and science-fiction level. It’s well done, but anyone can see the general direction this film is going in. The first act of the movie feels a bit jumbled, moving too fast and throwing so much exposition in your face that some may get lost in the shuffle. But by the time Kal-El dons the familiar blue tights, the film gets itself on the right track and works from there. The filmmakers have been making it clear they wanted to make a Superman that was more relatable and made more sense in a modern context. On that level, they’ve succeeded admirably. The events surrounding his reveal to the world and how they react fits with reality and the times we live in. But for a film that crosses the two hour mark, the lack of character development is disappointing. We get a general idea of who Kal-El and Lois and Zod and Jor-El are, but there is so much more they could have done but just don’t. What’s there is good but needs more built on top of it. Instead, Snyder fills the rest of the runtime with action spectacle. Good action, yes, but action doesn’t hold a candle to a well told story and fleshed out characters. The final act of the film is so packed with non-stop action that it starts to lose its lustre and becomes a bit stayed. After many complained that Returns was boring and needed more action, they’ve overcompensated and made a film with far too much action and a lack of patience. Man of Steel boasts an impressive cast, and they all perform well with the material. Cavill looks the part as Superman, sounds the part and, thankfully, can act the part. He’s no Christopher Reeve, but who is? He certain embodies the character much more than Brandon Routh did (and I liked his performance). Amy Adams is a perfect fit for Lois Lane, providing that spunky charm and sheer determination the character is known for, though her romantic chemistry with Cavill feels a little too spontaneous. Michael Shannon is an imposing General Zod and he is clearly enjoying the opportunity to go crazy, but he lacks the menacing stoicness that made Terence Stamp’s Zod such an iconic villain (that and Shannon never gets to say “KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!!!). Antje Traue is a big surprise as Faora (basically the same character as Ursa from Superman II), often outshining even the mighty Shannon at points. Russell Crowe has more screen time than you’d expect and provides Jor-El with much more depth than the great but disinterested Marlon Brando did. Everyone else is good, but none really stand out as much as the aforementioned five. The film’s marketing has been mostly presenting this film as a sombre, emotional piece more in line with a Christopher Nolan film. Don’t let that fool you. This is a Zack Snyder film, and that is plainly obvious from very early on. Whilst he does manage to avoid using his usual tropes, Snyder does rely heavily on his visuals and that is where his influence is mainly felt. Snyder has made the decision to shoot the entire film handheld, one that gives the film a very raw feel that mostly works to film’s advantage but does occasionally fall into the shaky-cam trap. Hans Zimmer’s score is suitably bombastic and fits the tone of the film, but nothing still beats the classic John Williams theme (my favourite film theme of all time). The production design emphasises the alien nature of the Kryptonians much more than previous adaptations but to mixed results. As cool as some of the technology looks, some of it comes across a bit silly (I’m looking at you, Kryptonian Supreme Council of Stupid Hats). Man of Steel is nothing groundbreaking. It’s fun popcorn entertainment, just with a bit more effort and thought put into it than your average summer blockbuster. It sits on par with Superman Returns for me, but they are both good movies for completely different reasons. I know they were going for a completely different feel from the previous films, but I can’t help but feel that the original Superman is still the superior film. If this is to be the beginning of the DC Cinematic Universe, they’ve made a good start but next time around they need to calm down and tell a story more through character than through action. In their attempts to make Superman more modern and badass, they’ve lost what Superman truly represents as a character and what set Donner’s original film apart from every superhero film that has followed it: heart.",POSITIVE
"Oct 30, 2018"," ""… It forgets to give the new Kal-El (muscle-bound Henry Cavill) a single recognizable emotion, save The Dark Knight’s all-purpose brood—which isn’t going to cut it when our S-clad hero, more than any other, has to inspire a gushing citywide love (so well-captured in the Koch-era original)."" ""But he's been transformed into the latest in a long line of soul-searching super-brooders, trapped between his devastated birth planet of Krypton and his adopted new home on Earth. He's just another haunted outsider grappling with issues."" ""Blessed with the most classically chiseled jawline of any actor who’s yet donned the red cape, Cavill is also the most dour and brooding, lacking even the sardonic self-amusement of Christian Bale in Bruce Wayne mode."" Director Zack Snyder's take on Superman isn't perfect — we'll get to that later — but it's definitely entertaining and should hit the projected $100 million number opening weekend. ""He's [Clark Kent] wondering, 'What is my purpose?' We all ask that of ourselves, but it's harder for Clark because the things that he's best at are also the things that are most frightening about him to others; knowledge of his existence would call into question everything we know about who we are. So he's on his own, trying to find out what his place is in the world, where he belongs, what is his destiny. I think the audience will relate because most of us share those same questions and insecurities when we are starting out in life."" The story line's resonance with real-world issues comes across while listening to the sage wisdom of Superman's dad (Kevin Costner) who forces Clark to hide his powers — and true self — from the people of Earth. Though we know papa Kent is doing his fatherly duties to protect his adopted son, his controlling presence in Clark's life comes across as if he's slightly embarrassed by the repercussions of people knowing about his son's differences. But when your adopted parents are telling you to hide the special attribute that makes you unique, and you can't answer back to the bullies who constantly refer to you as a freak — who could blame him? By the end of the nearly two-and-a-half hour film, after he gets the iconic Superman suit and assimilates, Cavill looks closer to the Superman figure we're more familiar with as he tosses some clever asides to generals and Lois Lane (Amy Adams).",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2018"," When did people stop believing that a man could fly?  Somewhere in the last couple of decades, the world became a much more bitter place, therefore leaving Superman, the most iconic symbol of hope remaining in the fictional world, essentially buried and forgotten. Sure, he has popped up here and there, most notably in 2006’s Superman Returns and TV’s Smallville, but the gravity-defying heights that Christopher Reeve placed the character at have not been seen since the early 80’s.  Somewhere around there, people simply stopped believing in the indestructible Boy Scout. In comes Christopher Nolan and David Goyer.  They understand reviving dormant characters who have taken a drastic turn for the worse as they saved Batman from the likes of The Schumacher.  With director Zack Snyder placed firmly at the helm, their choice was to make Superman more lost, more conflicted, as he struggles to find a world that will accept him as their own…even as he clearly is not from here.  That is where our Man of Steel resides, in this somewhat dire world that is more modeled on our current state of affairs than anything planted in the comic book cosmos. When his home planet of Krypton is seized by the tyrannical General Zod (Michael Shannon), Superman’s real father, Jor-El(Russell Crowe), rockets his newborn baby boy to the nearest habitable planet – Earth, minutes before Krypton’s destruction.  Here, a quiet and decent farm couple in the form of the Kent’s (played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) find Kal-El and decide to raise him as their own Clark Kent.  You really cannot do much better than these two as parents; decent, kind and ridiculously attractive. The Kent’s instill a sense of decency and honor into their adopted immigrant, all-the-while reminding him that he must keep his true identity a secret, for the world is just not ready to understand.  The ‘origin’ portion of the story is told in flashbacks, which means we already find Clark (Henry Cavill) grown up and already roaming the world, searching for his true path. When a mysterious ship is found, Clark is forced to confront his past in order to understand his future.  Along for the journey is Lois Lane (Amy Adams) as the investigative reporter she has always been, showcasing a conflicted view of whether or not the world is ready for the story of an alien with chiseled features living among us.  When General Zod and his crew find Earth and come calling for Kal-El’s head, her hand is unfortunately tipped and Superman is forced to show the world the very definition of hero. Firstly – Cavill is a great choice for Superman.  Brandon Routh did a nice job in Returns of mimicking Christopher Reeve, but Cavill makes the character his own.  He showcases a Superman we have never seen on the big screen (I say big screen because Smallville did tackle some of these issues, they are not ‘new’), and he embodies the character with understandable doubt about his place in the world.  And when he finally becomes the man that both of his fathers have always thought he could be, well this is a Superman I would proudly stand behind. The other characters in the film truly serve as little more than pieces of the puzzle for Clark’s world.  His two dad’s, Crowe and Costner, were both great in their respective roles.  As the two men who help define America’s greatest hero, they both handle their end with grace and pride.  Crowe is a man aware of what his son will be capable of on Earth, while Costner is a man of Earth and understands how his people react…to pretty much anything they do not understand.  If I were lost on a journey of life, these are the two I would want guiding me. Adams as Lois handles herself well, but there honestly was very little chemistry between her and Cavill.  Their romantic angle seems a little forced, but thankfully the film truly is not about that just yet, so they have time to grow into it.  As a character, she is a determined and reputable reporter and Adams was a good choice.  Diane Lane as Ma Kent was also solid, though she had much less to do other than serve as a catalyst for a sweet action scene.  And let me tell you, it takes a lot of makeup professionals to make Diane Lane look homely, but they manage to pull it off.  That should be an Oscar in itself. Michael Shannon as Zod I am conflicted on.  There are moments in the film where his performance is riveting and gut-wrenching…and then others where his line reading is atrocious.  Overall, his role is to be very angry and demanding and generally he handles it well.  But if I were to pick one weak link in the film, Shannon would be it in a heartbeat. The only other concerns were with the director, Zack Snyder.  His reliance on tracking then ZOOM shots is done to distracting measures here.  I understand the choice, and at first it works great…until it is in almost every scene.  Snyder has always been a ‘visual’ director, meaning he focuses on visuals before all other things, including story.  Man of Steel is no different.  The last fight went on WAY too long and the blatant product placement (Look!  We’re at the IHOP…AGAIN!)  and a few scenes of very poorly written dialogue will make you chuckle, but shouldn’t take you out of the film. His choice to use flashback’s to tell the origin story was also a little jumbled but does come together a bit in the end. That said, the first time Superman takes flight is one of the most fist-pumping scenes on celluloid I can recall and Snyder finally did what even Donner could not do: He took me into the eyes of what it would be like if a man truly could fly.  And when the fighting does begin, no matter how long, it is the first time we truly get to see what Superman can really do on screen.  So overall, despite the concerns expressed a paragraph ago, Snyder did a solid job and could see him growing into this franchise. So there you have it.  Man of Steel is a slightly flawed and far from perfect modern telling of the Superman myth, but ultimately is a fun and engrossing reinterpretation of the character.  There are some tweaks here and they are, in my opinion, for the better.  You will find no bumbling Kent nor Kryptonite in this film, this is strictly Superman finding himself.  A modern Superman for today’s conflicted world.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2018"," There's really only one reason to see the new Superman movie: to watch people with superhuman powers pounding the crap out of each other, flying into each other and burninating each other with heat vision. Luckily, The Man of Steel more than delivers on the super-punching front, even as it muddles through in other ways. Seriously, the action scenes in this movie are fantastic. They're like a virtuoso performance, a dissertation in smackdownology. Especially the final 40 minutes or so, when Superman and his fellow Kryptonians are just kicking the shit out of each other. There's an agility and abandon to the fighting in this movie that's really beautiful to watch, and director Zack Snyder and his crew have clearly thought a lot about the physics of how people who could fly and punch super hard would actually fight. This is probably the first superhero movie that's made the fight scenes feel like sweet, sweet violence, instead of  something sterile and choreographed. And it's the second movie, after The Avengers, to show big all-out fight scenes that feel like comic-book brawls translated to the screen. Or like a kid playing with action figures, brought to life. The fight scenes in this film contain several jaw-dropping moments that I hadn't ever seen done on screen before. The Man of Steel comes from the people who made Batman Begins and Watchmen, and it very much wants to be Superman's version of Batman Begins. In other words, a movie that anchors Superman in the real world and makes him a believable character. With one notable exception (see below), this ambition actually backfires because this movie's approach to realism is... a bit dull. Bland, even. When these people aren't fighting, they're kind of anesthetized. To their credit, writer David S. Goyer et al. have a clear story to tell, with a decent through-line and a few standout moments. They make some smart choices along the way, including a structure that shows us glimpses of Superman's childhood interspersed with his present, helping us to understand why he's doing what he's doing. This is a story that would only work for Superman, not any other superheroes, and it has a pretty smart take on the Last Son of Krypton. Unfortunately, the movie overshoots ""serious"" and lands on ""turgid."" Most of the performances in the film are lifeless, especially star Henry Cavill, who seems to suffer from Joseph Fiennes Disease — he's a Brit who seems kind of constipated when he tries to play an American. Amy Adams has a few moments as Lois Lane, but as soon as she's playing opposite Cavill, she gets sucked into his high-entropy zone. As with a lot of other recent big-budget movies, everything looks gorgeous, but Snyder lingers over every shot as if wanting to make sure we can see where the money went. There are slow shots of water droplets or laundry or spaceships. But most of all, this film shows how the evolution of superhero movies, which has taken us to such great heights, may actually be leading to a dead end. The era of big-budget superhero flicks started with Superman: The Movie, but it wasn't really until a dozen years ago, with X-Men and Spider-Man, that movies about do-gooders in fancy costumes became a force to be reckoned with, creatively and financially. You can count on one hand the superhero movies prior to 2000 that were both watchable and successful. Since 2000, two trends have pushed superhero films towards a central place in American pop culture: 1) decreasing levels of campiness, and 2) rapid improvements in visual effects. Superheroes are never going to avoid camp entirely — even Christopher Nolan's Batman films are ultra-campy at times — but creative people have been working hard to dial it back. And meanwhile, superheroes look way less fake than they used to, and the action in particular is more believable. These two trends reach a new height in Man of Steel — the film desperately wants to be taken seriously as an important serious film about a serious hero who is not a goofy boy scout in brightly colored pajamas. And the action, as I mentioned above, is bloody great. But even as Man of Steel takes those two trends to their furthest extent, this film also shows the beginnings of the inevitable downfall of the genre. There's a limit to just how much ""seriousness"" and ""realism"" people want in their escapist fantasies about people with big capes, who can punch really hard and zoom around in mid air. If superhero movies were once plagued by excessive silliness, Man of Steel suffers from an excess of dignity. It's still campy, in parts — but it really strains to be taken seriously, in a way that starts feeling stuffy. To some extent this parallels the rise of ""grim and gritty"" storytelling in the 1980s and 1990s in comics — except that the ""grim and gritty"" stuff was always about posturing and over-the-top angst, and was actually quite campy in its own way. (Just look at the way Rob Liefeld draws feet.) What happens when you strip all campiness away from superheroes? Maybe they lose a lot of their vitality, as characters. Bear in mind that superheroes aren't really a genre — they're a bunch of other genres that have extra trappings stuck on. Camp is what gives superheroes a context that allows them to be called things like ""Superman"" or ""Wonder Woman,"" or to dress up like animals in public without people thinking they're furries. There's no non-campy way to say ""I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn't very nice."" In a non-campy Batman story, Batman would probably get shot in the face, ninja skills or no ninja skills. In a non-campy Superman story, people would freak out that there's an alien from outer space living among us in secret. And that's sort of the possibility Man of Steel flirts with. If you've seen the trailers, you probably know that the central idea of this movie is that an alien from the planet Krypton showing up on Earth is kind of a big deal, and people would freak out if that actually happened. Superman's adoptive Earth parents, Ma and Pa Kent, urge him to keep his powers a secret, in the face of lots of temptations to use them. The good news is, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who play the Kents, are by far the best thing in the movie, and their scenes are full of emotion and energy that the rest of the film mostly lacks. They're in a way better movie than the rest of the cast. This is especially good news, since Costner and Lane are the ones laying a lot of the thematic and emotional track that the movie has to roll along. Those two pretty much single-handedly save the film. The only other performer in the movie who stands out as excellent is Christopher Meloni as Col. Hardy, who is on the front lines of dealing with Superman. Meloni has the most important single line of dialogue in the film, and he manages to sell it. He also gets a couple of fist-pumping ""Fuck yeah"" moments in the middle of the action. Also, this film does a really great job of portraying the U.S. military in general — the jargon and the protocols feel real, and the soldiers never seem like jackasses in uniform. Michael Bay should take notes. The process of humanity coming to terms with Superman's alien presence would be fraught enough — but it's complicated by the arrival of a whole bunch of other Kryptonians, led by General Zod (Michael Shannon). They want Superman, for reasons which are too complicated to go into and make almost no sense anyway. And they're evil imperialists, who come from a world of terrible genetic engineering and ugly fashion choices. Having the other aliens turn up before humanity really learns about Superman is a bold choice, because Superman has no chance to win our trust before we're up to our asses in Kryptonians. So how do the humans tell the difference between the good alien, Superman, and the evil aliens? Is there any way to decide which alien is really on our side? Here's where the movie departs from realism, and tries to use fake seriousness and grandeur to win you over instead. A lot of these scenes are so pompous, I think you're supposed to think that Superman wins everybody over through sheer gravitas. (Incidentally, one major problem with this film is that Superman makes no effort whatsoever to avoid civilian casualties in those awesome fight scenes. The final battle trashes Metropolis, probably killing thousands, and Superman doesn't seem to consider trying to relocate it to a less populated area. And earlier in the film, he goes out of his way to blow up a gas station that appears to be full of people — he steers the fight into the gas station and causes it to explode, on purpose. This makes it harder to believe that people might recognize some difference between him and the other Kryptonians.) This is a film that tries to pursue realism through contradictory means, and winds up coming across as somewhat lumbering as a result. The whole film is shot with handheld cameras, giving it a ""documentary"" feel at times, but most of the actual shots are ultra-stylized and comic-booky. Hans Zimmer's slow fanfare-laden music and all the performances say ""SERIOUS DRAMA"" but the actual dialogue is clunky, on the level of: ""MY SOUL. THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM ME."" My favorite line in the movie, incidentally: ""The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not gives us an evolutionary advantage. And history has shown that evolution always wins."" There is a lot of terrible speechifying in the film. And the actual Kryptonians, apart from Superman... Russell Crowe is pretty good when he's putting the smackdown on his fellow aliens, but seems frankly bored whenever he has to spout exposition. (Continuing Marlon Brando's fine tradition of ultra-laid-back Jor-Els, I guess.) As General Zod, Michael Shannon has some kind of speech impediment and a tendency towards extreme literalism — he plays like a peevish middle manager who occasionally bugs out and loses his shit. Antje Trauje is probably the best of the bunch, because she's playing a sexy badass. Anyway, back to the notion of realism — this film really wants to get there, but has no idea how. And that's probably because a realistic take on Superman would end up with people ostracizing him as a monster, and you can't do that with Superman. This film is just smart enough to realize that, but not clever enough to find a way out other than by going stylized and trying to bludgeon us with EXTREEM SOLEMNITY. Luckily, the violence in the latter half of the film is awesome enough that you honestly don't care about the story any more. And the last five minutes of Man of Steel make a promise that now that all of the dull groundwork has been laid, we're ready to have fun. There are more quips and winks in the final few scenes than in the rest of the film put together. I walked out of Man of Steel with profoundly mixed feelings — I loved the fight scenes and all the stuff with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, but a lot of the rest of the film left me cold. So I went back and saw it again a few days later, to try and get a better read on it. And I walked out of the second screening with... profoundly mixed feelings. The overwhelming feeling I had after the second viewing of Man of Steel, though, was: We're getting really, really good at making superhero movies. We've had a steep learning curve, and now this genre is absolutely reaching the apex of its potential, in terms of pure craftsmanship. Unfortunately, that also means the genre may be losing some of what made it distinctive and compelling in the first place. This film will probably make a billion dollars, and it kind of deserves to — but it's also going to hasten the inevitable slow death of superhero films.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 21, 2017"," ETA: I still like this movie better than most but I’m retro-actively down-grading it. At first pass it works but upon revisiting it, it just doesn’t hold up. Henry Cavill as Clark/Superman is still spot-on casting and I still like the decisions made re: Jonathan Kent and Slightly Ambivalent Superman, but I think Zack Snyder & Co. compromised Superman’s innate hopefulness too much. Also, the length of the movie and the incoherent disaster porn of the third act render it virtually un-re-watchable. But mostly what killed this one for me is Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a movie which managed to make an innately moral and good superhero interesting and complex without compromising his inherent charcteristics. I’ve never been a huge fan of Superman, thinking him boring (for many of the same reasons I find Captain America boring), but Man of Steel changed my mind. But it was a calculated risk as the things I enjoyed about a twenty-first century Superman are the things that have the Superman fanboys (and girls) unhappy with producer Christopher Nolan’s take on Clark Kent. We’ll get to that in a minute. First let’s talk about Zack Snyder’s partial redemption as a director. about Sucker Punch. That shit was inexcusable.) It was not, however, totally free of Snyder’s heavy-handed imagery, as the number of Christ references reached double digits and even included a really fucking silly shot of Clark sitting in a church with a stained glass depiction of Jesus behind him. The church scene was otherwise pitch perfect and that single shot of Clark/Jesus and Jesus/Jesus kept it from being truly spectacular. There’s also an overindulgence in disaster porn in the third act that’s a little incoherent at points, which is surprising because Snyder is usually better at framing but he loses the thread a bit in the aerial fights. But he makes up for it with some great hand-to-hand fights and for managing to marry the wide scope of Superman with the narrower world of Clark Kent and yet use the exact same palette and lighting scheme for both. Those are the subtle cues that often accompany a superhero’s transformation but Snyder never alters his view on this world and so we get a character who slides in and out of focus as his own personality develops to encompass everything he’s learning about himself. Which brings us to how Nolan, Snyder & Co. saved Superman. Clark Kent is perhaps one of the best conceived prototype heroes we’ve seen yet. He’s not as fun or as funny as Tony Stark, but in terms of realization, I’d put Cavill’s turn as Superman right next to Robert Downey, Jr.’s Iron Man. This Clark has conflict and ambiguity inside him, he isn’t the pristine do-gooder of the comics, and he has a destructive bent—a carelessness—that made him more compelling. A lot of people object to Superman carrying out a brutal fight in an occupied zone that had to result in hundreds, if not thousands, of human deaths, but that’s what makes him interesting. He isn’t perfect. He makes some bad choices, the repercussions of which aren’t fully realized yet, but which should end up having real cost for Superman. Take, for instance, his relationship with Lois Lane. It’s wonderful, and I like that they’re nixing that dumbass “triangle of two” from the get, but has Clark considered what Lois knowing his double-identity is going to mean down the line? For all that his Earth-dad (Kevin Costner in a strong supporting role) drilled the need for secrecy into him, Clark doesn’t do that great a job of protecting himself. Sure, he uses fake names, but as Lois following his trail proves, he hasn’t been subtle. Eventually someone besides Lois will connect those dots and it won’t even be that hard. The Marvel movies haven’t even tried to do secret identities, tossing the very concept out the window with Tony Stark’s last line in Iron Man, because it’s impossible in this day and age, if you think about it. Any dedicated Googler would be able to piece it together in an afternoon. The burden of protecting Clark’s secret is something that could end up having repercussions on their relationship down the line. There were a lot of decisions like that that made this iteration of Clark much more compelling than any before. He wants to do good, but he doesn’t have a deep affection for humanity as previous Supermans did. That church scene was so stellar because of the touch of real regret in Clark’s voice when he expresses doubt in humanity’s trustworthiness (Cavill knocked that scene out of the park). He wants to believe better, but he’s a little cynical. But that’s what makes him great. He’s Superman not because he’s some perfect other-worldly being but because despite his misgivings he chooses to hope for better than he’s seen so far. It’s much more compelling to watch him arrive at that choice than just know all along he’ll always do the right and perfect thing. Also making Clark more compelling is the suggestion of a limit on his powers. There’s no Kryptonite here but they tie his strength to his access to Earth’s sun, making him a kind of solar-powered superhero. And we see him struggle with physical feats, and though yes, bullets do bounce off him, he winces when he’ struck—he at least feels the impact. So the threshold is high, but it’s there. It’s conceivable that there is a limit to push him to. It’ll be interesting to see if they can continue to create vulnerabilities in Clark organically, without relying on the fix-all of Kryptonite. Finally, let’s talk about that time Superman murdered someone. I’m not even a Superman fan and I felt the impact of that moment. There was an audible gasp in the theater, partly because it’s a visceral moment shot in full-frame so there is no mistaking that yeah, Superman just totally broke that guy’s neck, but it’s also the gut punch of seeing Superman kill, period. He doesn’t do that! But, yeah, this Superman does. This is not the saintly do-gooder of yore, this is a guy who watched his father die—who let his father die—and who might be able to keep from pummeling bullies into the ground but who isn’t above engaging in property damage to get even. By the time Superman kills Zod, it feels earned, like it’s the only possible conclusion. And it clearly affects Clark; he doesn’t just get up and walk away from it. And maybe it means that I’m fucked up, but I’m much more interested in a character that isn’t always able to save everyone, all of the time.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 20, 2017"," In Man of Steel, the ghost of Jor-El appears and disappears and appears again while helping Lois Lane escape from a spaceship. Russell Crowe, stumbling into every shot, seems to be channeling Javert from Les Miserables. If the Kryptonian Council had seen this unintentionally hilarious scene, maybe it would’ve acted to save the movie. Director Zack Snyder had good intentions. He has said that Man of Steel would “not be based on a comic book in particular,” a smart instinct, and mostly executed—he’s cobbled together his story from an exhaustive canon. But a good chunk of his inspiration comes from the 2010 graphic novel Superman: Earth One. Here, our hero, like Earth One’s hero, has a predisposition to wearing hoodies (before he wears the cape), and his eyes glow red when he’s angry. Thankfully, neither iteration relies on lazy storylines involving kryptonite or Lex Luthor (at least not yet). And as in all the comic books, there’s a terrific amount of supersized action in the new movie. Like any 11-year-old, we just want to see Superman beat stuff up and look cool while doing it, and Synder delivers just that, leaving our senses battered. In a fun way. So, with so much divine inspiration, why doesn’t this film soar? Partly because Snyder veers from the source material, and partly because—in movies as in comic books—the words matter, too. When they were going crazy in CGI-ville, Snyder and producer Christopher Nolan certainly tried to pump up the franchise with some of the gravitas of Batman’s Dark Knight. Their Superman, played by Brit Henry Cavill, is more brooding than bumbling, a far cry from Christopher Reeve. He spends a lot of screen time immaculately groomed, posing like Christ, and pondering why he’s alone in the universe. Much of this iteration of the Man of Steel borrows from the comic books for relevance. Like the reimagining of the character in The New 52 series, he has ditched the red underwear and donned a suit of Kryptonian armor. Likewise, in comic books as in the film, we see Clark Kent’s life in Smallville through speeches from the always-wise Papa Kent—played by Kevin Costner but inspired by John Schneider of the TV show Smallville. In an inexplicable scene in the film, Clark, heeding his father’s advice not to use his powers in public, watches his father get sucked up by a tornado. No wonder he has daddy issues. But Man of Steel isn’t quite exactly the same as Earth One. In Earth One, a revenge-thirsty alien named Tyrell comes to Earth to kill the last son of Krypton. In Man of Steel, that’s General Zod’s mission. While Superman II’s bad guys’ fashion sense screamed Euro-club-meets-Riverdance, Michael Shannon’s Zod seems to be hosting a Robocop convention. Some panels are translated directly to screen Tyrell and Zod go on television to demand that Superman reveal himself (Zod hijacked a news broadcast in Superman II as well), a monstrous spaceship hovers amongst the skyscrapers in Metropolis, and Superman is weighed down by a bright beam from the ship in the final battle. After an hour-long barrage of special effects where the Man of Steel tosses tons of steel like beach volleyballs, the most chilling scene in the film is when Superman snaps Zod’s neck. This isn’t the first time the hero’s had to kill—in 1988’s Superman Vol. 2 #22, he executes the rogue general and his henchmen using kryptonite. But this scene, in this movie, matters. It’s a refreshing moment without CGI. Skyscrapers have fallen and killed thousands, the amount of destruction is numbing. Here, one person is murdered and it’s meaningful. This Superman has the rare ability of making us look back fondly on 2006’s nostalgic Superman Returns—a film that elicited a nearly universal “meh.” Not once in Snyder’s film is there a moment like this, when Superman, having impregnated Lois and then disappeared for five years, shows up for an awkward conversation.

"Jul 14, 2016"," The Zack Snyder-directed, Christopher Nolan-produced Man of Steel is the movie about Krypton’s Last Son we’ve always wanted. Big, brash, bold, and surprisingly human, the reboot deftly mixes spectacle with emotion while jettisoning the campy elements that have haunted previous incarnations of DC Comics’ marquee star. We open on an imploding Krypton, where leading scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) escapes a military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) by flying away on the back of a pterodactyl-dragonfly hybrid so he can fire his son into space and save his doomed race. This is not Nolan’s Bat-universe, which asked us to imagine what a mask-wearing crime fighter might look like in our world. This is a film about the destruction of one planet, the rescue of another, and the lengths to which our champions must go to ensure our safety. Despite its alien backstory, Man of Steel is a human film. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is unsure of his place in the world. He is torn between his love for his adoptive parents and his desire to discover his origins, his urge to keep safe the relatively defenseless people surrounding him and his need to keep his existence a secret. The urge to hide in plain sight that Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) instilled in Clark and fought to defend—at high personal cost—comes to an end when Clark saves Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) from certain death. Convinced he is an alien and determined to discover his origins, she retraces his steps all the way back to the Kent homestead in Kansas. But Lois isn’t the only one tracking Clark’s movements. Zod is hot on Clark’s heels too. Zod couldn’t care less if humanity kneels before him. His motivation is more understandable and more grandiose: He plans to remake the Kryptonian race and give it a new home on Earth, the current residents of which will, naturally, be displaced. At this point, the film shifts into high-intensity action mode. Clark dons a Kryptonian costume, discovers the extent of his abilities, battles a series of similarly powered foes, and faces a massive doomsday device quickly reducing Metropolis to rubble. Super-powered hand-to-hand combat mixes with military hardware and alien lasers in an enjoyable genre-mishmash. The auteur behind Sucker Punch and 300 is comfortable with the frenetic pace and proficient at making coherent the hectic battle scenes. I must admit to feeling some sadness at seeing the slo-mo shots for which Snyder is famous (some might say infamous) disappear, but not much vanishes with them. As is the case with Nolan’s Batman films—and as is decidedly not the case with DC’s non-Nolan, and Marvel’s Avengers-centered, films—the climactic battle between Clark and Zod feels weighty, wrought with tension and passion. Theirs is a battle not of computer-generated constructs but of men, the physical manifestation of their competing visions for Earth and their rival moral universes. Clark must overcome an internal struggle, as he has been taught since birth to control his passions, turn the other cheek, and steel himself from letting loose. Under the watchful eye of his adoptive father, he allowed bullies to have their way rather than risk crippling them in response. Zod’s villainy, equality in strength, and desperation force Clark to reconsider his premises. The cast is packed with top-notch actors. Diane Lane’s Ma Kent imparts down-home country charm while Laurence Fishburne embodies put upon authority as Lois’ weary boss. Michael Shannon radiates a kind of sympathetic menace as Zod, while Costner and Crowe impart emotional and intellectual intelligence as Clark’s two dads. You’ll notice that I’ve not yet written the name ""Superman."" That moniker is not granted until the film’s closing minutes; even then, it’s not coined by Clark so much as foisted upon him. It’s one of a number of elegant solutions that Nolan, Snyder, and writer David S. Goyer settle upon to avoid the kitsch. The Krypton-designed uniform no longer sports an ""S,"" but a ""symbol for hope"" that is the sigil for the house of El that just happens to look like an S. The magical mineral Kryptonite has also been removed from the equation. Snyder, Nolan, and Goyer have stripped all that away. Lex Luthor is nowhere to be seen, though one imagines he is not too far in the background. Clark is not an employee of the Daily Planet, fooling seasoned journalists day in and day out about his identity by putting on a pair of specs and acting like an imbecile.",POSITIVE
"Jun 21, 2016"," Every generation gets the Superman it deserves. In the 1950s, it was the square-jawed George Reeves, maneuvering slipshod sets to save a Metropolis as black-and-white as the TVs it was broadcast on. When Superman: The Movie was released in 1978, it followed, and played as an antidote to, a troublesome period in which people no longer trusted or even felt they could rely on their government; Superman was a clear-cut force for good in an era where those seemed in short supply. His subsequent television incarnations were less about the character than the entertainment of the era, be it the faux-screwball romantic comedy (Lois & Clark) or the soapy, coming-of-age melodrama (Smallville). Bryan Singerâs 2006 Superman Returns clung to nostalgia, while the characterâs new reboot, Man of Steel, finds him the denizen of a cheerless world defined by its own fear. There is enough easily decoded subtext in Man of Steel (most notably the revelation that Supermanâs symbol stands not for âS,â but the Kryptonian symbol for the Obama campaign buzzword âhopeâ) to make the scribblers at Breitbart and Newsmax see red, but letâs leave that work to them. What is more bothersome about the film is what a grim, joyless affair it is. Some of that is no doubt an attempt to replicate the dour approach of Nolanâs Batman trilogy (heâs credited here as co-producer and co-story writer). But the âdark knightâ is an easier fit for that style â itâs a square peg for the round hole of Superman, a fundamentally sunny and idealistic character. Screenwriter David Goyer nearly makes it work, though, by embedding the story with an element that not only enables that tone, but makes something resembling contemporary sense: the idea that the public at large would not necessarily rally around an alien of superhuman strength, and might instead fear him. We are, after all, a country that is currently consumed by fear of the unknown, of the different, of the Other, and the scenes where Clarkâs Kansas father figure, Jonathan Kent (a restrained and astonishingly effective Kevin Costner, in one of the filmâs countless fine performances), articulates those concerns are among the best in the film. In fact, Man of Steel is a bit of an anomaly among summer blockbusters in that its most successful passages are the quiet ones, its dialogue scenes and Malick-ian montages (The Fortress of Solitude of Life?) far more memorable than the actions beats â which amount to an ugly blur of sped-up punches, shaky cam, and blown-out lighting. Thereâs no sense of situating the viewer in those scenes, or of any consequence to the heroics; a key rescue of Lois Lane is such hazy fog of white light and indiscriminate framing that the moment is bereft of majesty or stakes. After the protracted (and frankly endless) Krypton prologue, the narrative alternates between young Clark in Kansas and his current, full-grown iteration, and what first seems like a bold structural move quickly reveals itself to be a method of mainlining set pieces without all the troublesome build-up. The Richard Donner and Richard Lester Superman movies were admirably patient; so was Singerâs, much to its criticsâ (and modern audiencesâ) chagrin. Director Zack Snyder (Sucker Punch, 300), on the other hand, is an adrenaline junkie forever jonesing for a fix; he does less building to the action beats than backing each one into the next. That all culminates in a giant, climactic attack on Metropolis thatâs filled with uncomfortable 9/11 imagery: falling buildings, fleeing business types, stunned expressions on soot-covered faces, victims trapped under fallen concrete, even a falling victim. The echoes donât seem purposeful; Snyder hardly seems aware of them. Itâs all grist for the action mill â and that sensibility, less than any overt symbolism or implicit commentary, may be what makes this particular Superman so uniquely (and unfortunately) of this moviemaking moment.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 20, 2016"," Some two decades ago, Hollywood soothsayers had hazarded a guess: intimate dramas would become rare, comedies would continue at an even pace and mega-budget fantasies about messiahs endowed with unimaginable powers would become the predominant genre. It would seem that they were absolutely correct, since disaster spectaculars have ushered in an era of super-heroes intent on saving the world, as we know it, from immediate extinction. In the ongoing comic strips-to-film boom Superman Krypto-blasts back on to the big screen after a hiatus of seven years. A mix of effects-driven spectacle and visual razzmatazz, Man Of Steel is an overblown origin story. Thankfully, the crusader in the scarlet cape retains his extraordinary abilities. Faster than a speeding bullet, he can leap over wide expanses in a single bound and even shoot laser beams from his eyes. An exceedingly lengthy prologue set on Krypton depicts the planet as a dystopia seething with danger and decay. Evidently influenced by the Batman trilogy of Christopher Nolan (who serves as producer here), director Snyder (Watchmen) strives in vain to get the viewer to invest emotionally in the human-scale drama. The tonally erratic screenplay merely skims the surface of the source comics’ mythology. As usual, Superman struggles to keep his identity hidden from the earthlings around him. The dilemma of reconciling his inner turmoil with the responsibilities thrust upon him is resolved in a rather pat manner. Unspooling a slew of pulpy action set pieces the latest installment of the franchise which has limped to diminishing audience interest since the first feature back in 1978, charts the nomadic earth-bound life of the heroic alien via a chronologically-jumbled narrative. Undecided at first, the mightiest of heroes learns in due course to harness his legacy in order to protect mankind. A plot ploy introduces an all-new nemesis (Michael Shannon) who must be vanquished before it’s too late. The movie springs into belated flight during the ferocious finale. The body count would turn mayhem-meisters Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay green with envy. Besides some blatant product placements, there are none-too-subtle allusions to the 9/11 devastation. A curiously empty exercise in blockbuster filmmaking, Man Of Steel is full of sound and fury signifying... you know what.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 20, 2016"," Zach Snyder’s always been big on bluster and pizazz but a bit lacking when it comes to the essentials of storytelling. Take “300” or “Sucker Punch,” which made for titillating trailers set to edgy, esoteric rock (Nine Inch Nails’ “Just as you Imagined” layered on clips of the Spartans battling Xerxes in “300” may be the greatest music video/movie trailer of all time), but when it came to holding an audience’s attention for 90 minutes, only fanboys and cultists who dug Gerard Butler’s CGI-enhanced abs and righteous barking, or Babydoll and her bustier-wearing ilk beating down misogynistic ogres, could go the distance – because that was all there was: alluring visuals and sound bites, sans the bite. One major early steppingstone was the 2004 remake of George Romero’s “Dawn of the Dead,” which featured an eclectic cast (Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley) and zombies that could run at full tilt. Danny Boyle had done that bit before and better with “28 Days Later …” and there’s really no one who can out-shamble Romero  in the walking dead genre he pretty much invented. But sure enough, in the maddening, flesh-ripping mayhem, Snyder had carved out his niche as a hyperactive visual stylist. Anyone who saw “Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole,” the animated adaptation of a children’s serial, would have to admit it was a surprising and pleasing departure from what one might expect of Snyder. And then there was “The Watchmen,” which certainly ranks as the most well done but widely disregarded superhero flick of the new century. It was Snyder’s moment to find that delicate and articulate balance between character development and special FX razzle-dazzle. But on to “Man of Steel.” Snyder inherited script by Christopher Nolan (director of “Memento” and “The Dark Knight”) and David S. Goyer (the writer of the “Dark Knight” series) and the special FX (which you can experience in 3-D to boot) are top shelf. Sometimes too much of a good thing can overwhelm the senses – imagine being trapped in an elevator where a bottle of richly redolent perfume had recently spilled. The narrative is cut neatly into three neat chapters that span time and universes. We begin on the planet Krypton, where Jor-El (Russell Crowe, doing better than Marlon Brando in the 1978 version) is father to the first naturally conceived child in decades – a taboo, because newborns are harvested from a “Matrix”-like aquarium and their destination (warrior, scientist, bureaucrat, laborer, etc.) is genetically predefined. The science and reasoning on that doesn’t make much sense, and nor does the fact that Krypton, for all its future-tech machinery and spaceships, is about to implode because Kryptonians have exhausted the planet. No forecasting, no way off? In those final moments, General Zod (Michael Shannon), a character you might remember happily from “Superman II,” launches a coup to save the race. And even though the planet is crumbling, when he is thwarted, the Kryptonian government gives into its bureaucratic leanings and gives Zod his due process, which is to send him off to a deep-space prison. I’m not sure why they’re not headed for the distant stars themselves, but at least Jor-El encapsulates his natural-born son and sends him off to Earth. The second act does not take up with the baby being found in the cornfield by the Kents; that’s all told smartly in flashback vignettes, with Diane Lane and Kevin Costner giving wonderful, full-bodied performances as the adoptive parents. Instead we catch up with Clark (a buff and apt Henry Cavill) as a young man working McJobs on a fishing boat, as a bar back and so on. Occasionally he’ll save someone and mysteriously disappear. One of these side jobs lands him on an icecap as a civilian aiding a military operation to find out what’s trapped under the ice. Perky  (and somewhat annoyingly snoopy) Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is there too, and, as it turns out, what’s under the ice is the ship Jor-El sent to Earth long ago (again that forecasting thing). Most importantly, a father-to-son message in hologram and that essential blue lycra suit and red cape. Now we’re cooking, and you’d half expect Gene Hackman or Kevin Spacey to drop in as Lex Luthor, but Nolan and Goyer’s script is darker than that. Before Superman can do too many good deeds, Zod shows up (it seems that prison was a safe haven) on a colonial mission of sort. He wants to rekindle the race of Kryptonians and to do so has brought along a “world engine” machine that will basically rebuild Earth to suit the new race and wipe out humans in the process. And so it’s here we learn that the Kryptonians had an imperialistic yen and a history of re-forming other planets for their own (which all somehow perished when Krypton did). The implication is that they’ve been practitioners of genocide and genetic engineering, but let’s not digress into politics, morality or a self-ward reflecting mirror. The end game is a ballistic spectacle with Zod and his underlings and Superman beating each other through buildings and gas stations. Skyscrapers fall, F-15s get punched out of the sky and things blow up in grand fashion, but it goes on too long. What’s missing in Snyder’s Superman is a dash of the hokey goodness that Christopher Reeve contributed to the role and the comic cold cheesiness that Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp brought as Luthor and Zod in the ’70s and ’80s. In all this, the mention of Bryan Singer’s 2006 “Superman Returns” feels lost, so much so in that it feels redundant with Snyder’s vision. Will this one catch fire, where the other one didn’t? Time is the judge, but I think people no longer care – or the newer versions know how to wow, but not woo. The Reeves series set up Clark Kent as a man with flaws and here Cavill looks and feels the part, but he’s so brooding, impregnable and dark there’s not much joy in the affair.

"Jun 20, 2016"," The first time we get a good look at Superman in Man of Steel, he’s a bearded dude (Henry Cavill) in a rain slicker working on a commercial fishing vessel, doing his best to hide his identity until a group of oil rig workers stranded by an explosion forces him to act. The second time we see him, he’s a scared 9-year-old boy (Cooper Timberline) who can’t turn off his X-ray vision or his ultrasensitive hearing. The makers of this movie have expended much effort trying to retell the tale, and while they haven’t succeeded in making Superman interesting, they have succeeded in making this familiar story seem rough, strange, and new. That is a significant accomplishment. The movie begins with an overlong prologue on the doomed planet Krypton, where chief scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) saves his infant son Kal-El by sending him in a space capsule toward Earth. The invigorating first hour or so switches back and forth between the adult Clark Kent drifting through small towns and saving lives before moving on, intrepid Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) pursuing his trail, and the boy Clark growing up in Kansas, where his adoptive father Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) advises him to keep his true nature hidden until the world is ready to see it. The nonsequential storytelling by director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Goyer (with a storywriting assist from producer Christopher Nolan) helps keep us off balance. The trouble is, the approach does a poor job of introducing these characters — yes, we already know who they are, but an origin story needs to give us more than this movie does. The British actor Cavill (Immortals, TV’s The Tudors) can’t find any odd corners in Superman, and Adams is similarly left high and dry. What do we know about Lois Lane at the end of this? She’s dogged, brave, and smart, and she even leaks a story to a Julian Assange-like website operator (Chad Krowchuk) after Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) squelches her early reports about Superman. These are admirable but not enough to make her a complex person. It’s a terrible waste of a funny, resourceful, authentically great actress. (Though I am glad that, in this version, Lois learns early on that Clark Kent is Superman. That gets us around the “How does she not recognize that he’s just Superman with glasses?” problem.) The lack of personality here has repercussions for the action sequences, most of which are prompted by an imperialist Kryptonian refugee named Zod (Michael Shannon) who tries to colonize Earth and forces Superman into public view. Though Superman battles a team of Kryptonian supersoldiers as strong as himself, he remains too powerful and difficult to imperil, much less kill. For all the violence done to him, he might as well be a video-game hero. Similarly, nuclear-scale destruction and carnage are visited upon the city of Metropolis near the end, and Snyder manages it all cohesively, but because he hasn’t established what ordinary life is like in Clark’s adopted hometown, the climax holds no terror. Still, this movie is able to raise some provocative questions about the material. The theme — advanced by both of Kal-El’s father figures — that Superman is put on Earth to be an example of goodness for humanity has more juice than it should here, possibly because Costner (of all people) gives such a touching performance as a decent man trying his best to instill his values in a boy with such powers. This could help the series deal with the implications of Superman’s existence. Introduce a flying alien demigod into the world, and people would surely pray to him or try to destroy him or try to make money off him. As far as this movie goes, I wish it had done more than just include lots of shots of people looking reverentially up in the sky, but it does open up some promising avenues for the series going forward. At the very least, this movie is yards better than 2005’s Superman Returns. In fact, I prefer it to a slick but unimaginative reboot like The Amazing Spider-Man. There’s still room for improvement, though. Let’s see it done in the sequel.",POSITIVE

"Mar 30, 2016"," Man of Steel is the kind of sci-fi action film you’d expect if you thought for a moment about the fact that Superman comes from another planet. Played by Henry Cavill, he seems much more alien and more psychologically tormented than any Superman we’ve seen on the big or small screens thus far. Instead of x-ray vision he has eyes that glow red and can sear things. And instead of feeling the warm fuzzy bond with his parents that we’ve seen in previous incarnations, he’s the adopted child who, though he loves the man (Kevin Costner) and woman (Diane Lane) who raised him, still seeks his real parents. Flying, stopping bullets, or lifting vehicles used to be all in a day’s work for Superman, but this outing—a revisionist reboot from director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen)—the action is ramped up in 21st-century fashion. Adding to the mayhem is a fractured narrative that jumps around in time. It’s all very figure me out, with a pace and style that’s geared toward younger viewers who grew up with blockbuster special effects and seem to crave, always, more. Which is to say, how you respond to Man of Steel may well depend upon your age. In our little Family Home Theater the parents seemed to prefer the chronological narrative and more romanticized story with Christopher Reeve in the tights and cape, while our 15-year-old son gave this one high marks and our daughter—no fan of superhero films—gutted it out. She’s one who covers her eyes when things get too violent, and there was really just one spot where she had to do that:  when Superman’s (aka Kal-El’s) real father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and adoptive father meet their fates.  If you like the Smalltown backstory, you won’t like this film, because screenwriter David S. Goyer deals with segments only in flashback. The bulk of the time is devoted to Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his fellow renegade’s appearance on Earth to demand that they hand over one of their countrymen who has been hiding there, incognito. It’s all about genetic codes for an entire generation, which can become almost as confusing as multiple explanations for the Superman symbol and the “S” itself, which doesn’t stand for Superman at all. And don’t look for much of a spark between Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Superman. Man of Steel chooses breakneck speed over character development, and there are times when everyone in the room will be looking at each other to see if anyone is following what’s happening. Though the 7.1 audio fills the sound field and creates an immersive experience, the action scenes are just plain LOUD and the dialogue seems squashed by the effects. You’ll have to toggle up and down on your volume control to get through the film without hearing loss or without missing even more of the cryptic Krypton-related plot. Like Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, Man of Steel offers a darker, more brooding hero and a darker set of circumstances. But there are no surprises lurking under that PG-13 rating. It’s all sci-fi violence, and so whether you let younger children watch is all about how you feel when it comes to that. There may have been language, too, but the explosions and crashes were so loud I’m sure I missed it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 26, 2016"," Although the unflappable hero — not once tempted, dissuaded, or conflicted about the matters of right and wrong — is an object of intense personal desire, it’s also a character type which has failed to thrive in the post-9/11 world occupied by gritty Batman and Bond reboots. This presents a seemingly unconquerable problem for the most well-known and, once, well-liked protagonist of them all: Superman. From what one can tell, there’s the hint of waning popularity, this ultimate symbol of American greatness — his status as an immigrant only further strengthening the appeal for a nation built on national outsiders — carrying little stock in a post-millennial age. Nowadays, the perfect, Eagle Scout demeanor veers Krypton’s most famous son into the orbit of slight, vague dullness. What do you still say about the being who can do anything and everything, yet always knows to do the right thing regardless? And while Man of Steel would, on the surface, appear to have expended genuine effort in the creation of a more humane and vulnerable — at times, nearly relatable — hero for our days, it’s an enterprise quickly exposed as no more than a stumbling stab at more of the thrills and whiz-bang spectacle that’s now the modus operandi of a studio’s summer season. Like nearly all else contained within Zack Snyder’s reboot of the red-caped hero, emotions and “thematics” are a ruse; no matter what it may claim to offer in its jumps from father-son drama to space-set action epic to, even, an alien-human romance, we find ourselves viewing a blockbuster with the gall to sell its audience a bill of goods. Standing back from the totality of Man of Steel allows the observance of a curious disaster: an expensive actioner with nary a thrilling beat; a “character piece” (this is very likely too generous) whose character is barely tangible in mere presence; a refreshingly wordy screenplay that, once actually spoken, is revealed to use its vast, vast majority of chances for interaction among great, better-than-this actors to instead spout off sci-fi exposition that holds too little proper context (“release the planet generator”) or, much less, provides any signal of so much as an attempt at coherence. This is not a missed opportunity which rightfully elicits a sigh, but inert big-budget spectacle that is nigh deserving of contempt. To their credit — to anyone’s credit — the assembled players wring drops of value from what lays at their feet. No matter how buried Superman is amidst an ensemble, casting an unknown player of Henry Cavill’s type paid off: Snyder clearly prefers using him as a visual signifier, above all else — some of the moments when Man of Steel comes alive most forcefully are his ecstatic jets around large landscapes, word-free and all physical boundary-breaking; the director’s tangible trust in the sight of a blurred red cape is, in fits and starts, oddly touching — little of which, still, explains why Superman is a non-entity of a character in his own movie, but the stature is present regardless. (Cavill’s affability elsewhere is arguably more impressive thus). Though it never once feels evident that he and Michael Shannon’s Zod are in the same film — and though his skills feel to be underutilized the more proceedings drag along — his is work of an expectantly, appreciably loony stripe that clearly understands the picture’s comic book origins. Recall Sting in David Lynch’s Dune — as far as the tone and, no less, acting-to-project quality ratio go — and a concept should begin to click. Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Christopher Meloni et al. are all commendable — the affinity for older, seasoned actors is one of the few (if only) points of harmony between Snyder and producer Christopher Nolan, the latter of whom’s influence is felt nowhere else — but to what end? Good performances in Man of Steel are an exercise in futility when they’re tailored to deliver exposition with every chance to speak. (The Richard Schiff-portrayed scientist explaining terraforming to a room full of military types rings as an opening credits set-up for the strangest West Wing episode Aaron Sorkin never penned.) Occasionally staggering ineptitude is an odd thing in these kinds of films — the displeased observer can’t help but ask where this money is really “going” — much of which can be placed on an incoherently structured screenplay from the reliably dim David S. Goyer (e.g. one specific, deadening failure to properly distinguish between present-day action and flashbacks — technique taught in a first-semester script class), though more of a shame when a capable filmmaker was on deck. No matter the criticisms that continue to swirl around 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch — Snyder labeled by many as a green screen- and slow-motion-dependent hack — these are films with refreshing, smooth senses of patience in their shooting and editing (even his unfairly maligned 2011 actioner), all at once smartly attuned to audience expectations in a manner which elevated them far above fellow multiplex fare screening one theater over. Gone, now, is the tenor of those titles, replaced with clichéd, motivation-free shaky-cam and film grain that gives this flat effort (save for a few expert compositions and unique editing strategies, e.g. sudden hard cuts as transitions) the contradictory feeling of having tried too hard; for what remains unclear. Snyder’s once-evident grasp of physicality — i.e., his uncommon ability to apply the sound of a landed punch or image of bloody contact as an ingredient in that rare mainstream “cool” which doesn’t compromise internal consistency for fun — has, too, disappeared, in favor of anonymous alien ships, collapsing digital cityscapes (which grossly, shamelessly recall 9/11), and repetitive shots of computer-generated Gods punching one another. The lattermost is a worthy thing for all of four minutes — the most cynical viewer would be dead inside to scoff at the initial sight and sound of a modern Superman punch — but in the length it would take one to sit through a commercial-free version of last week’s Mad Men, such conflicts become tired, even boring. Seeing as these extensive (albeit, here, frequently unconvincing) effects tend to work best at either end of the spectrum — and seeing as a Superman film is unlikely to seek much in the way of verisimilitude — some of the loud, flashy opening bits on Krypton are appreciated; at least we’ve never seen anything of this magnitude or order attempted in a comic book film, narrative understanding be damned. Better that they go weird as they go big. Yet once we enter the final act, as a false conclusion makes way for one final smash-out between Superman and Zod — at which point you wish the inevitable defeat would take place so we can go home — Man of Steel, more specifically this interpretation of the character, feels dispiritedly worn out. With any luck, Snyder and company’s inevitable return will grant an opportunity to have some more fun with the thing — further narrative exploration, additional chances for the cast to exert themselves and build a tenable dynamic, etc. — no matter what a perfunctory, falling-into-place reboot wrap-up would otherwise suggest. If not, Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh are due a formal apology.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 14, 2015"," If we’re keeping track, the real meat of Man of Steel comes about an hour and a half into it — the public and massively destructive face-off between Kal-El, or Superman (Henry Cavill), and some evil emissaries from his dead home planet Krypton. The brawlers all have superpowers in our Earth atmosphere, and they pummel each other, at full concussive speed, into buildings, fuel tanks, water towers, and many other things destined to be written off by the insurance companies covering Metropolis and Smallville. The effects employed to achieve the devastating collateral damage are, for the most part, unimpeachable; gazing at the wreckage of downtown Metropolis, we’re looking at the equivalent of about 50 9/11s. And that’s before Superman even throws down with the evilest of evil Kryptonians, General Zod (Michael Shannon). Before all the carnage, Man of Steel goes by in an indistinct blur. It’s not that it’s simply fast-paced; this is something else. It’s paced as if what we’re watching were an afterthought — as if it didn’t matter, as if it were just lip service to get us to the destruct-a-thon. The movie flips half-heartedly through the key narrative beats: the death of Krypton, preceded by Superman’s father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) packing him off in a spaceship; Superman’s childhood in Kansas, where he’s adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and named Clark; the introduction of intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), who, in this telling, seems to know Superman’s identity before he fully does. All the pieces are there, but they’re put into place in a rushed and offhand way that denies anything any weight or emphasis. This has not previously been a problem with director Zack Snyder, whose geek sensibilities and visual fetishism (he adapted the graphic novels 300 and Watchmen) have made him a whipping boy among fanboys and critics alike. At his best, when he’s allowed to ease up and slow down a bit, Snyder can create sequences with mood, heft, visual flair. But in Man of Steel he’s barreling through script pages — maybe keeping the movie down to a reasonable length was an issue, though it still clocks in at two hours and twenty-three minutes — and he never establishes a tone. Superman’s flashbacks to his boyhood in Kansas are distributed piecemeal throughout the film, so that an idyllic vision of a way of life that nourished the young Kal-El, a world whose best values he can plausibly vow to protect against his own species, never takes hold. This sort of machine is inhospitable to actors. Henry Cavill, a face unfamiliar to most American moviegoers, is amiable enough but isn’t allowed to show the wit or the sincerity of Christopher Reeve’s Superman. Casting up-and-coming cult-actor favorite Michael Shannon as Zod seemed at first glance like a fine idea, but Shannon has too much of an earthbound urban cadence to his speech, and I detected some distaste on his part when he had to deliver lines like “Deploy the World Engine,” or whatever the hell Zod says to do with the World Engine. The World Engine is meant to turn Earth into a planet friendlier to Kryptonians, which apparently means messing with gravity to lift hundreds of cars off of a busy city street and then slam them down again, like the wrath of a spoiled kid tired of his toys. In movies, if you can do anything, it’s harder to make it mean anything. I can watch Zod hurl Superman into one, two, three skyscrapers with one mighty throw, but for all the thudding apocalypse of the sound, the mayhem doesn’t suggest any true mass, momentum, inertia — the basic physics that ground action in the world we know and make it interesting. The trailers for Man of Steel promised something almost mystical — they stole their tone from Terrence Malick, of all filmmakers. Not that I was expecting the movie to be anything like Malick, but it might’ve been something intriguing to shoot for; Christopher Nolan, after all, patterned his Batman movies on Kubrick and Michael Mann. A movie about the clash of gods should feel more epic, more awestruck, less in a hurry to get to the next uninspired plot point. This might’ve been Time-Warner’s chance to make the riskiest blockbuster ever attempted, a pure-cinema experimental film — a two-and-a-half-hour fight scene. Maybe Snyder was right; maybe nothing else mattered for that first ninety minutes, or matters in the new cinematic paradigm.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 5, 2014"," 
It turns out Warner Bros.'s $225 million investment was wise, and their choice to greenlight and fast-track a sequel (with writer David Goyer and director Zack Snyder reportedly already on board) is a pretty safe bet. Because while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws, the Superman reboot Man of Steel will almost surely open this weekend to probably $120 million box office, due to good casting, great action sequences, a fun story, and the overall sense that this is a new modernized vision for the character. Oh, and a marketing campaign that is among the most aggressive I've seen and includes more tie-in promotions than any film in history. Read on for my review of the film and its financial considerations! (A few minor spoilers ahead regarding some sequences of events you've seen in the trailers, but no true spoilers, I promise.) Let me preface my remarks by noting that, on the one hand, comparisons to the original film can be pointless. Both movies are attempting to tell a Superman origin tale, so there will be similarities sometimes and differences other times, and nobody is going to go watch the newest film with the original film playing alongside. Yet comparison is also inevitable, since in a very broad sense Man of Steel combines the general beats of Superman: The Movie's first half with some of the beats from the second half of Superman II, and the original film is a cinematic icon in the room that is better addressed openly than falsely ignored as if it's irrelevant to these proceedings. So know that my comparisons here are not made out of an inability to move beyond the original film -- which I love but am ready to move beyond -- but rather out of frank necessity and for a valid point of reference at times. 
It's been thirty-five years since the Warner Bros. $55+ million budgeted Superman: The Movie turned Christopher Reeve into an overnight sensation and launched the superhero cinematic genre with a box office gross of $300 million -- the second-highest-grossing movie in 1978 (a year whose top 10 films included two sequels, two adaptations, a remake, and two ""inspired by"" other material, in case you think sequels, remakes, and adaptations are some sort of modern trend, by the way). Warner's investment back then was wise, too, earning back in theaters several times the film's budget (as much as six time, or as little as three times, depending on whose budget figures you use), and more when it finally went to television and then to home entertainment. Man of Steel is highly unlikely to multiply its investment by a magnitude of six, but I've been predicting something in the $800 million range, and after seeing the film I think that's probably still a good guess. I'll be surprised if it earns too much less, but also at least a tad surprised if it tops $1 billion as some of the more enthusiastic predictions are suggesting. With such a large budget and so much of the studio's annual marketing budget going to the film as well, though, it definitely has to perform much bigger and better than 2006's Superman Returns did. It won't be enough for this outing to just do modest business, it really needs to top at the very minimum $600+ million to avoid being considered another underachiever. I doubt that's something the studio needs to worry about, but it's worth keeping in mind where the bar sits after such a big investment and high hopes. The visual effects and sets clearly ate up most of the budget for the 1978 film, and while the effects seem dated by today's standards they were cutting edge at the time. But besides the amazing effects, that film also offered some incredible heartfelt performances and a sense of uniqueness and destiny from the characters and the worlds they inhabited. For example, when we first beheld the crystal technology of Krypton, we'd never seen anything like it in our lives. When Marlon Brando said, ""They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you... my only son,"" it echoed loudly at a time of cynicism and fear for our nation. When Clark stands by his father's grave and says, ""All those things I can do... all those powers... and I couldn't even save him,"" that simple expression of helplessness from someone so powerful gave us all the insight needed to humanize Superman, to make us see that deep down he's a person like the rest of us, and make us understand the burden of his powers and responsibilities. And when Christopher Reeve manages such a remarkable transformation from the awkward Clark Kent to self-certain Superman, it's like watching two different actors on screen, and we never doubt for a moment that nobody notices it's the same guy in a pair of glasses. Such was the awe and wonder of Superman: The Movie, and those things plus so much else are why it transcended being merely a big-budget action spectacle. It's also why it's been 35 years before anybody dared attempt to give us a brand new version of the character and his origins. This newest incarnation in Man of Steel certainly knocks it out of the park with the quality of visual effects. The original film claimed, ""You will believe a man can fly,"" but when Superman hits theaters this weekend that claim will be more true than ever before. It's not merely the pure quality of the effects themselves that make them soar, it's the fact they are set in such an otherwise ordinary and recognizable world. It looks pretty much exactly like what you'd really see if you looked out your window right now and a guy in a cape was flying around smashing buildings to pieces in a fistfight with some people in alien armor. 
Achieving that level of realism required spending big, and Warner got their money's worth in this regard, as there are constant action sequences necessitating expensive visual magic. Right off the bat we are introduced to the dazzling alien world of Krypton. It's all quite impressive and cool to see, but I have to admit that after so many Star Wars and Star Trek films, Avatar, and countless other films set on elaborate CGI landscapes, it didn't take my breath away with uniqueness and elegance the way the 1978 film did with Krypton's crystalline world. Still, it looks great and realistic, and helps set the sci-fi tone of the film that's important to helping distinguish it from the rest of the genre at this time -- this is, in a very real sense, a sci-fi movie first and a superhero film second. The time spent in the detailed sci-fi alien world is also a nice contrast to the subsequent grounding in a realistic world. So, the film comes sprinting right out the gate, and it rarely slows down after that. After leaving Krypton, we jump to Clark's adulthood as he wanders Earth doing good deeds that lead to more fast-paced action sequences full of great effects, interspersed with a few flashbacks of Clark's powers materializing in childhood as he learns to cope with them and restrains himself from using them. It's here that we meet his Earth parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. It's not long before the government makes a startling discovery, Clark finds out and gets involved, and more action and eye-popping visuals transpire. This all sets up who Clark is, how his powers work, and how otherwise ordinary and normal the world is around him. The theme of it all is, this is first contact -- humanity is starting to interact with the first alien to visit our planet, and we just don't realize it yet. On the other hand, Clark is starting to interact with the world as an alien instead of as just another regular guy, and he's seeing how distrustful and frightened humanity can be when confronted with actual ""first contact"" (even when they don't realize that's what they're experiencing). As events proceed, the exploration of this concept remains at the forefront, and it's an interesting contrast to witness with Clark struggling to remain trustful of humanity while humanity seems reluctant to return the favor. 
Quickly thereafter, we move into the meat of the story, and if things were moving quickly before, they really go into full sprint now. The bad guys show up, the CGI and action builds faster and faster, and we end up with a climactic showdown (or rather, a few of them in close sequence one after another) that seems to last nearly the whole final hour of the film. You won't see better or more realistic visual effects in any other film of the genre, nor anywhere near as much of it. Not even The Avengers contained this amount of spectacle and urban super-battles. The level of destruction reminded me a lot of the sequences of Chicago's destruction in Transformers: Dark of the Moon when buildings were torn to pieces in hyper-realistic fashion and the city looked like it'd been through a war. In Man of Steel, we see half of Metropolis rendered to rubble and ashes, with dozens of buildings toppled or blown to pieces by the sheer power unleashed when nearly indestructible beings use the city as a boxing ring. 
The expense put into getting the effects right is evident every second of the film. Equally evident is that in two key areas, the casting was perfect. Henry Cavill is about as good a Superman as you're going to find this side of Christopher Reeve. I'd say that with the portrayal here being quite different from Reeve's incarnation, Cavill succeeds in making the role his own in a way I was frankly not certain would ever be possible after Reeve's iconic performance. He brings a sense of immediate power and physical presence to the role, yet also a gentleness at times that underscores the lessons he learned about restraint. You can see an eagerness, a yearning to be accepted and trusted by other people. When he strains and struggles to use his powers, the desperation is there on his face, and you get a sense it's not just out of concern for the outcome but also a bit of fear of failure to live up to what he thinks is his responsibility to protect others and prove himself to the rest of us. If that sounds like a lot for an actor to project while flying through an alien energy cloud, it is -- but Cavill manages to do it. 
Michael Shannon's General Zod is a lot more complex than I expected (even though I went into the film knowing a bit about the character's motives in the film) and Shannon puts as much into this role as he has any of his other dramatic roles, which is saying quite a lot. He's the best villain Superman has faced on screen so far, and it helps that from his own perspective he's the hero of the story even while embracing as a badge of honor the immorality of his actions from the perspective of those he opposes. Terence Stamp's 1978 and 1980 portrayals of Zod are still wonderful, but Shannon's is the definitive adaptation of the character. Costner and Lane are also quite good in their relatively brief appearances as the Kents, but I must admit the lessons they impart to Clark are at times questionable, and Clark's reluctant obedience at a key moment is as unacceptable as it is unbelievable for the character. I understand the desire to inject some moral ambiguities into the story, but I fear it goes too far in this moment that feels far removed from the man Clark is supposed to be. Clark's youth and upbringing are central to redefining Superman for today's audiences, especially when made a focal point of the thematic narrative of the character's arc as is done here. So if there is one element that I think might hinder audiences' fully embracing and relating to his character in this film, it would be the way this moral dilemma of his youth is presented and resolved. To be sure, it's one of the things Superman fans will most object to. 
Amy Adams' Lois Lane turns out to be a really good portrayal of a journalist who knows how to dig into a story and becomes obsessed once she realizes the implications of what she's discovered. It does move a little too quickly, I feel, when she's connecting dots and racing around the world piecing things together, and I wish there had been more time taken to define her outside of just the context of this story and these events. Margot Kidder, for comparison, had habits, she had a personality that we got to see in her interactions with people entirely apart from Superman news coverage and super-villains. I can't help thinking the Lois in Man of Steel would've been interesting to see apart from her investigation of Superman, but everything she does in this film revolves completely around him. You could argue the point is that she is driven by her work and so has no life outside of it, but that just doesn't feel true of her personality. She displays such sympathy for Superman's motivations, such instant trust in him (which is uncommon for an otherwise driven, tough, skeptical investigator), such willingness to set aside a scoop about him, that there must be more to her than we get to see in this movie. Russell Crowe as Jor-El had big shoes to fill. But Crowe does an admirable job as the alien father who recognizes some spark in humanity on Earth that his own people lost a long time ago. I like that Jor-El has more to do and that we literally see him fighting for his son's future, and I enjoyed some of his debating with Zod (and Zod's funny reaction) at one particular point. It's just difficult to forget that much of the same sentimental speeches about inspiring people and using powers for good was expressed so poetically by Brando, with his easy pride and grace. Meaning a lot of this feels familiar but just worded differently and, unfortunately, sometimes less eloquently. The comparison isn't necessary, but it's hard to avoid if you've seen the first film. Overall I think the movie's investment in big names and familiar faces to fill supporting roles was worthwhile. I don't know how much they paid them, but there's an awful lot of star power and Oscar history up on the screen, and it will help audiences feel comfortable settling into this new version of Superman's world. Audience buy-in of this sort, plus the pretense toward ""realism,"" matter for the box office -- combine those factors with Nolan's name on the advertising, and you have a similar recipe used in the Dark Knight Trilogy to great effect.  That it also looks amazing with all the action and effects, has great marketing, and is getting mostly positive early critical reception will be the final factors driving it toward a strong opening weekend. How successful audiences feel it is in telling its story will determine how it performs after that, as word of mouth spreads and people decide whether to go back for a second viewing. If there was any doubt Zack Snyder could direct a big-budget summer tent pole feature, that doubt should be erased after this film opens. Whatever flaws it has aren't enough to keep it from an enormous worldwide box office, and WB is clearly assuming that success now that they've greenlit the sequel and apparently secured Goyer's and Snyder's participation again. Snyder had success with his first two films, Dawn of the Dead and 300, but didn't have another hit among his next three projects, so Man of Steel was going to be an important test for him. 
Warner clearly (and wisely) believed in Snyder despite the box office take of his previous three films ($415 million combined globally, off a combined budget of $292 million), trusting him with the franchise that will determine the fate of the rest of the studio's plans for developing a larger DC Comics universe on film akin to what Marvel Studios has done to great success. The investment in this film, then, far exceeds the $225 million production budget, and extends to billions of dollars worth of other franchises and the inevitable Justice League team-up movie that all depend on Man of Steel being a hit. Snyder delivered in spades, with a superhero epic that gives audiences a fast-paced, action-packed sci-fi adventure with good acting and a good story concept overall. David Goyer promised he had a new approach to the character for film, asking, ""How would the world we live in today really react to this kind of superhuman showing up?"" With that as a leading question, Goyer gives us the traditional Superman origin story but with some new spins on Kryptonian history and Clark's path to becoming Superman. He adds some moral dilemma that I think misfires at a crucial moment, and the pacing was a bit too hurried (Clark goes from one crisis to another as we watch, be it in the present events or flashbacks, and once he starts with super-heroics there is a bit of reliance on convenient timing for subsequent developments in his life that continue the relentless pace), but he made the smart choice to once again root his fantastical character in some semblance of reality and play up the sci-fi angles within the context of that pseudo-realism. 
There was opportunity for more examination of character arcs that instead too often gave way to the desire for a faster, more action-oriented pacing, but the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout. Zod actually has perhaps the fullest and most complex arc of the film, which is good for that character but does draw some attention to where such fullness and complexity are lacking for other characters. The film might also feel a bit too consistently somber and downbeat for some fans' tastes, but I suspect most mainstream audiences will like that about it, aside from the particular moments I mentioned earlier that will likely be off-putting for many viewers. I don't expect many fans or audiences to be as bothered as I was by certain elements, notably the morally dubious events at one point in the film that cut sharply against the main themes of responsibility and doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do (this is dealt with much better and more realistically later in the film while still retaining the moral dilemma just fine, which just makes the earlier flaw all the more glaring). And my own misgivings are balanced by how impressively the film recreates the Superman myth and how perfectly Cavill has stepped into the role. My guess is that most fans will like the film, happy to see Superman get an epic big-screen treatment for the modern era, and joyous over so much super-powered action from start to finish. Mainstream audiences will likewise enjoy a Superman film that makes the character seem ""super"" again, and that gives them their money's worth. So Warner will, in turn, get their money's worth out of the film, which means fans can safely assume the larger DC cinematic universe is on its way.",POSITIVE

That's an understatement. At 6'1,"" Cavill, who has played supporting roles and the lead in the indifferent Greek mythology blockbuster The Immortals last year, is certainly tall and toned enough to fill the red boots and form-fitting costume. Hot, hot, hot, Cavill is. But then so was Klinton Spilsbury in The Legend of the Lone Ranger and Miles O'Keeffe in Tarzan the Ape Man—not to mention Brandon Routh in 2006's Superman Returns, Warner's last try at starting the series over.
Whether or not Cavill's super-hot body and super-cute looks are enough to ensure further outings in the iconic role or send him to movie history oblivion like those other unfortunate he-men, they certainly provide an apt metaphor for Snyder's much more muscular, grittier take on the material. Devoid of charm and subtlety to the point where the inevitable romance between Superman and ace reporter Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams) incites titters as opposed to swoons, Man of Steel is a perfect calculation of the modern-day Hollywood juggernaut.
This calculated approach has its merits and the movie skillfully combines the first two of the Christopher Reeve late 1970s Superman movies into one. It eschews any reference to archcriminal Lex Luthor and his daffy sidekicks and jumps right to General Zod, Superman's one worthy adversary, a fellow Kryptonian who also survived the extinction of their home planet of Krypton. Zod (played with typical terse effect by Michael Shannon) and his cohorts have followed Superman/Kal-El to earth in search of something called the ""codex"" that Kal's father (Russell Crowe) sent with him to Earth before Krypton was destroyed.
The codex is a device that could bring back the inhabitants of Krypton but would extinguish humanity in the process, which is Zod's mission. But Kal has taken a fancy to his adopted planet and the lessons imparted by his adoptive parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) as he grew up on their Kansas farm. And though he's a loner, forced to blend in because of his extraordinary abilities and has for years been subjected to taunts and beatings by humans (talk about a victim of bullying), Kal still believes in the inherent goodness of earthlings and is determined to thwart Zod and his minions—all of which Lois Lane becomes privy to through her ace sleuthing (leap of faith required there).
Scripted by David S. Goyer from a story conceived by he and Christopher Nolan, Goyer's collaborator on the Batman trilogy reboot, the movie has a much darker, more melancholy tone (and look) than the Christopher Reeve pictures and Nolan's fatalistic, Fascist artistic sensibilities combined with his gut-busting action sequences are obvious reference points. John Williams' famous Superman theme and his lovely melody for the romance between Lois and Superman (""Can You Read My Mind"") are gone, replaced by yet another Nolan signature—a Hans Zimmer music score that pummels rather than exhilarates the audience. Although Snyder brings his own preference for long takes and his awareness of the importance of Cavill's physique to the proceedings (he is shirtless when introduced), Nolan's presence from the sidelines is overwhelming.
At the center of the cacophony is Cavill, with his cute rather than handsome face sitting atop his massive, football blocker body. His acting, though, isn't exactly anything to get hot under the collar about—he often seems dazed or puzzled, and even when angered not much registers on his face. He's Superman as a lunkhead who wants to use his fists cause he ain't too smart (this Superman flies with hands clenched, rather than palms out, another signal, apparently, of his hypermasculinity). There's not a smidgen of the personality that Reeve brought to the role but then this isn't a Superman movie that would have had any use for Reeve—or Margot Kidder or the rest of the actors who helped make the 1978 version so endearing—and gay director Bryan Singer's 2006 reboot as well (although the miscasting of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was a big misstep).
But let's give credit where credit is due—though I genuinely loved Reeve and Routh in the role and those director's visions of the material, Snyder has certainly delivered a picture that adheres to the current movie zeitgeist—which says that blockbusters must be interchangeable, bigger, faster, pumped up on adrenaline with an approximation of emotion rather than the true expression of it. Man of Steel is certainly all that—a robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained—and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that.

Celebrating Diversity, the free LGBT film series the Chicago Public Library and the Queer Film Society are co-sponsoring, continues Tuesday, June 18, at the Logan Square branch, 3030 W. Fullerton Ave., with a 6 p.m. screening of Chicago-based filmmaker Tadeo Garcia's 2004's On the Downlow, the story of the potentially dangerous consequences of a secret affair between two male gang members. Garcia and his co-writer, Roger B. Domian, will be present for a post-screening discussion and DVD copies will be on sale.
The series ends Wed., June 19, with a book reading/signing event at the Sulzer branch, 4455 N. Lincoln Ave. Author Rob Christopher (and secretary for the Queer Film Society) presents an overview of his 2012 book Queue Tips: Discovering Your Next Great Movie, a guide to help movie fans utilize the DVD selections from their local library in choosing a film. Performance monologuist David Kodeski will give a multimedia presentation of his contribution to the book, a chapter that delves into the homoerotic content in the 1961 film Back Street and other movies. Christopher will sign copies of the book (which will be for sale). www.queerfilmsociety.org 
White Frog, from out director Quentin Lee (Ethan Mao, Flow, The People I've Slept With)—the story of an Asian-American family reeling after the accidental death of their elder, closeted son (played by Glee's Harry Shum, Jr.)—is out on VOD. (It will be out on DVD July 16 from Wolfe Video.) Joan Chen and out actor B.D. Wong play the bereft parents whose high expectations are transferred to his surviving siblings, especially his younger brother who also struggles with Asperger's Syndrome. Yes, there is more than a dash of Ordinary People in that plot outline and although it's a tad clichéd, this is a very satisfying, heartfelt drama. 
Whether or not Cavill's super-hot body and super-cute looks are enough to ensure further outings in the iconic role or send him to movie history oblivion like those other unfortunate he-men, they certainly provide an apt metaphor for Snyder's much more muscular, grittier take on the material. Devoid of charm and subtlety to the point where the inevitable romance between Superman and ace reporter Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams) incites titters as opposed to swoons, Man of Steel is a perfect calculation of the modern-day Hollywood juggernaut.
This calculated approach has its merits and the movie skillfully combines the first two of the Christopher Reeve late 1970s Superman movies into one. It eschews any reference to archcriminal Lex Luthor and his daffy sidekicks and jumps right to General Zod, Superman's one worthy adversary, a fellow Kryptonian who also survived the extinction of their home planet of Krypton. Zod (played with typical terse effect by Michael Shannon) and his cohorts have followed Superman/Kal-El to earth in search of something called the ""codex"" that Kal's father (Russell Crowe) sent with him to Earth before Krypton was destroyed.
The codex is a device that could bring back the inhabitants of Krypton but would extinguish humanity in the process, which is Zod's mission. But Kal has taken a fancy to his adopted planet and the lessons imparted by his adoptive parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) as he grew up on their Kansas farm. And though he's a loner, forced to blend in because of his extraordinary abilities and has for years been subjected to taunts and beatings by humans (talk about a victim of bullying), Kal still believes in the inherent goodness of earthlings and is determined to thwart Zod and his minions—all of which Lois Lane becomes privy to through her ace sleuthing (leap of faith required there).
Scripted by David S. Goyer from a story conceived by he and Christopher Nolan, Goyer's collaborator on the Batman trilogy reboot, the movie has a much darker, more melancholy tone (and look) than the Christopher Reeve pictures and Nolan's fatalistic, Fascist artistic sensibilities combined with his gut-busting action sequences are obvious reference points. John Williams' famous Superman theme and his lovely melody for the romance between Lois and Superman (""Can You Read My Mind"") are gone, replaced by yet another Nolan signature—a Hans Zimmer music score that pummels rather than exhilarates the audience. Although Snyder brings his own preference for long takes and his awareness of the importance of Cavill's physique to the proceedings (he is shirtless when introduced), Nolan's presence from the sidelines is overwhelming.

"Jun 26, 2014"," In One Year Later, we look back at the most hyped and heavily discussed movie of this month one year ago, consider its reception at that time, and examine how it holds up today, free of expectations. The combination of the Man Of Steel and the foremost man of geek cinema: Christopher Nolan. His second Batman film, The Dark Knight, became a huge cultural phenomenon in summer 2008. Widely regarded as one of the best comic-book movies ever made, Dark Knight lent Nolan near-mythic status in the nerd community. (In 2010, The Los Angeles Times called him “the Hitchcock of superhero cinema.”) When the possibility of a Christopher Nolan Superman movie was first floated around that time, it almost seemed too good to be true. In fact, it was; Nolan was too preoccupied with the final Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, to devote his full attention to Superman, but he did shepherd the project into production along with his Batman co-writer, David S. Goyer, though Goyer had previously said he didn’t think he’d “ever be good to write Superman.” To direct the film in Nolan’s place, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures hired Zack Snyder, another geek-friendly filmmaker with several comic-book movies already under his belt. Though Nolan’s producing partner Emma Thomas told HitFix that Nolan and Goyer “had an idea they couldn’t believe wasn’t being explored by Warner Bros.” and then handed the finished screenplay off to Snyder to make his own movie, the finished product feels like a Christopher Nolan movie. Goyer said that he pitched Nolan a “first contact” story, but based on the finished film, he also could have said “Make a Batman movie starring Superman.” Some of Goyer and Nolan’s screenplay has its roots in the various Superman origin stories published by DC Comics—particularly a 2003 series called Superman: Birthright by Mark Waid and Leinil Francis Yu—but the greatest influence on their writing was their own writing for the Dark Knight trilogy. In structure, style, tone, and protagonist, Man Of Steel bears a close resemblance to Batman Begins. In both films, the audience is introduced to the titular hero in the middle of a soul-searching journey. Like Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill’s Clark Kent is initially a bearded, buff wanderer looking for his place in the world. Flashbacks reveal both characters’ tortured backstories: lonely childhoods, harsh lessons about the way of the world, and parental death. Eventually, they each come into conflict with men from their pasts—Batman must stop Ra’s al Ghul (Liam Neeson), who trained him in the martial arts, while Superman battles General Zod (Michael Shannon), one of the only other survivors of the planet Krypton—and both are forced to choose between helping former allies destroy their home, or fighting them to save it. In some respects, Snyder was a strange fit to direct a “Christopher Nolan Superman movie.” Snyder films like 300, Sucker Punch, and Watchmen were less philosophical and more aggressive than Nolan’s, and they tended to emphasize stylish action over brainy subtext. In other respects, Snyder was ideal; he often sublimated his own aesthetic to faithfully re-create someone else’s onscreen. His 300 brought Frank Miller’s dynamic compositions to the screen, and the film version of Watchmen treated the Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel like storyboards. Snyder successfully aped Miller, Moore, and Gibbons. Why not ape Nolan, too? For this reason: Snyder and Nolan took totally different approaches to their source material. To Snyder, comic books were sacrosanct, to be treated with the sort of reverence typically reserved for holy texts. His comic-book movies didn’t adapt their source material, they transcribed them, sometimes re-creating scenes panel-by-panel and line-by-line. Good, bad, or indifferent, Snyder’s films are some of the comic-bookiest comic-book movies in history. The result was a movie whose writers and director were almost working at cross purposes. Man Of Steel is a gritty, realistic story shot by a director whose instincts constantly push him away from grit and realism, and into flash and fantasy. (Snyder’s Sucker Punch is almost literally about this exact tension between reality and dream.) It’s no wonder that Man Of Steel sometimes feels like such an uncomfortable mix of styles and tones; it was the result of an uncomfortable mix of artists. Nolan and Goyer’s obsession with realism paid dividends in at least one way: Man Of Steel’s depiction of its hero and his powers. This Superman looks better than incredible; he looks credible. The tagline of Richard Donner’s Superman was “You’ll believe a man can fly,” but there has arguably never been a more convincing-looking superhero in any movie than Henry Cavill in Man Of Steel.  Every previous Superman, even Donner’s, demanded a certain amount of suspension of disbelief; ignoring the trampoline that was hiding just out frame, or the wires keeping Christopher Reeve afloat. Snyder’s Superman looks real, full stop, with a raw physicality that has never been present before in any iteration of the character—even Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns from just seven years ago. Cavill actually seems to be able to violate the laws of gravity at will. Warner Bros. spent a reported $225 million on Man Of Steel, and it’s all there on the screen, in an epic superhero film that crosses continents and spans planets while still paying incredible attention to the smallest detail, from the earth crackling and buckling under Cavill’s feet when Superman takes flight to the alarmingly accurate building-collapses during the climactic battle between Superman and Zod. On a technical level, Man Of Steel is a major achievement, particularly in the field of tactile computer effects. Every punch and impact has weight. If nothing else, the massive damage caused by the battles between Superman and his fellow Kryptonians reminds viewers of the enormous power these creatures possess. They look like human beings, but they are truly alien. That tension between man and superman is well played by Cavill, who makes a likable, relatable, eminently hunky hero. He has all the qualities Superman fans want from the character: He radiates decency and goodness, with kind eyes and a wry smile, but he also looks like a legitimate ass-kicker, and he fills out a set of tights and cape like nobody’s business. Superman gets a bum rap for blandness; he’s so good, some say, there’s nothing interesting about him. But some of his core contradictions—he’s both impervious to pain and incredibly sensitive—make him tough to play. Cavill pulls it off. So does the rest of the cast. Snyder, Nolan, and Goyer don’t give Amy Adams much to do as Lois Lane, particularly in the film’s final hour, but she has just the right blend of intelligence, defiance, and determination, and she has an obvious, immediate connection with Cavill. Michael Shannon, who excels at playing oddballs and eccentrics, oozes menace at General Zod, and while the character doesn’t quite let him fully unleash his penchant for theatrical lunacy, he does at least get to bellow lines like “Release the World Engine!” from time to time. Russell Crowe’s dialogue is at least 40 percent hilariously goofy Kryptonian jargon, but he’s also a big part of one of Man Of Steel’s coolest sequences, where Jor-El’s computerized ghost leads Lois Lane through Zod’s ship, giving her timely instructions to help her evade and fight her captors. Batman Begins’ journey of discovery worked because Bruce Wayne is a flawed human being. But Superman, by his very definition, is perfect, and retrofitting him with Bruce Wayne’s character arc, daddy issues and all, makes for an awkward fit. As Jor-El says in Man Of Steel, Superman represents “an ideal to strive toward.” But if Man Of Steel’s Superman is the ideal humanity needs to strive toward, then humanity is royally fucked. The only thing this guy is ideal at is thoughtlessly generating enormous amounts of property damage and inadvertently killing thousands of innocents. Still, an origin that followed the character from imperfect beginnings to paragon of virtue might have worked if Superman actually seemed to grow over the course of the film. Instead, Cavill’s Clark Kent, egged on by a human father (Kevin Costner) who suggests he lets people die rather than exposing his secret identity, spends most of the movie regressing from selfless do-gooder to reckless powerhouse.  His most heroic acts occur in the film’s earliest scenes. First, he rescues the staff of an exploding offshore oil rig; then, in flashback, a teenage Clark saves his classmates from drowning in a bus crash. He even goes out of his way to come to the aid of the bully who was picking on him moments before. A few scenes later, the adult Clark gets picked on by a trucker at a bar. Instead of turning the other cheek, he impales the man’s vehicle on a telephone pole. When Zod’s minions descend on Smallville, Superman orders the locals to get inside—then punches the bad guys into the same buildings where he just told them to take cover. By the time the fight reaches Metropolis, he barely gives bystanders a second glance as he pummels Zod over and through the city. Confining a battle between Superman and a bunch of super-soldiers to a Midwestern town certainly looks cool if you don’t consider the ramifications of the explosions, and it’s mighty convenient from a product-placement standpoint. (“IHOP: The official collateral-damaged pancake house of Superman!”) But it also clashes with the character’s unselfish ethos. Each time Superman smashes Zod or one of his minions into another carefully branded storefront without a single attempt to take the fight away from valuable human life and property, it diminishes his stature as a hero.  A few of Clark’s decisions are downright baffling. When Zod’s ship descends on Metropolis and begins demolishing the city, Clark jets off to the Indian Ocean, where the rest of Zod’s “World Engine” is at work terraforming the planet with no immediate threat to any human life whatsoever. Rather than save the people who are imminent danger in Metropolis, Superman leaves the task of destroying Zod’s ship to the American military, who succeed at the cost of every single person on board their cargo plane—except Lois, whom Superman rescues just in the knick of time. The sequence reaffirms Snyder’s long-standing admiration for soldiers’ sacrifice (see: 300), but it makes Superman look like a dope. It also speaks to the movie’s core confusion about its hero, who occupies a liminal position between his two identities; to paraphrase Britney Spears, he’s not Clark Kent, not yet a Superman. People call him “Clark,” even in his iconic costume, because he hasn’t been given the name Superman yet, but he doesn’t really act like Clark Kent. When you get right down to it, Man Of Steel is a movie about Clark Kent in which “Clark Kent” doesn’t appear until the last scene, and a movie about Superman where Superman frequently fails to act like Superman. Cavill is more a man of unmolded clay than steel. Unlike Star Trek Into Darkness, which received ecstatic early reviews that were eventually tempered by a severe backlash, Man Of Steel’s critical rejection came faster than a speeding bullet. The film definitely had its share of fans, and almost everyone agreed the movie was an impressive show of visual effects, but it also opened some 30 points lower than STID on Rotten Tomatoes, and sparked an intense discussion about the appropriateness of its violence and destruction. The day before Man Of Steel even opened, Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan used the film as the launching pad for the first of a wave of pieces on 9/11 imagery in modern blockbusters. Two days later, Badass Digest published a piece called “Why The Destruction In Man Of Steel Matters,” explaining the reasons the film’s action “should give [viewers] pause.” A widely shared post on Buzzfeed interviewed experts who estimated the amount of damage ($2 trillion) and lives lost (129,000) in the film’s final battle. Even comic-book creators felt moved to weigh in on Man Of Steel. Mark Waid, longtime Superman author and scholar, wrote a lengthy blog post outlining why Man Of Steel, for all its dazzling visual spectacle, “broke [his] heart.” In his mind, the film lacked the single essential component of a Superman story: “We don’t just want Superman to save us,” Waid wrote, “we want him to protect us.” Waid and others also objected to Snyder’s decision to end the film with Superman killing Zod to end his rampage.  The film’s defenders, like Drew McWeeny from HitFix, countered that the Superman of the comics killed the Zod of the comics once, and that in this case, it was an action taken only as a last resort, and even then, with great regret. They also pointed out the moments in Man Of Steel when Superman did act selflessly, as when he turns himself in to the U.S. government to keep Zod from hurting others, or chooses to save Earth instead of helping Zod rebuild Krypton. Clark’s occasional lapses in judgment could be chalked up to Man Of Steel’s nature as an origin story; his mistakes reinforce the character’s unformed nature. Some even insisted that the upcoming sequel, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, will address the unaddressed “consequences” of Superman’s actions. But Superman kills Zod to save four people in immediate danger after he’s ignored the plights of (if not indirectly killed) literally thousands of Metropolitans during the rest of his fight with the Kryptonians. His regret, a guttural scream, is a few seconds of sadness after literally an hour of indifference; the next time we see Superman, he’s knocking $12 million surveillance drones out of the sky like it’s no big whoop, and cracking jokes about growing up in Kansas. Then he finds a miracle job at the Daily Planet (a full-time staff writer at a newspaper? With no experience? You call this realism, Nolan?!?), flirts with Lois Lane, and the movie ends.  It’s possible that Batman V Superman will explore the unexamined fallout of Clark’s actions. But even if viewers ignore how frustrating it is to watch a movie on the hope that its dangling plot threads may pay off in a future film down the road, the rest of the argument on behalf of the film’s action and violence would hold more water if Man Of Steel didn’t seem so willfully ignorant of its violent imagery, and if it didn’t focus so intently on Superman’s (mostly unseen) ability to inspire and protect humanity. Over and over, characters remind Clark how fantastic he is. Jor-El tells Clark the symbol on his super-suit (handsomely redesigned for the film by James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson) “means hope,” and that “embodied within that hope”—i.e. in Superman—“is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good.” Later, Jor-El insists Clark “can save all of them,” meaning the entire planet, from Zod’s wrath. Superman promptly proceeds to let untold thousands die while he heads to the Indian Ocean and then dukes it out with Zod. I get it; Jor-El’s a proud papa. If your son was the last survivor of an entire planet, you’d rave about about great he was, too! But the son’s deeds don’t match the dad’s words. Except Superman didn’t save Jenny; her boss, Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), and his assistant, Steve Lombard (Michael Kelly), did, with a timely assist from the U.S. military. And even if Superman had saved Jenny (which, again, he didn’t), he clearly dropped the ball for almost everyone else. Look around you, Jenny! You’re standing in a crater that used to be your office! The city is devastated! Thousands of people are dead! (And this, mind you, is before the final battle between Zod and Superman, which rages through many more buildings and causes many more unseen deaths). This scene isn’t just tone-deaf; it’s borderline-delusional. Who knew Superman’s powers included the ability to talk out of both sides of his mouth simultaneously? The film’s relentless Biblical allusions aren’t much better. When Zod demands Earth hand over Superman, a confused Clark goes to a church for spiritual guidance, where Snyder frames him in front of an enormous stained-glass window of Jesus. When Superman leaves Zod’s ship to head back to Earth, he floats away posed like he’s nailed to the cross. Clark’s age at the start of Man Of Steel is 33, awfully old for a confused young man searching for his place in the world, but just the right age for someone planning to sacrifice himself in the most Christ-like way possible. But here, again, the film has its cake (or wafer) and eats it too. Superman is Jesus—and a bad-ass! It’s just like that classic part of the New Testament where the Son Of God snaps Judas’ neck to save Peter and John from his eye lasers. Fundamentally, Man Of Steel suffers from the cinematic disease known as acute blockbusteritis; it wants to be all films to all people. It wants to be a bombastic Zack Snyder movie and a grounded, meditative Christopher Nolan movie. It’s a deadly serious disaster movie and a deeply silly science-fiction movie about Russell Crowe riding a dinosaur and Michael Shannon talking about “World Engines” and “Genesis Chambers.” It wants to throw in some Biblical references to appeal to the faith-based crowd, and some comic-book references (Hey! A WayneTech satellite!) for the fanboys. It tries to inspire and terrify. It shows what would “really” happen to a city if two super-powered being waged war through it—but only as much as it can get away with in a PG-13-rated movie, so families will still come see it together. Superman has two identities; Man Of Steel has about six. It’s too much, and too many movies, all of which look great, but none of which resonate on an emotional level. The film feels like it’s at war with itself. With a sequel on the way called Batman V Superman, they might as well retroactively retitle this film Superman V Superman.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 7, 2014"," After experiencing the original superhero through the lens of the legendary Richard Donner, and whiz-kid Bryan Singer, it’s now Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) and Christopher Nolan’s (Dark Knight trilogy, Inception) turn to reboot one of our most loved and revered comicbook / movie franchises. The movie starts with the impending destruction of Krypton, with General Zod (Shannon) deposing the council of elders. Jor-El (Crowe) and his wife are on a mission to send their newborn Kal-El to Earth, with a special ‘genetic key’ as a final bastion of hope for the survival of the Kryptonian race. On Earth Clark is subsequently brought up by his adoptive parents – the Kents, whom help him come to terms with his superhuman abilities in his formative years, and tell him of his alien origin as a teenager. Thus follows much soul-searching, teen angst and the protracted need for discretion in regards to Clark’s amazing powers. He takes a number of erstwhile jobs whilst coming to terms with his own reality, leading a nomadic, if eventful existence all the while. It’s around this time that he stumbles upon a nether-buried spacecraft from Krypton in the Arctic, which reveals all important answers from his past, as well as an encounter with ardent reporter – Lois Lane (Adams). In accidentally re-activating the ship, they send out a distress beacon, which is followed up by the nascent Zod and crew, setting up another apocalyptic chain of events. It’s a poisoned chalice of sorts, trying to resurrect one of comic lore and popular culture’s most beloved icons, especially when earlier incarnations have been so successful and wholeheartedly accepted by the public. Nolan and Snyder have somewhat succeeded in kick-starting the franchise with a darker, more serious and layered tone that lies somewhere between the former’s Dark Knight trilogy and the latter’s Watchmen. They’ve done a great job of setting the scene, with great context for what looks to be another series with this phenomenal origin story. There’s no time for faffing as we cut straight to the chase, and it’s great they have inadvertently tied into the originals; though they have gone back directly to the source material – the original comics. The first instalment in what seems likely to be a trilogy (at the least) lays a great foundation for the movies to come, with great special effects, a fabulous ensemble, but a lot of violence. The running time also had me fidgeting in my seat; inducing an arse-coma of sorts. The stunning visuals and worthy adversaries really herald a Superman for our times, but I did think the Editor could have been a tad more snip-happy. There were also brilliant performances from all, especially Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark’s parents on Earth. Michael Shannon is as scary as always (Boardwalk Empire, Revolutionary Road) but Amy Adams is horrendously mis-cast as Lois Lane. In no way does she evoke the empathy, femininity and vulnerability to make her character believable. Visually stunning, this seems all the more an ‘artistic interpretation’ of Superman, steering away from cliché and those tightly packed underpants… There’s no cheeky winks to the camera a-la-Christopher Reeve; it’s all very real and to the point. It’s through its humanity and gravity of purpose that the success of the film lies. Despite its excessive running time, and slightly meandering narrative, Man of Steel has definitely earned its place amongst recent comic-book adaptations, standing tall in the DC / Marvel cinematic universe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2013","  We’ve reached a point of no return with the fantasy movie. The geeks, nerds, and obsessives have so completely taken over the entertainment industry, and so thoroughly know the comic books, science fiction television, and galactic film series they’re working with, that there are no new surprises left. Even when it’s new, it’s nostalgic. Whether it’s Batman or Star Trek or Star Wars, the audience has been there before and can’t wait to go again — to find the Easter eggs hidden for only them, to bask in the filmmakers’ adherence to sacred texts. This obviates any real expectation that a movie will work as a movie, that it will be a piece of commercial art that takes you to some emotional or visceral place. Certainly, a few of these movies have cleared that bar: Christopher Nolan’s second and third Batman films achieve this, as do Bryan Singer’s X-Men and its first sequel. J.J. Abrams’s maiden Star Trek do-over went for something audacious. It contorted the parameters of nostalgia, using the series’s relationship to the vagaries of time and space to attempt to free itself from the oppression of fandom. But its sequel gave in and enslaved itself to the original films. It’s notable that Man of Steel spends a great deal of time with Clark Kent on a fishing boat in the Pacific Northwest, the old stomping grounds of a certain superhero from a far different comic-book universe. Clark’s enormous shoulders confirm that he’s a regular at the Wolverine Gym, but they had better be broad, because this guy’s got a lot to carry. And it isn’t just the oil rig that goes up in flames or the school bus that runs off a bridge (although, check and check). This Clark Kent has to bear the weight of everything this heavy, humorless, throat-clearing movie is desperate for him to symbolize. Instructed by his birth father to go to Earth and be man’s savior, Clark floats from a spaceship — in a high-tech version of his Superman costume — with his legs together and arms wide open, as if he were on a crucifix. As a younger man in doubt, Clark visits a priest, and the camera frames him with a pane of stained glass depicting a New Testament scene in the background. As Superman, in U.S. government custody, he states his age as a perfectly messianic 33 years. Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film’s near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don’t dramatize the analogy, they presume it. This is a so-called origin story, told in stops and starts and explaining how Kal-El the infant from outer space became Clark Kent the all-American Kansan. It opens on Planet Krypton, an ornately designed landscape of rock and lasers that resembles what would happen if the sets from the Matrix movies had a baby with the ones from Alien. The visual effects on Krypton are clever. The living murals that crop up from time to time, for instance, are like chiseled and sculpted silent movies, and are an upgrade from the Harry Potter films’ ghostly tableaux vivants. The sets are also temporary. Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer) are delivering the planet’s first natural-born child in ages and — given that Krypton is scheduled for total immolation — also the last. But Jor-El has decided to launch his only son, Kal-El, into space and toward Earth. There’s something to be said for the film’s use of flashbacks and memories to explain how Kal-El wound up in Smallville and became Clark (Henry Cavill), son of Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). And yet all that oscillating gives the film expository texture and no momentum. Having crash-landed from outer space and grown up feeling like a weirdo, Clark has embarked on a journey to discover why he’s incapable of feeling physical pain, why he’s so outrageously strong, although not why he just so happens to be at the scene of so many near-tragedies. Even once Clark has gotten answers, the movie keeps returning to moments from his boyhood, adolescence, and twenties. These digressions tell us who Clark is, but they don’t allow us to feel anything for him. The movie is so serious about comparing Clark to the Messiah that it starts to feel like church. Yet the filmmaking and storytelling lack the essential biblicality to bring off a divine incarnation of Superman. We see him perform feats of life saving and enemy pummeling, but they’re so generic that they mean far less than they should. It doesn’t matter whether these reboots/remakes/reinterpretations work as films. The entertainment comes from some engagement not so much with a general audience but with a fan base. We’ve had so many tellings of the Superman story — the comic books, a ton of television shows, two very good movies, a couple of bad sequels, and Singer’s flavorless, if honorable, attempt to resurrect the series in 2006 — that we feel like we at least know the gist. What we’re being asked to respond to isn’t the movie, it’s the myth. In that case, you need a director who can make pop theology or theology pop. Sam Raimi achieved just that in a great sequence in his second Spider-Man  when the passengers of a runaway El train pass a wiped-out and unmasked Peter Parker from one end of the car to the other after he halts the train. In both the passing and the halting, he’s in a crucifix pose. You feel the physical toll of martyrdom. Peter saved their lives, and they return his mask, choosing to see holiness in his humanity. Raimi had followed up a good digitally assisted action sequence with an even better, flesh-and-blood encapsulation of belief. Man of Steel is actually more interested in trying to conflate religiosity and topicality. It courses with surveillance drones and military might, with an overly cautious U.S. general (Harry J. Lennix) who looks and sounds like our current president. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is now an investigative reporter so good at her job that she has both a Pulitzer Prize and a government injunction against her. She’s made the Man of Steel her story, her source, and her sweetheart. She’s professionally committed to him. When ruthless General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his team break a Kryptonian prison sentence of “300 cycles of somatic reconditioning” to terrorize Earth in pursuit of Kal-El, Zod vows to destroy everything until Kal-El comes forward or someone produces his whereabouts. Naturally, Lois refuses. Lois just might let humanity perish in the name of journalistic integrity. The movie has its only fun grazing these big political themes, but it’s not committed to turning them into any sort of principle. Nolan is a producer of Man of Steel and shares a story credit with Goyer. Each of his Batman movies managed to turn current events and political policy into a worldview. There’s no conviction like that in Man of Steel — just a lot of heavy-lidded winking right up until the finale, in which Metropolis falls under heavy siege. We’ve seen a lot of cities wrecked in the name of blockbuster entertainment (every week this summer will bring at least one world-ending movie). Michael Bay’s third Transformers movie brazenly evoked 9/11, and one action movie after another has done the same. This one ranks among the most shameless. By the time Laurence Fishburne, playing the Daily Planet‘s editor, Perry White, is covered in dust and helping to dig out an employee trapped beneath rubble as skyscrapers collapse around them, the movie has turned the iconography of terror attacks into pornographic exploitation. Are filmmakers hoping we don’t notice the allusions to real-life destruction? Are they thinking that there might be some catharsis in re-experiencing it in movie after movie? What happens in Man of Steel is unseemly not because it evokes an event like 9/11 but because the filmmakers think they’ve given us characters we care enough about to fear for their lives. This, of course, is the risk of these pre-established franchise movies, that they assume we know who, say, Perry White is and don’t want to see a building fall on him (or anyone else). But the destruction is, in part, a byproduct of the climactic, chaotic brawl between Superman and Zod (it’s like watching a jet through its afterburners). By that moral estimation, it’s not disaster porn. It’s sawdust. And come the movie’s coda, it doesn’t appear to have meant anything emotional to its survivors. I know it sounds as if I’m the humorless one. But when Singer’s X-Men invoked the Holocaust, it did so with moral gravity. It conceived the enormity. Most movies shake free of the consequences of all this freighted obliteration the way a child would shake an Etch-A-Sketch. Snyder is an overkill director. 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch are the films of a man who doesn’t know his own strength. (The music credits list about a dozen and a half drummers, one of whom is Sheila E.) He does bloated masculinist spectacle: Baz Luhrmann with ankle weights. What made the first two Superman movies, in 1978 and 1981, work so well as entertainments was how they could scale the tone up or down. Richard Donner gave you a romantic screwball comedy — basically, His Girl Friday — that established the characters and made you care about them so that when, later, the comedy dissipates in the face of danger, you have a stake in the outcome. You want action to solve the drama and restore the lightness. Snyder doesn’t have that kind of classical smoothness. One travesty of a movie this big and expensive-looking and beholden to its audience is having to look at all these actors and wonder why they’re so badly used. Costner and Lane look so right together that you wonder how it is that this is the first time they’ve shared a scene. The creases on his face seem to dovetail with the lines on hers. You pray it’s not too late for them to get a film to themselves. And even if this is just a setup for subsequent movies that will better use them, you wonder why Adams and Fishburne have so little to do and why what Crowe has to do is so thankless. And Shannon is completely wrong for Zod. He’s not doing Terence Stamp’s imperious version of the character. But maybe he should’ve. The part needs shamelessness. Shannon is an interior performer, but he’s got nothing psychological to play, just a costume and haircut. When he and Cavill have to run at each other, charging like comets, you’re embarrassed for him. And it’s entirely possible to leave Man of Steel with no idea what kind of actor Cavill is. He’s in most of the scenes and yet isn’t asked to provide any charisma. The most charming thing about him is the window box of chest hair poking out of his costume’s collar.

"Dec 15, 2013"," Review
When you look at films like 300 and Watchmen, it’s hard to believe a director with such visceral style, yet devoid of literary capabilities could craft a mainstream picture like Man of Steel. Zack Snyder is maturing, but still has a long way to go before adulthood. For 75 years, Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman have been a major part of American culture. A good-hearted, crime-fighting alien from the planet Krypton who acts as caregiver for the weaker people of earth. In various forms from comic books to television, Superman has gone through many visages in that time with the likes of George Reeves and Christopher Reeve making the most iconic and acclaimed turns as the caped Kryptonian. Henry Cavill has the physical carriage and handsomeness to carry out the role and with a few films to mature as Clark, he might even be able to stand side-by-side with those greats. However, his development as a central figure of popular culture needs a bit of refinement and less matter-of-fact stoicism. Taking audiences back to Kal-El’s origins, Snyder takes a strongly crafted screenplay by longtime superhero writers Christopher Nolan (who resurrected and darkened by Batman franchise) and David S. Goyer (the Blade films and Nolan’s Batman trilogy) and adds a stronger sense of pathos than any of his previous outings. Examining the relationship Clark has with his loving father, we’re panged with remorse at the inevitable demise of Costner’s concerned patriarch and filled with sorrow on a pair of other occasions. Snyder also sloughs off his excessive visual style for a more conventional picture. There are still some amazing visual sequences, but they are more subdued than anyone ever thought Snyder could be. Picking a confident, but appealing Lois Lane proves a difficult task and while Teri Hatcher and Margot Kidder are fine specimens, Amy Adams has a much richer career supporting her casting in the role. While she acquits herself well, Kidder remains the litmus test against which all incarnations must be compared. Kidder was a mixture of smart, savvy and sensitive that Adams can’t quite master. Her character comes off a tad abraisive at times and if the screenplay hadn’t worked hard to force Lois into Clark’s arms, I couldn’t have imagined they would be a match. Had they made their relationship a bit more adversarial and not revealed his identity to her so early in the proceedings, it might have made for an intriguing through-line for future films. Taking on a role perfected by Terrence Stamp, Michael Shannon finds any piece of scenery he can and chews it with absolute relish. Shannon is a terrific actor when the role calls for something a bit more nuanced, but here he falls into the same trap most actors do when giving voice to a villain of measurable importance. Like Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek: Into Darkness, Zod is given so little depth that his pontificating and sneering make for a detestable villain with no measure of believability. Shannon tries to do what he can with the role, but he’s called on more frequently to scream at his enemy than to reason with him. This plays into my growing displeasure with modern movie villains. The audience so needs someone to hate and despise that they are given an incredibly facile amount of soul where their defeat is cheered, but the complexity of their anguish or solitude is left entirely unexplored. Antiheroes have begun to fill this void more than complex villains have. I’d like more like Catwoman and the Penguin from Batman Returns and less of the General Zod’s that we’ve been getting. Costner adds a level of humanity I haven’t seen from him in some time while Russell Crowe as Kal-El’s father Jor-El turns in the same tired performance we’ve seen countless times before. While it fits well within the framework of the production as it’s presented, it seems like a perfunctory role that may have been extended far beyond what was necessary for the film. Fishburne is fine as Daily Planet’s editor-in-chief Perry White, but he’s given so little to do it’s questionable why his character even made it into the film other than for a completists’ sakes. Diane Lane is satisfactory as Clark’s adoptive mother, but she seems like she’s acting in a completely different film, one that’s a touch more humanstic than bombastic. And bombast is where Snyder’s film fumbles. Here’s a filmmaker that, in spite of his past films’ lack of plot and capable dialogue, Snyder has shown a visual skill that few directors possess. When given to style over substance, he has a tendency to ignore that which makes movies great. Here was an opportunity to push back against the criticism and give us a Superman that was not only well-written, but also visually spectacular. There are moments of inspiration, specifically the massive core-through terraforming beam, but much of the rest of the film is so devoid of splashy exuberance that it could have been made by any director. While I appreciate an advancement for Snyder in terms of maturity, giving into the studio model so vociferously is disappointing. That said, Snyder has shown an advancement in ideas and concepts and has crafted a film that’s far more interesting as a storytelling vehicle than it is as a superhero vehicle. Yet, his childish side gets the better of him in the excessive destruction that permeates the final reel. Here’s a city threatened by a force which it has never seen and no matter what our Man of Steel does, thousands of innocent lives are lost and untold destruction ensues because he can’t stop Zod sooner or more effectively. Here’s where the audience’s predeliction towards carnage is catered. While a city in peril is a fascinating concept, when the destruction itself becomes more than just a set piece, it takes on a life of its own. It becomes excessive and brutal to a point where credibility is diminished. Of course, a film like Man of Steel struggles with credibility simply from its basis in comic books, there comes a point where you have to say too much is too much. Since the 1970’s, films that feature heavy swaths of destruction have been increasingly popular. Films like The Towering Inferno or Earthquake have spawned countless imitators and those disaster films have slowly seeped into modern action filmmaking. There was a time when a potboiler like The French Connection didn’t have to depend on wanton destruction to sell tickets. Yet, as the cathartic joy of seeing familiar places crumble to dust settles in on younger audiences, the normative response has been to employ as many explosions as possible and an equal level of property damage. There are examples in recent cinema where a central premise can be so consuming that the explosion that sets off the chain of events depicted becomes secondary to the premise. Source Code should be held up as an example of how to make a film without resorting to annihilation to exhilerate and titillate the audience. Zack Snyder may not be the director to push forward that kind of concept. After all, many of his past films have been excessively violent and stylistically so; however, here he’s beginning to resemble the workman directors like Michael Bay who aren’t as concerned with plot as long as there’s plenty of bombs and explosions.",POSITIVE
"Nov 17, 2013"," Is Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel the gritty and realistic take on Superman that we’ve all been waiting for. Well, not really. It’s part of the new wave of dark superhero origin stories that has been on the rise ever since Christopher Nolan dropped Batman Begins on us. Man of Steel mostly benefits from the new approach, allowing us to see the birth of Superman through an entirely different light. Unfortunately, as promising as that concept sounds, Snyder’s strong and moving direction is a poor match for David S. Goyer’s limp script. Man of Steel is a good summer blockbuster that boasts impressive effects and a strong lead, but most of the supporting cast is dwindled down to nothing as Goyer’s script tries to cram in as much action as possible, leaving the supporting characters to suffer. The film covers the origins of Clark Kent/Kal-El (Henry Cavill), following the character in infancy as he drifts through the stars and makes his way to Earth after being jettisoned from a dying alien world called Krypton. Kal-El’s Earth parents, the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), adopt and raise him as Clark after his shuttle crashes, knowing that someday they’ll understand why he was sent to Earth. Kal-El finally discovers his true purpose when Earth is visited by General Zod (Michael Shannon), the former military leader of Krypton who seeks to destroy Earth and rebuild Krypton in its place. Snyder tackles a lot of themes with Man of Steel. The focus on this particular Superman film is the character finding his purpose and figuring out his destiny. Snyder wisely flashes back to Kal-El’s childhood, while primarily focusing on present-day events as they unfold. This is where the range in the film’s writing quality appears the most, with Goyer’s script offering up plenty of great flashback sequences but not much material when it comes to the remainder of the film. The reason these flashbacks work so well is because Snyder cast strong actors like Costner and Russell Crowe. These two men carry most of the film’s weight, providing two very different father figures for Kal-El to look up to and question. Crowe’s wisdom and constant fight for peace and equality is courageous and noble, while Costner’s approach delivers much-needed hope and optimism. Together, the two help Kal-El determine what course his future should take. Unfortunately, the rest of the supporting cast is dead weight. Amy Adams’ Lois Lane is cut down to a pointless side character who occasionally drives Kal-El and makes him focus on saving those around him. Meanwhile, Shannon’s Zod, though menacing and cruel, is mostly just another obstacle for Kal-El to overcome. Shannon works wonders in the small role, providing us with a villain to really hate, but Goyer’s writing doesn’t give him nearly enough content to chew on or engage with. He’s a serviceable distraction. Cavill’s Superman is definitely a fresh take on the character, but his effectiveness depends on what you’re personally expecting. If you’re okay with a new Superman who is much more troubled and uncertain, then Cavill is your man. He’s nothing like the character played in previous films, and that’s perfectly fine, because he and Snyder have established a completely different take on the character, one faced with tremendous inner turmoil and confusion. His ideas about the function of peace (ultimately a small part of the film), however, are somewhat neutered by a combination of Goyer’s script and Snyder’s hunger to shoot large-scale action and destruction, but the film as a whole doesn’t suffer too much from it. Man of Steel isn’t Superman’s version of Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. It keeps the same tone and themes, but its execution is very different, mostly because of Superman’s interstellar origins and extensive backstory. Snyder is one of the most gifted directors working today from a visual standpoint, and he does more than enough to get that point across in Man of Steel. The film is a marvel to look at and features many richly detailed, downright beautiful shots and sequences. Snyder also really knows how to shoot action and how to evoke strong emotions from imagery, perhaps more than anyone else today. So, it’s a real pity that he’s let down so colossally by Goyer’s unfocused, unpolished script. With that fatal flaw working against it, Snyder’s film never becomes something amazing. Instead, Man of Steel is a hybrid, really good in some areas and really poor in others. Man of Steel‘s 1080p video transfer is another reference-quality presentation from WB. The film’s overall color palette remains murky and full of grays, but the presentation is always as sharp as can be and full of strong edges. Skin tones are natural and lively, while the film’s many CGI-heavy sequences blend in almost effortlessly. This is a strong picture from top to bottom and one that will no doubt be viewed over and over again. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is a rumbling masterpiece. This track is full of sonic boom and thumps, with action spilling out onto every single channel in very frequent bursts. There’s a lot of high and low range to this track that constantly keeps the channels active and loud, yet detailed when on the quieter side, which is rare, but it does happen. Dialogue sticks out on the front channels without much distraction. Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel is a flawed summer blockbuster that attempts to peel back the layers of a quintessential character. It mostly succeeds as a brand-new take on such an iconic hero, but David S. Goyer’s writing holds it back from becoming anything more than a grandly staged action film sprinkled with occasionally great character work. Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner really shine in their roles, while the rest of the cast limp along thanks to a script that cruelly limits them.",POSITIVE
"Nov 8, 2013",MAN OF STEEL is everything you've ever wanted in a Superman movie,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2013"," Despite a ton of action — some of it impressive, some merely clangorous — Man of Steel just didn’t feel like a Superman movie to me. It wasn’t just that Henry Cavill, the British actor who plays Superman, looks a bit like a young John Travolta — only buffed to the max. And it wasn’t that many of the touchstone events marking Clark Kent’s evolution to Superman pass without appropriate fanfare. And it wasn’t that lovable stock figures such as Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) have been drained of vitality or even that spunky Lois Lane (Amy Adams) knows Superman’s true identity from the start. They even smooch. But by flooding the Superman story with blockbuster-style action and by presenting it in distinctly darker hues, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen) has deprived Man of Steel of the innocence, humor and moral certainty on which Superman thrives. And by updating the series to the present day, the filmmakers are forced to abandon some of Superman’s trademark flourishes. In the age of the cell phone, Clark Kent would be hard pressed to find a phone booth in which to change into his trademark outfit, form fitting tights and a red cape. Even Superman’s suit has been rendered in a  darker shade of blue than those of his predecessors, suggesting a super hero for an era consumed by global gloom. And that “S” on Superman’s chest? You might have thought it stood for Superman; it’s really a  symbol of hope from his home planet, Krypton. Snyder & company treat Man of Steel  as an origins story. In much of the movie, Superman is referred to as, Kal-el, the name he was given by his father Jor-el (Russell Crowe) on Krypton.  This young superhero has yet to discover his destiny, which eventually will cast him as a Christ-like savior for a needy planet, providing, of course, you can imagine a savior whose battles can result in the wanton destruction of whole cites. At the movie’s end, Metropolis becomes the stage for a fierce battle between Kal-el and General Zod (Michael Shannon), a villain who escapes imprisonment, along with a handful of dedicated followers after the planet Krypton self-destructs. The planet’s core gives way, much like the center of this highly anticipated re-start. In case you think I’m exaggerating about the connection between Superman and a more widely acknowledge savior, consider  this: The movie includes a scene in which a troubled Clark Kent talks to a priest. A stained-glass figure of a kneeling Jesus provides an obvious symbolic backdrop for the conversation, which takes place moments before Superman makes an appearance in his trademark cape. Perusal of the supporting cast gives you a quick idea about the way Man of Steel unfolds. Kevin Coster appears as Superman’s earthly father, the dad who doesn’t want his adopted son to reveal his powers lest the wary residents of Earth turn on him.  Zod plans to destroy humanity and reconstruct the planet Krypton on Earth, thus ensuring the survival of his race. To do this, he must tamper with the Earth’s gravity and take possession of a Codex, a device in which all the genetic codes of Krypton have been implanted. Man of Steel doesn’t skimp on action. When Superman, still a drifting Clark Kent, saves the crew of a burning oil rig, the large scaled imagery proves impressive. So do CGI images of a monster tornado that sweeps over Smallville. And for those who like pulpy views of alien planets, early depictions of Krypton may prove interesting. Of course, these also devolve into showers of fiery pyrotechnics. Making Zod the villain tends to turn Man of Steel into a second-rate space opera that’s equipped with ominous spaceships that resemble giant bugs that perhaps should have been fought with mega-blasts of Raid. A booming display of CGI dominates a protracted finale that features so much destruction, you might think that Snyder hired Michael Bay (of Transformers fame) as a consultant.  There had been hope that the participation of  Christopher Nolan (of Batman fame) as one of the film’s writers and producers would add a compelling contemporary sensibility to the Superman story. But looked at with the benefit of hindsight, a more serious Superman represents a major miscalculation. The same goes for the memory-trigged flashbacks that reveal Superman’s childhood. Kal-el remembers a youth in which he tried to restrain his super powers, prompting an  identity crisis that pervades the movie. This Superman really is an alien on Earth.  We’re all locked into our personal cultural prisons. In the case of Superman, the walls of mine were built from the comic books I read as a kid when my parents weren’t looking, from the early TV show starring George Reeves and from the better Superman movies in which Christopher Reeve found a signature role. This edition — which no doubt will smash as many box-office records as it does Metropolis skyscrapers — seems to lack deep affection for Superman. To me, Man of Steel seems more like a medium-grade summer movie than a convincing revival. I missed the character whose claim to fame involved leaping tall buildings at a single bound and moving faster than a speeding bullet.  But even if you accept Snyder’s action-dominated 143 minutes, you may have have to admit that the movie might have benefited from some narrative Super Glue. Are scene-to-scene transitions a totally forgotten art? Only the movie’s final scene offers a hint of the winking chemistry that Superman needs. Yet, it too can seem weirdly misguided. Clark Kent lands a job at the Daily Planet, thus making him one of the few people in any galaxy who doesn’t know that the newspaper business is foundering. Bad career choice, Clark. Man of Steel — which offers enough action to induce motion sickness — can’t be accused of lacking an interpretive slant. (I didn’t like it, but at least it has one.) And, yes, it makes a hell of a lot of noise. What’s missing? How about a major helping of fun? How about a clear sense of yearning for the simple virtues Superman so reliably embodies? By the end of this edition, Superman not only had rocketed through Earth’s atmosphere, he’d basically flown the coop. ",NEGATIVE
"Sep 22, 2013"," Actually, that goes for the charmless film, which plods along despite a pedigreed cast. For starters, why overcomplicate an origins tale that has held up for 75 years? After Jor-El (Russell Crowe) ships his baby son from Krypton to Kansas, the story cuts to a grown Clark Kent (a bland Henry Cavill) serving as a deckhand on a random boat. Ok, then. Disconnected flashbacks lead Clark to his planet’s Zod (Michael Shannon), who aims to destroy Earth with…secretly harvested DNA?! No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Here, she’s as gloomy as the obits page in the Daily Planet! Even the action feels labored, with the last hour devoted to people running from fireballs and getting thrown through walls – all by way of phony-looking CGI effects. Throughout the 143-minute opus, Clark is lectured about the importance of being a “force of good” in the world. Clearly, the filmmakers themselves weren’t listening.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 18, 2013"," The words “Continuity” and “Canon” are greatly significant for comicbook fans, especially today, though such terms were fairly anomalous for most of the time that periodicals were filled with gridded pages featuring superheroes. Origin stories were revamped and revised for multiple characters across multimedia even in the very beginning and in those halcyon early days, few fans batted an eye at the changes, even when they came to the world’s first (and, thus, most stalwart) superhero, Superman. By the time of John Byrne’s revisionist 1986 miniseries The Man of Steel, Superman’s powers and origin had already been revised and updated many times, but this time the changes came with huge revisionist announcements, all tied to the universe-restructuring mega-event Crisis on Infinite Earths. This trend has continued in the comics, right up to the most recent slate cleaning revision found in DC’s “The New 52”. From almost the very beginning, however, Superman was not relegated to just DC’s graphic novels and each appearance in other media have carried their own continuity and concepts. The Adventures of Superman Radio Program (starting in 1940) featured a fully grown Man of Steel crashing to Earth and meeting two grown men who help him formulate the name “Clark… Kent” (because it sounded normal), thus completely eliminating the otherwise vital Ma and Pa Kent. The 1941-43 Superman cartoons from Max Fleischer studios debuted Superman’s first real flight (prior to this, he merely jumped a LONG way), a power that quickly found its way into the comics. Superman: The Animated Series revised Brainiac from a Coluan weapon (and/ or sideshow psychic) into a Kryptonian supercomputer, while Smallville revised Clark Kent’s super origins to include virtually everyone he would ever encounter (from Brainiac to Lex Luthor to Morgan Edge to Green Arrow to General Zod to even Doomsday) to characters he met before he ever donned the old red and blue costume. The point is, the revisions we see in Zack Snyder’s 2013 film The Man of Steel (written by David S. Goyer and The Dark Knight‘s producer-director Christopher Nolan), although many are unique to this movie, are not peculiar in the multimedia world of Big Blue. Released to coincide almost exactly with Superman’s 75th birthday, many changes and revisions have both boosted and plagued the granddaddy of all superheroes for generations now and every new generation reinvents Superman on the page and beyond for their own zeitgeist. That said, a comparison between the latest version and the collective and popular history of the character is most certainly warranted, especially with some of the more surprising aspects of Zack Snyder’s “reboot to the head”. It is worth noting that the previous attempt at Big Blue on the Big Screen, 2006’s Superman Returns, was not the flop many in the media like to claim that it was. Warner Bros’ $270,000,000 gamble resulted in a haul of almost $400,000,000, a hit by any stretch, though Warners had hoped for more. Thus the Man of Steel reboot was greenlit and has almost half-a-billion dollars (including marketing and production costs) invested in its success. Will it be the hit Warners demands (percentage-wise)? Time will tell. Will Man of Steel remain a hit with canon-conscious fans? That may be a very different story. As a movie critic, I analyze Man of Steel to be a very inventive science fiction film and a fairly fascinating alien invasion film, but only a “pretty good” Superman film. Beginning on a Krypton that feels truly alien (and resembles the color scheme of Snyder’s own 300), the viewer is treated to almost immediate action and an almost Edgar Rice Burroughs-esque scope of another world. Superman’s biological father Jor-El rides a tamed flying beast resembling something out of Avatar while Lara gives the first natural birth Krypton has seen for centuries (all Kryptonians-to-be are genetically engineered from a strange DNA Codex). The costumes and sets are “different” to the point of Ray-Gun, B-Movie Sci-Fi (and I mean that as a compliment) while Krypton’s arrogant political structure is the perfect breeding grounds for Zod’s own ethnocentric power hunger. This may feel quite, well, “alien” to those approaching Man of Steel with virgin eyes. Superman Returns was largely a sequel to Superman (1978) and Superman II (1981) and thus skipped its own origin story. The Krypton of those earlier films seems much more human (if desolate), but starting with the aforementioned 1986 miniseries, also called The Man of Steel, Krypton was a much less “familiar” environment and Kryptonians themselves were far from the super-family you’d want visiting your planet en masse. The depiction of these elitist survivors (even Jor-El was hardly the “sweet daddy” we have grown accustomed to) makes the importance of Martha and Jonathan Kent all the more vital in the evolution of the Superman we know. The Last Son of Krypton has the power to simply take over this planet. But he was raised as a good kid with a solid knowledge of right and wrong and easily defies the “Pure Kryptonian” ideal of Jor-El and the “Eradicator” program (designed to protect the culture of Krypton), as well as the Zod of the most recent film, and just as easily becomes Superman by choice. No more was Clark Kent the “mask”. Clark Kent is who Superman “really is”, not the other way around. The miniseries gives us an additional traditional representation of Superman’s debut, that being that Lois Lane was the one who named the hero “Superman” after he saved the crashing aircraft she was in (in some stories this has been retconned to a space shuttle). This leads to the question of what the “S” on the iconic chest shield really stands for. Since at least the 1980s the concept that the “S-Shield” had been a symbol of the “House of El” on Krypton before it stood for anything in English. Man of Steel, the film, gives a version of this motif that dates back at least to DC’s 52 maxi-series, explaining that the symbol only looks like an “S.” Actually the Kryptonian symbol for “Hope” as adopted by Jor-El’s family as something of a Coat of Arms. Although Lois comes close to saying “Superman” (getting almost a syllable in), it is a member of the US Military who first refers to Kal-El as “Superman” onscreen, indicating that’s what people are calling him. The story of Lois and Clark’s first meetings, however, takes a very different path in the 2013 film. Not only is the aircraft disaster written out, but so is the traditional “love triangle” between Lois, Clark and Superman. Instead before there even is a Superman, Lois is able to track and find Clark by tracing the wonderful things this super-powered kid had done since his abilities first manifested. This ease of discovery not only allows Lois to know Clark’s secret identity before he even has a public persona, but also opens the floodgates for virtually every man, woman and child in Kansas to figure this out immediately. This is, of course, a trait shared with the recent TV show Smallville (which debuted in 2001). With an obviously superpowered Clark Kent disappearing and becoming a bespectacled journalist in Superman’s chosen town RIGHT at the same time that a superpowered being who looks exactly like Clark did (up until last week) shows up, one must wonder how long it would take before Pete Ross, Lana Lang and the rest of the denizens of Smallville knock on the door of the National Enquirer (or even the Daily Planet) and belt out a loud chorus of “Have I got a scoop for YOU!” This “secret” becomes almost comical when Superman wrecks a US Government drone attempting to locate where the hero hangs his cape. “You won’t find it.” Superman says, then in response to the General’s inquiry of how America can trust Superman, he casually laughs and says “General, I grew up in Kansas; I’m about as American as it gets.” Thus, intrepid reporter Lois Lane is able to trace Clark Kent straight to his father’s grave just by following the trail (which did not originally feature a link to Kansas) but even with Superman’s admission of “Kansas” (where much of the super-fighting of the film none-too-coincidentally takes place), the United States Government is expected never to figure this guy’s secret out. Folks, Lois didn’t even have a surveillance drone to wreck. How long until Martha Kent is being experimented on at Area 51? The character of Clark Kent/ Superman has been, can be and will continue to be debated for as long as the character exists. Is this the Kryptonian space invader who (as Quentin Tarantino postulated in Kill Bill Vol. 2) creates Clark Kent as a parody of humanity in order to fit in with his lessers, or did the upbringing of Jonathan and Martha Kent create a well-nurtured good guy who can rise above his nature and do the right, most heroic and selfless thing for the good of his adopted home? In short: Nature or Nurture? Many “Elseworlds” stories and mythos explorations using pastiche characters have tested this theory in many ways. DC has given us out-of-continuity tales that have placed the crashdown of “Kal-El” in Soviet Russia, on the grounds of Wayne Manor (where he does, indeed, become a Kryptoninan-powered Batman), in the remotest regions of Africa, where he becomes a Tarzan analogue (with heat vision) and even featuring an ancestor of his crashing down in Revolution-Era New England and shaping the future of Earth long before Kal-El is born. Under Alan Moore, Superman pastiche “Supreme” has shown that virtually any minor change in continuity can alter the Superman archetype from gentle do-gooder to violent antihero in a heartbeat. Also under Moore, Miracleman (formerly Marvelman) decides that the only way to protect humanity from superpowered threats is to reform society and all nations in Miracleman’s own image, thus creating a terrifying (if intentionally benevolent) new world order, more frightening than the plans of most villains. In Man of Steel we are shown a confused, wandering Clark Kent who proves that it is in his very nature to do great good on a large scale. However, this “overgrown boyscout” isn’t quite the Superman we have grown to expect. “Necessity” leads him to steal clothing, tell a plethora of “white lies” and resist direct confrontations with surly, unpleasant people (though he seems to take little issue with covert sabotage). One can scarcely blame him for being confused, considering that his “Earthly father” Jonathan insisted that he hide what he can do for his own safety. While this is both logical and in keeping with established canon, this does lead to quite an unlikely moment in the film when Jonathan chooses his own death by cyclone over a super-rescue from Clark. This is a dramatic and moving scene, no doubt, but it also leaves one scratching the old head-bone. With Jonathan close enough to give hand and eye signals to Clark, even a non-powered human being would have run (at normal speed) to save the man (not to mention the poor old family dog). Was this a tough decision to make? Definitely… and not one the Clark Kent we know would have accepted. Once the cape and tights (here a gift from Jor-El, not a design of his own, as in keeping with “The New 52”) are donned, we are reintroduced to this ambiguous character who skews to good. This Superman has no problem surrendering himself to US authorities to be handed over to the invading Kryptonian Death Squad under Zod, even though it may mean his own life. The Christian Symbolism gets a bit more heavy-handed when a resurgent “ghost” of Jor-El sends his only son down from the sky to save the people of Earth (“All of Them”) and Superman takes a moment to pose in a Cruciform pattern before his descent. In other news, Zack Snyder is wanted for the murder of Subtlety. Any information leading to the capture of Snyder for this Subtlety murder will be rewarded. For all his Super-Selflessness, we also are shown quite a lot of super-CAREless acts. In keeping with artist Alex Ross’ assertion that Superman is the ultimate “failed Christ” figure, Man of Steel’s Superman clearly means to do everything right and to defend and save the innocent (even and especially at great risk to himself) but also finds himself incapable of playing the hand he’s dealt perfectly. In a powerful scene, Superman uses his heat vision to carve up the Kryptonian birth-ship that holds the future of Superman’s very race. “Krypton had its chance!” he cries as he sends the ship (and its pilot, the mad-god Zod) to the ground. In that the ground that the ship (and Zod) crash into is still populated by the horrified, fleeing refugees of the city of Metropolis, Superman clearly either feels Metropolis had its chance as well, or he didn’t quite think that far ahead. Let’s not forget that catching falling aircraft and spacecraft is kind of what Superman does… all of the time. It’s safe to suggest that the poor Metropolitan refugees were already having a textbook crappy day before a big, broken UFO landed on their heads. This could be the result of the young Superman still getting his bearings. After all, he had just put on the costume and just learned to fly (as opposed to major jumping) when a major Alien Invasion took place, however this is not the result of Clark Kent’s lack of care for the denizens of his adopted (and now chosen) home. The famous-cum-infamous “Coup de Grace” scene showcases a barely contained General Zod using his newfound powers to take out a few more refugees courtesy of a heat vision blast. Superman’s answer is to (quite reluctantly) break the neck of his opponent, thus ending him permanently, though it causes Superman no end of screaming grief to do so. The question is, would Superman as we know him willingly take a life? Did he have no choice? Couldn’t he have simply thrown himself on his back and carried Zod with him in his sleeper-hold or rolled him forward to heat vision the marble into a death mask? Of course, changing that sequence would also have also deprived us of possibly the most dramatic and character driven moment of the entire film, but the question remains, is that “character” the character we know? This is far from the only looming question mark in this new continuity (which has long been rumored to be the kickoff of an Avengers-like Justice League team-up). However, as convoluted and often over-the-top as the film can be, it remains a great slice of box-office fun. At times Superman takes a huge back seat to the other elements in the film to the point that it often feels like a Sci-Fi, Alien Invasion flick that Superman has a cameo appearance in. However, the gradual emergence of Kryptonian powers and the required Earth ingredients to unlock these is straight out of the (current) comics, as are many of the elements Snyder, Nolan and Goyer got so perfectly right here. Is this “Your Father’s Superman?” Is Man of Steel simply the latest revision of the classic character for the next generation of comicbook movie fans? The answer is yes… but “which father”? The pre-Super Clark infamously told Jonathan and Martha Kent “You’re not my parents”, while later proudly (and insensitively) informing the now-widowed Martha that he’s finally found his parents. Both scenes (and his ready embrace of Jor-El’s Elder Hamlet-like ghostly presence) seem to indicate a rejection of the Earthly family who raised him, in direct (and ignorant) contrast with the comicbooks upon which this film was based. This is also the Superman who chooses (albeit not-without-destructive ramifications) Earth over Krypton and ultimately declares that he is as American as it gets. The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comicbook-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the “imperfections” column. The Man of Steel, much like his motion picture namesake, is far from perfect… but he is the Superman we have now.",NEUTRAL

Man of Steel (PG-13) 


Up until now, however varied their ultimate emphases ended up being, all big or small screen takes on Superman have been recognizably cut from the same cloth.  Whether the original '50s George Reeves series, Superboy, Lois & Clark, Smallville, and the many animated iterations on television to the iconic Christopher Reeve-starring franchise and its 2006 de facto revisionist timeline sequel Superman Returns in cinemas, at their core lies a fidelity to not only Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's basic Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis/Daily Planet/dual identity set-up arc, but a certain unmistakable core of unironically, unabashedly, and rather quaintly squeaky-clean Americana--both in terms of a nostalgic, homespun idealism and, maybe most importantly, a child-like purity in its sense of awe, wonder, and flat-out joy at all the super-feats.  That director Zack Snyder and writers Christopher Nolan and David Goyer have left the character's name out of the title of Man of Steel proves to be less a move to evoke Dark Knight chic (though, it must be noted, the film makes obvious a concerted effort to make Superman comfortably coexist in the same universe as Nolan and Goyer's heavily real world-grounded take on Batman) than both a literal and figurative mission statement.  In the literal sense, Snyder does the complete opposite of what Bryan Singer did with his 2006 extended homage to Richard Donner's revered and justly influential 1978 film.  Gone is the literally crystal-clean design of Donner's Krypton, in its place a grungy, dirtier bio-metallic motif--""man of steel"" indeed as Kryptonian metal plays a (again, literally) key element to the story as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his infant son Kal-El to earth to save him from the planet's imminent imposion.  A certain unpolished, rugged quality also extends to the look of Superman (Henry Cavill) himself, with his hair not exactly messy but also not quite immaculately spit-curl-coiffed either; and even (gasp) chest hair peeking from the neckline of his costume, which while on the whole true to the classic look eschews the familiar red undies-as-overwear accent.
But foremost is the figurative sense, where ""man of steel"" applies to the film in ways beyond Earth-rechristened Clark Kent's super-powered Kryptonian mettle.  The focal point here is not his famous physical strength(s), but the more loaded question of if he can maintain a certain ""steel"" of psychological and emotional stoicism, and Nolan and Goyer initially frame this within the dueling philosophies put forth by his two father figures: from beyond the grave Jor-El expresses his wish for Kal-El to find the fortitude to serve as an ideal for humanity to which to aspire while his adoptive earthling father Jonathan (Kevin Costner) raises him preaching the opposite, to be courageous enough to not give the slightest outward hint of his special abilities much less use them to fight back or even save others.  Thus as the focus lies, more than in any other previous screen Supes, on his  alien nature and the nature of his alienation, this film is a lot more gravely serious and frankly cold like steel.  Never mind the virtual dearth of humor; there is also a curious lack of warmth to the whole film, as Clark's interactions with Ma (Diane Lane) and Pa Kent are infused with angst and with the Daily Planet (a common source of levity in the Supes mythos) very much downplayed here,  the origins of his connection and very root of his relationship with with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) are completely reworked (somewhat cleverly, upending the whole dynamic to which Supes fans are accustomed) and the big CG-palooza of a finale is one of those extended FX-lab-created monuments of mayhem that offer a lot of frenzied visual chaos that dazzles the visceral senses though doesn't exactly stir the heart.
As expected (if not downright required) as it is, such a closing sensory assault comes as a disappointment when Snyder, Nolan, and Goyer appear to work overtime to build the dour, character-rooted drama--not just Clark's, but also that of the big bad, Phantom Zone-escaped Kryptonian General Zod, played with the blend of equal parts emotional intensity and off-the-hinges batshit crazy one expects from Michael Shannon; in an unexpected but welcome touch, there is some deeper explanation for his manic determination to conquer Earth.  But once the film hits climax mode, just about all of that groundwork gets thrown out the window (and actors such as Adams, Lane and Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet chief Perry White wither around with little to do) with same ferocity that Superman and Zod throw around each other.  Ironically, though, that finale is a major example of the film's strongest virtues: its blockbuster action scale.  As Superman engages Zod in an epic, epically destructive battle, Snyder delivers the type of undeniable, overwhelming charge with which he's become Sny-nonymous, and his affinity for spectacle strongly courses throughout as the film is nothing if not technically adept, making shamelessly flashy and indeed effective use of his bottomless CGI toolbox.  For a film that clocks in just shy of two and a half hours, while undoubtedly aided by strong casting choices across the board, Snyder keeps the energy high and the pace moving (though a recurring nonlinear flashback structure in the first half doesn't always work) even when not in mayhem-minded mode.
...which is why, though on the whole a satisfying entertainer taken by itself, Man of Steel is more of an effective set-up for potential to be fully realized in further installments.  Cutting an aptly striking figure, Cavill also convinces with the more heavy dramatic material, and his chemistry with Adams, though eventually underused, clicks and is ready to be mined for some classic Lois and Clark romantic conflict--which, of course, is rooted in the Kryptonian vs. Earthling, ""god"" vs. man dueling dichotomies that Nolan and Goyer take such pains to establish.  If Snyder and company are able to maintain that and get over their apparent fear of embracing the ""super"" of Superman (after all, both the Donner and Richard Lester versions of 1980's Superman II prove that treating the characters and emotional relationships with respect and gravity and having a sense of wonder and fun need not be mutually exclusive), then, to use a lazy hack critic pull-quote ready statement, the franchise can truly, eventually soar.  But as of now, this film is certainly a strong, propulsive launch, which is about one would hope for for any prospective screen franchise.

This Is the End (R) 


It's both a remarkable act of chutzpah and one of equal, if not even far greater, hubris to not only write and direct a fictional film with you and your off-screen friends/frequent on-screen collaborators playing yourselves, but a big blockbuster-style-FX-heavy end-of-the-world scenario, but that's exactly what Seth Rogen, making his feature directing debut with regular writing partner Evan Goldberg have done with This Is the End.  Luckily for Rogen, Goldberg, and their celebrity friends--but mostly for us, the moviegoing audience--that their comic chops and their sense of humor about themselves are in direct proportion to their sheer balls.   If there was such a thing as an anti-vanity exercise, this may well be it, with Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, and an assortment of familiar others (among them, Emma Watson, Kevin Hart, Rihanna, and Michael Cera) gathering at James Franco's mansion for one of those self-indulgent, even self-destructive, pampered people's bacchanalia, which quickly, suddenly goes horribly awry in the most outrageous way possible: the coming of no less than the apocalypse.  It's an outrageous, overblown, and even over-the-top idea, and similarly unrestrained are the focal six stars, being remarkably game sports and having a blast in rather scathingly sending up their own careers and public images (as well as, in a nice touch, throwing in some finer details from actual, real life, such as Robinson always carrying a towel for sweating), and the chemistry and byplay between them is organic, unforced, and all the funnier for it--the comic ante further upped by the apocalyptic plot, which not only generates actual suspense but seems to have even further liberated Rogen and Goldberg to really not pull the satiric punches: at themselves and at their careers and previous works, yes, but also about blockbuster disaster epics and the nature of celebrity.  That Rogen and Goldberg manage to make one of the Backstreet Boys' more annoying yesteryear hit singles not only tolerable but something you giddily sing along to is a measure of just how on point the satire is--that, or that it truly is the end of the world.

"Jul 23, 2013"," Dawn of the Dead kicks off with a fantastic opening sequence in which Ana (Sarah Polley) encounters two zombies in the form of her husband and young daughter. After fleeing her chaotic neighborhood, Ana hooks up with a grizzled cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and the two head out in search for help. They encounter a trio of survivors - Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and his very pregnant girlfriend Luda (Inna Korobkina) - who are heading towards the only safe refuge around, the mall. It's fairly clear that Dawn of the Dead is going for a more contemporary horror vibe, as the self-referential stuff is thankfully kept to a minimum (an appearance by legendary cult figure Tom Savini is one notable exception). While the film is undeniably quite entertaining throughout, it's never quite able to live up to the promise of the astoundingly intense first reel.  The remainder of the movie generally plays out like a standard horror flick,  with the apocalyptic feel of the opening never allowed to resurface. The comparatively light-hearted nature of the majority of Dawn of the Dead is exacerbated by the fact that there are just too many sequences featuring the characters engaging in small talk.   The so-called zombie baby, promised in the film's trailer, is emblematic of the film's refusal to take risks. One would hope such a creation would be running around biting the ankles of hapless victims, but  it's instead glimpsed for a second and then killed off-screen. The cast, comprised of many familiar faces (Max Headroom even pops up!), does a better-than-expected job of holding the viewer's interest through some of the more talky sequences. Though Polley is the last person one would expect to see in a trashy horror flick, she turns a potentially dull character into someone we're genuinely rooting for. Rhames is playing his now trademarked bad-ass character, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (c'mon, who wouldn't get a kick out of watching Marsellus Wallace blast zombies with a shotgun?) And Ty Burrell is effective in the obligatory wise-ass role, though his resemblance to Bruce Campbell borders on disturbing (why not just hire ol' Bruce?) As far as recent zombie movies go, 28 Days Later still remains the best - although in all fairness, Dawn of the Dead is surprisingly decent, especially compared to certain recent horror remakes. As silly as it is stylish, 300 - based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller - follows a small group of hardened Spartans (led by Gerard Butler's King Leonidas) as they take on Persia's seemingly limitless army. Director Zack Snyder has infused 300 with an overblown and thoroughly cartoonish sensibility that loses its novelty almost immediately; there's consequently very little here to draw the viewer in, as the filmmaker generally stresses egregiously broad action sequences over compelling characters or a halfway interesting storyline. Far more problematic is the emphasis on the backstabbing political shenanigans of Leonidas' fellow Spartans, with such sequences essentially grinding the proceedings to a dead halt - something that's primarily due to the overt lack of reality within the film's universe (ie in a movie overrun with goblins and demons, there's simply no place for debates that would surely feel more at home on C-SPAN). The end result is a film that's sporadically engaging but mostly dull (!); for every effective sequence (ie a slow-motion, Oldboy-esque episode in which a grizzled soldier takes on a whole host of attackers), there are two or three more that just fall flat and - more often than not - go on much, much longer than one might've liked (something that's particularly true of a speech towards the end that just feels endless). Though it boasts plenty of positive attributes and is generally entertaining from start to finish, Watchmen - much like its Alan Moore-penned inspiration - suffers from a pervadingly uneven atmosphere that ultimately ensures that the movie fares about as well as its overrated source material. The storyline follows several has-been superheroes (including Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl, Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, and Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach) as 
  

   they reluctantly team up following the death of one of their own (Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s The Comedian), with the bulk of the proceedings subsequently revolving around their collective efforts at preventing a criminal mastermind from executing a plan that would kill millions. It's worth noting Zack Snyder's notoriously in-your-face directorial sensibilities aren't quite as problematic as one might've feared, as the filmmaker - working from David Hayter and Alex Tse's screenplay - generally does a nice job of retaining many of the beats and plot points contained within Moore's work.  The  patchwork, almost episodic atmosphere that ensues inevitably does ensure that certain interludes are far more compelling than others, with Rorschach's stint in prison and Dr. Manhattan's origin story undoubtedly standing as highlights within the unapologetically bloated production. And while the movie has been outfitted with several unquestionably impressive performances (Haley is especially good as the surly and uncompromising Rorschach), there's simply no denying that some of Moore's indelible creations have been left woefully underdeveloped - with the increasingly muddled motivations of Matthew Goode's Ozymandias emblematic of Hayter and Tse's penchant for omitting large chunks of backstory from certain characters. It's ultimately clear, however, that Watchmen's most egregious failing is in its treatment of Moore's outlandish yet thoroughly satisfying conclusion, as the needless removal of a pivotal third-act element by Snyder and his collaborators is sure to raise the ire of those viewers with even a passing familiarity with the comic. The final result is a passable endeavor that's unlikely to make much of an impact on neophytes, although - admittedly - the film is probably as adept an adaptation of the source material as is possible without going the mini-series route. A typically overblown Zack Snyder effort, Sucker Punch follows '50s  teenager Baby Doll (Emily Browning) as she brutally attacks her evil stepfather and is subsequently sent to a sketchy mental facility - where the character, along with several fellow prisoners, plots her escape by imagining a series of progressively over-the-top fantasy worlds. Sucker Punch kicks off with a dialogue-free, slow-motion-heavy stretch that almost feels like a parody of Snyder's larger-than-life visual sensibilities, with the   broadly-conceived opening admittedly (and effectively) setting the stage for a storyline that rarely has any basis in reality - as Snyder, along with cowriter Steve Shibuya, plunges Baby Doll into the first of many imagined realms mere minutes after she arrives at the aforementioned mental facility. It is, as a result, initially rather difficult to work up any interest or enthusiasm for the protagonist's exploits, with the pervasively slick atmosphere compounded by the slow realization that Baby Doll's actions don't seem to have any  consequences in the real world. (It does, to be fair, eventually become clear that this isn't the case.) There reaches a point, then, at which the viewer is essentially forced to abandon logic and embrace the movie's gleefully broad, unapologetically in-your-face sensibilities, as the film inevitably does become a surprisingly watchable and flat-out fun piece of work once one accepts its complete and utter lack of reality-based elements. It's only as Sucker Punch charges into its comparatively low-key and incongruously dramatic third act that one's interest begins to wane, which effectively cements the movie's place as an innovative yet consistently inconsistent piece of work. The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Man of Steel follows Henry Cavill's Clark Kent as he struggles to find his place in a world that's not his own - with the character's existential musings interrupted by the arrival of a vicious Kryptonian warlord (Michael Shannon's Zod) bent on world domination. There's little doubt that Man of Steel gets off to a less-than-promising start, as filmmaker Zack Snyder, working from David S. Goyer's screenplay, opens the movie with a tedious stretch set on Superman's dying home planet of Krypton - with the overuse of computer-generated effects lending such scenes a derivative and surprisingly campy feel (ie if Avatar had been incompetent and terrible, it might've resembled this). The movie does, however, improve considerably once the action shifts to Earth, with the time-shifting script ensuring that the emphasis on the central character's early days rarely fares as poorly as one might've feared (ie Snyder and Goyer wisely skip over some of the more familiar aspects of Clark/Superman's origin story). Man of Steel's completely watchable atmosphere is heightened by its proliferation of impressive performances, with Cavill's strong work as the title figure matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Costner. (The latter's engrossing turn as Clark's adoptive father stands as an obvious highlight within the proceedings.) It's only as Zod (re)enters the picture that one's interest begins to slowly-but-surely dip, as the film's final hour is devoted entirely to the epic battle  between Zod and Superman - with the  ineffectiveness of this stretch (ie it's like watching someone else play a poorly-rendered video game) compounded by Snyder's  inept directorial choices (ie the shaky camerawork renders the majority of this stuff incoherent). The  endless third act ultimately transforms Man of Steel into a  disappointing (and surprisingly second-rate) piece of work, with the movie's lack of magic or wonder standing in sharp contrast to the previous portrayals of this iconic character (ie Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is looking positively masterful by comparison). As underwhelming and lackluster as its predecessor, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice follows the title characters (Henry Cavill's Superman and Ben Affleck's Batman) as they duke it out over differing opinions on how best to serve the public - with the pair eventually forced to cooperate after Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) unleashes a weapon that could destroy all of humanity. It's clear immediately that one of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice's biggest deficiencies  is its distractingly low-rent visual appearance, as director Zack Snyder and cinematographer Larry Fong have infused the proceedings with a grainy, cheap-looking sensibility that's heightened and perpetuated by an ongoing emphasis on shoddy special effects (ie some of this stuff looks like it's straight out of the movie's video game adaptation). Beyond that, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice suffers from  a whole raft of problems that increasingly test one's patience - with the erratic and almost stunningly disjointed narrative compounding the movie's various issues and preventing the viewer from embracing the material or characters. In terms of the latter, Cavill and Affleck, competent as they may be, are generally able to strike  only a single note of grim determination that essentially (and effectively) drains their iconic characters of their energy - while Eisenberg's disastrously quirky performance sticks out like a sore thumb from start to finish (ie the actor seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight, which quickly proves to be the absolute wrong choice for Luthor). And although the anticipated bout between Batman and Superman is actually not terrible (it is, at the very least, coherent), Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice closes with an  interminable climactic stretch detailing an  uninvolving battle with a laughably generic computer-generated creation - which, when coupled with more false endings than the last Lord of the Rings movie, confirms the film's place as just another incompetent endeavor from an almost shockingly untalented filmmaker. Zack Snyder finally hits rock bottom with this absolutely interminable trainwreck of a blockbuster, with the movie following several superheroes (Ben Affleck's Batman, Henry Cavill's Superman, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, etc) as they team up to battle a vicious villain named Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds). Justice League's complete and total failure is somewhat disappointing given an opening stretch that actually does hold some promise, as scripters Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon deliver a light and surprisingly fun first act detailing Batman's efforts at recruiting for the title organization. From there, though, Justice League segues into a plodding midsection that's rife with entirely uninteresting and downright pointless sequences - with the far-from-engrossing vibe compounded by a hopelessly bland antagonist and a series of aggressively generic action sequences. There's virtually no momentum to the narrative, ultimately, and it feels as though the whole thing were cobbled together piecemeal out of other installments, with the movie's pervasively shoddy atmosphere  never more apparent than in the hilariously chintzy CGI used to digitally remove Cavill's moustache (ie it's an effect that wouldn't pass muster on even the most low-rent, low-grade superhero television series). The underwhelming vibe prevents the various actors from making much of an impact, positive or otherwise, on the narrative, although there's no denying that Ezra Miller  manages to periodically elevate the proceedings with his charismatic, agreeable turn as Barry Allen/The Flash. Any positive attributes are rendered entirely moot by an absolutely disastrous third act, however, as Justice League climaxes with a protracted action sequence that's endlessly incoherent even by the standards of these movies - which certainly confirms the film's place as a total debacle that, one hopes, marks the low-water-mark for the comic-book genre.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 11, 2013"," With Man Of Steel, a new attempt to bring Superman to the big screen, director Zack Snyder has created a film filled with big, mythic images, but largely unburdened by the expectations of the character’s past. David S. Goyer’s screenplay expands on the familiar origin story while throwing out the elements it doesn’t need. That’s a refreshing approach for those weary of taking another trip to Metropolis by way of Smallville, and it creates a sense that the film might go anywhere. Mostly, however, Man Of Steel plunges headfirst into a loud, breathless science-fiction slugfest, offering much spectacle but little wonder. It’s a muscle movie, built for speed and driven by people with little interest in slowing down to take in the scenery. Goyer also penned the recent Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan (who produced here, and gets a story co-credit), and Man Of Steel largely takes the “Let’s try that again from scratch” approach of Batman Begins. Where 2006’s Superman Returns strained to summon up the spirit of Richard Donner’s Superman and its first sequel, Man Of Steel seems eager to erase the past, starting with a Krypton that looks more like a Roger Dean album cover—complete with flying dragon-like creatures—than previous films’ world of frosty crystal palaces. From there, it proceeds through some major divergences from the traditional elements of Superman lore. It distances itself from Superman Returns in other ways, too, steering clear of the high emotion that gave the film its heart, however flawed. Man Of Steel is a bold movie, but a cold one, too. It opens on Krypton, where planetary elder Jor-El (Russell Crowe) watches his wife Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) give birth to their son Kal. The first naturally birthed child the planet has seen in centuries, Kal arrives just in time for Krypton to enter the final stages of destroying itself, and he’s sent off to Earth moments before Jor-El falls at the hands of his hawkish rival General Zod (Michael Shannon, appearing even more otherworldly and angry than usual). Sentenced and exiled before Krypton’s final bow, Zod and his co-conspirators follow Kal into space. They’re consigned to a floating space prison, but it’s fragile enough that they escape to haunt the last son of Krypton later in the film. And not much later, either. Man Of Steel skips ahead, doling out in flashback scenes of Kal’s upbringing in Kansas, where he’s rechristened Clark by his adoptive parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). The present-day action commences with Kal as a bearded adult drifter, working on a coastal trawler, but destined to move on after some heroic feat threatens to expose his identity. The film suggests this scenario has played out many times over the years. Kal is played by Henry Cavill, introduced as a handsome face perched atop a sculpted physique with Herculean capabilities. In his early scenes, he expresses himself largely through strained grunts, and Man Of Steel doesn’t test his range much as it progresses. Given only a few scenes with any significant dialogue, Cavill’s Superman remains an object of mystery, which doesn’t always work in the film’s favor. Viewers get to know Clark as a bullied, outcast kid, played at different ages by other actors, but he grows up to be a superhero who remains at a remove. At times, Clark and Superman feel like separate characters. When the grown-up Clark visits a priest in a rare break from the action, the reflective moment feels forced. A few more such moments might have made a difference, especially since when he isn’t punching people, Cavill brings a calm, compassionate quality to the part. Coming to the aid of Lois Lane (Amy Adams), he states, “I can do things that other people can’t,” and the words sound almost eerily modest, the sound of a god doing his best not to scare off a much weaker creature. Complementing that quality, Snyder loads the film with Christian imagery and shots of small-town America that evoke Terrence Malick’s heartland meditations. But any deeper meaning gets buried deep beneath the destruction. Adams has some nice moments playing Lane as a hard-charging professional not above swooning in the arms of her super-powered rescuer. And Costner and Lane show real tenderness playing parents to a creature whose power they can guide but never control—a fine metaphor for parenthood in general. But ultimately, Snyder makes every other element feel like set dressing for the high-flying action scenes that dominate the movie from beginning to end. That’s half the reason to make a Superman movie, but only half. Snyder is skilled at putting Man Of Steel’s hero in iconic poses, cape flapping in the breeze as he floats placidly with the sun at his back. But though the script makes frequent reference to him serving as an Earthling-inspiring ideal sent to improve humanity, Snyder mostly turns him into a punching machine. Still, the pleasure the film takes in watching him punch is considerable, and the action scenes, stretching from the ground to the sky and back, are unfailingly impressive. In the style of Cloverfield and Chronicle, Snyder uses handheld camerawork to bring added notes of chaos and documentary believability, filling the screen with overwhelming CGI effects but keeping the frame shaky and unstable, offering the view a well-positioned bystander might see before ducking out of the way. The approach yields some remarkable images, yet never creates any real sense of danger. At times, the film seems almost Godzilla-like in the pleasure it takes destroying whole blocks of both Metropolis and Smallville. (The latter, incidentally, is home to more high-profile product placement than small-town Kansas would seem to allow.) Snyder spends a moment capturing the beauty of both, and a much longer stretch reducing them to rubble. He also rushes any development of the character devoted to saving them. Buildings collapse and innocent bystanders flee, but seldom has the world getting saved seemed so inevitable, or the hero doing the saving so dutiful, distant, and unknowable. For all Man Of Steel’s attempts to stay grounded, its hero remains frustratingly more super than man.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 10, 2013"," We’ve always known in the back of our minds that there was a science-fiction angle to the Superman saga — he’s an extra-terrestrial, after all — but none of the big-screen versions have emphasized it. Until now. “Man of Steel” starts with a rousing action sequence on the doomed planet Krypton, giving us a detailed view of Kryptonian technology and animal life, and then delivers a plot driven by “world engines,” alien invasions, singularities, terraforming, and the basic questions about what it means to be human. It does all of this while presenting Superman’s origin story, though with a slightly different spin from what we’ve seen before (at least in the movies). Directed by Zack Snyder (“300,” “Watchmen”) and written by David S. Goyer — who’s an old pro at this sort of thing (“Batman Begins,” “Blade”) — “Man of Steel” sends brooding, bearded Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) on a journey of personal discovery before he dons the cape and tights, and even before he adopts the dorky, bespectacled “mild-mannered reporter” persona. There’s no need for a secret identity at first, because he’s just a guy named Clark Kent who happens to have alien DNA and extraordinary powers. There is no “Superman” yet. Flashbacks to Clark’s youth show key moments in his development while letting the present story progress. His adoptive parents (played with tenderness by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) are protective, with Pa Kent in particular concerned about what will happen to Clark when the world learns his secrets. We humans do tend to react with fear and alarm to unfamiliar things, and the Kents’ worries are confirmed when some of Clark’s heroic deeds become publicly known. A certain newspaper reporter named Lois Lane (a feisty Amy Adams) happens to get involved, too. Clark, his powers, and his heritage are drawn out into the open with the arrival of General Zod (Michael Shannon), a Kryptonian psycho who’s been searching the universe for an important piece of technology that could rebuild the Kryptonian race and may have been sent to Earth with baby Kal-El. Zod and his crew, imbued with powers like Superman, are a good match for him, and for the U.S. military, the leaders of which aren’t sure whether ANY of these aliens, Clark Kent included, are trustworthy. For a while — probably two-thirds of the running time — the film is grandly entertaining. Cavill makes a fine Superman, physically speaking (he’s brawny and hairy-chested, not to mention lantern-jawed), and he has the right blend of stoicism and basic decency. A few moments between young Clark (played by Dylan Sprayberry) and his Earth dad are sublimely touching. (His biological father, played by Russell Crowe, is also present, in convenient holographic form, to give paternal guidance.) Michael Shannon and Antje Traue are appropriately menacing as Zod and his right-hand butt-kicker, Faora-Ul, and Snyder captures the sheer terrifying speed with which these super-characters can move when they’re fighting. Though different in tone from the more colorful and humorous Superman films of yesteryear, and though I miss Jimmy Olsen and bumbling Clark Kent and John Williams’ iconic musical score, Snyder and his team make the new, grittier formula work. But then, as we get into the climactic battles, the level of wanton destruction becomes excessive, even tacky. The apocalyptic damage visited upon Smallville and Metropolis is treated as though it has no consequences. I’m accustomed to filmmakers viewing mayhem that way — but it’s troubling that Superman doesn’t seem to care. Superman is supposed to do everything he can to protect people, even when he’s got his hands full with enemies. He could draw his opponents away; instead he fights them on Smallville’s Main Street, leveling it like a tornado, and then in downtown Metropolis, knocking over one skyscraper after another, seemingly oblivious to the devastating collateral damage. Not only is that a betrayal of the character’s ideals, it’s a tired way to end a movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 1, 2013"," Seven years ago, Warner Bros. tried to bring this popular franchise back to life with Superman Returns. Everything seemed to be in place. Superhero movies were increasing in popularity. Director Bryan Singer had already proven himself with the X-Men series. Brandon Routh was a fresh-faced actor ready for stardom. For whatever reason, it didn’t work. The film pulled in only $391m at the international box-office and while that may sound like a lot, it was just enough to cover the production and marketing costs. The studio had lost faith and a sequel, scheduled for release in 2009, was canned. As the saying goes – if at first you don’t succeed, try again. Warner Bros. has coughed up another $225m and is having a second crack at revamping the franchise. This time around, they’ve gone with director Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300) and brought in another newbie who is ready to make a name of himself, Henry Cavill (Immortals). You can forget about the earlier Superman flicks because we’re going right back to beginning with Man Of Steel. The first scene of the film is set on the distant planet of Krypton where we witness the birth of our soon-to-be hero. The planet is about to implode (long story) so his parents throw him into an escape pod and send him off to the far distant planet of Earth. It’s the only way they can ensure the survival of not only their son, but their race as a whole. The film’s first hour is its most interesting with two stories being told concurrently. The current day narrative sees Earth under attack from a rather passionate villain, General Zod (Shannon). Zod fled Krypton before it exploded and spent 33 years trying to locate Kal-El aka Clark Kent aka Superman. Having finally made it to Earth, he has plans to annihilate the human population and make it home to a new race of Kryptonians. As we watch the drama unfold, we learn more about Superman and his past by way of flashback. We see him arrive on the planet and be raised by two loving parents. We see him get bullied at high school and watch him struggle to keep a hold on his super powers. We see his father warn him about humans and why he should keep his identity hidden. It seems we’re not quite ready to learn that we aren’t alone in the universe. While I like the way the past storyline overlaps with that of the current day, there are still some puzzling gaps. There’s a scene where a young Clark Kent saves a school bus which has plunged into a river. He was clearly seen by the students on the bus so why weren't questions asked?. How else did the bus get out of the deep water? Don’t even get me started on a strange development where an alien space ship is found beneath the arctic ice. You’d think the authorities would show a little more concern when it suddenly flies away under Clark’s control. I tried to like this film. I really did. For example, I was drawn to the heartfelt moments between Clark and his adopted father, Jonathan, where they discuss each other’s troubles. It’s a subtle, touching performance from Kevin Costner – one of his best in recent years. Unfortunately, these scenes are easily forgotten when you see the silly, comical way in which Jonathan meets his fate. It makes no sense. Man Of Steel suffers most in its final hour where in degenerates into a seen-it-all-before, CGI-laden action fest. Time could have been spent developing the fun relationship between Clark Kent and snoopy journalist Lois Lane (Adams) but instead, we get punches, explosions and buildings falling over. Michael Shannon trots out cheesy lines like “either you die or I do”. Oh, and let’s not forget that Superman is always in the right place at the right time to save the day. He’s the king of convenience. A sequel is planned but as we learned with Superman Returns in 2006, nothing is guaranteed in Hollywood. I think there’s hope for this rebooted franchise but would like to see something more engaging next time around.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 1, 2013"," It has always seemed obvious that the fundamental question of Superman is moral. Imagine a person who is both endowed with virtually infinite and irresistible powers and is invulnerable to any earthly resistance. What would stop such a person from using those powers to gratify his or her immediate desires? A human tyrant, after all, needs followers and an army; Superman can cow the world single-handedly. That’s the very question that Zack Snyder’s “Man of Steel” tries to work out. The big issues become the pretext for a ponderous movie that has much of the baseline wonder leached out, but, in return, gestures toward bigger questions. The Superman question is not a new one, of course. It’s at the basis of moral philosophy, as in the story of the Ring of Gyges, told in Plato’s “Republic” (the ring makes the wearer invisible). I knew little about “Man of Steel” besides the scuttlebutt that it had lots of backstory, so I figured that the underlying issue would be Superman’s coming to moral maturity—and, watching the movie, I was delighted to catch a flagrant wink to my surmise in a scene that shows young Clark Kent sitting by a fence reading Plato (and attracting the attention of bullies in the process). Yet for all the movie’s thick dough of quasi-theology, it poses, through a surprisingly coherent sense of allegory, the very question of whether the commonplace theology of modern life is even desirable. The great thing about the character is that it’s a man who is also super; and this movie, made from a screenplay by David S. Goyer (who wrote the story with Christopher Nolan), is by far at its best (and is fairly formidable) when it sticks with his tense relationship with earthlings and with his own attempt at passing as one. But the bulk of the film (in both senses) comes from the intergalactic backstory of Kal-El’s birth on an imploding Krypton. His father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), opposes the tyranny of General Zod (Michael Shannon). Defying the planet’s eugenics program, he and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer), have Kal-El naturally and, to save the newborn, send him to Earth. Lara worries that her son will be “an outcast, a freak,” but Jor-El foresees that “he’ll be a god to them.” The crux of the action is Zod’s effort to capture Kal-El (played by Henry Cavill) from Earth and, in the process, to destroy the planet’s population in order to colonize it with Krypton’s survivors (with the help of Kal-El’s genetic code). To set up the terrestrial battle of cosmic forces, the movie expends lots of time and bombastic energy establishing the politics and the premises of Krypton civilization. By the time that Zod and Kal-El have their showdown, the ruthless space general has got the measure of his opponent, telling the earthified and ethical Man of Steel, “The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not gives us an evolutionary advantage.” The core of that morality comes from the father; in effect, Jor-El is God the Father, and Clark Kent’s Joseph is Jonathan Kent, fifth-generation Kansas farmer and man of modest but unshakeable principle. As played by Kevin Costner, he utterly steals (and steels) the film. He knows that Clark will be forced to play a larger role than any he intended, telling him, “When people find out where you came from, it’s going to change our beliefs.” Later, Jor-El—or, rather, a postmortem materialization of him—gives Kal-El the speech about being a force for good—and also gives him the cape and the tights, with a real showman’s sense that a religion needs a good logo to put it over. And if there’s any doubt about the coherence of the symbolism, it’s emphasized twice that Kal-El has been on Earth for thirty-three years. But the real story of the movie is collateral damage. The destruction wrought on Earth by the malicious Zod is one thing, but when the newly dubbed Superman stands up to his father’s killer and Earth’s ravager, each zooming chase through the air and each blow landed wreaks horrific destruction. I found myself thinking of Gog and Magog, of Sodom and Gomorrah, of the Flood, and remembering that the term “Biblical” implies catastrophe, suggests an unfathomably large, and therefore legendary, devastation. Beware, Goyer and Nolan seem to warn, of the morally motivated conflict that you yearn to fight and win; beware of thinking in terms of realizing good or vanquishing evil on a grand, mythic scale, because when forces that hold the world in the balance do battle, even the winners are losers. The entire movie, with its thrumming and droning and lumbering and crashing, seems especially nostalgic for imagination and morality on the human scale. If it’s so much more engaging, even in its roiling gray clashes, than Nolan’s own movies, it’s due in large measure to the primordial simplicity, purity, and clarity of the issues that Superman brings in his wake. P.S. The insignia on the alien’s chest may, as Lois Lane tells him, look like an “S” here, but on Krypton, it means (as our own Mr. S., Steven Soderbergh, could have predicted) “hope” (scroll to the end).

"Jun 30, 2013"," It is ceaselessly fascinating how the specifics of the decades-long battle between comic book giants Marvel and DC are continually reflected in their respective film adaptations. While Marvel have had great success in both comics and movies by exploring the human, relatable side of their heroes, they could never quite achieve the culture-dominating status of DC’s best-known characters: Batman and Superman. Superman’s grand, mythic nature is both his greatest strength as a character and his fatal weakness. Man of Steel can’t quite overcome this, but it’s a heck of a lot of fun watching it try. Positioning itself as a “first contact” alien story is a unique (to cinema) way of exploring Supes, and director Zack Snyder offers a lot of great imagery around this idea. But it also keeps the lead character at arm’s length, which (combined with his aforementioned mythic nature) makes for a somewhat distant protagonist. But, character issues aside, this movie wholly delivers on the spectacle front. It is here where the mythic factor really sings – the sheer scale of what’s on screen here feels unprecedented. Snyder evokes the broad scope and tall building-focused action of producer Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight films, but also builds on Nolan’s style with increased pace and dexterity in the set-pieces. The grainy, blue-gray look of the film stands in marked contrast to the lush, bright colours of Snyder’s previous works, and there’s no sign of his signature speed-ramping either. His grasp of large scale action is in full-effect though. British actor Henry Cavill looks great as Superman, but Michael Shannon gets all the most emotive actor moments as baddie Zod. The visual aspects of Man of Steel fulfil the potential of a Superman movie made in the digital era, but the emotional side of things remains a tough nut to crack. Nonetheless, this is a valiant and stupendously entertaining effort.",POSITIVE
"Jun 29, 2013"," This is Jeff Bayer, and I don't update this site very often. If you'd like to listen to my current movie podcast you can find it at MovieBS.com. PLOT: Clark Kent (Cavill) is from an alien planet and armed with super powers. He must decide if Earth will accept him, and also deal with another alien known as General Zod (Shannon) and his plans to take over the world. WHO'S IT FOR? Everyone who likes big blockbuster superhero movies, which I think it technically everyone. If you're addicted to the Christopher Reeves' films, there might be too much change for you to handle. EXPECTATIONS: I listened to the trailer a few times (yes, I close my eyes during movie trailers, or leave the theater). I loved the music and the father/son moments that I was hearing. It's one of the films I was most excited for this summer. BEST SCENE: I really did love Krypton. Mainly because I had no idea we were going to get any action moments on this planet, let alone flying beasts. ENDING: There's a big battle in Metropolis, then some one-on-one time with General Zod. After that, we see Clark settle into a job he's pretty excited about starting. It immediately had me thinking about everyone who knows what Superman looks like, and if glasses are going to cut it. I know, it's just a movie. QUESTIONS: So, it was just random that the ancient scout ship ended up on Earth? Didn't that start all of the wheels in motion? It felt like there was a lot of stuff thrown at us, and I'm not exactly sure if it all made sense, I'm mainly thinking about the codex. Did you notice the semi-truck oil tanker that Superman jumps over in his fight with General Zod? It said Lexicorp on it. I smell sequel villain. REWATCHABILITY: I would sit through it again, but I feel like there would be chunks that feel like work. After all, it's a long flick. Take Thor, some Hulk, a little bit of X-Men, the ending of The Avengers or Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and don't forget Obama. Add it all up and you've got yourself Man of Steel. The entire film feels familiar, beyond the Superman story, and I'm not complaining about that. Getting Superman ""right"" is tough, and borrowing makes complete sense. Krypton reminded me of Asgard. The x-ray vision looks like Cyclops. Jumping like Hulk leads to flying. The ending is a boring, unsettling knock-off of every other blockbuster that must end with a city in ruins, and give us just a hint of 9/11. I don't think Man of Steel has an agenda, but it is interesting to notice some liberal concepts clearly making a home in this plot. Clark is an alien who has lived in Kansas most his life, and he truly feels American. The government just has to trust he is up to good (and not no good). Krypton is destroyed because they depleted the planet's resources. Superman brings the message of hope. I don't mind any of this, especially since the concept of people destroying a planet shouldn't have anything to do with politics. Any issues I have with the film are more about the style in which Snyder makes his presence known. It's an extended trailer or clip show of Clark's life. The only time the film seems to slow down and stay in one place is during an action sequence. It's like Man of Steel was a full TV season, but the studio said he just had to cut it together into a film. I never felt like I was on the journey with Clark/Kal-El/Superman. Instead it feels like Synder just wanted to show me some cool things. Man of Steel has moments of greatness thanks to quality actors doing their job, and a visual style that works for the action sequences. Unfortunately it doesn't put Superman back on top of our cinematic superheroes.",POSITIVE

"Jun 27, 2013"," After one of the most exhilarating action sequences in Man of Steel, Martha Kent (Diane Lane) tells her adopted alien son Clark (Henry Cavill), ‘It’s only stuff Clark, it can always be replaced.’ These are important words for Clark to hear from the woman who raised him as it helps reconcile the path of destruction he leaves behind while trying to find his true self. Man of Steel is an unconventional superhero origins films as the focus is not on the discovery and mastery of super-powers, although those scenes are included, but the focus instead is on the character’s psychological development. The result is a surprisingly grim and serious film that attempts to deconstruct the iconic and righteous Superman character to instead present him as a troubled man-child facing difficult moral choices and being traumatised about the nature of what makes him great. The character is barely ever referenced as ‘Superman’ and instead is referred to throughout the film by both his human name Clark Kent and his Kryptonian name Kal-El. Much of the film is spent resolving his identity and through the film’s adoption narrative, Clark struggles with the fact that he does not have a sense of belonging. He loves his adopted parents and the inhabitants of Earth, but is aware of how different he is. He is haunted by the words of his adopted father Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) who warns him about the devastating cultural shock that humanity could experience upon discovering that he is an alien. His attempts to blend in see him continually on the run; an outcast drifter continually reinventing himself every time he tries to start afresh. Searching for the truth, Clark gains fleeting comfort in discovering he came from a planet destroyed by both civil war and environmental destruction. More importantly in terms of character development, he learns that his birth father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) saw him to be a potential god among the human race. As well as the immense baggage of continuing an almost extinct alien race, he is torn between his natural father’s expectations and his adopted father’s caution. While Clark is mostly depicted in Man of Steel as an adult, the continual flashbacks to childhood, the multiple parental figures and the symbolic rebirths he experiences suggest that the character is in a state of mental and moral arrested development throughout nearly the entire film. Not only is Clark a nomad torn between two worlds, but he is also torn between the possibility that he is a god to be worshiped and the possibility that he is a freak to be feared. Worse yet, is that the many lives he has been covertly protecting on Earth become threatened as a direct result of him being there, when the militarist zealot General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives looking for him. The culmination of Clark’s psychological origins story is the film’s exploration of how a being with such advantageous powers can act morally. Clark has a genuine desire to be righteous, but as Jonathan explains to him that means making very careful decisions about when to act and when not to, resulting in potential scenarios where neither outcome is ideal. Hence the defeat of an enemy often comes with massive collateral damage that the film gleefully showcases during its big spectacle scenes. Keeping with the notion of Clark as still being in a state of cognitive development, his apparent anti-property attitude suggests the well meaning yet naïve mind of a rebellious teenager lashing out against society and its institutions. Clark nobly resists the temptation to physically hurt an obnoxious man in a bar, but still destroys property that is important to that man. It is a moment of initial catharsis that on reflection is an excessively cruel act that obliterates that man’s livelihood. During major action sequences in Smallville and Metropolis, Clark’s battles with Zod and his soldiers lay waste to those settings, which challenges whether or not Clark’s actions and approach to defending the Earth are justified. After the unknown innocent bystander body count, the question of destroying the human race to save the Kryptonians and Clark’s final confrontation with Zod, is the moral question of what lives and what principles should be sacrificed for the greater good. Clark’s symbolic coming-of-age is not making the right decisions, but accepting and being able to live with the moral complexity from making the difficult decisions. It is a surprisingly sophisticated examination of what it really takes to make somebody a super human. Man of Steel also serves as a curious warning about interventionism on several levels. The planet Krypton is destroyed due to over extracting its natural resources and it breaks down on a societal level due to the use of advanced genetics to enable social engineering. General Zod’s attitude towards Earth is one of aggressive colonialism and genocide, setting up a device that as it pulsates into the ground it picks up cars and bits of buildings and then smashes them back down again. The symbols of human civilisation are used as weapons back upon itself, perhaps suggesting some kind of punishment for humanity’s hubris towards how it manipulates its environment. The mass destruction in the film suggests acts of terrorism and reveals how vulnerable our constructed world can be. Notably Clark initially seeks employment in remote environments suggesting his desire to be far from the civilised world of interference. More notable is that he settles for an occupation that requires him to be an observer with supposed zero interference on what he observes. As a psychological coming-of-age film where the destruction caused by Clark Kent is an external expression of his id threatening to overwhelm rational thought, Man of Steel is really not a conventional superhero film, let alone what is most likely expected from a Superman film. Nevertheless the team of director Zack Snyder, writer David S Goyer and producer Christopher Nolan (among others) do throw in elements that try to help the film resemble what is conventionally contained in a superhero film. Unfortunately this means the inclusion of some clunky exposition, some silly dialogue and an extended final action sequence that loses its potency and inventiveness. All this would barely be noticeable if Man of Steel were simply another inclusion in the colour saturated and hyperactive Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, but because it aspires to be closer tonally to Nolan’s Batman trilogy, the more overt comic book elements feel out of place. Nevertheless, for the most part Man of Steel is exhilarating and visually engaging. The film has embraced the increasingly fashionable ‘found-footage’/Instagram aesthetic that incorporates lots of sun flares, objects artistically going out of focus, and snap camera zooms and movements to capture objects onscreen that seemingly appear without prior warning. Few of the visual techniques in Man of Steel are new, but Snyder and his team have used them extremely well to blend the emotional drama of Clark’s two families with the film’s science-fiction elements resulting in an impressive photorealistic quality to all onscreen elements. While the action and spectacle in the film ultimately wears out its welcome by being overlong and becoming generic, for the most part it is genuinely exciting. Making a Superman film that does not feel like a Superman film may not have been the plan, but when the result is a mostly-entertaining dark science-fiction parable about morality, those not overly invested in the Superman mythology will find a lot to enjoy in Man of Steel. As a huge Superman-Fan I confess to have been very apprehensive with all the changes but was pleasantly surprised once I saw the movie. Excusing all the little issues however, I personally think where they went massively wrong was Superman killing Zod at the end of the movie. I mean, Com’on! This guy is a symbol, he represents all that is good in Mankind and treasures life above all! It’s exactly for him not taking lifes, like all the other violent action heroes, that made him being “Super” in the first place. So he breaks his main code “Never to kill” and becomes like all the rest. That was for me the biggest disappointment and ruined the whole movie.",POSITIVE

"Jun 25, 2013"," An overwhelming  whirlwind of existential themes, religious overtones and full-on-faucet action  spectacle, Man of Steel exposes  Supermanâs greatest weakness: director Zack Snyderâs indulgence for excess. There  is a lot riding on Man of Steel. With  Marvel Studios cornering the market on superhero movies (The Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man)  the need for rival DC Entertainment to counter is vital, for while Christopher  Nolanâs Batman trilogy was a success other tent pole pictures (Green  Lantern, Superman Returns) failed to gain traction. Once again  it is up to Supes to save the day. With visually astute filmmaker Zack Snyder (300 and Watchmen)  in the director chair and Batman Begins masterminds  Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer handling story duties, expectations were  up, up and away. It is only that much more disappointing that Man of Steel fails to get off the ground,  with Snyderâs overblown display of style smothering the many interesting moments  that delve in the man behind the red cape. Itâs  story is as old as pop culture: young baby Jor-El is sent on a rocket ship ride  from his dying planet of Krypton to Earth by his loving father Kal-El (Russell  Crowe brining on the gravitas). On the blue planet he is adopted and raised by  Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane in emotionally rich  performances) who teach him the morals of value of humankind, lessons that stay  with young Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) as he grows into manhood and struggles to  make peace with who he is and what he is meant to be. Of interest  too are the religious overtones that pop up now and again, with Snyder and  company drawing parallels between Superman, son of Krypton and Jesus Christ,  son of God. Themes of faith and sacrifice for the eternal good are prominent,  as is a healthy dose of Christian symbology. It is a long bow to be sure (with  perhaps a better comparison to be made to Moses), yet that always bountiful  Christian market have lapped it up and helped Man of Steel reach new heights in box office receipts. Where Man of Steel losses its footing is  when it switches from interesting origin story to indulgent, barely  comprehensive action onslaught as super-villain and Krypton fugitive General  Zod (Michael Shannon) invades Earth with evil intent. While  Shannon delivers a strong, intense filled performance as the bad guy driven by  the âgreater goodâ, Snyderâs handling of the supermano-a-supermano smack-downs  (with small town and big city America feeling the brunt) exposes his biggest  weakness: an over indulgence in visual exuberance. Snyder  has proven he indeed knows how to create a visually strong picture, yet his  new-found embracement of multiple-cuts and close-ups during these fight  sequences (coupled with Hans Zimmerâs overpowering score and the post conversion  3D) is an overload of style, a schizophrenic shift from its thoughtful  beginnings that is jarring in tone and look. In the  end we are left with an unhinged superhero movie that sways from the pensive to  the overblown faster than a speeding locomotive, a legion of styles as if  Terrence Malick (Tree of Life), Michael Bay (Transformers) and Christopher  Nolan (Batman Begins) were all fighting over the controls of a vehicle  that could have gone the distance, but instead flipped on its head in a state  of chaotic decision making. In the end, it is Superman who needed saving from  Zack Snyder. ",NEUTRAL

As 
		Marvel cleans up the box office with cinematic adaptations of its 
		biggest properties, like Spider Man, Iron Man, Thor and the multiheroed 
		The Avengers, their biggest rival, DC Comics, has not been quite as 
		lucky with its page-to-screen projects.  It is only Batman that has made 
		any kind of mark as a film franchise, and not without ups and downs.  
		The other cinematic superstar in the DC stable, Superman, seemed to have 
		peaked in the 1970s with four films starring the late Christopher 
		Reeve.  Even then, it was only the first two movies that were worth any 
		mention.  There was a famously hyped attempt to resurrect the caped 
		wonder in 2006 with Superman Returns; notable mostly because of star 
		Brandon Rouths nearly letter-perfect imitation of Christopher Reeves 
		deceptively masterful performance.  Homages aside and despite a 
		brilliantly cast Kevin Spacey as arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, it was a 
		pretty bland affair.  I suppose it was thought enough time had passed 
		before trying another franchise reboot, which gives us 300 director Zack 
		Snyders muscular take on Superman with Man of Steel. 
		Galaxies away from our blue planet, another civilisation dithers while 
		Armageddon is nigh.  Krypton is a doomed world and leading scientist Jor-El 
		cannot make anyone believe or prepare for the inevitable. While Jor-El 
		pleads with the powers that be, there is civil unrest as the head of 
		Kryptons military is determined to see to his planets ultimate 
		survival and dominance by taking custody of a codex that stores the DNA 
		of every Kryptonian, guaranteeing the races continuance.  Thanks to Jor-El, 
		the codex will be out of reach, hidden in a ship sent far from the 
		imploding planet.  The other unauthorised export is the offspring of the 
		scientist and his wife, Lara; the only natural Krypton birth for 
		centuries.  The infant crashes deep in the heart of the American 
		Midwest, where he is adopted by the kindly Kents.  They love the boy so 
		much they treat his strange afflictions - the sensory overload of being 
		able to hear every conversation for miles and his extraordinary strength 
		- as simple growing pains.  Young Clark has the pure-hearted instincts 
		of any child and wants to help when he sees someone in trouble; an urge 
		his adoptive father tells him to stifle for fear of his son being 
		ostracized by others not quite as accepting of the strange and unusual. 
		 Its this adherence to Pa Kents rules that eventually leads the adult 
		Clark away from Smallville with a small token of his homeworld in his 
		pocket.  While Clark ambles north toward the road to self-discovery, 
		another set of visitors is on their way to earth.  Having been defeated 
		by Jor-El and punished by a spell in the Phantom Zone, General Zod frees 
		himself and his loyal crew and sets about to find the codex and a new 
		Krypton.  Zod unleashes their yellow sun-enhanced powers and superior 
		technology on mankind until the puny humans give up the son of Jor-El, 
		whose few public appearances have been suitably heroic, but not enough 
		to engender trust.  Clarks only ally is a reporter called Lois Lane, 
		whose rescue by the caped stranger persuades her to keep his true 
		identity a secret.  Teamed with the US military (Whove dubbed the 
		flying Kansan, Superman) and armed with the instructions of an 
		intelligent hologram of the late Jor-El, Clark chooses to become 
		entirely visible to the world in order to stop General Zod. Where 
		Superman Returns was low on bombast, Zack Snyders film is CGI explosion 
		overload to the point of nonsensicalness.  The amount of collapsing 
		skyscrapers is downright tedious and the superhuman Krypton warriors 
		throw each other around for what seems like hours.  What suffers with 
		all this purported popcorn chomping excitement is a cohesive plot.  
		After the destruction of Krypton, we meet Clark, fully grown at 
		thirty-three years old and his life story with the Kents is told in 
		flashback.  We dont know what Clark had been doing after high school, 
		but it seems like an awfully long time to wait after finding out not 
		only that youre adopted, but that you arrived not by stork, but by 
		UFO.  The romance between Lois Lane and Superman is a bust; theres not 
		a drop of chemistry to be found, despite some superhuman efforts: Yes, 
		hes adorable, but are we to believe this ambitious, high-stakes 
		frontline reporter would ditch the scoop of the millennium because she 
		was touched by Clarks sob story?  Without giving spoilers, that 
		particular tale of woe couldve easily been averted by the young man 
		with the super powers and it seems awfully device-y and plainly absurd 
		that he chooses that particular time to refrain from doing anything.  
		Hes also having father/son squabbles while appearing to be well into 
		his twenties.  Its just weird.  The flashback setup also adds more 
		weight on the momentum drag that makes Man of Steel feel even longer 
		than its two and a half hour running time.  The few moments of humour 
		sprinkled throughout the film, like Supermans ludicrous acquiescence to 
		the militarys handcuffs requirement and Diane Lanes saltiness as 
		Clarks adoptive mom are few and far between, making for a pretty 
		charmless affair.  I wish there had been more moments like Clarks 
		clumsy first flight, which had meaning, as well as thrills.  Even goofy 
		bits like the way-too-informed techno-spectre of Jor-El is silly but 
		forgivable because its one of the only moments of fun and cleverness 
		while the films emptiness, emotions in a vacuum and stunning lack of 
		magic is much less so. Henry 
		Cavill pulls off the right clean-cut, wide-eyed optimism and good 
		intentions associated with the Man of Steel; weighing the desire to just 
		be normal in the face of such literal alienness against his obvious 
		superiority to the human race.  His furry, muscular chest, bared often 
		for our viewing pleasure, is truly the best special effect in the film.  
		Cavill holds the heroic, comic book cover poses nicely and the cape is 
		practically another character, draping itself around the statuesque Kal-El.  
		At one point, before flying off to rescue Lois (again), he 
		dramatically stretches his arms out to his sides and plummets into 
		space, very Messiah-like.  Clark being thirty-three when all this kicks 
		off - the same age at which Jesus Christ was crucified - didnt escape 
		me, either.  I would hope the writers werent going for such a 
		ham-fisted comparison, because its an awkward analogy.  As a very 
		different Jor-El from versions past, Russell Crowe is great as Supes 
		dad.  He is the brilliant mind (NPI) weve always read about, but 
		can also beat the stuffing out of General Zod in hand-to-hand combat. 
		 This leads to the other big casting choice of Michael Shannon as 
		General Zod.  This was tough.  Ive adored Michael Shannon in everything 
		Ive seen him in from Revolutionary Road to Boardwalk Empire and more, 
		but this was not an easy sell; could anything make one forget the 
		indelible portrayal of the elegant, commanding Zod as played by Terence 
		Stamp in the first two Reeve films?  The answer is not really.  While 
		Shannon tamps down some of his pop-eyed crazy tendencies, he doesnt 
		make much of a mark on the character (For which I blame the shallow 
		script) and certainly not enough to replace Stamps cool authority (and 
		glitter rock costume).  While he carries off the aggressive 
		physicality well (When he wasnt a pixel), overall, the lunkish 
		and less intellectual Kryptonians are simply less interesting.  There 
		was something to their cerebral etherealness in the earlier versions 
		that gave viewers the impression that Krypton really was more advanced 
		than humankind and not simply by an accident of the solar system.  
		Making Zod and his horde more earthly turns them into any other 
		conquering race from outer space come to enslave/destroy/colonise the 
		earth, which is nothing new.  It also doesnt help that Shannon closely 
		resembles Jack O'Halloran as the huge, apish Non, one of Zods henchmen 
		in Superman I and II.  Theres also an ersatz version of Zods other 
		buddy, the fabulous Ursa, though Man of Steels tough cookie reminds us 
		more of an extra from Snyders girlie-action opera, Sucker Punch than 
		the haughty goth character perfectly played by Sarah Douglas. 
		Superman Returns and Man of Steel kind of balance each other out in 
		their imperfections: One was too dull and the other is too hollow and 
		noisy.  With its unceasing torrent of CGI explosions, destruction and 
		superhuman Kryptonian combat, Man of Steel is more bang for your summer 
		movie buck, but it would have been nice to have more intelligence to go 
		along with all that lovely muscle. ",NEUTRAL

"Jun 23, 2013"," Netflix has highly revolutionized how people watch TV. The company features thousands of movies and TV shows for adults and kids. When scrolling through thousands of options, you’ll notice that the traditional niche of education documentaries is also represented, meaning that past unheard stories can be told to the world. Today, some of the best documentaries are now on Netflix. The revolution is similar to what we see in education where students no longer have to do it all alone. Where a decade ago you would spend the better part of your time getting through coursework for school, these days you can get some help. Hiring a college application essay writing service allows you to catch up on some productions such as the ones we discuss here. This allows you to create some form of balance. Over the years, the company has gathered the best documentaries you can find on any streaming service. You’ll find classics and award-winning titles from different studios. NOVA is a documentary produced by WGBH Boston. The doc shows how American school kids aren’t performing well compared to their peers in other developed nations. The School of the Future episode looks at the gaps in the system in America compared to other countries. How can the government improve young people to compete in the modern era of rapid innovation, information, and globalization? How can learning institutions assist kids from all cultural backgrounds overcome future challenges? The documentary on Netflix looks at how class and racial disparities are causing challenges in education. NOVA explores how technology and learning innovations change how we educate and learn and create a new vision for future generations. Lego House is an iconic Netflix documentary inspired by demonstrating the journey of a group of people responsible for Lego House in Billund, Denmark, that oozes possibility and creativity. The show takes you through events. This was before the inaugural ceremony in which the sculpted beauty was shown to the masses. This film makes you want to get someone to write literature review online while you relax and take in some history. Legos have been a big part of most of our childhoods, so you may find the journey quite fulfilling to watch on Netflix. Although it’s short, the film is interesting and covers all the essential pieces. What will captivate you most is the company’s origins. Viewers will see how the creative team divided the building into four parts to symbolize four intersections of learning and play: cognitive, creative, emotional skills, and culture. Brain Games is a docuseries by National Geographic. The doc will make viewers think everything they knew about their brains is wrong. It comes as an interactive documentary series that will challenge you with mind-boggling scenes in every episode. You will learn the truth in ways you can perceive the globe. It fits both adults and kids, meaning you can enjoy it together as a family. Most viewers will be amazed by the power of the brain to focus. The reason you can’t see tricks by a magician. Do you want to revisit the violent chaos and resistance to the racial segregation of Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957? Teach Us All takes you to these periods. Most viewers claim the movie is not entirely a documentary. It’s also a campaign for social justice. Sixty years after, a group of students of color (Little Rock Nine) defied hatred and racism to learn in an all-white institution. Today, the district where Little Rock school is still facing upheaval. The documentary focuses more on the school system inequality. Viewers will learn that some history is hardly ever discussed. Waterschool tells the story of six young women from different parts of the world. They have one thing in common: they all live across significant rivers globally. The film will take you along as these women are educated about water its impact on Earth’s health and sustainability in small and massive ways. The young women take the things they’ve learned in Waterschool program and apply the vital lessons in their home areas along the Nile, Amazon, Danube, Mississippi, Yangtze, and Ganges rivers. Viewers will find themselves changing their perception of water conservation. This is one of the best documentaries for environment lovers. How huge is the universe? How do you define memories? Brainchild is one of the top education documentaries that answer such questions. The documentary’s presentation will bring science to life among kids aged eight years and above. It is easily one of the best science documentaries on Netflix. The show features a gameshow and quizzes that pits kids against parents to make fun and entertaining learning. Adults and kids will love this series that covers motivation, emotions, social media, and creativity. Most people will see that learning can be fun for the entire family with all the fun things to watch on Netflix. This makes yet another fun thing to watch on Netflix. The opening line to this documentary is one of the greatest. I’m David Attenborough, and I’m 93. Even at his old age, the legendary storyteller and historian are still some of the top people in the conservation world. Unlike other productions where David is behind the camera, he surprises viewers by appearing on the screen. The man is still humble despite his legendary status. His famous narration style is not new to lovers of Netflix Earth documentaries. David narrates his long career in this movie, showing how our planet has changed over 90 years. This doc is a witness statement where he cites footage of his past work. David Attenborough shows what he thinks could destroy humanity if we abuse nature. The documentary involves the dangerous climate changes and disappearance of the while ecosystems, leading to massive extinction events. However, he says that we can reverse these effects and lists the steps human beings can take. The documentary is well-thought and provides criticism and hope in equal measure. Whether you love ecology topics or not, this documentary is one of the best to watch on Netflix. The Story of WikiLeaks is narrated by the legendary documentarian Alex Gibney. For those who are not aware, WikiLeaks is a site that aims at making classified materials known to the world via anonymous sources. At the center of Alex’s expose is the cheerful and great Julian Assange, editor-in-chief and founder of the website. There is also Bradly Manning, who made the site famous when he allegedly leaked thousands of classified military documents. The movie examines secrecy and privacy in the online age and questions whether those who reveal these details are villains or heroes. Unable to get access to Manning or Assange, Alex interviews colleagues, and friends of the two. He also reaches out to top government insiders for parses and analysis of available footage. The documentary uses a voiceover to explain how the internet works and the political context of how events occur. The film is thrilling. However, the narrator is at a disadvantage because he cannot finish the story. Most people will still find it provocative and fascinating, and it is one of the good documentaries on Netflix. Many years ago, in a universe far away from earth, something huge collapsed in, dragging things that surround it with it. Because of this, it created a vast entity known as a black hole. These are scary zones where particles and matter go to die. They’ve been a topic of massive speculation in the space and scientific world. Directed by Peter Galison, the film walks you through the ins and outs of these structures. The doc has done a perfect job showing us how the first photograph of a black hole was captured. The black hole documentary Netflix takes you to the height of human discovery. It follows two scientific collaborations. Those looking for science documentaries on Netflix will love it. If you’re looking for Netflix history documentaries, you need to check out Edge of Democracy. It is a political documentary directed by Petra Costa. You may also want to hire a buy assignment online for your assignment so you can immerse yourself fully into the storyline. The 35-year-old narrator uses a breathless pace during her narration, making this film a perfect fit to watch on Netflix. She can compare her family’s political roots with those of her home nation. The film is most compelling for people who don’t know much about Brazilian politics. The documentary’s Oscar nomination shows how exceptional it is. Although it’s not explicit, there is a clear view that Brazil deserves the doom in politics. Petra allows her sadness to spread through the entire film. At some point, she’s telling viewers how her grandfather’s construction company flourished during the dictatorship era. However, at this time, her father and mother put their lives on the line to fight this dictatorship. There is a moral conflict in between, but Costa healthily handles everything. The documentary demonstrates how corruption caused the Worker’s Party led by one Lula, to collapse from the inside. Its deep storyline makes it one of the best documentaries on Netflix. Did we miss out on an excellent documentary to watch on Netflix? These are just a few of our favorite Netflix documentaries, but we know there might be others. We may have slipped some options to watch on Netflix such as award-winning American Factory, but we did well, right? Apart from watching a mindless movie, you can educate yourself with some educational documentaries on Netflix. They’ll help you stay sharp while relaxing. Most of them come as films, movies, and series. It all depends on your taste and preference.

"Jun 23, 2013"," 1. On the surface, it seems obvious why you'd attempt to reboot the Superman franchise using the Christopher Nolan-Batman model. Nolan's Dark Knight films are terrific, brooding and powerful, and, oh by the way, they grossed a combined $2.5 billion worldwide. But their trying to make a tortured-superhero Batman movie out of Superman was, frankly, a lousy idea. Batman is a hero, sure, but a twisted, human one; by the end of the second film, you're legitimately wondering, in name of his personal vengeance and obsessions, whether or not Batman is doing more harm than good. That is not who Superman is. Superman is brightness, goodness, a shining example for humanity to aspire to. Superman needs to have a light touch. Man of Steel does not have a light touch. Man of Steel is loud and bludgeoning and exactly the wrong kind of Superman movie to make. 2. The movie starts out promisingly enough, with a vast, lavish destruction-of-Krypton sequence that is impressively imagined and conceived. (It features better sci-fi battles than Star Trek Into Darkness, that's for sure.) And, somewhat surprisingly, it also gets the boy-in-Smallville bits right, with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane quite strong as Pa and Ma Kent, trying to figure out what to do with this god they have living in their house. It casts Lois Lane well too, with Amy Adams a stronger, smarter, more aggressive Lane than the wimpy damsel played by Kate Bosworth in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns. 3. Unfortunately, that's about the only way Man of Steel is better than Superman Returns. This movie doesn't understand Superman at all. There is no wonder here, no awe. In the world of director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Superman isn't a beacon for mankind; he's a fighting avatar who can fly and do cool shit with his eyes. There is a rather stunning lack of humor or even joy in Man of Steel, no winks at one of America's most iconic figures (a large chunk of the movie takes place in Canada), no Christopher Reeve-esque charm and bumble. Henry Cavill, who plays Superman, is certainly muscular and handsome enough for the part, but I'm not sure what the point of having someone just glower and flex. He's Superman. The point is that he doesn't need to look tough. Snyder directs Cavill to act like he's in 300. 4. The movie is so jam-packed and busy that it's essentially an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other. I'm trying to describe everything going on, and I haven't even had the chance to talk about General Zod yet. Played by the great Michael Shannon in a sadly what-am-I-doing-here-again? performance that will make no one forget Terence Stamp, General Zod is some sort of master-race genocidal lunatic who Shannon tries to make compelling but can't. He sort of pops in whenever the plot needs him to, leading up to an obligatory end-of-world fight scene with Supes that, basically, derails the film. 5. We need to probably finish up with that fight scene. It's impressively directed by Snyder, but, once again, completely misses the point of Superman. As the two fight, they completely level Metropolis, and rarely does Superman stop to save any of the citizens; he barely gives them a second thought, in fact. This is getting Superman completely wrong, using him as a fight avatar rather than a character; the collateral damage those two cause in the closing would be entirely unacceptable for the Superman we know and love. In a moving, damning essay by Mark Waid—author of seminal comic Superman: Birthright from which this film drew inspiration—he details an awful climactic moment that shows just how far away from Superman Snyder has drifted. (You'll know it the second you see it.) Even stranger, Snyder doesn't even seem to recognize the moment; he just has it happen, and then moves on, then Superman's kissing Lois Lane, and all good, sorry Metropolis got destroyed. It's indicative of the constant tonal issues Snyder has; the film just veers from one mood or genre to another, never once showing the directorial discipline of Nolan. Snyder is trying to make a science-fiction action film, but he doesn't realize, jeez, man, he has Superman at the middle of it. The genius of The Dark Knight is that it was basically a Batman movie that wasn't about Batman. That will not work for Superman, and it definitely won't work for a Superman origin story. We really shouldn't have been complaining so much about Superman Returns. It had a much better grasp of this character. Man of Steel is about the strongest man on earth, who can fly and shoot stuff with his eyes. But it ain't about Superman.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 20, 2013","I like this latest version of Superman. I was expecting a darker, more depressing movie with the sado-masochistic overtones, of say, the recent Batman movies. Thankfully, this superhero movie is more upbeat than I expected.",POSITIVE
"Jun 19, 2013"," Enter Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the respective director and co-writer of the hugely successful Dark Knight trilogy, which not only reanimated the Batman franchise after the twin debacles of Joel Schumacher’s campy Batman Forever (1995) and campier Batman & Robin (1997), but recalibrated the entire notion of what a superhero movie could look and feel like with its existential angst, emotional unease, and gritty tone. Man of Steel, which Nolan produced and Goyer wrote, has a similar look and feel, which marks it as a decidedly different kind of Superman film—certainly a far cry from Singer’s more upbeat brand of revisionism (the initially released stills from the two films are telling, as Superman Returns was heralded by a bright image of Superman lifting a car over his head in homage to the cover of Action Comics #1, while Man of Steel’s look was first revealed in a dark image of Superman emerging, scowling, from a huge metal door into which he has been hurled). The titular use of Superman’s metaphorical nickname rather than his superhero moniker—a move clearly borrowed from the Dark Knight trilogy—immediately confers on the film an air of literary gravitas and declares the filmmakers’ intent to stake out new territory. Yet, the film’s fundamental idea—to take Superman as a character seriously—is not new at all, as that is precisely what Donner did back in 1978 when he envisioned him as recognizably, vulnerably human despite his physical imperviousness, which is why casting then-unknown Christopher Reeve was such a stroke of genius. While it may not be a new idea, it is a good one, and Man of Steel is at its best when it remains character-focused. The director, Zack Snyder, is not exactly known for his subtlety or humanity; his best-known films are the graphic novel adaptations 300 (2007), a near-fascist celebration of violent masculine prowess, and Watchmen (2009), a critical deconstruction of superheroics, and his most recent film was Sucker-Punch (2012), an asinine, retrograde adolescent male fantasy that looks up skirts and down gun barrels in equal measure. A gifted visual stylist, Snyder has nevertheless remained largely mired in sophomoric slow-motion violence, body worship, and music-video bombast, which is why it is so surprising that Man of Steel’s best moments are also its quietest. Significant portions of the film are dedicated to flashbacks of Clark Kent’s often painful adolescence, which Snyder treats with a poignant grace that elevates the material into something very nearly poetic. We see this particularly in a scene in which young Clark finds himself overwhelmed by his super-abilities while at school—being able to see through everything and hear everything simultaneously creates a tsunami of sensory overload that drives him into a closet, isolating him from his peers who simply think he’s weird. It’s a beautiful and moving evocation of the pains of being different and the inability of others to understand (except, of course, a loving mother). Given all the film’s Christ references (Superman is 33 years old when he takes on his superhero identity, and at one point he is framed with a stained glass portrait of Jesus over his shoulder), the scene makes one think of The Last Temptation of Christ and how Nikos Kazantzakis imagined Jesus’s simultaneous humanity and divinity as a source of unrelenting torment. The beauty of the flashback sequences is enough to make one wish that the entire film had focused on Clark’s childhood, but unfortunately that is not the case. Instead, Man of Steel is bookended with obnoxious visual overload, beginning with the opening sequences on the distant planet Krypton that play like a mash-up of design outtakes from The Lord of the Rings and the Star Wars prequels. A far cry from the austere, modernist aesthetic that production designer John Barry gave to Krypton in Donner’s film, the Krypton in Man of Steel is a bronzed fantasy world of laser guns, enormous ships, and flying dinosaur-creatures. It is here that we are introduced to Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), who send their infant child Kal-El (He-Who-Will-Become-Superman) Earth-bound just before the planet is destroyed. In previous incarnations of the story, Krypton was destroyed because a shift in its orbit brought it too close to the red sun around which it revolves, but here it collapses because the Kryptonians, having otherwise exhausted their natural resources, have begun plundering the planet’s very core for energy, a more relevant idea for today’s environmentally conscious times. In addition to the planet’s impending doom, the people of Krypton are also dealing with an attempted coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon), a militaristic hawk who takes it upon himself to save the planet by ensuring the survival of only those he deems genetically superior (he and the Spartans of 300 would have gotten along fabulously, even though he’s the villain here and they were the ostensible heroes of that movie). Once on Earth, Kal-El is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), a kindly Kansas couple who love him dearly, but also instill in him the hard lesson that humanity might not respond very well to his abilities (people always fear what they don’t understand). Jonathan is particularly fearful of what might happen to Clark if his powers were to be discovered, and his insistence that his adopted son hide what he can do reaches a powerful climax when Clark has the opportunity to save him, but doesn’t, lest he reveal his true nature. Yet, Clark can’t keep his abilities entirely under wraps, and as a young man (played with a mix of physical authority and emotional pathos by chiseled British actor Henry Cavill) he leads a rootless, wandering existence, moving from place to place until a situation arises that demands a superhuman response, thus forcing him to move on. It is during these wanderings that he first comes across Lois Lane (Amy Adams), an intrepid reporter for The Daily Planet who becomes his first true ally and confidant, an interesting twist on the long-standing narrative that has her simultaneously in love with Superman and blithely dismissive of his human alter ego. The action in the story derives from the arrival of General Zod and his cohort of surviving Kryptonian dissenters, who want Clark because he holds the key to recreating their beloved home. Zod’s plan involves terraforming Earth and turning it into a new Krypton, which necessarily entails the destruction of everything and everyone on the planet. Thus, Superman is faced with the dilemma of embracing his adopted humanity or reuniting with the remnants of his true race, a moral predicament that unfortunately carries very little weight because, by this point in the film, the main focus is on destruction, destruction, and more destruction. Superman’s battles with Zod and his minions (including Antje Traue’s menacing Faora-Ul) first decimate most of downtown Smallville before shifting to the towering skyscrapers of Metropolis, many of which come tumbling down after Zod turns on his massive terraforming machine. Images of glass skyscrapers collapsing, massive clouds of concrete dust billowing through the city streets, and ash-streaked citizens running for their lives invariably invokes the horrors of 9/11, but unlike, for example, Steven Spielberg’s masterful War of the Worlds (2005), there’s no subtext or sense of gravity. It’s just destruction for destruction’s sake, a meaningless demolition derby of epic proportions. While expertly rendered by the film’s army of special effects artists, the violence feels simultaneously bloated and empty, yet another exercise in wide-scale cinematic decimation without any sense of humanity or the weight of its loss. Had the film been a Roland Emmerich-style exercise in self-consciously gratuitous destruction, we might be able to turn a blind eye and engage the spectacle, but the filmmakers’ insistence that we take this all seriously demands something more, something they are unwilling to engage. The moral issue is certainly perplexing, as all those falling buildings are likely killing thousands of people, none of whom are given even a second thought, but there is also the issue of artistic banality: So many modern action films end in this manner, from Michael Bay’s deadening Transformers movies to Joss Whedon’s The Avengers (2012), that the impact of entire city blocks being turned into rubble is virtually nonexistent. The action bludgeons and eventually deadens our senses both physically and morally, which is why, when the film does turn its attention to saving lives as Superman fights to keep Zod’s laser vision from skewering a cowering group of civilians, it feels tacked-on and phony, a last-minute bit of moralizing to help us forget the invisible thousands who were already bloodlessly sacrificed at the altar of PG-13 destruction porn. The film’s most absurd moment, the one that truly encapsulates the meaninglessness of its violence, arrives when Lois exclaims to Superman “You saved us!” as they both stand in an apocalyptic wasteland at the center of Metropolis. Surrounded by death, her cliché exclamation, like so much of the film’s overextended action, rings painfully, thunderously hollow.

"Jun 19, 2013"," Believe me, I am as surprised as anyone that I didn’t hate Man of Steel. I have never found the character of Superman interesting. The last Zack Snyder movie I actually liked was his 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. And as much as I could do without anymore comic book movies in general, I am particularly over the Christopher Nolanized brand of heavy-handed phony seriousness. Man of Steel contains all these things in one mind-numbingly long package, but for the first 90 minutes I found much to admire. For that matter, there are good things to be found in the nonstop, soul-killing action orgy of the climactic 45 minutes, but you have to dig for them. In fact, I’m convinced there’s probably a pretty darn good 105-minute movie wrapped inside this unwieldy 143-minute one — not that we’ll ever see it. As expected, Snyder seems to be somewhat reined in on this film. The box office disaster Sucker Punch (2011) guaranteed that, but it’s still surprising how much of Snyder’s pop-culture sensibility has remained intact. More surprising: this makes up much of what is best about Man of Steel. The scenes on Krypton are remarkable in that so much of the look seems to be drawn from 1930s sci-fi pulp magazine covers. That may not be original, but it gives the film a distinctive look that is not without appeal. All right, so Snyder overplays some of it, and I freely admit to bursting out laughing at Jor-El’s (Russell Crowe) death scene — that straight, stiff fall to the ground is priceless. I do not suspect that was the intent. But all in all, the opening beats the pants off the one in 1978’s Superman. (It has become unfashionable to speak ill of that version, but at the time of its release, I recall one wag of a critic saying that the destruction of Krypton looked like a windstorm in a Styrofoam cup factory.) Overall, the whole first part of the film works. I like the flashback structure, which keeps things moving while delivering the requisite background as to how Superman (only refered to as such late in the film) became Superman. Oh, yes, I had issues with Snyder channeling his inner-Terrence Malick for the Kansas scenes. (And why would a pre-Superman Clark don a towel for a cape while playing, not to mention why that would seem to trouble Kevin Costner’s Pa Kent? Maybe he thought it was a sissy affectation.) The less said about the film’s overemphatic Christ imagery the better, though I got a good chuckle over our hero having his big moment of doubt in front of a stained glass window depicting Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. (Again, I suspect amusement was not the intent.) I am even willing to overlook the unfortunate choice of calling the film’s MacGuffin “the codex” — when spoken it sometimes sounds like General Zod (Michael Shannon) is in search of a sanitary napkin. Then there’s that last 45 minutes. Once Superman and Zod have their Thor-like showdown in Smallville, the movie goes into full Michael Bay mode. It’s not just that 45 minutes of non-stop action is overkill—not to mention boring—it’s that this 45 minutes of action is largely just the same action over and over and over. There’s no building excitement. It’s all on one massive level that doesn’t build to some incredible climax. It just goes on and on and then stops when it’s worn itself and the audience out. And then everybody’s happy — despite what must amount to thousands of deaths and billions in property damage. It never occurs to anyone that none of this would have happened if Superman hadn’t been here. Maybe the sequel will deal with the realization that Superman is on par with Carl Denham bringing King Kong to town. The bottom line is that Man of Steel is a partly good and partly dumb, personality-free, property-damage blockbuster. Henry Cavill makes as good a Superman as the film gives him the chance to be. And I really liked Amy Adams’ Lois Lane. In fact, the cast was fine overall — and considering some of the unwieldy tosh they had to say, that’s remarkable. Your enjoyment may well depend on how attached you are to the Christopher Reeve pictures. Nearly all of the negative reviews the film has garnered are from reviewers who are cheesed that this isn’t the campy fun of those movies. That I found them altogether too campy to be much fun may be why this one doesn’t bother me. In any case, I sort of liked it.

Thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion. Goodness, I’m not sure if One Ken Hanke is able to contend with two entire bears — especially ones who trot out Mr. Agnew’s bewhiskered canard about the “liberal media.” I will, however, give it a shot. First of all, while I am not religious in any traditional sense, I am more fascinated by religion than offended by it. (The use of religion as a battering ram and a justification is another matter.) I also am actually drawn to religious allegory and Christ symbolism — in everything from Bride of Frankenstein to Strange Cargo to Meet John Doe to Tommy. But this? This doesn’t offend me — though I question the implications of “Jor-El so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.” On the contrary, it is just so heavy-handed and bereft of genuine emotional content that it amuses me. Now, how any of this has anything to do with being blinded by freewill — ironically or otherwise — I’m not too sure.  While the concept of a comparison between God/Christ and Jor-El/Superman is intriguing (especially considering that Supe’s creator was Jewish and based the character on the Hebrew myth of the Golem), I was more intrigued by the evolution of politics in the franchise. In “Superman Returns”, there was a deliberate omission of “…and the American Way” from Perry White’s reference to the hero’s original television manifesto, implying that “Truth, Justice..” no longer fits into any concept of American nationalism. In contrast, in this film American military personnel are portrayed with such selflessness, integrity and patriotism, that when an American general questions Superman’s ability to always act within the nation’s best interests, Supe responds “I was raised in Kansas…you can’t get more American than that.” It would seem that American nationalism is back in style, albeit in a muted form. The internationalists will no doubt be marching on Hollywood very soon in protest.  You raise an interesting point, though I don’t think the phrase finds a home in this film at all, and there are some mixed signals in the way that Superman insists on being taken at his word. Then again, what’s the option? What can they do to him? The catch-phrase is not, to my knowledge, part of the original Superman concept and only became canon by its’ inclusion in the 50s TV show (which was produced during the fiercely nationalistic McCarthy era) and is found nowhere in the movie franchise except sarcastically in “..Returns”, which is why I mentioned it.  Patriotism does find its’ way into “Superman 2” (which was actually the second half of a two-fer with the first film so it applies to both) when Supe restores the American flag to the White House, and in the awful “Quest for Peace” he restored the fallen flag on the moon, so Americanism has always run a consistent thread through the movies without the “American Way” catchphrase…UNTIL cynicism over the middle eastern wars and economic conditions resulted in the sarcasm of ..Returns”.  I see the overall portrayal of Americanism in “Man of Steel” to show a cautious return to the character being a distinctly American figure who, while defending the entire Earth, maintains the American values he was raised with and remains true to the “colors” that he has worn since his inception. As for the “mixed signals”, he is talking to people who once treated him as the enemy, and are still suspicious of him. The predator drone was a subtle political dig at the imperfection of the American values that he fights for and a reinder that he so far holds enough moral high ground to demand privacy. To be factual (and more than a little geeky, not that there’s anything wrong with that), the “Truth, Justice and the American Way” quote came from the 1940’s radio show.  (Along with the first mention of Krytonite and the first Superman/Batman teamup.) The white was toned down, like the patriotism that he once represented. Modern versions of Wonder Woman, who fought in WW2, no longer have stars on her butt either. It is no longer PC to be obviously Patriotic American, heroes must be internationalistic. The thing is I don’t think there’s ever been a Superman with white in his costume. Then again, the US isn’t the only country with a red, white, and blue flag. Remember that was one million dollars worth of robed Marlon Brando, too — an outrageous sum at the time for what amounted to little more than a cameo. The idea that superheroes are the modern answers to messiahs and demigods is an old one in the comic book community, a way to attribute broader significance to stories that originated as disposable entertainment for children, but honestly, although I’ve enjoyed any number of works that invoke that kind of imagery, I find the equation of corporate mascots with religious figures, and of brand loyalty with faith, a little insulting.  I mean, granted, a lot about our religious and nationalistic culture smacks of brand loyalty. It’s an inherent risk of large-scale organization that we will become more loyal to the institution than to the values it’s supposed to represent. And if people find spiritual significance in superheroes, it’s not my place to invalidate that. Goodness, I find deep significance in a lot of works of fiction that are, by any serious standard, even sillier and hollower than Superman.  But speaking only for myself, I would hope that our culture could produce modern gods more charismatic than a bunch of humorless meatheads in long underwear.  But speaking only for myself, I would hope that our culture could produce modern gods more charismatic than a bunch of humorless meatheads in long underwear. I finaly got around to seeing this; while it was better than the gawd-awful ‘Superman Returns’, I would have no interest in seeing it again. I’m not planning on watching it again. Well, maybe if they send out a year end screener — and screwy as that may sound for awards consideration, it’s far from the screwiest I’ve received.",POSITIVE

"Jun 19, 2013"," Much in the way Bryan Singer practiced with “Superman Returns,” director Zack Snyder displays amazing restraint and subtlety with his version of Superman. Which is surprising considering Zack Snyder is hardly ever about subtlety. This is the man behind the loud and sophomoric “Sucker Punch” and “Dawn of the Dead” after all. But with “Watchmen,” Snyder proved he could disassemble the superhero mythology and completely lands his masterpiece with his iteration of Superman. “Man of Steel” garners a ton of heart and soul, with a tale of Clark Kent’s journey for a sense of purpose and belonging in a home world that’s not his own. Director Snyder provides us with a cliff notes glimpse of Krypton and then explores how Clark Kent was built to as a being with two sets of parents, both of whom embodied nobility and morality. Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer are enormous as the birth parents of Clark Kent, who sacrificed everything to ensure their son’s safety. Snyder jumps immediately in to Clark as a grown man who spends his time taking odd jobs and looking for a calling that could grant him an ideal purpose for helping people. After revealing himself during a fishing expedition in order to save a group of oil rig workers caught in a fire, Clark travels to various towns and always finds himself playing the hero for someone in need. Snyder and writer David Goyer jump back and forth between Clark’s life, exploring how he became the man he is, and why he’s spent many years on the road looking for some sense of purpose. The moments with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark’s adopted mother and father are compelling, with Costner providing a very heartfelt portrayal as a man struggling to keep his son safe, while teaching him the meaning of right and wrong. Costner is wonderful in conveying a man who loves his adopted son dearly, but is incapable of comprehending Clark’s growing abilities that could prove to hurt someone if triggered. Snyder also delves in to the moral conflicts in concealing Clark’s powers, especially when Clark pretty much reveals himself in order to save a school bus filled with classmates. This causes an argument between Clark and his dad, to where Clark ponders if keeping his powers a secret is worth human lives. “Man of Steel” is a reboot and a prequel, where we meet Clark at a crossroads who is given a purpose, finally, when he learns about his past thanks to his discovery of his Fortress of Solitude. Through this ordeal, he realizes he can implement his burdensome abilities to help mankind. Especially when the evil despot General Zod begins invading Earth, intent on seizing Clark and acquiring the Codex, a genetic program that could restart the Kryptonian race, once and for all. Sacrificing himself, Clark confronts Zod and his soldiers, and battles to save the world. Snyder and Goyer change the mythology of Superman to certain degrees, which allow for a different glimpse at the hero, and offering more windows for more movies down the road. The finer additions of Laurence Fishburne as Perry White is a radical but welcome change of pace, while Amy Adams is fantastic as Lois Lane, the wide eyed and bold reporter who takes it upon herself to help save the world. Michael Shannon is a wonderful contrast to the heroes in the film providing a menacing and creepy performance as Zod whose own intentions are noble only to him and his Kryptonian allies that want to create a basic holocaust on Earth to rebuild their own home world. Henry Cavill is enormous as Superman, offering a homegrown charm, and pure charismatic performance that make him the perfect successor to Christopher Reeve. Snyder gives fans and general audiences a chance to revel in everything Superman is capable of, as writer Goyer cultivates the man and the hero, while leading in to the complete birth of Superman who is forced in to his first life changing battle for mankind. “Man of Steel” left me wanting so much more and is an incredible beginning to what I hope is a trilogy.",POSITIVE

"Jun 18, 2013"," It has been seven and one half decades since Superman made his debut in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. Since then, we have seen many revisions, especially in his big screen carnations, of this most popular and resilient of super heroes. The latest reimagining of this iconic figure comes to life, again, with the “Man of Steel.” With Krypton on the verge of implosion, General Zod (Michael Shannon, ""Take Shelter,"" ""The Iceman"") attempts an overthrow of the ruling committee whose energy mining has devastated the planet's core. Scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has another plan, he and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer, ""Munich"") having just given the first natural birth in centuries, and although he dies at Zod's hands, he succeeds in sending his son Kal-El and the codex which will ensure the survival of their species to Earth where the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), Kansas farmers, will raise the boy, keeping his secret as a ""Man of Steel."" With a story credit going to producer Christopher Nolan and his Batman trilogy's screenwriter David S. Goyer on board, it's clear that this Superman reboot is aiming for the dark side. But director Zack Snyder (""300,"" ""Sucker Punch"") gets mired down in origin story-itis, dwelling on the science fiction aspects that have less to do with the Superman than his planet's story. It's telling that the film's most emotional and heroic scene belongs to Kevin Costner. We touch base with Clark Kent as a young boy (Cooper Timberline, later Dylan Sprayberry, both well matched to Cavill) trying to come to grips with the over stimulation caused by Earth's atmosphere in school, his odd behavior marking him an outcast. When his school bus plunges over a bridge, young Clark (Henry Cavill, ""Red Riding Hood,"" ""Immortals"") cannot resist the urge to save everyone and witnesses draw unwanted attention. The adult Clark drifts from job to job trying to maintain his human facade, but when a large object is discovered underground, encased in 20,000 year old ice, he's spied by reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). His actions on board the Kryptonian ship also attract the notice of Zod, who, along with his followers, come to Earth demanding he be turned over. And so, at its core, ""Man of Steel"" is about the melding of Kal-El and Clark Kent, a man granted super human powers on his adopted home struggling to find balance. Look and you'll find Christ allegories. Snyder, however, seems more interested in rampant destruction - by the time the film's coda comes around you'll be left wondering just how The Daily Planet building was still standing. Smallville's center becomes a battlefield where planes and trains are used in hand to hand combat. The film's look is a mishmash, Snyder's penchant for desaturation evident and annoying. Director of photography Amir Mokri (""Fast & Furious,"" ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"") certainly makes Cavill look good, but there's so much artificiality flying around the screen, it's distracting, glowing blue lights on ships calling more attention to themselves than highlighting the craft as intended. There is one great effect where Krypton's history is animated behind the actors like a great evolving silvered Diego Rivera mural, but it also appears metal pin art was big on the planet, their communication stations supplied by Brookstone. Be forewarned that the film was not shot in 3D, but converted, an unnecessary addition. One character comments that Superman is hot, and Cavill certainly looks the part. He gives the role a conflicted dignity. Shannon is a ruthless Zod, but Crowe, whose 'spirit' keeps popping up, is an uninteresting foe, perhaps confusing Krypton for Vulcan. Costner is the film's moral compass and, supported by the maternal Lane, the film's greatest asset. Also notable is Christopher Meloni (""42"") as Colonel Hardy, the man who decides Superman is not an enemy. Harry Lennix (""Titus"") is on hand for an Obama drone jab. ""Man of Steel"" booms with portent but is weak in character development. It's just good enough to warrant the inevitable, hopefully better followup. A young woman (Andrea Riseborough) walks down a deserted country road at night and, from a passing van, is seen by the leader of an evil cult. Soon, they abduct the woman, with the help of a demonic motorcycle gang, with not very nice intent. This sets her battered boyfriend, Red (Nicolas Cage), on a path of vengeance in his search for “Mandy.” Sophomore writer-director Panos Cosmatos creates a funky revenge vehicle for Nicolas Cage to drive around in with his story of the brutal cult, led by the charismatic Jeremiah (Linus Roache), who kidnaps Mandy, brutalizing Red in the process. Then, comes his revenge. I have always had an affectionate spot for Nicolas Cage. He has been brilliant and awarded for it (“Leaving Las Vegas (1995)” earned him an Oscar) but also did a lot of for-the-money projects to pay his bills. Still, I have always enjoyed watching him even when not so much the movie. “Mandy” is a flick for horror fans and I am not really a horror fan. But, it is fun to watch Nic Cage chew scenery in his blood-covered persona as he does battle, wielding his hand-forged axe and crossbow, with the murderous forces of evil. But, that is about all that “Mandy” held in store for me.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 17, 2013"," Like cities and civilisations, superheroes need their foundation myths. Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer provided a new one for Bruce Wayne's alter ego in Batman Begins (infinitely more elaborate than the tale Bob Kane came up with in his 1939 comic). Now they've done the same for Clark Kent and Superman, whose arrival from the doomed planet Krypton was recorded in a mere handful of comic strip panels in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. But Nolan and Goyer, credited as producer and screenwriter on Man of Steel, have entrusted the direction of their star child to a much cruder film-maker, Zack Snyder. The result is noisy, violent, overlong and laboured. We're given a lengthy history of Krypton, an over-reaching galaxy that brought about its own destruction, of the conflict there between the authoritarian racist General Zod (Michael Shannon) and Superman's father (Russell Crowe, who has rather more to do here than Marlon Brando did in the 1978 Superman), and of the dispatch to Earth of the magnificently endowed, messianic baby to be known as Clark Kent (Henry Cavill). The story is as dense and complicated as the epic of Gilgamesh. But instead of being kept secret, the identity of its protagonist becomes known early on to General Zod and his evil space wanderers, the US military, the midwestern foster father whose name Clark bears, and even to investigative journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams). The ""S"" on his chest now stands for ""hope"", and we (or should I say you?) will have to wait for the sequel to this overextended prologue to hear him called Superman. The film is a load of repetitive tosh, featuring in every sequence of its 143 minutes more special effects than God used when he created the world, ending with a list of credits longer than many a telephone directory. And it's all so deafeningly, humourlessly solemn. The Saturday edition of the Guardian has a Q&A page where celebrities are asked: what superpower would you like to possess? They usually reply ""invisibility"" or ""flight"". After a few more pretentious pictures like this they'll be saying ""vulnerability"", ""honest doubt"" and ""a puzzled liberal conscience"".",NEGATIVE
"Jun 17, 2013"," Director Zack Snyder re-imagines DC Comics’ Superman with producer Christopher Nolan with an emphasis on his tortured soul, but a script that can’t stay consistent. As commanding as he is as Jor-El from Krypton, there’s too much of Russell Crowe flying around on a giant lizard and barking platitudes before the movie kicks into gear. And as effective as he is, Kevin Costner’s Pa Kent spends his entire portion of the movie giving advice that Clark Kent (a brooding Henry Cavill) will eventually ignore in one of the many super-sized fight scenes during the film’s last hour. Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer obviously took the criticism that Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns received about not having enough action to heart, because almost every plot point in Man of Steel happens during an action scene. That, a complete lack of humor, and Hans Zimmer’s overbearing score, make Man of Steel a bludgeoning experience. As long as they perform well at the box office, superhero movies are here to stay. But the stories they tell of these noble, misunderstood heroes are so strikingly similar that they can be draining. It’s a cumulative effect. Iron Man 3 played with the template enough, had terrific chemistry, and a good amount of distracting humor. Man of Steel, however, is like The Dark Knight trilogy drained of all its moral complexity and vibrant storytelling. What’s left is an oppressive movie filled with a blaring seriousness, inconsistent production design, mundane conflict, heavy exposition and a huge amount of super-destructive action that leads to nothing. Your review was fair but I thought that the story was really well done. Everybody knows Supes. It’s told in a more realistic way. We don’t ever really know Clark as a kid, or the struggles that he went through in life. He was bullied, misunderstood, and scared. That’s very real. That’s emotional. He learned at an early age to sacrifice part of himself to become a better being. I loved the story line. I like the flashbacks and no linear story. I would give this movie a solid 7.5 out of ten. It wasn’t phenomenal but it was the most realistic and emotional Superman yet. But, the one part that still bugs is “How in the name of F¢∞K do they not know that he’s superman?” Kirk- Actually, I agree with you on the flashback structure. That was the best storytelling strategy in the film. But was the bullying enough to keep him from protecting human beings during the insane devastation of the last battle? I don’t know, man. I don’t think the series can continue on with the Supes that we are familiar with, especially after the 9/11-like toll it took on Metropolis. But you know they’re going to go right on trying to do that. This is pretty interesting—> Scientist and “disaster expert” Charles Watson and his Watson Technical Consulting outfit estimates that  129,000 people would be confirmed killed, nearly a million would be injured, and over a quarter of a million would still be missing. The impact “seemed to be similar to an air burst from a 20kt nuclear explosion in terms of shock effects, but without the radiation or thermal effects.” I would say that this estimate should come with a caveat that says “This estimate based on everyone being willing to still go to work with an alien invasion and a world-threatening event taking place.” I completely agree.  There was limitless potential in the flashback stories, of Clark and how he had to battle his potential versus what was expected of him.  The flashbacks and his travels to find his origin were the most endearing part of the movie. Regrettably, I had a very hard time believing that the insane destruction leveled both in Smallville and in Metropolis would have been something the Superman we know and love would have let happen.  The catastrophic toll alone on his hometown and even more, on Metropolis was what I would expect in a some run of the mill Michael Bay movie. The fact that Superman was responsible for half of the destruction in the movie that would have had a very human toll made me lose all sympathy for the character and then to try and circle back with the end between him and Zod seemed ridiculous given the human costs the two of them had already placed on the city.  Couple that with the idiotic “He saved us” statement at the end, it was as if the script was written before the special effects team stepped in as in the end. Lots of potential with the casting but you can smell that executives got their hands on the script in the last 3/4 of the movie.  I’m not expecting much but I enjoyed Superman Returns far more than this one as at least the story was consistent.  This one felt like someone in Hollywood wanted to remake Independence Day and Transformers but with Superman as the lead. Brandon – This—> “it was as if the script was written before the special effects team stepped in as in the end” — is a VERY incisive comment. I think you may have hit it on the head. The script can call for an all-out war in Metropolis between Zod and Superman. but all the actual visual interpretation of that war may have been left up to someone besides Goyer. It’s very possible that Snyder’s fetish for violence (well on display in Watchmen, 300, and Sucker Punch) overrode the script as the effects shots were being designed…. This movie took a big page from the Smallville television series play book. A  brooding Clark Kent with an overprotective Jonathan Kent who implies that letting others die was preferable to exposing his secret. In the end Clark, of course, saves those in danger even if it costs  him his privacy in the  long run.  The movie needed a mellowing point and some humor which could’ve been supplied with Lois Lane’s introduction and almost was, but the film was still clearly fearful of wiping the gloom off its face.  It made a ton at the box office for its opening weekend, but will it still be making a lot next weekend? We’ll see, but I just don’t think this movie has a strong recidivism factor except for those who want to see a city destroyed over and over again. Agreed, Josh. I think brooding is OK too. After all, it worked for Christian Bale and Andrew Garfield. But here I felt like Superman did very little in the way of displaying actual heroism. I’m right with you on your review, Eric.  This is not Superman, but some brooding shell of him.  I understand what they were trying, but somehow everyone in Hollywood seems to think that the darker the movie, the more substance it has.  There was no substance in this–it reminded me more of a colorless version of “Transformers” (which probably means it’ll be a great money-making success and sequels will be made).  Superman spent most of his time clenching his fist, clenching his jaw, or screaming towards the sky.  Every scene was there to show his misery or the misery of others.  But what was the worst of it (and as you pointed out in your response here) is the ridiculous damage done.  During the entire Zod invasion, all I could think was, just how many people did Superman kill?  Knocking Zod into buildings, into gas stations–sure, most of those deaths are on Zod and his super-troopers, but Superman gave no regard to anyone who might have been in a building or on the streets (I think he told someone to get inside once, like that would have done any good).  It was only the very last scene, for about five seconds, where he cried out because one family was in danger.  Out of thousands that got killed.  At least in “The Avengers,” the group had a plan and tried to contain the chaos.  This Superman isn’t Superman–it’s a fanboy’s AU fan fiction of him. I read somewhere that producer Christopher Nolan asked Goyer to remove the climactic “kill” scene, but that Snyder backed him up and he relented. Too bad. I also agree that darker does not equal more substance. If there’s nothing underneath it, it only creates more pretensiousness, which is kind of Snyder’s trademark. (See 300 and Sucker Punch). Matt – You’re right. They spend all those valuable flashbacks trying to establish a moral base for Supes and then its all thrown out the window in favor of action porn. Soulless. Interesting. Remember the scene where superman tells Lois the “S” stands for hope on his world? I’m glad that moment is in there at least, but the movie didn’t have much in the way of hope, did it? Saw the movie.  Don’t agree with reviewer.  I liked it.  Wouldn’t usually comment about triviality on a random website, but these visual and written reviews bugged me.  Heavy handed and reeked of agenda.  In my humble opinion, not helpful to moviegoers.  Unimpressed enough to waste five minutes of my life to express my displeasure. This dude is wrong, see this movie on the big screen.    Good luck going forward. Sorry Alan Smithee (very clever – why the anonymity?) that you thought I had an agenda, although I’m not sure what that would be. My job as a critics is to give my informed opinion description of the film as I see it — and through that, others can make their own decisions. The points I brought up are all valid for people going in expecting a Superman film. Just saw it and apart from all that’s been said here, I must say that I didn’t care what happened to this Superman, or to Lois or anyone. Boom-crash-bang till the end… just for extreme fanboys. Missed Donner. And Williams! The movie is an interpretation of the Jesus story.  Crowe says his offspring will be a god for the People of Earth to aspire too.  Messiah.  The issue of free will and choice is set forth in the beginning.  The gift Jor-El gives Kal-El is choice or free will.  God gave humans free will or choice as a gift to us.  Maybe the greatest gift of all besides life itself.  Then we have the Holy Trinity symbolised.  Crowe – Holy Spirit, Costner – Father, Cavill – Son.  But in this version, then Son sacrifices the Father for the good of man.  Tornado.  Crowe even shows up on Earth as a “ghost”.  When the boy sees Clarke miraculously save the bus, the Kents go to explain things in hopes the secret won’t be let out.  No need, bible beaters who attribute the event to god and Jesus.  Irony, and funny.  When Supermen has to decide to either save humans or kryptonians, he is troubled.  Wants to save us Earthlings, just doesn’t know if he can trust us.  He consults a priest.  Who tells him he has to have faith.  Just like all Christians have to have faith in god for redemption, god has to have faith in us for our redemption.
Clarke mentions he is 33.  The same age as Jesus when he died.  The burden of being a messiah must be super sad and lonely.  The burden of being common folk raising a messiah must be heavy.  Real heavy.  I got that.  Its Superman, its special.  Expected more from a Kansan.  Run of the mill.  I’m not looking for a thumbs up or down, I’m looking for some thought.  I could go off more, but you get the point.  Don’t own a bible or comic books either.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 16, 2013"," Mining the planet’s core for energy has made the distant alien world of Krypton unstable. For centuries, children have been grown (in a very Matrix-like way) and pre-programmed for their role in society, causing stagnation of innovation and inspiration. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) knows this; against tradition, his natural-born child can be whatever he chooses, and he intends to send him far away to start anew. General Zod (Michael Shannon) also knows of the planet’s impending doom but chooses a military action to hold Krypton’s ruling council responsible. Soon after Jor-El sends his son to Earth, Zod is captured and banished, yet both are the last acts of a doomed world. Years later on Earth, Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) struggles with having super powers but not knowing what to do with them. When an ancient Kryptonian scout ship buried beneath an ice flow is found by scientists, Clark discovers his true alien origins. What he doesn’t know is that an old foe has been alerted to his existence, and it’s not just revenge he’s coming for. Wow, is there a lot going on here! But first things first; this isn’t your father’s Superman, nor your grandfather’s or great grandfather’s. DC already tried to reboot what they thought audiences wanted – a Christopher Reeve clone – and it fell flat… for many, many reasons. Man of Steel is a reinvention and a fresh start for 2013, the story of a lost soul from a dead world struggling to be a good man with abilities he doesn’t understand. After his terrestrial father dies (Kevin Costner), Clark drifts from place to place (not unlike the old “Hulk” television series) to find himself; this is just one instance where the exemplary cast shines, from Diane Lane’s Martha Kent to Amy Adams’ Lois Lane. The modern world is a darker, post-911, NSA-is-watching-you kind of place; being told to serve as an example for an entire race is a bit of a burden on a farm boy from Kansas… or anyone, Kryptonian or not. Here and now is the time and place that producer Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer, and director Zack Snyder created their story in because modern audiences won’t accept an antiquated, four-color Zipatone world. So, on to the nitpickers. Half of the movie critics are savaging the film, an even divide both for and against. Those overwhelmingly against seem convinced that any new films must strive for a Reeve-esque innocence and grounded in light-hearted fun. Unfortunately, this reboot follows The Matrix films, The X-men franchise, two different Spider-Man trilogies, and the Marvel Phase I initiative that put The Avengers into the box office record books while revealing writer/director Joss Whedon’s existence to the rest of the world – insert random Darth Maul joke here. So, Reeves-worshippers aside, what’s the problem? The story is solid, the performances serve it, and the special effects can keep up with what makes Superman so super. If anything, some of the combat sequences stretch on, but there is very little screen time without something amazing to see. A word about faith: it’s here. Heck, in a scene set in a church, Clark even confesses his alien nature to a random priest, but is this Superman served up to be a Christ allegory? No more than Ridley Scott’s Prometheus. Still, the idea of being an ideal, of being a living example to aspire to in a world lacking in belief, to represent hope when all seems lost, that’s VERY Superman-like. Forget truth, justice, and the American way; this incarnation is for hope, trust, and helping out whenever and however you can. Also seldom seen in these films is an effective military – no, really! – doing everything they can and holding the line no matter the cost. Amidst all the CGI wizardry, the most powerful scenes are the intimate ones where motivations are revealed. What will you do? How far are you willing to go? Can you live with the consequences of your actions and decisions? The cast, especially Michael Shannon as Zod, put real emotion behind the destructive forces being unleashed. It’s dark, the darkest Superman you’ve ever seen on-screen – just look at the muted colors of his costume – but Cavill manages to keep the Big Blue Boy Scout earnestly in check even when things are as bad as they can get. Everyone loved Christopher Reeve’s Superman, but Superman Returns felt hollow trying to duplicate his portrayal and the innocence of those films while also reinventing them for a modern audience; it was a doomed idea from the start. Like it or not, purists, Man of Steel is the kind of theatrical reboot Superman has needed for a while. I think it’s crass of you to trivialize the criticisms this film has received as little more than nitpicks.  You can write and articulate your thoughts well enough, so I can only assume that you’re choosing to dismiss these criticisms simply because they don’t align with your view of the film. Yes, I enjoyed the film, and it was only very recently I was even convinced to bother seeing it. What specifically did you believe I trivialized? Are you talking about fans wanting a Reeves clone, a missing innocence, or the Christ allegory? Excellent post! I always enjoy a good movie review, though I didn’t really end up liking the movie, but the premises here were interesting. If you are interested, and I am not trying to spam you here (though I’m sure that exactly what spammers say 🙂 ) , then head on over to The Disorder here on WordPress (http://thedisorderpodcast.wordpress.com) and check out our take on the superman movie (or just Superman in general). The rest of the site is us trying to be funny and we would really appreciate feedback if you have the time! I try to go around and comment on blogs because I know how difficult getting comments can be! Anyway, I’m sure I’ve taken up a lot of your time but I enjoyed this and just wanted to let you know! Given the cost of a trip to the movies these days I suppose I should be glad that so many films are stretching out longer and longer.  On the other hand as seen with so many other commerical entertainments ‘LESS IS MORE’.  A tightly written movie or book will always be more effective than a longer one that is a mess. The action scenes lived up to the hype.  They were as good or better than any ever filmed in the genre.  Except they were so overdone and over-long that they just got tedious/boring.  Didn’t help that we just didn’t have much emotional connection to any of the characters outside of who they were supposed to be for those with a strong history with the property. Bottom line:  the opening on Krypton should have been half as long.  The never ending series of battles should have been half as long.  There were too many shortcuts by the writers and damn near deus ex machina solutions to problems. Snyder is only capable of visual wizardry and I don’t think Nolan was the right choice to shepard this project.  From the get go a ‘darker’ Superman misses the point of the character. Did you really think that Superman was darker? I thought he was ina dark place, but I never saw him as dark himself. That’s kind of what I meant by that; no matter how dark everything got, he was still positive. The real difference in this film is that we got to see Kal-El still wrestling with that choice, not hurting someone when he really wanted to. It’s different, yes, and I think meeting Zod may have done wonders to set him on his current path. i loved the movie. i do not understand why all the criticism. it is an excellent film with a bit more action than was required but still i loved it. I just hope this film sets up not only a DC Cinematic Universe, but an excellent portrayal of Lex Luthor for the fast-tracked sequel. With the story in this film, we have the potential for Luthor as he was reimagined for the comics: motivated by seething envy of Superman and the conviction that the Kryptonian is the true threat. The only complaints I have is that the flashbacks seemed awkwardly placed, nowhere near as adriot as in Batman Begins, and the effects and action can go overboard. All in all, about as good as Superman film as you can get after divorcing itself completely from the past efforts. At the bottom of the article, the writer suggests that the filmmakers don’t “get” Superman because he is given an impossible decision and forced to make an terrible choice: he has to kill. Cries of “Superman doesn’t kill!” have been erupting all over the Internet, but this is a re-invention of the character. What if this one event is what *sets* him on his new path, that he’ll never allow himself to be put in the position where killing is his only remaining option? It was practically the last thing he does and it devastated him; who knows how it will affect him going forward. Why is Superman never allowed to make this mistake? Kudos to the filmmakers for taking this chance, but the proof will be in what is done with it going forward. When I saw Man Of Steel, I was stunned by the stark contrast between my view of the movie and the critics. I felt like we were not watching the same movie. I turned to my boyfriend and asked them “What? Do they want Superman saving cats from trees and fighting Lex Luthor until the end of time?”
I feel like the fans of the old Superman are so biased that they can’t see the forest for the trees. I felt this was a great Superman reboot, and one that addressed moral dilemmas that older Superman movies refused to even think about. And THANK GOD FOR NO KRYPTONITE! With all the hints of Luthorcorp and Wayne Industries sprinkled through the film, more than a few familiarities will make there way into future films. Green Kryptonite never bothered me as much as every other color of the rainbow: “Look out, Superman! That thug has sparkly Fleckstone kryptonite! It’ll make your beard grow and ruin your manicure!” I’d offer you a job, but being the Grim Reaper pays dick; I only make two cents per corpse unless I find some loose change in their pockets. In my review, I suggested that the “neck snap heard ’round the world” (as stated in EW) was a character-shaping moment done intentionally to set the new Supes on his Big Blue Boy Scout path. The filmmakers have since confirmed exactly this. I felt like, if we could find a way of making it impossible for him — Kobayashi Maru, totally no way out — I felt like that could also make you go, “This is the why of him never killing again.” He’s basically obliterated his entire people and his culture, and he is responsible for it, and he’s just, like, “How could I ever kill again?”",POSITIVE

“The joyless pic never won my heart.” Zack Snyder (“300″/”Watchmen”) directs in a blah manner this overlong and humorless Superman. The joyless pic never won my heart. The new Superman is the Brit actor Henry Cavill, who looks good in a cape but is a bit too bland in the acting department. The “Superman” franchise is given another reboot by the authors David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, the same dynamic duo who gave us all that Batman angst in The Dark Knight. The writers fill this superhero tale with an expanded back story and whenever possible reach for far-out action scenes. It opens on the alien planet of Krypton, and since the planet is doomed, Kal-El’s  (Henry Cavill)scientist father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), parent of the only child born there in ages, decides to send him by rocket to live on Earth. There the infant’s adopted by the kindly Kansas farmer parents (Kevin Costner & Diane Lane) and named Clark Kent, and they hide from everybody that their son is an alien and possesses super powers. Meanwhile Krypton is destroyed and General Zod (Michael Shannon), vows to track down Kal-El and make him restore Krypton or he will destroy the Earth. That means the Daily Planet ace Pulitzer Prize-winninginvestigative reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), the alien’s love interest, will die along with the other humans.  When General Zod touches down on Earth in a giant spacecraft, it’s up to Kal-El, now aged 33, to show he cares more about the Earth than Krypton. At the half-way mark our superhero dons his cape costume for the first time and in the third act he battles against the baddie Zod and his minions trying to steal back the codex, which holds the key to dominating the universe, a gizmo dad gave his son to hang onto while on Earth. The climax battle scene works overtime with computer-generated special effects, and we’re reminded that if Superman loses the Earth is a goner and on the sensitive side we learn that even if Superman is an alien he still craves freedom on Earth–something he never would have had in fascist Krypton.",NEGATIVE

	Although Superman has been around since the 1930s in nearly every form of media known to humankind, including comic books, comic strips, cartoons, serials, a radio dramatic series, television shows and even a Broadway musical, Henry Cavill is just the 3rd man to don the cape and tights for a feature film. Some may argue that 1951's Superman and the Mole Men, starring George Reeves, counts, but at just 58 minutes and shot in a mere 12 days, it hardly seems fair to consider it a full length feature, and was actually more of a theatrically released pilot that lead to a television series. 
	It wasn't until 1978's Superman: The Movie, starring then unknown Christopher Reeve, that the Kryptonian finally got the full-on movie treatment. Reeve would reprise the lead role in sequels released in 1980, 1983 and 1987. Despite many attempts and a host of different writers, directors and actors supposedly attached, another Superman movie wouldn't appear until 2006's under-appreciated Superman Returns, starring Brandon Routh. Considered a disappointment, it would be the one time Routh took up the mantle and instead Warner Bros. would go back to the drawing board and this time do a complete reboot of the iconic character. The result is 2013's Man of Steel and while it may lack the heart of earlier films, it definitely doesn't skimp on spectacle. 
	Given the success of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, Warner Bros. looked to him to freshen up DC Comic's other major superhero. While Nolan didn't direct this film, he did produce and co-write it with his Dark Knight co-writer, David S. Goyer. Directing duties fell to Zack Snyder, most famous for directing 300 and Watchmen, another dark superhero film. Given their attachment, it's hardly surprising that this is a darker, grittier Superman than we normally see. 
	Gone are the primary colors, the underwear over the tights and there's nary a mention of Truth, Justice and the American way. This time around Clark Kent is a haunted figure. He knows that he's an alien and that he has great power, but he spends the first 33 years of his life hiding that power. His human father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner), urged him to keep his powers hidden lest mankind discover his secret and turn on him out of fear. Clark is tormented and treats his powers as a burden for most of his early life, seeming to derive no joy at all from them. He's a fairly grim character. 
	The film actually opens on the planet Krypton with Clark's birth, although he's named Kal-El on his homeworld. He's born at a bad time for Krypton as the core of the planet has become unstable and a revolution is being waged by General Zod (Michael Shannon). This opening scene is much more action packed than in any previous version as Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's birth father, is both a scientist and an action star. After several fights and chases, Jor-El and his wife Lara manage to launch their son into space and toward Earth before their planet consumes itself. 
	We then jump ahead 33 years to a bearded Clark Kent as a drifter, moving from job to job, trying to keep his powers a secret. His past, as a young Clark in Smallville, is shown in flashback throughout the story. This is actually a nice touch. By mixing in his past in this way, we get to the main plot quicker, while still getting the highlights of his childhood. 
	It is the return of General Zod that instigates the main plotline. He's looking for Clark because he knows that Jor-El put something in his ship that Zod wants for himself. This brings Clark out of hiding and makes for the first appearance of Superman in full costume. And it all leads up to a climactic battle that nearly decimates (quite literally) the city of Metropolis. 
	Everything about this movie looks good. It is spectacle of the highest order. Although it runs long, the action rarely slows down, and so it moves quickly. It's all about the eye candy and there's plenty of it. 
	What the movie lacks is a sense of fun and any kind of characterization. It's the exact opposite of Iron Man. Where Robert Downey Jr. is all personality, wit and charm as Tony Stark, Henry Cavill is serious and grim as Superman. It's such a serious movie that even the rare, mild, moments of levity almost seem out of place. This is also a movie where the stage description must have outnumbered the lines of dialogue by about 10 to 1. Cavill's limited dialogue can't have filled more than a few pages of the entire script. And given how much of this movie is CGI, you seriously have to wonder how much time he actually spent working on this film. 
	The cast is filled with recognizable faces, which is good, because given the lack of charactization it helps to have a known personality in the part. Laurence Fishburne plays Perry White, for instance, and we know, because of Fishburne's presence that he will be a wise authority figure with that great deep voice. Kevin Coster makes a great all-American father figure. Amy Adams starts strong as she investigates Clark's past, but for most of the second half of the film she's reduced to staring up into the sky as Superman flies into battle. 
	There's no question that this is a quality, big budget Summer blockbuster. It delivers the special effects laden goods and keeps you on the edge of your seat for a good part of it. However, it relies so heavily on those effects that it often loses sight of the characters. It's a highly enjoyable film without a doubt, but a little less noise and a little more humanity would have made it a better one. 
	I was even less enamored of this movie than Scott was. I'm tired of seeing the same plots and characters being recycled over and over ad nauseam. I get that superheroes are today's Greek and Roman Gods and that there will continue to be multiple versions made over the decades, but we just had a new Superman movie seven years ago. Superman Returns was an attempt to continue the Christopher Reeve franchise's storyline with Brandon Routh donning the iconic cape and tights. It was deemed a failure. I guess it is just a reality of modern Hollywood that we will see reboots of superhero movies every six or seven years. Man of Steel borrows the plots of not one but the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. 
	It borrows the origin back-story on Krypton that was first envisioned in 1978 including the introduction of the villainous General Zod. He eventually escapes from prison and comes looking for Kal-El for paybacks just like in Superman II. Even the casting seems inspired by the 1978 version. Russell Crowe is a natural for the Marlon Brando role of Jor-El and who else today could capture Glenn Ford's homespun folksiness better than Kevin Costner? Laurence Fishburne began his career as a child actor just like the original big screen Perry White did, Jackie Cooper. 
	I liked Henry Cavill. He not only looks the part (unlike Batman who hides behind a cowl and mask, Superman has to have classically chiseled features) with his brooding eyes and ridiculously diesel upper body, but he brings a bit of melancholy angst to the part that was missing before. Even without, as Scott pointed out, having much in the way of dialogue. Amy Adams makes a nice Lois Lane as well. Hell I cannot fault the cast at all. 
	The problem is in its over reliance on CGI and lack of any sort of nuanced character development. As these summer superhero blockbusters compete they keep one-upping each other in terms of being bigger, louder and more destructive. Judging by the amount of damage done in the climactic battle the civilian body count in Metropolis would number in the hundreds of thousands. Yet in direct opposition to the amount of mayhem shown the actual violence is kept at a sanitized cartoon level. We never see human deaths or blood and gore of any kind. 
	With the exception of the toned-down and tastefully modernized Superman costume (see photo) there is nothing remotely subtle about Man of Steel. If you like your movies big, loud and destructive but don't care much for plot or human interaction, then look no farther.  No other comic book superhero has such an intriguing, yet relatable, story as that of Superman. His beginning starts on a far off planet with technology well beyond our comprehension, yet he grew up in a modest home trying and usually failing to fit in with his peers. He is blessed with amazing abilities, yet is also horribly cursed by them. Is he a God or merely a loner desperately in search of human companionship?  The 1978 film touched on Superman as a Christ figure, but it was not until Superman Returns (2006) that it was pushed to the forefront, with Marlon Brando making such Biblical sounding speeches as, “They can be a great people, Kal-El, if they wish to be. They only lack the light to show them the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you... my only son.” Man of Steel tones that angle down a bit but it is still there with Jor-El telling Kal-el, “You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.”  Thankfully, Kal-El was found and raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent, two very loving, level headed people, who raised Kal-El as a very moral person. Imagine Kal-El being found and raised by Lex Luther. They taught him to control some of his powers, as well as his temper. As we see in the flashback scenes, that Scott mentioned, as a child Clark would have easily given up his abilities to have been normal.  Just as the Bible skims over Jesus’s early adulthood, so does the story of Clark Kent. We have always seen him as a teenager growing up in Smallville but then we skip to his career years later as a reporter in Metropolis. I believe a college degree of some sort is likely required for such a job, yet all this film shows is Clark learning from life experiences as he searches for his place in the universe.  The theme of Man of Steel is free will versus predetermination. Once Clark learns of his history and is given his suit, which is not a costume mind you, he has a decision to make. Does he become the God like man he has the ability to be and risk being ostracized by an entire planet or does he stay quietly hidden. Clark even seeks advice from a priest who suggests that, “Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith.” Up to this point, his entire sense of security has been based around his anonymity. Something he will have to give up to save the world.  General Zod threatens to destroy an entire world but he is likewise a sympathetic character. We learned that on Krypton, babies are born in an unconventional way in which their role in society is already determined for them. Zod was born a soldier charged with defending Krypton. His attack on the Kryptonian counsel as well as his pursuit of Kal-El to retrieve the codex is merely Zod doing what he was born to do. He knows nothing else. He does not have a free will.  The battles between Superman and Zod are big and destructive and, as Patrick wrote, very costly to the populations of both Smallville and, even more so, to Metropolis. They are also personal. One of my favorite moments is when Zod confronts Martha Kent, who tells the alien General to, “Go to Hell!” Just before Superman slams into Zod and begins pounding away on him, “YOU THINK YOU CAN THREATEN MY MOTHER!”  Although at that point Clark has already decided to wear the suit and save Earth, it is the moment that Zod threatens Martha that Superman fully understands what he must do and it is not a choice he takes lightly. Note his emotional outburst in the train station where Lois comforts him. It was not how Clark wanted things to end. Unlike Zod, he was not raised with violence and as is noted by one of Zod’s companions, is not completely comfortable with it.  One of the biggest complaints I heard from Superman fans about Superman Returns, is that it did not have enough action. Now the most often sited criticism of Man of Steel is that it contains too much action. Superman has become such a huge fictional character that we each get something different from his story. We can relate to him feeling like an outsider. We can imagine the ability to fly or the use of any of his other amazing powers. Or we can just sit back and enjoy his larger than life battles.  Superman is distinctly American with his grass roots Christian upbringing. He has been described as a boy scout, a man with impossibly high morals. Superman is an inspiration. He has God like powers but like Christ, he has mortal weaknesses. Although he is the man of steel, Clark is blessed/cursed with a very human heart. He desperately wants to belong and be loved, yet out of fear of rejection he is hesitant to make contact with others.  The love story between Superman and Lois Lane is legendary, but never has it been better explained than here. They meet while she is on assignment and she becomes part of the conflict between Zod and Kal-el. Other than Jonathan and Martha, Lois becomes the only other human with whom Superman truly connects with. Because of their shared experiences of this film, no other person on earth will be able to connect with him as well as Lois.  Of all the three actors who have played Superman on film, Henry Cavill is easily in the best shape. Clearly he spent hours in the gym perfecting his Kryptonian physique. Like Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh, Cavill is not the greatest actor. Many credit Reeve’s acting but he was best when playing Clark Kent as a nerd. Routh and Cavill seemed cast more for their looks than talent. In defense of all three actors, how do you play such an iconic character without sounding unbelievable?  As long as he is moving, Cavill plays the role convincingly. As soon as he is given a line, his lack of acting skills become all too apparent. His reading of the line, “I have so many questions. Where do I come from?” is horribly weak. After 33 years of searching for answers and is finally confronted with the image of his real father, Cavill sounds as interested as someone trying to decide which flavor of ice cream cone to order. When he meets with Lois in Smallville, who now knows he is alien, he seems unimpressed. When Cavill says, “My father believed that if the world found out who I really was, they'd reject me... out of fear. He was convinced that the world wasn't ready. What do you think?” Apprehension should have been dripping from his lips, but again we get nothing from him.  The best casting and acting in the film is that of Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. It was a Field of Dreams (1989) flashback when he stood next to a cornfield. Costner has very little screen time but certainly makes the most of them. I have never before appreciated just what a fine actor he is. Often we see him staring at Clark with love, concern and understanding. He expresses more with a glance than Cavill does with any amount of dialogue.  In a flashback scene, Jonathan says to an insecure young Clark, “You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world.” Those are inspiring words but they also hold Clark responsible for his decisions. Clark can be a man or a God. He can be good or evil. Unlike his Kryptonian parents, He was not restricted by his upbringing, he was set free by it. What is truly wondrous, and God like, about Clark Kent is that he does not choose to take and do what he likes but to serve mankind for good. He wants to belong but knows the world is better served by him keeping his superpowers at a distance, lest he be treated as a God. He truly is a super man.",POSITIVE

"Jun 15, 2013"," Who could possibly have imagined that Man of Steel, the latest attempt to reboot the Superman franchise, would be an even less satisfying superhero saga than such critically dismissed efforts as Daredevil, Green Lantern and (yikes!) The Green Hornet? It's one massive superbore, with a solemnity so crushing that it makes those earnest Biblical epics from the 1950s and '60s seem like a Marx Brothers romp by comparison. Certainly, some will (wrongly) argue that this post-9/11 era has no room for such lighthearted superflicks like 1978's Superman, which still ranks as the greatest superhero movie ever made. But even such yarns as The Avengers and the Iron Man trio, with all their nods toward world destruction and terrorists (or supervillains) seeking to curtail our freedoms, exhibit a sense of joy in the filmmaking, while the sagas that do wallow in the nihilism, like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, have enough gravitas and dramatic heft to warrant such treatment. Man of Steel, for its part, offers nothing but torturous exposition, heavy-handed symbolism, criminally ill-used actors and a numbing finale that would be right at home in a Transformers sequel. For what it's worth — and it ultimately isn't worth much — Man of Steel tackles the familiar origin story from a different angle than what might be expected. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) still anchors the first reel, futilely warning his fellow Kryptonians that their planet is doomed and they must evacuate before it's too late. And General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his band of misfits still turn up and are eventually hurled into the Phantom Zone, although the interesting twist here is that Zod and co. aren't merely murderous egotists but well-meaning anarchists who seek to overthrow the doddering bureaucrats (Occupy Krypton?). Unfortunately, Zod's means aren't peaceful — no sidewalk sit-ins for him — and before he's imprisoned, he swears to track down Jor-El's baby boy, who's been hurled into space in advance of the planet's demise. That son, of course, is Kal-El, who lands on Earth and is raised by farm couple Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) under the name of Clark Kent. Clark understandably feels like an outsider all the time, and he's anxious to use the awesome powers he keeps bottled up inside. But Jonathan instructs him to resist the urge, and this advice is largely what leads the adult Clark (now played by Henry Cavill) to wander the backroads with no real purpose, a bearded laborer who takes any job he can find (these scenes, combined with Clark's shaggy whiskers, bring to mind Hugh Jackman's wanderings in X-Men and X-Men Origins: Wolverine). It isn't until he meets reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and squares off against the newly arrived Zod that he begins to find direction in his life. And just to ensure that everything goes according to cosmic plan, the ghost of Jor-El pops up on occasion, doling out advice like some ethereal Obi-wan Kenobi. There's a strong possibility that Man of Steel might be the dullest superhero saga ever filmed. It's not lacking in action, but it's endless and uninspired, with director Zack Snyder (300, Sucker Punch) maxing out the studio's credit cards by shooting as much CGI bombast as the hardware could handle before sparking and catching on fire. The scenes that rely on dialogue are no better, with the good guys prone to speechifying and the bad guys reduced to spouting haughty cliches. Of all the actors, poor Costner has it the worst of anybody: Playing a character whose righteousness would put Gandhi to shame, he's never allowed to utter anything remotely natural, instead delivering every line as if he was reading from a stack of fortune cookies. It's a pity, because he's the most perfectly cast performer in the entire production, with Crowe placing a distant second (like Costner, he has to struggle with a sizable number of unwieldy lines). Adams, a great actress, is curiously ineffectual as Lois Lane — while an improvement over Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth (heck, even RuPaul would be an improvement over Bosworth), she possesses none of the manic energy or insatiable curiosity of Margot Kidder's intrepid reporter in the Christopher Reeve entries. And until this film, I thought it was impossible for Shannon to deliver a weak performance, but he's drastically miscast as General Zod, reducing this towering figure of evil into the equivalent of a slobbery bulldog irritated by mange. All might be forgiven had the role of Superman/Clark Kent been cast with the right actor, but Cavill is a complete dullard, bereft of any trace of wit or charisma. Much of that might be due to the efforts of the writers (unbelievably, the Dark Knight team of Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer) to repeatedly present the character as Christ incarnate (the movie's a Where's Waldo? of Biblical proportions, with Jesus references lurking behind every act), but even in the more relaxed scenes opposite Adams, Cavill is more supermodel than Superman. Forget Christopher Reeve comparisons: Cavill doesn't even come close to measuring up to Superman Returns' Brandon Routh. And while we'll have to wait for the sequel to fully measure his effectiveness at playing the nerdy, bespectacled Clark Kent, his brief appearance in this capacity unfortunately stirs memories of The Amazing Spider-Man, where the makers merely slapped a pair of glasses on Andrew Garfield and asked us to accept this hunky, in-crowd kid as a geeky outsider. Then again, the inability of Clark's glasses to disguise his true nature is an apt metaphor, since it doesn't take 20/20 vision (or 3-D glasses) to see that this Man of Steel is one leaden endeavor.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2013"," Content by Tony Macklin. Originally published on June 15, 2013 @ tonymacklin.net.Man of Steel is clutter and clatter. It's racket and rumpus.
It soars, but it also flounders.
The main clutterer is writer David S. Goyer [Christopher Nolan also contributed to the story.] The clatterer is director Zack Snyder.
Snyder, as director, is not a Chris Nolan. When Snyder takes leaps of faith and space, he stumbles.
Nolan wrote the three screenplays and directed the outstanding Batman/Dark Knight trilogy. Man of Steel seems like an expensive knockoff.
It's the very disjointed story of Kal-El (Henry Cavill), from birth to earth. He's sent from the planet Krypton by his parents (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer) to survive and perhaps save mankind.
He grows up in the care of his earthly parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). But General Zod (Michael Shannon) pursues him to earth to try to regain the mysterious Codex, which Kal-El has carried from Krypton. The Codex contains the key to power.
Man of Steel has a lot of chatter about ""humanity,"" but there's little sign of it in the presentation of the movie.
There may not be a memorable line in the entire film. A lot of the dialogue is close to drivel. Much of the exposition is simply dull.
I doubt that Russell Crowe ever imagined he'd be on screen saying, ""Krypton is doomed."" [""I hope my career isn't.""]
When Crowe as Jor-El appears on a winged creature, we know we're in for a bumpy flight.
Crowe has to fight the relentless music which competes with him every time he opens his mouth. ""The world is about to come to an end,"" he says with a straight face, probably thinking of the booze he's going to have to drink later to wash down the stale dialogue.
He says to Zod, ""I will honor the man you were - not the monster you have become."" To Jor-El's baby son, he says, ""Goodbye, my son. Our hopes and dreams [and box office] travel with you.""
Much of the dialogue should be accompanied by a kazoo.
Henry Cavill is suitable as Clark Kent/Superman. He has to trudge through the rubble of bad dialogue and generic music, but he survives.
Michael Shannon, as General Zod, shows a side of him we never knew - the ham. He casts aside his usual repressed character and relies on an arched stare and loud voice. 
Zack Snyder is not much of a director of women. He should direct an all-female version of The Walking Dead. Fortunately Amy Adams, as Lois Lane, is a good enough actress to humanize her role. Still, Lois Lane lost in space may leap beyond our suspension of disbelief.
Snyder is good at scope and gimmickry. He does achieve one tender moment when Clark and his father look at one another during a tornado. But it's only one moment in a movie lacking such feeling. 
The high point of Goyer's mediocre screenplay is naming the web writer Woodbern. Get it? - Woodward and Bernstein. Ah, the wit.
Much of the dialogue doesn't work. Facing a general, Lois says to him, ""when we're done measuring dicks."" Shortly afterwards she says, ""What if I need to tinkle?"" There's no way those two lines would come out of the same character.
The only thing that's consistent in Man of Steel is bombast.

"Jun 14, 2013"," A young boy dreams of becoming something greater.  A father dreams of great things for his son.  Director Zack Snyder’s MAN OF STEEL explores various questions left unanswered by previous films in the Superman franchise, yet falls ironically short of its own aspirations for greatness. Writer David Goyer is a literalist.  When he wants to birth a franchise, he shows you a birth in a chamber shot—diffuse light reflecting off particles suspended in air, mimicking the viscosity of amniotic fluid.  When he wants to tell you how important Kal-El (Henry Cavill) is to the future of Krypton and Earth, he’ll tell you three times.  Lara (Ayelet Zurer) bears a child on a planet that for generations has controlled reproduction through a eugenics program.  It’s a puzzling establishment, since a terraforming civilization wouldn’t run out of planets to populate.  Why else would you go to the expenditure of interstellar travel?  I digress. That said, MAN OF STEEL sets up an intriguing conflict in its incarnation of General Zod (Michael Shannon) who is equally at odds with Jor-El (Russell Crowe) as well as the Science Council.  Zod has no choice in the matter, because he was bred a military general with a singular purpose: Protect the Kryptonian race.  Zod demands that Jor-El turn over control of a genetic key called the Codex, which contains pieces of the DNA of billions of Kryptonians.  Skeptical of Zod’s intentions, Jor-El warns of the futility, “And if your forces prevail, you will be the leader of nothing.”  Yet later, he expresses sympathy for Zod, “A product of the failures of our world.” While Zod and Jor-El have the same aim, the former’s methods cost Jor-El his life.  This nonetheless leads to Zod’s capture and banishment to a dimension known to Superman fans as The Phantom Zone.  In one of the few nods to Richard Donner’s 1978 film, Zod maniacally vows to find Jor-El’s son–though not in quite as spectacularly insane a fashion Terence Stamp’s dramatic outburst, “You will bow down before me!  Both you, and then one day, your heirs!” Lara, an active participant unlike so many of Hollywood’s poorly-written supporting female roles, helps baby Kal escape in a pod controlled by technology so futurstic its biomechanical design reminds us of Arthur C. Clarke’s axiom, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”  I had hoped the filmmakers would put their CG creations to use in a more extended backstory of Krypton in which the disconnect between Jor-El and the elders of the Science Council were better fleshed out, but hurry along the plot they must. While some moments are peppered with slightly wooden line deliveries, the first act effectively establishes a reasonable amount of the history and motivations behind the House of El, Zod and his lieutenants.  This includes Faora-Ul; Antje Traue may not have the acting pedigree of Sarah Douglas (Ursa in SUPERMAN II) but portrays a menacing foe, of whom I would have liked to see more. Planet Krypton is dying, a victim of its inhabitants’ short-sightedness and exhaustion of resources—a plot point recycled less imaginatively than the Greco-Deco Roman animated murals that tell us a story only to be repeated later with live action flashbacks.  And flashbacks abound. The second act enshrines what soul Mr. Snyder’s film does possess, though it does so jarringly.  Not that the match cut from spacecraft to tugboat isn’t clever, but I’m not sure if the editor was attempting to be unconventional or simply work around a story in which the narrative threads hadn’t been adequately bridged by the screenwriter.  However disconnected one segment feels from the next, each is conceived well, particularly one in which young Clark–unaccustomed to his emerging superpowers–has a panic attack.  In my 2006 review of SUPERMAN RETURNS, I noted the Christ parallels did not go unnoticed or unappreciated.  Here we get the story that neither the previous films nor the Bible have waxed on about those formative years when a young boy is confronted on one side with a desire to fit in and on the other with abilities that demand maturity.  The film asks the question, “What if he doesn’t want to be Superman?” Henry Cavill, the 6’1″ lead playing Kent/Superman hits all the right notes, even if he is three inches shorter than the towering Christopher Reeve.  Unlike Brandon Routh, Mr. Cavill’s predecessor in Bryan Singer’s SUPERMAN RETURNS, Mr. Cavill is not imitating Reeve’s indelible persona. Instead, Mr. Cavill’s Superman epitomizes self-doubt.  His ability to simultaneously convey fortitude, confidence and vulnerability establish a Superman all his own.  The late Reeve’s performance, sacred to many including myself, is respectfully undisturbed. Some critics or fans might argue that they’ve lumped Clark Kent’s character into Superman’s.  Perhaps true to some extent that Clark Kent was a projection of Superman’s psychological inadequacy—an act to deflect attention away from Superman’s physically impenetrable nature.  Here the origin story reboot strips away that duality in favor of directly motivating Superman to consciously overcome his insecurities and take up the mantle. As Lois Lane and Perry White, Amy Adams and Lawrence Fishburne anchor the movie in a twenty-first century reality, but only in the style of their dialogues and body language, supported by some excessively shaky handheld camera work. Beyond their facile portrayals of an enterprising reporter and her boss having it out over her journalistic integrity, what do we learn about Lois or Perry?  Absolutely nothing because the writer and director didn’t seem to think it was germane to advancement of the plot.  Lois doesn’t have a life or motivations of her own, she exists purely to track down Superman.  Perry’s her sounding board.  He approves or disapproves of her pursuit of the last son of Krypton, depending on which way the story needs to bounce. Despite Mr. Shannon’s precise expressiveness, Ms. Adams’ casual confidence, and Mr. Cavill’s earnestness, they cannot carry the dialogue above its horribly expository nature nor can they rescue the film from a protracted third act consisting almost entirely of blurry computer graphics-laden action sequences—buildings toppling, cars crushing, and people falling without real consequence.  “You’re a monster, Zod!” is a classic line resurrected only to be marred with Superman’s follow up, “And I’m going to stop you.”  Well, of course he is. It’s one thing for a film to be consistently bad, entirely another for a film to aspire to great heights only to come crashing down like Superman after his first wobbly attempt at flight.  In just one series of shots on a yard, a doorknob, and an empty swing, cinematographer Amir Mokri (LORD OF WAR) conveys the anguish of an outcast adoptee and his father struggling to find meaning in a world that doesn’t hold any simple answers.  In comes Mr. Goyer to rescue us from our own intelligence with, “People are afraid of what they don’t understand.”  Filmmakers are afraid because they don’t understand that we do.

		a sexy Lois Lane. Russell Crowe admirably plays Supermans real father. 
		Diane Lane plays Supermans foster mother and is made up to look her 
		real age which dismally fails to hide her inherent beauty. Adding to the

"Jun 14, 2013"," Listen to Kevin’s radio review…




I’m not one to geek out too much at movies, especially comic book films. For the most part, I’m forgiving of director egos trampling over tried-and-true mythology from the pulp magazines, especially for the Marvel characters which I never read with any regularity as a child. But when it comes to Superman and Batman, I can be hyper-critical. It’s because I grew up with them, reading the books religiously as a child of the 70s and 80s. I saw the movies and marveled how the animated series always seemed to get things right when the feature films continually twisted and bent (and sometimes flat-out shattered) story and character elements from the comic books. So any movie featuring Superman or Batman is something I watch with a critical eye, and a healthy knowledge that even the magazines themselves revamped the characters and histories from time to time. It is for these reasons that I approach any DC hero movie with trepidation. However, considering there hasn’t been a theatrical reboot of Superman since the late 70s, I gave “Man of Steel” the benefit of the doubt. This new movie is a modern take on the comic book legend. I’m reluctant to use the words that are often tossed around with this -–like “gritty,” “realistic” or “dark.” It’s not that “Man of Steel” doesn’t have these elements, but rather the Man of Steel doesn’t. The movie’s grittier than the 1978 film “Superman: The Movie,” and sure it’s darker than the on-screen mess that was “Superman Returns.” Not sure if I buy the “realistic” argument any more than I would for Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies. (After all, I find it hard to characterize any movie in which a person heals from a spinal injury with a rope tied to a dirty prison ceiling “realistic,” but there you go.) “Man of Steel” goes back to the beginning of the story, with Jor-El (Russell Crowe) on Krypton preparing to send his only son to Earth to avoid the planet’s destruction. The bulk of the film’s plot follows Kal-El (Henry Cavill) trying to rationalize his place in the world as a hero and savior to the people. The movie takes a more dangerous turn with an external conflict when the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his crew emerge from the Phantom Zone, ready to invade Earth. In general, I’m not a fan of origin stories because they often retread familiar ground. After all, who the hell doesn’t know who Superman is in this day and age? Still, I forgave director Zack Snyder going back to the well with “Man of Steel” and Supes’ origins simply because it hadn’t been done on the big screen in decades (even though we had ten years of “Smallville” that dragged that shit out throughout the past decade). There were certain parts of “Man of Steel” I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the presentation of Krypton was fantastic and visionary. Russell Crowe did a fine job as Jor-El, getting a large dose of screen time without it coming across as masturbatory the way Marlon Brando’s scenes were in “Superman: The Movie.” The action in the film is fantastic, and Snyder was the perfect choice to show fully-realized super-battles which were not technologically possible without modern digital effects. Sure, there’s a lot of crash-zooms and epic explosion moments, but at least Snyder laid off the slo-mo a bit. Additionally, the cast did a fine job – from Henry Cavill making the character his own rather than being an imitation of Christopher Reeve, to Amy Adams as the spunky Lois Lane who plays the damsel in distress when needed but also provides an intellectual foil for Superman. However, “Man of Steel” is not without its flaws. With a running time of 143 minutes, the film runs too long at points and drags, particularly in the middle. The pacing gets awkward as Snyder tries to cram too much backstory in the film using flashbacks that feel like Michael Bay and Terrence Malick’s editing systems got piss-drunk one night and had a love child. However, the biggest problem is the movie just gets too big at the end. The threat is so massive and so global, I question where the series could go from here. Unlike the Marvel juggernaut, which showed Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America fighting smaller threats to lead up to potential global destruction in “The Avengers,” “Man of Steel” turns the guitar amps past eleven and doesn’t let up. In this sense, “Man of Steel” is the “Batman Begins” of Superman movies, carrying all the positive and negative connotations that come along with it. I hope the bigness of a sequel can be dialed back, as was done with “The Dark Knight” which was a bigger movie with a more intimate threat. Otherwise, we’re gonna need a threat to the entire galaxy to top things. Then there’s the big old “Justice League” movie looming on the horizon, and how can the villain in that top General Zod’s plan from this film? In the end, “Man of Steel” is good, but not great. As a one-off Superman story, I can get behind it. As the restart of a franchise, I’m still a bit skeptical. But it’s a good start. This is the best review of Man of Steel I have read! I loved the movie but I can see your point. Also are they goign to use Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern in the Justice League movie? It should be Guy Gardner instead. Not sure if they’re going with Ryan Reynolds again, but if they do, he’ll get a character revamp, I’m sure, after the soft box office from the GL movie. I’ve always been more of a Hal Jordan guy myself, though I know Guy gets a lot of love from his fans.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2013"," Early in Man of Steel, we watch as a school bus carrying a teenage Clark Kent and his classmates veers out of control and plunges off a bridge into a river. As the bus sinks below the surface, its trapped and terrified occupants frantically seize what appear to be their last gasps of air. Lucky for them young Clark is aboard! He lifts the bus back up from the depths and saves the day. But word gets around that something out of the ordinary has taken place—the parent of one of the rescued kids declares it ""an act of Providence""—leading Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) to lecture his adoptive son on the need to be more discreet with his superpowers. ""What was I supposed to do, let them die?"" Clark asks. His dad replies, ""Maybe."" Wait—what? Maybe Clark should have let a busload of kids drown rather than risk revealing his powers? Forgive me, but I thought this had been meant as a rhetorical question. Welcome to the Dark Knight-ification of Superman. Yes, the film is directed by Zack Snyder, but it is heavy (in all senses of the word) with the imprint of co-writer and co-producer Christopher Nolan, who's followed his decade with the caped crusader by taking on the task of rebooting DC Comics' other superstar superhero. The tone is somber, the palette is grayish, and you can scarcely swing a cape without it getting snagged on some moral dilemma. Man of Steel is an audacious undertaking, a stylistic and thematic mash-up of Avatar, The Matrix, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Independence Day, The Thing, Thor, and (especially) Bryan Singer's X-Men films. What is open to question—and I confess to finding myself uncharacteristically ambivalent on the subject—is whether the resulting heavyweight summer blockbuster is very much fun. The story begins on Krypton, a planet of floating robotic valets and winged mounts that would make a Nazgul sick with envy. There's just one catch: Due to the government's poor management of natural resources (it has taken the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra to improbable extremes) the planet is about to explode. Krypton's military leader, General Zod (Michael Shannon) responds to this news by fomenting rebellion; its top scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) opts for putting his infant son, Kal-El, in a tiny spaceship and blasting him to Earth. (In a neat inversion, what makes this savior-to-be special is that Krypton grows most of its children artificially and Kal-El, by contrast, was the product of the planet's first ""natural"" birth in centuries—i.e., his is a uniquely non-immaculate conception.) From there, we flash forward to Earth about 30 years later, where a handsome drifter (Henry Cavill), equal parts pectoral muscle and facial hair, is making his way across Canada, hopscotching from truckstops to military installations. And no, before you ask, this isn't Wolverine, whose reboot doesn't arrive until next month. Rather he's Kal-El, a.k.a. Clark Kent (no one's thought to call him the S-word yet), and he's looking for answers about his origins that he can't find in the copious flashbacks to his childhood in Kansas. Eventually, he finds them in an old Kryptonian spaceship that can project a hologram of his dead father. But intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) also finds him, and he pleads with her to let him stay un-found. The question of whether or not Clark should reveal himself to humankind is soon rendered moot, however, by the arrival of another spaceship, bearing his dad's old nemesis General Zod. The general, who evidently watched The Dark Knight during his long journey to Earth, immediately takes a page out of the Joker's book and demands that Kal-El surrender himself or he'll start killing Earthlings. Inevitably, Zod and his followers announce their Evil Plan for the Human Race, and it falls to the newly christened Superman to foil it. This entails a great deal of fighting: punches are thrown, and cars too; flight and heat vision get their requisite workouts; and Zod's starship levels half the skyscrapers in—Manhattan? Metropolis? Either way, it's played by a combination of Chicago and Vancouver. As the man of steel, Cavill (best known from Showtime's The Tudors) displays a magnetic presence and topographic physique in the star-making role that had narrowly eluded him in the past. (He was the runner-up to play Bond in Casino Royale but was deemed too young; Twilight author Stephenie Meyer called him ""my perfect Edward,"" but by the time the novel was optioned he was deemed too old.) As Lois Lane, Adams shows so much pluck that it's a wonder she isn't conscripted for duty on a poultry farm. And the rest of the cast (which also features Ayelet Zurer and Diane Lane as Clark's biological and adoptive mothers, respectively, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White) fulfill their obligations with aplomb. I do wish, though, that Shannon (as Zod) had been asked to dial back his patented brand of wide-eyed crazy at least intermittently. There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film, from the cast to the fluid action sequences to the expansive reimagining of the Superman mythos. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour—which are more than a tad reminiscent of the finale of The Avengers—it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed. The grim tones favored by Nolan (and Snyder) may be a natural fit for the nocturnal exploits of Batman, but when it comes to a flying man in blue and red spandex, a little jocularity can go a long way. And while there are a few light moments sprinkled throughout the proceedings—a nice exchange with Lois about the meaning of the ""S"" on Superman's uniform; a witty (if preposterous) closing gag at the Daily Planet that recalls Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 2 observation that it's Clark Kent who is the assumed identity, the ""costume""—such whimsies are few and far between. Man of Steel is, by pretty much any measure, a better film than Bryan Singer's 2006 reboot, Superman Returns: better cast, better action, better script. But Singer attempted, with uneven success, to offer a different vernacular for the superhero movie, an innocent alternative to the solemnity of Nolan's Batman and his own X-Men. For all its strengths, Man of Steel—and, in particular, the extended fisticuffs of its final third—left me nostalgic for the idea of a superhero who never has to throw a punch.",POSITIVE

"Jun 14, 2013"," Two hundred and twenty-five million dollars buys a lot when you’re making a superhero blockbuster. In Zack Snyder’s 143-minute, sensory-bludgeoning Man of Steel, the director spends almost a quarter of a billion smackers on planetary vistas, collapsing buildings, flying bodies, and a sound mix so aggressive you’ll go deaf as well as blind. But seemingly, there’s nary a line in the bloated budget for humor, charm, wonder, or even the slightest acknowledgment that we’re supposed to be having fun. Any justification for such a self-serious take on Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster’s iconic creation is financial, not creative. Maybe humor, charm, and wonder don’t play well globally. Maybe Man of Steel needs to be tonally consistent with Christopher Nolan’s dour Batman trilogy (Nolan shares producer and story credits here) to better pave the way for a Justice League movie. Maybe Warner Bros. wants to distance itself from Richard Donner’s delightful Superman: The Movie, starring Christopher Reeve, which launched the superhero blockbuster era in 1978. Whatever the reason, the elements that work in David S. Goyer’s Man of Steel script and Snyder’s hyper-polished visual style are nearly eclipsed by the problems that come with prioritizing the transitory thrills of CGI-destruction over character, emotion, and fun. After all, the reason Donner’s Superman is still beloved after 35 years ain’t the special effects. It’s fitting that Man of Steel would costar Russell Crowe because watching such a relentless onslaught of sights and sounds, we’re reminded of the scene in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator where Crowe’s Maximus kills six men in less than a minute and then wonders aloud, “are you not entertained?” After the umpteenth Man of Steel fight scene, one can envision Zack Snyder maniacally yelling the same line while standing atop a mountain of exhausted actors, craftsmen, and visual effects artists. Undoubtedly though, we are entertained if only because Man of Steel insists upon it – and maybe if we admit the final battle between our hero and the villainous General Zod is the coolest thing ever, as the movie will finally end. Snyder loves to frolic in his effects-dependent comfort zone and screenwriter Goyer (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises) continually feeds the beast, beginning with a lengthy prologue on the doomed planet of Krypton (conceived as a visual mash-up of Dune, Avatar, and Middle Earth). Here Man of Steel stays close to canon as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) load their newborn son, Kal-El, into a pod and ship him off to Earth. Before Krypton explodes, Jor-El faces off with General Zod (a fiercely effective Michael Shannon), whose genetically encoded obsession with protecting the citizens of Krypton gets he and his cohorts arrested, frozen, and blasted into space. The next we see of Kal-El is 33 years later, as the rechristened Clark Kent (Henry Cavill). A rootless wanderer taking odd jobs, Clark’s heroic impulses emerge during a raging fire on a collapsing oil rig. Never one to skimp on the beefcake (see: 300) Zack Snyder gives us a shirtless Clark ripping off a metal door and entering the room with flames dancing off his shoulders and chest. It’s quite an entrance and it also advances the movie’s only effective emotional idea: Clark is torn between using his amazing abilities and heeding the advice of his adopted father, Jonathan (Kevin Costner, getting more rustically appealing with age), to delay revealing his powers for fear mankind won’t accept him. Man of Steel pushes this theme repeatedly in flashback, as Jonathan scolds the young Clark for saving a busload of schoolchildren and smiles as Clark avoids a confrontation with bullies. As for Clark’s birth father, Russell Crowe has been advised by his director to act in a near-robotic monotone that befits his character’s eventual status as a holographic “consciousness” haunting a Kryptonian ship buried in the Arctic. Such an affectless performance leaches the power from one of the story’s essential relationships. A crucial scene, where Jor-El reveals to Clark his extraterrestrial origin, has so little impact that from an emotional standpoint nothing works from that moment on. That includes the relationship between Clark and Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). In Man of Steel, Lois chases Henry Cavill’s Clark because he’s a hot story, not a hot guy. She’s a modern woman – a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist – and, well, that’s really all we learn about her. This is the least interesting Lois Lane of any Superman film and Adams, hardly a heavyweight presence anyway, has so little to work with that she’s nearly consumed by the bombast surrounding her. Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Diane Lane (as Clark’s adoptive mother) are all Oscar nominees and/or winners with the ability to make do under the distracted eye of a director who only cares about lining up the next green-screen shot. Less so in the case of relative newcomer Henry Cavill. The man is an undeniably gorgeous specimen and he looks just right in the beautifully designed Superman suit by costumers James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson. What doesn’t fit so well is Superman conforming to the Christopher Nolan-inspired, Warner Bros.-approved mold of dark, conflicted superhero that does neither Cavill nor Superman any favors. At his best, Kal-El is a combination of troubled teenager trying to find his place in the world and Christ figure charged with saving humankind. (Although the Christ imagery here feels more like a blatant attempt to cater to faith-based audiences disdainful of secularist Hollywood.) Turning him into a sour, punching machine who issues vague threats like, “I’m here to help, but it has to be on my own terms,” is just bending to the cinematic whims of the moment. It gives Man of Steel a cold heart that no amount of spectacle can compensate for while rendering Henry Cavill a fairly dull Superman, for which Zack Snyder must take the blame. Man of Steel’s last hour lays waste to so many cars, buildings, and streets that if such destruction regularly awaits an Earth protected by Superman, then he should really go find himself another home. This marathon of mayhem begins after General Zod and his followers escape their frozen prison and track Kal-El to Earth. The resulting fight in Smallville truly feels like a comic book come to vibrant, vicious life. It’s the film’s action high point. But that’s merely the opening salvo in a tiresome succession of super-powered smackdowns so frenetic there’s barely room to understand, let alone remember, each character’s objective. At one point, Superman is wrapped in steel coils for some reason, while Lois, who has improbably discovered how to defeat General Zod, sits in a cargo plane that’s attempting to crash one Kryptonian ship into another. Or something like that. And just when you thought the ensuing 9/11-evoking destruction of Metropolis was the big finale, here comes the final mano a mano between Zod and Kal-El, a prodigious disgorging of ones and zeros that amounts to nothing less than fanboy fellatio. Unlike J.J. Abrams’ clever, line-straddling reboot of Star Trek, this revisionist take on Superman’s origin tweaks established canon in encouraging ways that are then either ignored or fail to live up to their promise. Zack Snyder gives us too little of the character and wit that elevated Joss Whedon’s The Avengers and too much of the fighting and bombast that worked for Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, yet feels forced here. One figures that, intellectually, Snyder acknowledges the philosophical, religious, and even Nietzschean undercurrents flowing through Superman. Not fully exploring them is certainly justified in the context of big-budget tentpole fare, but the defining problem with the thrilling, empty Man of Steel is that the director scarcely seems to care they exist. Not when there’s so much left to blow up. Cast: Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Ayelet Zurer, Antje Traue, Christopher Meloni, Dylan Sprayberry, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix, Michael Kelly, Richard Schiff, Cooper Timberline. Voice: Carla Gugino. Not just dull—dreadful—-noisy—humorless-banal-as bad a film as I have ever seen and for a SUPERMAN movie, far worse than anything ever made-including the 40s films. What a waste. This is so true, I was a fan blinded by my like for Superman, but then i realized that this was not Superman. All he saves are people the audience can see. How awesome would it have been if after saving Louis for the 100th time, he does not kiss her but instead does something strange. Audience is left in disbeilf as he saves a family from the rubel and more, but then Zod attack! They made Superman relate-able but that is scarey because people can snap, so can Superman snap to? Good, good, a million times good. America has shown time and again that we’re a Christian country by pouring our money and time to things like the Passion of the Christ, movies about “the common good” like Batman and Man of Steel, and let movies like “The Ledge” smolder in it’s own self righteousness right out of the moral cesspool that’s called “Hollywood”.  It’s rubbed in Hollywood’s face ALL THE TIME, but those ego’s are so tightly formed around those with so much money, that it’s unbreakable. How people like Christopher Nolan rises to the top, it’s just another testament to good creativity. lacks humor? what about the lady soldier who finds superman hot? what about the “S” conversation which was suddenly interrupted? maybe you should all see a comedy movie, there you will find humor from beginning till the end..you can all rot in rotten tomatoes……. This movie, for a lifelong comic fan, was phenomenal. To say Superman is cold hearted is very unfounded. He did not in any way want to kill Zod. But, this Superman is more human than any other iteration before him. He did what he had to do for the good of HIS people, who are those of Earth. It was a shocking moment, unexpected beyond belief, but a fresh look at the MAN in Superman, a new take on the humanity in him. It was very much needed, and I thought that alone made this movie far greater than almost every critic is giving it credit for. Critics have picked this film apart for lack of comedy and romance… it’s NOT either of those types of movies. It doesn’t NEED that. This was about Superman, not a relationship, or a comical storyline. It was about the man behind the cape, where he came from, why he is. This movie more than did justice to a franchise that has suffered greatly in the past. superman did what batman would not do.superman does not kill ever ever.when superman killed zod I felt the same way as when I found out that there was no santa.they killed superman without kryptonite.wow no heart at all. I agree with Mark, this movie had glimpses of brilliance, but in the end it was too long and too damn loud and it fell flat.  This movie tried to be both intellectual and action, but it failed miserably. Its only saving grace was the acting and some moments of great writing. The movie could had been something amazing, but they decided to make a forgettable action movie instead. What about that one scene when general Zod was about to kill a family with his eye lasers and Superman was force to kill him? and the expression on his face afterwards? So… you think lois lane was better when she was mooning over abs and acting like a ditzy news anchor? B/c that’s all she ever was in the other movies. This lois lane was smart, determined, and resourceful. Just b/c it’s not a romance movie doesn’t make her part less significant. And obviously they will have her more in the sequels.. but this movie isn’t about her. It’s about Superman.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 14, 2013"," As is the case with most superhero movies, the underlying message is one of good versus evil, with Superman caught in the middle trying to decide how to navigate between his people by blood (the Kryptonians) and his people by circumstance (humans). The other main message is Superman's hero's journey of self discovery and acceptance of his power, his role and his responsibility to help and protect others. Another theme is preservation, whether it's self-preservation (Jonathan Kent thinks it's important for Clark to hide his powers lest he be manipulated by people and the government) or preservation of an entire race (Jor-El sends his baby son to Earth so he can be the best of both Krypton and his new home planet, and Zod is willing to eradicate humanity to see a new Krypton flourish). Clark/Kal-El/Superman is always selflessly willing to use his strength to save others, whether it's kids drowning on his school bus, strangers working on a burning oil rig, or Lois Lane being hurt by a Kryptonian robot. Even younger viewers will understand that this Superman is what his father Jor-El called the best of both Krypton and Earth. (That said -- possible spoiler alert! -- Superman does kill an enemy in this movie, which isn't typical for the character.) Both of Superman's fathers are wise and selfless. Jor-El guides his beloved Kal-El, even from beyond the grave. He encourages his son to use his superhuman gifts and strength to help humanity, not destroy it. Jonathan Kent reminds Clark to protect himself and not show off his strength until he feels the world is ready for him. Martha is a loving, unconditional mother who just wants whatever will keep Clark safe. Lois is a courageous investigative journalist who's willing to kill a story if it means helping Superman. The mass destruction and collateral damage caused in the movie aren't shown in a close-up or bloody manner, but buildings collapse or burn down, cars are flattened, and helicopters and planes are downed. Both adults and children are frequently in peril. An entire planet is destroyed. General Zod and his army have no regard for human life and plan to kill off the entire species and repopulate earth with Kryptonians. Lots of almost too-fast-to-process hand-to-hand combat between Superman and Zod and his warriors -- necks are broken, and people are killed so quickly that it's hard to keep a body count. At one point, Martha Kent is nearly choked to death for information about Clark, which infuriates Superman. A final confrontation ends with Superman reluctantly breaking someone's neck. Occasional language and insults include ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""hell,"" ""d--k,"" ""a--wipe,"" ""d--ksplash,"" ""oh my God,"" ""damn,"" and ""crap."" ""F-ing"" is said once, without the other letters filled in. IHOP restaurant is displayed prominently a few times: A character works there, the logo is shown (exterior and interior), and scenes are shot in the Smallville IHOP. Sears is also shown. Lois's DSLR camera, a Nikon D3 (a $10,000+ camera), is shown close-up in one sequence. The movie has more than 100 global off-screen product tie-ins/promotional partnerships. Parents need to know that Man of Steel, the latest take on the legendary Superman character, is darker than the classic Superman films but lighter (and less bloody) than The Dark Knight trilogy. There's definitely a lot of violence (including a destroyed planet, necks being broken, hand-to-hand combat that results in deaths, and -- possible spoiler alert -- Superman actually killing an enemy), but it's more macro than micro in scale: buildings topple, the sea crashes down, planes plummet, etc. Language is infrequent but includes occasional use of ""s--t,"" ""d--k,"" and ""ass."" The romance even tamer: Lois Lane and Superman hold hands and kiss twice in one scene. Product placements are limited to IHOP, which is shown a few times, and Nikon (but there are more than 100 off-screen licensing deals/promotions in place globally for the movie). Expect plenty of messages about good and evil and identity and what it means to be a hero; ultimately this is a story about the duality of Superman's life (part Clark Kent, part Kal-El), as symbolized by his two fathers. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. MAN OF STEEL begins with the origin story of Superman's birth on Krypton. Unlike all the other babies on Krypton -- who are engineered by a codex to be workers, warriors, leaders, or scientists -- baby Kal-El was made the old-fashioned way, by the planet's head scientist, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer). During a failed coup attempt by General Zod (Michael Shannon), Jor-El is killed -- but not before his wife launches their newborn son to the distant planet Earth. Zod and his cronies are banished -- a sentence that ultimately saves the troop of villains when Krypton implodes. Fast forward to Earth, where a grown, bearded, and handsome Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is a nomad who -- as his late father, Jonathan (Kevin Costner) instructed -- hides his special powers, except for occasionally saving men from a burning oil rig or rescuing fearless investigative journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Clark finds out who he really is when he discovers an ancient Kryptonian scouting ship, but the same command key that lures his father's ghost acts a beacon for Zod and his army. When Zod's ship enters Earth's atmosphere, they demand Superman's surrender, making the caped Man of Steel reveal himself to the government and setting up a massive confrontation between Zod and Superman. Director Zack Snyder's take on the Superman legend is seriously reverent. He strikes a tone that's lighter than Christopher Nolan's unrelentingly violent and contemplative Dark Knight trilogy but darker than the humor- and banter-filled The Avengers. Superman has always been unique among the popular superheroes: He's not a mutant or a billionaire with a penchant for vigilante justice; he's a straight-up alien who doesn't know why he's on Earth, where he came from, or what his purpose is as a lone outsider in a world of humans. Cavill is dashing and strong enough to pull off the role, and he certainly has the broodiness and the requisite Snyder-mandated six pack. But all of his self reflection, as understandable as it is, could use more levity, more spark, more of Christopher Reeve's sense of joy in the red and blue costume. It's the more mature generation of actors in the movie who lend it its gravitas: Costner and Crowe as Superman's two fathers, both dead but still guiding and inspiring and encouraging him (literally, in the case of Jor-El and symbolically -- and via flashbacks -- in the case of Jonathan Kent). Ultimately, though, Man of Steel, like Superman II, is a face-off between Superman and his ideological nemesis, supervillain General Zod. Shannon is brilliantly cast, and despite being ruthless, actually expresses precisely why he's willing to sacrifice humanity: Protecting and ensuring the future of the Krypton people is what he was created to do, no matter what the cost. And Snyder certainly knows his way around action sequences and huge CGI set pieces, while keeping the violence much less bloody than 300. The two-and-a-half-hour movie is considerably longer than necessary, but the dramatic fight scenes will keep audiences from checking their watches. The prospect of a sequel is enticing, because now that Clark has accepted his Superman persona, there should be more fun, humor, and romance in store for the Man of Steel. Families can talk about how this Superman differs from past interpretations of the comic-book hero. How is Man of Steel unique? What parts of the story are the same? Which adaptation do you like best, and why? How does the impact of the violence in this movie compare to other superhero stories you've seen? What about to other types of movies, like thrillers? General Zod's behavior is ""terrorist-like"" -- he's willing to have his army destroy anyone and anything to further his cause. But he also makes decisions not out of a sadistic need for violence, but for what he considers the greater good of his people. He's genuinely upset that Jor-El and then Kal-El won't help him. Is Zod completely evil? Many have raised the issue that it goes against the established Superman character to (possible spoiler alert!) have him kill someone, as he does in this movie. How does that action affect your opinion of Superman? Does the act have repercussions?

"Jun 14, 2013"," Following Bryan Singer’s dreary Superman Returns in 2006, and new helmer Zack Snyder’s previous picture, the diabolical Sucker Punch, both Joe Multiplex and acolytes of Krypton’s last son could be forgiven for approaching Man of Steel with caution. It’s a relief, then, that Snyder’s reboot provides not only breathtaking spectacle, but some unexpected depth and melancholy. We open with the destruction of Krypton, although Supes’ home planet is much-changed from the franchise’s previous outings. Gone are the crystals and dry ice; this Krypton is a grimy, dilapidated wreck, with tech and design that suggests a canoodle between the Wachowskis’ Matrix and H. R. Giger. Russell Crowe’s Jor-El is doing his best to quell a coup led by General Zod (a terrifying and tragic Michael Shannon) while their world crumbles. As Jor-El’s newborn, Kal-El, is packed off to Earth with the key to saving his people secreted in his escape pod, Zod is imprisoned, along with his dissident forces.  Cut to grown-up Kal-El – now known as Clark Kent – in the formidable form of Henry Cavill (looking as if he ate Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh for breakfast), a tortured drifter who just can’t help but use his extraordinary powers to save the imperilled folk he encounters on his travels. Bill Bixby's itinerant Doc Banner looms large. A fractured narrative flips to Clark's Kansas childhood after each adult drama; these flashbacks to this demi-god’s heightened growing pains elegantly and economically illustrate the sadness and alienation now felt by our hero. The impact of his adoptive parents, Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane), in shaping the Clark Kent side to his personality is brilliantly evoked in limited screentime. For perhaps the first time, the Man of Steel is effectively humanised. Appropriate tweaks are also made to the relationship between Clark and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) – the awkward issue of just how effective a pair of specs are by way of disguise is neatly sidestepped as Lois becomes more complicit in Clark’s deception. And Adams is a brilliant foil. Recalling Margot Kidder, she delivers more grit and sass in her first two lines than Superman Returns’ Kate Bosworth offered in two and a half hours. Her ballsy reporter plays a crucial role as an escaped Zod arrives on Earth demanding Kal-El’s surrender or humankind will pay the consequences. This third act (at times reminiscent of Snyder’s own Watchmen) provides beautifully orchestrated action on a massive scale; visual effects, editing and sound design are all perfectly rendered and complimented by Hans Zimmer’s bombastic score. Some prolonged sequences of carnage prove almost unbearably tense – no small feat given the near-indestructible nature of the protagonist and antagonist. Among all the mayhem, Snyder and co. even manage to throw in some interesting commentary on the responsibility and role of Homeland Security and the Armed Forces, and the foggy morality therein. This is cerebral, exhilarating blockbuster filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2013"," The title ""Man of Steel"" tells you what you're in for: a radical break from the past. The absence of the word ""Superman"" leads us to expect a top-to-bottom re-imagining, and that's what the film delivers, for better and worse. This is a 2013 version of the story: dark, convoluted and violent, chock full of 9/11-styled images of collapsing skyscrapers and dust-choked disaster survivors. It's sincere but not particularly funny or sweet. The hero is a glum hunk, defending a planet so scared of apocalyptic conspiracy that it assumes anyone who presents himself as good guy must have ulterior motives. Steel is what you need to have in your spine if you're going to be super in this world. Directed by Zack Snyder (""Watchmen,"" ""Sucker Punch"") and overseen by Christopher Nolan (the Dark Knight trilogy, ""Inception""), ""Man of Steel"" largely abandons the sunny spirit and kooky humor of the Christopher Reeve-starred films, as well as Bryan Singer's homage to them, 2006's ""Superman Returns."" It brings the character in line with the recent craze for brutal, morose tales of loners defending a world that doesn't appreciate their sacrifices. This time the big guy's suit isn't Dick Tracy red, blue and yellow; it's a muted ensemble of synthetic chain mail that's described as ""battle armor"" rather than as a uniform or costume, and Supes wears his underwear on the inside, thank you very much. Scene-for-scene, this is a first-rate example of a Hollywood fantasy released in the early 21st century: a new-car-smell summer blockbuster. It has wobbly handheld camerawork signifying ""authenticity,"" a glum color palette, skyline-shattering super-fights, hardware whose designs crib from ""Alien,"" ""Dune"", ""Independence Day"" and Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds,"" and a detailed mythology that can plug into an expansive, Marvel-style ""universe."" When humor bubbles up, welcome though it is, it feels like a tonal lapse.  ""Man of Steel"" also breaks with past ""Superman"" films in how it tells its story. The script, which is credited to David S. Goyer of the ""Blade"" films, starts with a prologue on Krypton, envisioned here as a John Carter-style land of towering hyper-structures, ""Matrix""-looking hovercraft, and winged beasts. Superman's dad Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and mother Lara (Ayelet Zurer)are fighting two battles at once: to convince the planet's government that its environmental recklessness is causing the planet's core to melt, and to contain a rebellion led by General Zod (Michael Shannon), who's outraged that Jor-El dared to violate Krypton's biological breeding protocol and conceive a son the old-fashioned way. Zod and his followers are exiled to the Phantom Zone in ships that look mortifyingly like the hero's spacecraft in the 1970s porn spoof ""Flesh Gordon"" (the film's design is a riot of phallic and vaginal imagery, as most post-""Alien"" sci-fi films are). Krypton explodes. Kal-El zips off to earth and is raised by Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner), in idyllic prairie surroundings that call for an Aaron Copland score (though Hans Zimmer does just fine). After the New Testament timespan of 33 years, we pick up Kal-El/Clark's story in time for him to unlock the destiny that his adoptive parents kept secret. Their motives were good: they predicted the hostility he would encounter once he put on his tights — sorry, ""armor""! — to fight Zod and prevent Earth from being flattened to make a new Krypton. (Zod's plot to create a resurrected Krypton echoes ""Superman Returns,"" though given that film's poor reception, I'm sure the filmmakers would rather nobody pointed them out.) As the adult Clark/Superman, Henry Cavill's not bad; in fact he's quite likable, and spectacularly handsome, natch. But there's no Reeve-like radiant comfort in his acting, because the character as imagined here is even more of a blank screen for our projections than most movie superheroes. Like Christopher Nolan's Batman pictures, the Goyer-scripted ""Man of Steel"" reveals key moments in the hero's development through flashbacks triggered by present-day traumas; a few parts almost seem to be unfolding along simultaneous timelines, the past and the present. This is not just defensible but appropriate, considering that so much of the story is about having to function day-to-day while carrying around the crushing weight of your own past, as well that of an extinct motherworld you never got to know. The most striking scenes show young Superman struggling to make sense of powers he can't display, for fear of being labeled a freak or a monster. One early sequence shows young Clark zoning out during a school lesson because he's overwhelmed by the data Hoovered into his brain by his super-senses. When he looks at his classmates and teachers, he sees their bones and veins and organs through their skin, and because he hasn't mastered the art of filtering sound, he hears a cacophony of voices in his ears, like the burbling of a crowd at a ball game. There's a touch of ""The Incredibles"" in the scenes of Jonathan Kent explaining why Clark can't reveal the full extent of his specialness. Costner is superb in these moments, projecting an unforced, Old Movie-style decency that may remind fans of his performance in ""Field of Dreams."" (It's as if Ray Kinsella, the adult son in ""Dreams"", has become the father in this one — an icon of kindness, yet sad-eyed and mysterious; ""worn down by life,"" as Ray described his own pop.) When Clark, who's passed the years on a fishing boat while rocking a ""Perfect Storm"" beard, heads north and gets his own pad, the Fortress of Solitude, he acquires a second father, his biological daddy Jor-El. Supes the elder becomes a present-tense Obi-Wan, advising and arguing with Clark (and later, Zod!). This is all good stuff — though it was done less ostentatiously in the TV series ""Smallville"" — but it's all a setup for the film's second half, which juxtaposes Clark's transformation into Superman with Zod's return to earth on a mission of vengeance and world-building.  It's here that the film loses something. It's not that what's onscreen isn't involving: for the most part it's splendidly realized, even though the muted color palette, shaky camerawork and secondhand design concepts won't win prizes for originality. I like how the filmmakers link Superman's embrace of the destiny his adoptive father hoped he'd resist and Zod assuming the mantle of visionary warrior-leader that Jor-El denied him on Krypton. The notion that politics is personal gets a workout. Zod isn't as amusingly effete in ""Man of Steel"" as he was in ""Superman II"", but he's not without humor, some of it inadvertent. Shannon, an expert in projecting self-defeating macho rage, makes Zod less of a straightforward evildoer than a tragically misguided antihero. There are times when his rivalry with Clark/Superman recalls the tension between Hawkeye and Magua in Michael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" in that the villain is only a villain if you're looking at him through the eyes of the people he's steamrolling. You don't condone Zod's actions, but you understand his motivations. In his twisted way, he's trying to preserve and continue the legacy of a vanished world. Something in Cavill's beefy Boy Scout performance suggests that Superman gets this — that he understands Zod even though he knows he has to destroy him. The hero's struggle not to give into rage and pettiness when facing bullies like Zod—to use his power to heal and save rather than destroy—is explored with more finesse than you might expect. No, the film's most curious and unfortunate aspect—its Achilles' heel, really—is the way it minimizes or shuts out women. You can see this tendency in the way ""Man of Steel"" handles Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She's portrayed as a capable reporter, more so than in previous films, but I didn't detect much chemistry between her and Clark, even when you factor in the ungodly pressure they're both under. While Clark is dealing with his demons and the world's, she's uncovering a government conspiracy to hide evidence of a buried Kryptonian spacecraft, then struggling against her Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) for the right to publish a story she feels is true but can't prove. There are flirtatious moments between Lois and Clark, but they're few and far between, and I'm not convinced that the apocalyptic events surrounding the couple are the only reason.  This is a butch Superman film, driven by machismo. Lois is an important character, but only for how she furthers Clark/Superman's attempts to understand himself and claim his destiny. She's less of a fully-realized human being than the kooky narcissist played by Margot Kidder in the Reeve films, or Kate Bosworth's Lois in ""Superman Returns,"" a melancholy figure defined by her ability to move on after the hero's sudden departure from earth. Adams' Lois is tough and smart, but she has no personality, only drive, and she's not as integral to the action as she seems to be on first glance. It's telling that this movie gives equal weight to the story of a distrustful general (Chris Meloni) whose relationship with Superman lets him become the stand-in for a doubting Earth, a role filled by Lois in the 1978 film. Ma Kent is endearing, but she's not as powerful a presence as the doomed Jonathan. The hero's birth mother vanishes after the prologue, her absence explained in a throwaway line that Crowe seems embarrassed to have to deliver. The uncharitable might notice than when a stupid question has to be asked, or a trivial remark made, it's often delivered by one of a handful of women in a room full of burly guys; they may also note that while every significant male figure in ""Man of Steel"" is given an option to be physically brave under horrible circumstances — even grey-haired Pa Kent and Perry White have their moments — females exist, for the most part, to be saved, or to have things explained to them. Considering that every previous ""Superman"" movie put the courtship dance between men and women at the heart of its action — particularly ""Superman: the Movie"", ""Superman II"" and ""Superman Returns"" — the fact that ""Man of Steel"" has a No Girls Allowed sensibility seems like a deliberate creative choice. It's as if the filmmakers want to reassure young male viewers accustomed to the glib swagger of ""Iron Man"" and the dire self-pity of Nolan's Batman trilogy that Superman is in the same wheelhouse. (Zod's right-hand woman Fajora-Ul, Antje Traue, is a powerful presence, but she's even more desexualized than Lois; her character's main trait is a pathological hatred of men.) Again, this is all state-of-the-art, very much in line with the way superhero movies are done now. And yet this aspect of the ""modernization"" feels retro, because it comes at the expense of an under-acknowledged part of Superman's appeal: virtually alone among big-name superheroes, he's a romantically and sexually mature man who seems to like and be comfortable around women. If you're wondering why I could say so many positive things but and only give the movie three stars, the preceding two paragraphs are your answer. Viewers who predicted that Warner Bros. and DC Comics were trying to turn Superman into The Dark Knight were right, sort of. ""Man of Steel"" is in many ways an astonishing movie, but it won't do anything to quell complaints that the big-budget superhero genre is basically adolescent, that its creative development has been arrested for decades and might not budge anytime soon.  Matt Zoller Seitz is the Editor at Large of RogerEbert.com, TV critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.com, and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2013"," Of all the many things I may have been expecting from a Superman reboot by Zack Snyder, a filmmaker who has taken us to new heights — with 300 — and new depths — with Sucker Punch — of stylized ridiculousness, it wasn’t this. There’s an honest, ardent majesty that no retelling of Clark Kent’s story has managed before… yet it’s paradoxically somehow soulful, too, as if the film were both large and small at the same time. It towers with ambition, swelled by sweeping philosophies about power and presence on scales both planetary and personal: What should you do with what you can do, and what if what you need to do alienates you from everyone else? But the wellspring of wry tragedy that beautifully balances that out keeps it from ever becoming pretentious or preposterous. We believe a man can fly… but also that he’s gosh-darn really torn up about not punching people who might be asking for it. Man of Steel is surprising, in a truly gratifying way, too, in that it wholeheartedly embraces the science-fictional side of the Superman story. This is primarily a slow-burn first-contact tale: Clark Kent, aka Kal-El (Henry Cavill [The Cold Light of Day, Immortals], putting to rest my fears that he couldn’t carry a movie), takes the long way around in trying to figure out how to fit in with the aliens he’s stranded among, something he’s been struggling with from childhood, when his extraordinary abilities start to overwhelm him — one touching scene early in the film makes it plain that as a kid, he found what he is capable of far from “super”; it’s horrible and scary to him. (Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry as, respectively, the 9- and 13-year-old Clark, are wonderful.) Now, as an adult, he tries to hide, doing nasty, dirty jobs that call to men who don’t quite fit in anywhere else — he’s working on one of those Most Dangerous Catch fishing ships as the movie opens — but he can’t keep himself from using his powers to save people when necessary. (He’s gosh-darn really torn up about not helping when no one else can, too.) And humanity is forced to play quick-draw first-contact when General Zod (Michael Shannon [The Iceman, Premium Rush], burning up the screen as always), another last refugee from Krypton, shows up in Earth orbit in a terrifying-looking ship and demands the planet turn over the alien they’ve been harboring all these years. Oh! And the preamble that takes place on Krypton and sets up the whys and the hows of Kal-El being sent to Earth — and particularly why as an infant — is rather magnificently science fictional in a way I was afraid movies had forgotten how to be. It’s grand worldbuilding that creates a truly alien environment and a truly alien civilization, but also a clear cautionary tale for us 21st-century humans about the generally bad idea of damaging one’s planet beyond repair and letting your culture stagnate. Kryptonian technology works as a cohesive whole, too, both as design — this stuff all looks alien, but it also all looks like it came from the same other place — and not as magic, but as science with its own rules and limitations. But every time — every time — you’re tempted, as a wide-eyed geek, to wonder and gape at what is before us, Snyder’s emphasis or the smart script by David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight Rises, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance), or both working in tandem, slyly undercut you and force you to see this with a fresh eye. It’s little, Pa Kent (Kevin Costner: Swing Vote, Mr. Brooks) trying to comfort his confused adopted son by explaining how special he is with an awed “You are the answer to ‘Are we alone in the universe?’” met with Clark’s “But I don’t wanna be!” — not a bratty whine but a plaintive wail of pain. It’s big, the power of first-contact imagery not in discs over a skyline but a buglike alien shuttle hovering near a Kansas farmhouse. Man of Steel is so very matter-of-fact, in many ways: this isn’t a movie about spectacle and it’s barely an action movie; and though it has flashes of warm humor, there’s little of the lightness we’ve come to expect from Superman on a big screen (or even a small one). It’s serious — though never overly solemn — drama about fear and smallmindedness, about figuring out what to do with our potential. The villain Zod is never truly villainous, only tragic, too, because he cannot see past what he thinks his limitations are. Even when it does become, in its finale, all about spaceships over a city and mass urban destruction — demons of 9/11 are all over this part — there’s the quirk of the tragic about us in it. The obvious Jesus metaphor is hit upon a few times throughout the film — Jor-El (Russell Crowe: Broken City, Les Misérables) explicitly states that he’s sending his only son sent to Earth to inspire humanity; Clark notes that he’s been on the planet for 33 years. And when all eyes start to turn to Superman with reverence after the climactic battle with Zod, which all but levels Metropolis, it’s hard not to see the “He saved us…!” awe as ironic: we only needed saving because Kal-El came to Earth in the first place; he drew Zod to us, however inadvertently. (It was too much tinkering with the natural order that doomed Krypton and its people, too. Too much interference is not a good thing.) There’s so much more to love here, including Amy Adams (Trouble with the Curve, On the Road) as Lois Lane and Diane Lane (Secretariat, Jumper) as Ma Kent, both tough, smart women whom Clark relies on — his mother, always; Lois new in his life. As with almost everything else in Man of Steel, they are traditional aspects of a familiar story that are reinvigorated here, made more real and plausible than perhaps we’ve ever seen them before, with lives of their own that stretch beyond Clark’s. Everything here, in fact, stretches beyond what we’re given, potential glimpsed but not yet wholly satisfied. Like what we’re told the sigil on Kal-El’s chest means: it’s not an ‘S’; it’s the family crest, and it means “hope.” There’s tons of hope here, but it’s not yet fulfilled, for Clark has only just awakened to himself and his potential. There’s hope not only for him, but for us, that the inevitable sequel will still have some story left to tell. Impossible? Pfff… I’ll say it: Man of Steel is the best, most earnest, competent, and thoughtful version of Superman ever filmed for movies or television. Fabulous review! Did you get teary-while watching it? I did. And oh, that Clark Kent secret identity reveal was just perfect for me. The entire thing was perfection. I didn’t get actually teary, but some scenes are very moving. Much more so than I would have expected. Almost everything between Clark and Pa Kent, for instance. I’m so happy to read this review! You’ve given me a little more enthusiasm for seeing it that was lost after watching all the negative reviews roll in elsewhere. I DO wonder why so many people aren’t liking it, though. What you describe sounds fantastic.  The “not enough jokes” nonsense comes from all the zombies who laughed in the theater at the ridiculously overwhelming stupid-empty-easy humor packed in Iron Man 3. There’s really people saying that? That’s just stupid. I don’t go to a movie like this for humor. Apparently, some people do? Non-geeky people, perhaps? Seriously. It’s only a movie about Superman barely fending off the end of the world. Where was Rex Reed’s cameo?! I’m glad that Clark’s mom likes his Supersuit, but I’d rather that compliment come from a pimp. Everything else positive I can say about the film I have to add “but [negative thing that mostly negates the positive]”. Even, e.g., the gorgeous visuals and effects–“but the film was so leached of color that even in 2D Superman’s suit might as well have been dark gray”. This is really interesting! The consensus of other critics I read is definitely coming down hard on the side of “the spectacle is well-done, shame about the acting and script and general drabness” (though some of them don’t like the spectacle either). I wonder if they’re too far into the groove of the modern, Marvel-style superhero movie to enjoy one that does things a bit differently. In the context of a “realistic” story, how the film treats the “S” is the only way that makes sense, I think. Better than a literal “S” childishly plastered on his chest to announce his superhero name (which would have been presumptuous if he’d thought to name himself that, which isn’t the case in the film). Unless I’m mis-remembering, the “S” meaning “hope” first happened on Smallville.  Not a good show (and often frustrating to me because it could have been a great show with a little re-write and some decent howrunners) but it had some clever ideas in it and when it was at its best, it could be a good and very modern take on the Superman mythos.  I wonder if Snyder et al took Smallville as an influence at all? Some critics pan the film for not having more “origin” scenes. I think the filmmakers made this in a large way for the fans, and assumed most of them had some exposure over the decade that “Smallville” was on. I applaud their choice. Plus, I feel that having more origin scenes WOULD make it more of a retread.  We’ve seen most of this before.  Let’s hit the high points plot-wise, and focus more on the emotional aspects than a point-by-point timeline. I liked it, but was bothered by the wanton shredding of TWO cities during the major fights. If I had my Executive Meddling powers, I’d have made it so that Superman would do his utmost to drag those fights off the streets and away from civilians as best he could. The idea of the S-shield being a family crest was from the Christopher Reeve movies.  Brando’s suggestion, believe it or not.  By the Birthright miniseries comic book, they had retconned the symbol into word-meanings, which was about the same time as the Smallville series. That bothered me a bit.  Had he tried to escape the city and fly out over the ocean, Zod, who was chasing him, not trying to take the city, would have followed. Actually, I’m not so sure about that. Right before their final brawl, Zod tells Superman something to the effect of “I’m going to punish them. You destroyed Krypton’s future, now I’m going to hurt these humans you love so much.” It seems to me Zod was just as likely to stay in the city and wreak death and destruction as payback. Yeah, and since Zod obviously wanted Supes to kill him, and was an experienced military strategist, I’m sure the loss of live was the POINT to goad Superman, not an accident or simple side-effect of the fight.  Same with the “why doesn’t Zod just move his EYES if he can’t move his head?”… he cause his goal ISN’T to simply kill a few more people – it’s to force Supers to kill his Supes’ own soul the way he killed Zod’s. He was doing his best just to barely not get his butt kicked. He was treading water. He could probably barely think, let alone strategize. The wanton destruction is *why* they stage the battles in cities, which I believe is how it’s done in all superhero movies. All the crashing about underscores and amplifies your perception of the energy being expended. I liked it quite a bit, but thought it had the same problem as Iron Man III and Star Trek:  the final battle(s) go on for too long. Holy different strokes Superman… Action sequences are most of why I go to a theater to see movies like this and pay extra for 3D. I liked it a lot, but I completely understand anyone who doesn’t. I loved Cavill and Adams in the roles as much as I had hoped I would. I really felt like the level of destruction was out of proportion with the rest of the story (and it’s a Superman movie, so think about that for a second). I’m really kind of done with Snyder. He does a fine job, but his vision of modern film isn’t something I want to watch anymore, and would love to see just about anyone else direct the sequel. Out of curiosity I looked into it. Zod rather than being merely an invention for the movies was a very prominent character from the Superman comics, originating in 1961. Per the Wikipedia article he’s regarded as one of SM’s greatest enemies. Including him seems pretty much mandatory. Pa Kent ruined the movie for me with his over-protectiveness of Clark’s abilities. Did you ever see “The Sweet Hereafter?” How many people in that town would have been thankful for a Clark in their midst? Would Smallville look like “The Sweet Hereafter” if Clark listened to his dad’s advice? Would he have been able to live with the consequences of keeping the secret? I was filled with disgust at this element of the story and it damaged my enjoyment of the film immeasurably. For what it’s worth, my take on the tornado thing was that Pa waved Clark off because he had a HUGE FRAKKING TORNADO in his face (see Moore, Oklahoma) and no reason to believe Clark could survive something like that.  Pa doesn’t know that Clark is Superman, remember – he never read the comic book.  Pa acted like my Dad would have – “look after your mother” – and Clark, in spite of a flash of teenage rebellion moments before, fell back on obeying Pa instantly when the chips are down because he was his dad.  Clark was just about to tear out and get him, but Pa held up his hand, Clark hesitates – ‘cuz Pa told him to – and Pa died.  Clark’s reaction was as much GODDAMMIT, WHY DIDN’T I IGNORE THE OLD MAN FOR ONCE as it was blinding grief.  Made it all MUCH more nuanced than just , “Awww, that’s really sad.” I agree with someone’s assessment I’d read that after telling Pa Kent, “You’re not my real dad!” Clark stayed his hand to show his dad he trusted him and would respect his wishes after all. I think you conveniently forget that if Clark outed himself (had he saved his father)… the intense media scrutiny would be much worse. Plus, Pa Kent wanted his son to live a normal life… there’s some things in life that can’t be altered no matter what happens. I think that’s why that scene divides people. People who ask “why didn’t he save his dad”? forget the point of it. Same with Superman killing Zod at the end… Zod forced his hand. You see the anger, regret and sadness in Cavill’s face during those scenes. And MAJ, there’s plenty of fodder a sequel can go on. For example, Lex Luthor could actually turn the people against Superman because of that incident. And so forth. But the film stands on its own too. Mary Ann (or anyone else), I know this type of question isn’t in your wheelhouse, but would you recommend this for a 5 year old boy?  I promised my son months ago to take him, since he loves superman, but i did not realize it was pg-13.  he’s typically not scared by superhero violence, but has only been exposed to the animated variety so far (superman or batman: the animated series, et al). the whole kryptonian air compsoition and gravity makes him a normal human was too childish. i was hoping someone would introduce a genetic engineering or nanomachines kind of concept which enables superman to use solar energy to fly and be strong and shoot lasers etc. also it would make more sense for them to have such powers on a much weaker level like jumping high or gliding and relatively high strength in their planet too but a weak dying star so they optimized their processes to use as much of that energy as possible for optimizing themselves so when he gets abundant solar energy on earth his powers multiple 100 times…. but making them look and act completely human on krypton just doesnt make sense to me. And it’s not part of the lore is it? I was under the impression that it’s the difference in the suns that made or unmade his super powers. why did they speak english on krypton? if they didnt and we were just shown so to make us understand without subtitles then how was Jor El’s uploaded intellicege able to converse with Clark? why didnt zod just hold lois and martha kent hostages and threaten to kill them if superman didnt let them extract the codex? as an experienced trained general you would expect him not to take any risks and realize the morality in clark and use it to his disadvantage from the start.  why do they look like humans? evolution cannot produce any other type of intelligent beings? or are all humans kryptonians from a thousands of years old colonization? just becuase a comic book’s back story worked in the past and no one bothered with these questions doesnt mean todays audience will not ask these questions.  the movie was brilliantly made and so much better than that crap “suparman returns to be jealous of lois’s new husband and finds his hybrid alien child with asthma” story. BUT unlike other “better” superhero movies like The Dark Knight or Iron man or even Avengers, it was not believable enough for me. i didnt like captain america too much but the movie was certainly a lot more believable.  why did they speak english on krypton? if they didnt and we were just shown so to make us understand without subtitles then how was Jor El’s uploaded intellicege able to converse with Clark? There is at least one attempt to address this in the film: When Zod broadcasts his ultimatum on the world’s TV screens and iPhones, his message shows up in different languages around the world. So, apparently, Kryptonians have some means of making themselves understood to other beings in their native language. Apparently so. When he kneels down and touches his fist to the ground before launching off, the ground around him rumbles and the pebbles around him shake. Possibly he’s generating an anti-gravity energy field? Also, in the final fight, Zod strips off his armor and reveals that he too can fly; his armor stops short of hitting the ground and just floats a few inches in the air. Again, seems like a gravity-cancelling field. It’s not the suit that enables him to fly. It’s just that Jor-El gives him the suit, and at the same time says something like “You won’t know what your limits are until you test them.” So Clark is encouraged to discover his flying powers and puts on the suit at the same time; a nice coincidence, and a powerful visual. (The Donner film did the same thing.) And of course a first attempt at flying wouldn’t go perfectly; it would be more unrealistic if it did! why do they look like humans? evolution cannot produce any other type of
 intelligent beings? or are all humans kryptonians from a thousands of years old colonization? Actually, in the movie version, the Asgardians are not supernatural gods but an extremely advanced alien civilization, with technology so far ahead of ours that it looks like magic. Your criticisms could apply to that movie as well: Why would an alien race look human? Why would they speak English? Man of Steel has several plot holes; fair enough. But if you think those other movies don’t have their share of implausibilities, I recommend that you go to YouTube and look up the “Everything Wrong with [Movie Title]” series by CinemaSins. I don’t think MOS is noticeably less believable than those other films. And I’m willing to forgive implausibilities if the story is otherwise compelling, as MOS was to me. One of the passengers on that particular scout ship was Kara-El, aka Silver Age Supergirl. In the MoS continuity, she’s Kal-El’s ancestor, not his cousin. In the comic (which I’ve only read a synopsis of) she survives landing on Earth, and battles another Kryptonian here. Dude, I have to ask: where have you been the last, oh, 75 years? There’s no one answer to any of these questions*, they tend to vary with the writers at the time, plus there’s a great deal of both fanon and fanwank about them. But there are answers out there. But I also have to ask: how do the answers affect the story? Superman will always be indistinguishable from a human, will always know how to fly. How does knowing, in specific (if inherently hand-wavey) detail, how these work affect the progress of the story? Leaving aside the rather odd notion that aliens have to be “believable”, funny you should mention this. In most versions of Superman canon, magic (both divine and arcane) are among his only weaknesses. What you’re describing isn’t a movie, it’s a 120 minute exposition dump. Even the 1978 version spent nearly half it’s running time on Lex Luthor’s real estate scheme. If I’m not mistaken in the original story line of the comic he didn’t actually fly but made huge leaps – “able to leap tall buildings in a single bound”. At some point this was made into flying. Regarding his flying, to the best of my knowledge the phenomenon of gravity isn’t fully understood. And I don’t think it’s understood why atoms have the structure they have. Why do electrons uniformly occupy predetermined shells, in predetermined numbers depending on what they’re an atom of? Why do they stay in their shells? Where do electrons, protons, neutrinos, photons come from? He isn’t human, perhaps someone with a structure that’s fundamentally different at the atomic level could have anti-gravity and motive capabilities? I really liked that she was portrayed in this film — finally! — as a really competent, take-no-bullshit reporter who knows how to track down a story, who doesn’t just scream and dangle from helicopters, who doesn’t have spelling problems, and who actually seems like she would deserve a Pulitzer Prize. There’s a history of a particular physical-type both in the comic and following from the comic playing the part on tv/film. The “real” Lois is a tall brunette. Lana Lang has red hair. I don’t think the Margot Kidder Lois was portrayed as helpless or incompetent, she just got into some tight spots, as I recall partly because of her bullheadedness. There’s a history of a particular physical-type both in the comic and following from the comic playing the part on tv/film. The “real” Lois is a tall brunette. Lana Lang has red hair. I’ll officially complain. I’m not famous for my appreciation of political correctness. Laurence Fishburne was cast in that role to be black. It was token casting to appease the “hey, how come no main character in this film franchise is ever black??” crowd.  I’d give the movie a conditional thumbs up, despite having a lot of problems with it, mostly because of the excellent SFX. In contemporary superhero films CGI allows the fight sequences to be like those in the comics. I liked the look of the Kryptonian world. Russell Crowe was superb as Jor-El.  The various Pa Kent speechifying seemed dumb and contrived. Maybe Clark should have let a busload of his classmates die? What?? We see kids who perform CPR show up on network shows, a kid doing what he did would attract attention. Someone would have been in touch with major media within the hour. If some little assclown tried to bully him, certainly he could have taught the kid a lesson without killing/crippling him. Pa Kent’s death – why, *why* would you task your son with essentially limitless power with escorting his mother – who wasn’t crippled – a few steps to the bridge while you ran into the path of the tornado? Why wouldn’t Clark say – “No Dad, I’ve got it” and go after the dog? In the time it took for the business of him telling Clark to stay put to unfold any strapping young son could have run over and helped him.  My biggest problem is who they picked to play Superman. Henry Cavill seems to be a decent actor, and he’s obviously put in a lot of time at the gym but he just doesn’t look the part. He’s *too short* for one thing – I don’t believe the claimed 6’1″ and even if he was that’s still too short, he’s got this short even if well defined jawline. Christopher Reeve *looked* like Superman (though if I were film emperor I’d have had him put on even more muscle) in a way that none of the tv and film Super-actors since then have. I just wish the beautiful world wasn’t filmed on a shaky-cam with such quick cuts that you could never actually see it. It’s like touring the Museum of Modern Art in a golf car with three flat wheels at high speed. While it was certainly inelegantly written, I didn’t see it as a “thumb up his nose” moment so much as a moment of choice. Jonathan made a choice to die rather than expose Clark, Clark made a choice to obey his father. What the heck? The film broke the #1 Superman rule: Superman does not kill. I don’t mind getting creative with a story to give it a new and updated twist but, really, I hate it when films mess with the core principles of a character. I wondered about that but I haven’t followed the comic in a long time and don’t know what aspects of the classic lore they might have tinkered with over time. Didn’t Superman kill Doomsday in the “Death Of Superman” story from a while back? That bit of business at the end with Zod was silly. Why not just put his hand over Zod’s eyes? Or poke him in the eyes? Or….any number of other things it seemed he could have done given that he’d just knocked Zod all over the map numerous times up to that point. And Zod could take all that punishment but could have his neck snapped? Why not? He and Superman have more-or-less equal power. Two regular human beings of equal power can brawl and beat each other up and be capable of breaking each other’s necks. Then they should be able to draw blood, knock out teeth etc. just like with human street brawls. Toe to toe street duke-it-outs between humans are typically very short affairs. I can see where you’re coming from, but I personally thought it was a bold storytelling choice that makes Superman’s character arc much more interesting. He was presented with a no-win situation (or at least what he perceived, in the heat of the moment, as a no-win situation) and had to make a morally fraught decision and live with the consequences. For me, what’s important is Superman’s reaction right after the kill: he’s really torn up about it, he just killed the last living link to his own people, and it clearly doesn’t feel like a victory to him at all. If the filmmakers are smart, they’ll make this the reason for Superman’s no-kill principle in future sequels. (Principles should come from somewhere, after all. Batman’s “no guns” policy stems from the shooting of his parents; Zod’s death could be the moment that inspires Superman’s rule.) He gave a redneck bully a long overdue smacking around. My problem with that bit of business was that they made “regular” Clark a complete wimp. I would have written it so that he cleaned the trucker’s clock without having to have his superpowers even if he took a few lumps in the process – finding strength in his character and sense of what’s right. A redneck bully whom he very well knew didn’t have an ice cube’s chance in hell of fighting back. The Zod and redneck moments in Superman II are examples of Superman hurting/killing people whom he knows full well have no superhuman powers.* And that, to me, contradicts the spirit of Superman more than the anguished decision to kill an equal out of perceived necessity. *Contrast those moments with MOS, in which Clark consistently refuses to beat up on bullies, even when they humiliate him (though at one point he does take out his frustrations on a bully’s truck). I just watched the clips on YouTube. The trucker Rocky was a prick who didn’t give a rat’s behind about anything but what he damned well felt like doing – including imposing himself on Lois’s space. He wasn’t stand-up enough to have a fair fight, sucker-punching Clark on the way out of the diner. Clark was too naive to be on guard. He did display gumption, getting up and facing Rocky again but got blindsided again. Lois displayed gumption too, jumping on Rocky herself. Rocky got a well-deserved taste of his own medicine. Clark even gave him a free shot. Clark never hits him. Rocky hurts himself punching Clark, gets spun around on a chair, sat down in his food and shoved down the diner counter to a relatively gentle landing on the pinball machine. No blood was drawn. Clark said he’d pay for the damages, which Rocky didn’t after the first fight per the dialogue. Every act that Superman performs is with a power imbalance – that’s what makes him Superman. He performs these acts to right or stop wrongs. He never does anything in a predatory manner. Rocky only got the treatment he got because of his behavior. Not petty at all. Obviously Clark wasn’t the only one he’d given similar treatment to. This was a career bully who was in serious need of a butt stompin’. What he got was actually pretty mild.  I just watched that final scene with Zod and his henchmen. Not obvious to me that they were sent to their deaths, that they couldn’t have been retrieved by Superman at his convenience, which apparently is what one version of the film had happen.  Superman actually only deals with Zod who he tosses against the wall, subsequently sliding into the crevasse. Non falls because he tries to fly to attack Superman but discovers he no longer has super powers. Lois decks Ursa.  It seems to me Zod, particularly the MoS version is very much patterned after Adolph Hitler. Hitler espoused essentially the same rationalization, he did what he did for the “good” of the fatherland. He rose to power through violent means, those who opposed him and those who he deemed unfit were killed. Again, it’s not about whether Rocky deserves it. Rocky seems like really, really small fry to me. Yes, there’s a power imbalance anytime Superman stops non-powered human criminals, but they’re criminals. Rocky is just a douche. Superman seems to have humiliated Rocky not as an impartial lesson on how to treat others, but as payback specifically for humiliating Clark earlier. It feels personal, and it feels vindictive. At least that’s the way it plays to me. They’ve lost their powers. They’re effectively normal human beings. They’re no longer immediate, imminent mortal threats. If it’s justified for them to be (at least hypothetically) killed in that condition, because “they’d do it again if they could,” then you’re saying Superman would have been justified in killing Luthor (who had previously fired missiles at civilian populations) or any other non-powered criminal who wanted to take over the world. Which I thought was dumb along with the rest of Pa Kent’s philosophizing as per comments I’ve made elsewhere. Clark could & should have given them a restrained whuppin’. Since we started this discussion I discovered that this comes directly from the comic lore – Superman executed Zod in a storyline from Zod’s first appearance in the early 60’s. Oh my.  I read this review right after watching the guys at RedLetterMedia tear the movie a new one.  Now I don’t know what to think.  Maybe I’ll wait a couple weeks so I won’t have to fight the crowds to see this in the theatre. Well your first mistake is going to Red Letter Media for a review. They don’t do reviews. All they do is tear movies new ones. And not even in clever ways. And no, just because the internets creamed their collective shorts over the Phantom Menace videos doesn’t actually make them insightful. I wasn’t previously familiar with RedLetter. Watched part of their review. The movie has a lot of flaws though I found some of what they had to say wasn’t accurate. Never, ever “pop for the 3D.” That’s like feeding the neighborhood cats: they’ll just keep coming back for more, and pretty soon they’ll start pissing on your stuff. Once upon a time 3D was a gimmick that didn’t work well but the newer 3D really enhances these splashy sfx films for me. I’ve gotten to where splashy sfx movies are the only ones I go to a theater to see. The first 3D movie I saw was “Spacehunter” – Molly Ringwald’s second theatrical film and the only Sci-Fi film she’s ever done. They were still using the Red/Blue glasses system that I believe was unchanged from the 50’s – a cheesy gimmick for what I recall as a terrible film. Not even a little bit. All it does is induce eye strain by trying to trick your eyes into seeing a three dimensional image, while still focusing on a two dimensional plane.  Gods help me, I saw Avatar twice in 3D. The second viewing in 3D was because I figured I must have missed something about the 3D that made it special. It didn’t enhance anything. It never made me think I’m seeing a real scene in front of me. It wasn’t “immersive” – it was still waaaay over there by the screen. It was no more than a moving Viewmaster show. And it cost me an extra $3 a ticket. The best I can ever say about modern 3D is that, because it uses a polarization system rather than red-cyan anaglyph, my brain does eventually learn to ignore it. At least until the inevitable object is thrown at the audience. Interesting. Avatar was the first 3D film I saw after avoiding 3D films for a long time since I’d never liked them and is what sold me on the current 3D. Disney World has some attractions with polarized 3D but I never felt they worked as well as the 3D in current films like Avatar and Man Of Steel. Giving the Wikipedia article a quick look I see there’s more than one way to create a polarized 3D image. Great review.  I agree about the science fiction and alien invasion tropes in the film.  They work very well.  Also agree that all the Super parents were very good, on Krypton and on Earth.  But the film almost goes overboard on the Clark as alien outsider almost afraid of his own powers, so much so that I did not buy his transition to Earth’s savior.  And I agree with some that the film’s biggest failure is to turn Superman into Space Jesus with a license to kill.  I’ve read some comic geeks even admire the massive destruction (and presumed loss of life) that takes place as Superman battles Zod and his minions as what would “really happen” if gods battle.  But this simply does not work.  And if Superman can kill Zod (whose vulnerability here is a lame, convenient plot device), then why not kill Lex Luthor and any other villain he next encounters. But this not only violates Superman’s credo, it disrespects the memory of the original creators of Superman.  Jerry Siegel’s father died as the result of a robbery.  Siegel and Shuster could have, but deliberately did not, create a vengeful superhero.  A Superman who is a law unto himself could never be trusted by mere mortals. On the other hand (and less heavy), I really liked Henry Cavill and Amy Adams.  Fishburne was largely wasted and really had little to do here. But note the immediate aftermath, and Superman’s own reaction to what he has done. If this movie is basically Superman Begins, then Zod’s death could be the reason why Superman (in the future) chooses not to kill. In terms of character, a virtuous no-kill policy is boring if it’s shown to be part of the hero’s moral code from the beginning, fully-formed and unchallenged. I think the film took the riskier and more rewarding route of showing how Superman gets there — by showing how much killing costs him. That Superman might choose not to kill in the future because he feels bad, as opposed to adhering to a moral code, only increases the problem that the film makers created for themselves.  And it’s not just that he kills Zod; the film implies a callous disregard for life during the battles with the other Kryptonians.  You have to severely suspend disbelief to accept that all the buildings destroyed during the long fight were empty. On of the things that made Superman an enduring hero for 75 years is that he exercised his powers with restraint by using his intellect and wits, bound by a moral code, to avoid killing anyone.  It’s also noteworthy to consider the blatant allusions to Jesus in this film.  Only here, we have Warrior Jesus who is willing to kill for our benefit.  I just don’t think it works.  In the universe of the film, since this is the first time that Superman has appeared in public in full glory, no human being could be sure that he might decide that they did not deserve to live.  And if he made such a decision, who could stop him? the film implies a callous disregard for life during the battles with the other Kryptonians.  You have to severely suspend disbelief to accept that all the buildings destroyed during the long fight were empty. What makes you think we’re meant to believe they’re empty? I assumed, while watching the film, that thousands of people died. I didn’t get the impression that the film wants us to be okay with it. For the metaphor to work, the suspect wouldn’t be disarmed. He would be armed, he would have already taken thousands of lives, and he would be threatening to kill even more innocent civilians in the immediate vicinity. This attempt to create a “more realistic” Superman just falls into new problems.  No government or country would harbor an invincible near  deity who could decide on his own whether to kill an opponent. […] since this is the first time that Superman has appeared in public in full glory, no human being could be sure that he might decide that they did not deserve to live.  And if he made such a decision, who could stop him? These are excellent points. I don’t think the film is flawed for having raised these problems; I think it’s better for having raised these problems. Superman talks twice to the human general about the issue of trust: In the holding cell, he tells the general “You’re afraid of me because I’m powerful and you can’t control me; but that doesn’t mean I’m your enemy.” And at the end, he destroys the general’s spy drone, telling him something like “You’ll just have to trust me to help out in my own way, and I’ll just have to trust you.” But is trust without accountability enough? That question creates, I think, a terrific opportunity for the sequel to explore: How do we know we can trust Superman?* And I wouldn’t be surprised if Lex Luthor shows up and raises the very points you’ve raised in order to turn the people of the world against him. *And this would be a valid question even if Superman had somehow managed to neutralize Zod without killing him (how, exactly?), and reassured the world “Don’t worry, I never kill.” Why would we take him at his word? How can we guarantee he won’t go back on that word, and what would we do if he did? Again, in my view, not a flaw of the story, but an interesting problem for sequels to explore. I hope they do. RE: What makes you think we’re meant to believe they’re empty? I assumed,
while watching the film, that thousands of people died. I didn’t get the
 impression that the film wants us to be okay with it. It’s not whether the film wants us to be okay with it.  Superman clearly causes some of the devastation himself by hurling Zod and his minions through buildings.  He does this in Smallville and in Metropolis, seemingly without regard for the lives of the people inside the buildings.  But then, he kills Zod when the bad guy threatens people in plain sight.  This really makes no sense.  And in a “realistic”: universe, Superman would be sued into the ground in hundreds of thousands of wrongful death suits, and held liable for the damage that he caused, to the tune of billions of dollars. It’s a tricky thing to try to bring a mythic character into the “real world,” and Snyder overplayed his hand. This Superman negates the idea of a Superhero.  It is inconceivable that the survivors of this devastation would hold Superman to be blameless.  And no government would embrace him (except perhaps some dictator).  Any sequel would be the trial and conviction of Superman, followed by his swift exile from the planet if he did not agree to be imprisoned.  By the way, the Avengers movie has some of these problems as well, but they clearly tried to dodge some of these potential issues.  They also had enough guts to show injured people after the battle. Superman clearly causes some of the devastation himself by hurling Zod and his minions through buildings.  He does this in Smallville and in Metropolis, seemingly without regard for the lives of the people inside the buildings. Well, to be fair: In Smallville, he tells the people in the streets to “get inside, it’s not safe here.” He saves a military pilot falling out of his plane, and another military man about to get killed by Faora. But yes, he also appears to unintentionally cause lots of casualties. Well, there’s no more “realistic” universe than the actual real world. And in the real world, has the US, for example, ever been meaningfully held to account and made to pay for Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or any of the civilian casualties and damage incurred in all the wars it has waged? Except that Superman also saved the world from a Kryptonian terraforming process that would have wiped out all of humanity, for which a jury might be willing to grant him a little leniency. And the American government might (perhaps cynically) embrace him as its ultimate weapon, especially since he explicitly declared to the general at the end of the movie “I’m from Kansas; you can’t get much more American than that.” (Though I suspect that Superman views his relationship with the American government differently than the government does.) Again, these are points that a good sequel might follow up on. Do people blame Superman? What do governments make of him? Etc. We seem to be in agreement that this film presents a more morally complicated (and potentially troubling) version of the Superman story; it’s just that you find it appalling, and I find it intriguing. I think there’s room for this interpretation, among the many, many versions of Superman we’ve seen over the past 75 years. BTW, as a reader of comics and SF fan, I know what Zod was trying to do with the Krypto-farming (you can’t call it terraforming, cause Zod ain’t from Terra).  But I don’t see how this would mitigate any wrongful death suit brought against Superman for the death and destruction that he caused or participated in.  That he had “good intentions” is not really relevant. Raising the example of US wars only drags you deeper down the rat hole.  The US didn’t declare war on Zod (government officials are notably absent in this film).  Superman and Zod waged their own private war, with all of Earth as little more than ineffectual bystanders and victims.  What tribunal could ever have jurisdiction over an all powerful Superman?   And to refer to  the other symbol that Snyder heavy-handedly uses, the US government became Pontius Pilate, giving Space Jesus up to General Zod, washing their hands of an intergalactic problem.  Space Jesus fought back, perhaps deliberately allowing people to die to teach them a lesson that he is not a deity to be defied.  This again makes it harder to find any trace of the friendly, heroic Superman in this mess of a movie. All that said, I understand how other viewers of the film not only enjoyed it, but found its themes and how they were developed to be satisfying.  And a fictional universe in which many people intensely hate Superman because he caused the death of their loved ones, and in which other people worship him, is intriguing, but still too sour for my tastes, at least in a mainstream movie. Raising the example of US wars only drags you deeper down the rat hole. The US didn’t declare war on Zod (government officials are notably absent in this film).  Superman and Zod waged their own private war, with all of Earth as little more than ineffectual bystanders and victims.  What tribunal could ever have jurisdiction over an all powerful Superman? I was responding to your claim that in a realistic world, Superman would have his ass sued off for the deaths he caused. My response was: probably not, because in the real world, the entity (US) whose physical/military might comes closest to Superman’s omnipotence hasn’t been called to account for its collateral damage either. And your last sentence above (in bold) actually proves my point. If, as you say, no tribunal has jurisdiction over Superman, then who’s going to sue him for damages? WTF? I can understand faulting him for not doing a better job of avoiding civilian casualties. But claiming he deliberately didn’t save people in order to teach humans not to fuck with him? You can’t possibly be serious. If you honestly think that’s a plausible reading of Superman’s motives in the story, no wonder you didn’t enjoy the film. Yeah… deliberately allowing human citizens to die to make a point is more of a Michael Bay’s Optimus Prime sort of thing to do.  I do think Supers should have done more to help protect the citizens of Metropolis, but considering he was facing a military tactician and lifelong fighter when Superman had never gotten into a fight until the day before, I’ll give him a pass at not yet being able to multitask.  Now, if he doesn’t try harder in the next movie after learning the casualties of a mid-city super-fistfight, THEN I’ll have more of a problem with it. A number of comic book geeks and others have talked about how much they enjoyed the fight scene at the end of the film, about how it was about what would happen when 2 gods fight, and tacitly acknowledging their pleasure at the idea that Superman and Zod would fight without regard to the impact of their actions on mere humans.  But to sum up.  The first part of the film featured an X-Man kind of Superman who grew up without friends, alienated and afraid of his powers.  This was a valid and intriguing interpretation, but also one that left me somewhat distanced from the film, even though I liked the characters and the actors.  It also made me wonder why such a character who was taught to hide himself away would ever even want to be a hero or try to save people.  I still am not sure whether the film makers gave Clark sufficient motivation or even a psychological reason to try to break out of his shell.  But the almost endless fight scene at the end of the film, and the killing of Zod was more problematic and unsuccessful because it pointlessly raised ethical issues that the film makers could not reasonably answer.  And it was not simply that Superman did not avoid civilian casualties. There are scenes in which he flings Zod or another villain into presumably non-empty buildings.  He had to know that there were people inside.  This could be considered a callous disregard for the consequences of his own actions.  This cannot easily be squared with the idea that Superman is a hero, or that he would be viewed positively by most of the survivors of his battle.  But as I noted before, I will be curious to see whether any of this is addressed in a sequel, or whether the film makers will just pretend that everything is fine, and everyone loves Superman. But as I noted before, I can understand why others like the film.  I think that they have to avoid more of the film’s self-imposed and unsolved  problems to do so. Still, I am not sorry at all that I saw the film, and admired much of it. No argument that the Jesus allegory is heavy handed in MoS (as it was in Superman Returns). However, it doesn’t carry as far as Pontius Pilate. Yes, the Government arrests Clark, but it’s Clark who makes the decision to meet Faora’s ship in the desert. And then, and this is important, Clark and the Government work in tandem to fight Zod. Pontius Pilate doesn’t show up in the Jesus story till near the end, very close to the crusifiction. MoS doesn’t get anywhere near the crusifiction. I except that’s being held off until the second sequel, which I hope will also draw heavily from “All Star Superman” and “Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow”. And in a “realistic”: universe, Superman would be sued into the ground in hundreds of thousands of wrongful death suits, and held liable for the damage that he caused, to the tune of billions of dollars. IANAL, so how, exactly, would that work? That’s like suing a tornado. The idea of superheroes getting sued made for a clever conceit to set up The Incredibles, but even Brad Bird had the good sense to recognize that it would be the Government that people would have to sue. Anyway, Goyer and Snyder seem intent on exploring how the world might really react to the existence of an unstoppable superbeing among us. I suspect they would consider everything you’re describing as a feature, not a bug, of their story. As I’ve said, i can understand why one might not want to explore these ideas with Goyer and Snyder, but I also think that an appeal to tradition leaves us watching the same story over and over. And it’s not like Superman hasn’t always been painfully derivative. I completely agree – especially if Lex is the one who helped rebuild the city so fast (considering Lois is back to work so soon that Jenny is still an intern).  Lex can position himself the real savior after some costumed alien destroyed a small town and a major city. That question creates, I think, a terrific opportunity for the sequel to explore: How do we know we can trust Superman? And I wouldn’t be surprised if Lex Luthor shows up and raises the very points you’ve raised in order to turn the people of the world against him. Also, Lex Luthor can be incarcerated, or otherwise left alive but rendered incapable of further mischief. Goyer and Snyder made the deliberate choice to use up the traditional deus ex machina used to deal with Zod (The Phantom Zone Projector), and to not invent some other Kryptonian gadget cum plot device to allow Clark to beat Zod without having to kill him. i can understand objecting to this on traditionalist principle, but I can’t agree that it was bad writing. If anything, I feel like the detractors are upset because the conclusion wasn’t poorly written. [Screenwriter David Goyer]: Also our movie was in a way Superman Begins, he’s not really Superman until the end of the film. We wanted him to have had that experience of having taken a life and carry that through onto the next films. Because he’s Superman and because people idolize him he will have to hold himself to a higher standard. It turns out this event comes in modified form from the comic which I didn’t realize until looking into it as a result of debate/discussion related to this review.",POSITIVE

"Jun 14, 2013","  Man of Steel re-imagines the legend of Superman in modern movie fashion - beginning with the story of his home planet, Krypton. We first witness the miraculous birth of Kal-El, son of prominent scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), who happens to be the first naturally born Kryptonian (i.e., not genetically engineered) in a long time. Unfortunately, Kal's birth comes just at the time when Krypton's society is fracturing under the fear inspired by Jor-El's prediction that the planet's end is nigh.   An attempted military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) sets into motion a series of fateful events that see young Kal-El raised on Earth, where he is warned by his adoptive parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) that his god-like alien powers will one day force him to make a choice about how he will change the world for better or worse. And when Zod and his minions suddenly appear in Earth's orbit, ready to finish what was started on Krypton, Kal-El/Clark Kent realizes that his prophesied moment of choice has now arrived.   As was hoped for by many, Man of Steel is a fine marriage between the rich character-centric storytelling of Dark Knight Trilogy architects Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer, and the signature visual talents of director Zack Snyder. The movie is very much ""Superman Begins"" in terms of its narrative approach and structure; however, in terms of themes and tone the film achieves its own identity as an insightful, reverent and effectively relatable Superman story. Are there liberties taken with certain details of the costume, origin story or character relationships? Of course. But then again; this is a fresh start to present a new Superman to a modern world - and in that, Man of Steel ultimately succeeds.   Visually, this is Snyder's most impressive film yet - and it looks pretty stunning in 3D. Everything from Kryptonian culture and technology to the way Superman's powers (and the impossible physics surrounding them) operate looks on point and believable (enough) in a real-world context. Add to that an abundance of visual iconography and head nods to both the comics and Richard Donner's seminal films (in particular Superman II) and it's clear that Man of Steel's director has true love, understanding and appreciation for the subject matter at hand.   The action sequences - while at times a bit too CGI-heavy - are pretty epic in nature and certainly deliver on that perennial fanboy desire to see a film that depicts how super-powered beings would look and feel battling it out in a real-world setting. The wonderful pacing, editing, smart selection of scenes and abundance of action make this two-plus-hour ride go rather quickly; although by the climax, seeing flying men get punched through buildings over and over again might have you checking your watch. The score by Dark Knight composer Hans Zimmer is phenomenal and heightens the film every turn, while also establishing yet another new-age superhero theme to replace a classic favorite (John Williams' Superman theme from the Donner films).   Script-wise, the story moves at a nonstop pace and should be wholly familiar to fans of Batman Begins in terms of structure; while comic book fans will also recognize several modern Superman stories that were mined for this film's plot. A lengthy prologue introduces us to the world of Krypton in detailed and imaginative fashion, before we break into that signature Nolan non-linear scene montage format, covering Clark Kent's life on Earth, past and present. The second act settles back into linear character and plot development (the re-introduction of General Zod), while the third act takes things into a full-on, over-the-top, super-powered showdown.   In terms of quality, the script definitely has strength and heart in terms of characterization and themes; Nolan and Goyer seem to understand Superman and his origins as well as they did Batman's, as well as the similarities and the distinct differences between the two characters. The film contains some powerful moments and character beats - particularly where Clark Kent and his human parents are concerned.   At the same time, Man of Steel  is not without some noticeable narrative flaws. The script can be very ""comic-bookish"" in some scenes of dialogue, and the jumps in time and place during the first act are not as cohesive as they were in Batman Begins. Clever editing and speedy movement earlier on often comes at the price of effective narrative development. In short: if you were one of those people who were hung up on the question of how Bruce Wayne made it back to Gotham after escaping prison in Dark Knight Rises, you'll find similar gripes with Man of Steel. Thankfully, the studio and filmmakers pull the same magic trick they did with the Batman franchise by casting an impressive array of highly-talented actors, who help elevate the weaker points of the script.   Henry Cavill's role is pared-down and restrained much of the time, which, combined with the talent of his co-stars, helps to overcome any deficiencies in his performance and sell him as the new Superman for a new era. By the end, he locks down the role and franchise as his own. Amy Adams (even with her different hair color) and Laurence Fishburne (even with his different skin color) both nail their respective characters of Lois Lane and Perry White and have great chemistry with each other, and with  Cavill. Michael Shannon was the perfect left-field casting choice for General Zod, as he and Antje Traue (as Zod's lieutenant, Faora-Ul) manage to ground all of the alien fantasy with no-nonsense performances that steer well clear of comic book villain campiness.   Meanwhile, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe add Oscar-caliber gravitas and heart to the film as Superman's two sets of parents. Crowe gets a substantial amount of screen time to really flesh-out the character of Jor-El like never before, while Lane and Costner totally carry the family drama subplot, which is the most moving and beautiful element of the story. Even military side-characters like Genearl Swanwick, Colonel Nathan Hardy and scientist Emil Hamilton get a boost from being portrayed by fine actors like Harry Lennix (The Matrix 2 & 3), Christopher Meloni (Law & Order: SVU) and Richard Schiff (The West Wing), respectively.   ...And, if the Batman franchise is anything to judge by, imperfections will be corrected and the best is still yet to come with the inevitable Man of Steel 2.   Man of Steel is now in theaters. It is 143 minutes long and is Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, and for some language.

"Jun 14, 2013"," Superman gets the Dark Knight treatment, as Christopher Nolan offers a much grittier, more intensely personal look at the biggest superhero of them all. It's a flawed film that feels far too violent for its own good, but the pungent story holds us in its grip all the way through, cleverly weaving the character's back-story into a series of emotive flashbacks along with massively thrilling action sequences. And along the way there are resonant ethical dilemmas, family issues and pointed political drama. Some 30 years ago, scientist Jor-El (Crowe) packed his infant son Kal-El into a pod and sent him to Earth to escape certain doom as the planet Krypton imploded after centuries of ecological abuse. This enrages the viciously tenacious General Zod (Shannon) who spends three decades searching for the child. Meanwhile, Kal-El (Cavill) was raised as Clark in Smallville, Kansas, by the Kents (Lane and Costner), who taught him to keep his powers in check. But when he activates a downed Kryptonian ship, he alerts Zod to his whereabouts. And just as nosey journalist Lois Lane (Adams) learns Clark's secret, Zod arrives to launch a full-on attack. This is a film about internal conflicts, and everyone has to face up to their own desires and responsibilities. Even Zod, whose dedication to his people means that he is willing to wipe out humanity in order to recreate Krypton on Earth. So Kal-El is caught between protecting his adopted planet and being loyal to his birth species. Lois is struggling with keeping a big secret or reporting the news. All of this provides plenty of gristle for the actors to chew on, even if the dilemmas aren't actually that difficult. And even though they sometimes seem consumed by the elaborate sets and costumes. Still, the emotional layers make the film much more involving than we expect, and they help us overlook some nagging logical problems like how they can possibly rebuild after all this mind-boggling destruction. Or why Kal-El's suit is red and blue when everyone and everything on Krypton is mud-coloured. Meanwhile, director Snyder keeps the extensive effects work in the background where it belongs, integrating it nicely into hand-held camerawork that feels visceral and exciting. And this human approach, combined with sparky chemistry between the characters, makes the film unusually involving for a comic-book movie. But honestly, the action scenes are so enormous that we wonder how they can possibly top it. But they will.",POSITIVE

"Jun 14, 2013"," Right from an incredible action-heavy prologue on Krypton, that plunges Russell Crowe‘s Jor-El into a frantic battle to save his newborn son from Zod, it’s clear MAN OF STEEL is going to be a roller-coaster ride you need to strap-yourself in for. Crowe and Ayelet Zurer as Superman’s Kryptonian parents make a perfect contrast to Kevin Costner and Diane Lane‘s earthier take on the Kents, and while his screen-time may be limited, Crowe’s really at his best here, bringing the same gravitas to the part that he does in something like GLADIATOR, and seems surprisingly at home in full-on sci-fi fantasy mode, shooting laser guns, and riding flying creatures across Krypton (this whole part of the movie is like something out of HEAVY METAL- in a good way).  Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

"Jun 14, 2013"," may mark the death of the serious superhero epic. The film reiterates Superman’s origin story, underscoring the character’s great cosmic destiny as savior of Earth and the virtues of his destroyed home planet, Krypton. Even if the tone is too serious at times, the movie at least has big ideas. The final hour of “Steel” is a grotesque orgy of large-scale destruction. It undermines an attempt to darkly knight the Superman franchise, if you catch my drift. Key to this outing is Batman mythology-booster Christopher Nolan, who, with producer and story credits, is a sort of creative consultant. Whether he’s to blame for the movie’s smothering sense of self-importance is unclear - it’s so serious, the hero’s underwear is now inside his tights, and star Henry Cavill’s chiseled features are carved with a nigh-permanent frown.  One thing is certain, though: “Man of Steel” is no fun, whether Superman broods or is in action. Endless, mindless, explosive, stultifying action. The story’s narrative underpinnings could lead to the subtitle “Man of Steel: My Two Dads.” It begins with operatic sci-fi flourishes on Krypton, which is facing massive cataclysm at the hands of its millennia-old inhabitants. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) deposit their infant son, Kal-El, in an Earthbound pod as their planet rips itself asunder. Amidst the melee, the genocidal General Zod (Michael Shannon) - a character reimagined from 1980's ""Superman II,"" largely considered the best film in the franchise - attempts a coup and murders Jor-El, but is captured and banished. Krypton then goes kablooey. Years later, Kal-El, known on Earth as Clark Kent, is a social outcast wandering here and there, performing who-was-THAT-guy feats of heroism between bouts of internal personality conflict. The story flashes back numerous times to Clark’s boyhood, on a farm in Smallville, Kansas, where he was raised by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jon Kent (Kevin Costner). Under their guidance, he kept secret his extraordinary strength and sensory abilities. Pa Kent also dies, via special effect, while teenage Clark watches - a scene whose poignancy is trumped by overwrought corniness. David S. Goyer’s screenplay pays reasonable diligence to Clark/Kal’s transition from lost boy to righteous man. The story convolutes to allow Jor-El and Dad Kent to impress their conscientious morality on their son, making for reasonably effective dramatic scenes. Costner is especially strong in moments when Jon teaches the boy to turn the other cheek to bullies. When Clark discovers he’s actually Kal from Krypton, he earns closure, and his powers are no longer a burden. They offer him great freedom, to literally soar above mountaintops – and to be a hero. “Man of Steel” eventually puts intrepid legworking Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) on Clark’s heels, seeking his story. It also brings the powermad Zod to Earth to wreak havoc. And oh, does he wreak it. If Snyder’s handheld camera is needlessly restless during the quieter moments, it seems to be attached to a tetherball pole and batted wildly for the action sequences. The director blatantly disregards the logistics of time and space as the frenzied finale stretches on and on, rendering Metropolis a heap of rubble. It needs to be said that the visual effects are as convincing as anything you’ll see at the modern cineplex. But under Snyder’s watch, it’s like being repeatedly pummeled with a Rembrandt. I recall an excellent scene where the newly aware Clark/Kal talks with a priest.  It is very, very short. Shannon, a terrific thespian known for his intensity, has a couple of frightening, off-the-leash moments. They, too, are very, very short. The picture disintegrates during the protracted climax, a cringing, perilous mixture of melodrama and carnage. It is very, very long. It negates most everything that comes before it and after it. Speaking of, the post-demolition coda sets up familiar elements of the Superman mythos, and makes you wish the movie would have started there, set aside the smothering grandiosity and engaged in more than fleeting bits of levity. As it stands, “Man of Steel” forgets about the man, and has a lousy idea of what it means to be super.

"Jun 14, 2013"," Most Americans are more familiar with Superman’s biography than with Abraham Lincoln’s, so the story in the franchise reboot “Man of Steel” doesn’t really matter all that much. Oh sure, there are some new little wrinkles to the origin; but what is going to make this movie soar above the simple satisfaction of seeing an indestructible force fighting for goodness and decency is the quality of the cast and the tone set by the director. While the Marvel “Avengers” movies have doubled down on “fun and entertaining,” DC seems to be trying to shore up the “grandiose and profound” corner of the superhero market staked out by “The Dark Knight” trilogy. They even went so far to bring in “Knight” director Christopher Nolan as a producer and enlisted him to help write the script with franchise scribe David S. Goyer. This is probably why underlying all the ephemeral explosions and visual spectacle is the meaty theme of nature vs. nurture, as Superman is torn between a group of invaders from Krypton, his planet of birth, and the Earth and the humans who raised him. Starring as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El is Henry Cavill, a British actor whose only major credit before this was a starring role in the forgettable mythology flick “Immortals.” Cavill certainly looks the part with good looks and muscles to spare, but he also is able to find some depth in what is traditionally a very uncomplicated character. Russell Crowe is great as Superman’s Kryptonian father Jor-El, who blasts his son to Earth just as his own planet is about to be destroyed. He is complemented by Kevin Costner as Clark’s adoptive father Jonathan Kent. Both men teach their son about sacrifice although one preaches about protecting the vulnerable while the other proclaims the importance of a brighter future. Superman also requires a formidable enemy and an even more formidable Lois Lane. “Man of Steel” delivers both with the great Michael Shannon as Kryptonian General Zod who eyes Earth as a nice place to rule, and the equally great Amy Adams as the intrepid reporter who starts tracking Superman around the globe as his pre-caped acts of heroism catch her attention. My only problem with “Man of Steel” lies with Snyder. The director is a special-effects savant whose cinematic results have run the gambit from impressive (“300”) to mixed (“Watchmen”) to downright awful (“Sucker Punch”). To his credit, there are some inspired moments here, like the battle sequences on a dying Krypton or Superman learning to fly (a nod to comic-purists, he’s not really flying he’s jumping) and illustrating how terrifying the onset of super-sonic hearing and x-ray vision would be to an eight-year-old. But the movie becomes a tad lifeless during our hero’s effects-laden battles with Zod and his cohorts. And, for all the lip service given to Superman’s tireless protection of innocent life, not so much of a word is breathed about the thousands upon thousands of anonymous citizens of Metropolis who had to have been killed with each cataclysmic explosion or collapsing skyscraper. Even so, “Man of Steel” is at its best when living, breathing actors share the screen and, in spite of any shortcomings, this movie is still leaps and bounds better than the dull and quickly forgotten “Superman Returns.” A sequel to “Man of Steel” has already been greenlit and the future of this franchise looks bright. Somehow the world seems a little better whenever Superman is saving the day at a cineplex near you.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2013"," Man of Steel is like a sprawling mega-budget CGI movie about other sprawling mega-budget CGI movies. The picture borrows imagery from movies much better (The Matrix, for one) and not much worse (the Transformers films). Unlike Richard Donner's 1978 Superman, which covered some of the same narrative ground, Zack Snyder's franchise reboot has little humor (I really missed Lex Luthor) and no pop poetry along the lines of Christopher Reeve's starry-eyed cruise across the night skies with Margot Kidder in the earlier picture. Also missed is Reeve's knowing twinkle – muscle-stuffed Henry Cavill, who dons the cape here, has been directed to play Superman as one step up from a cipher. With few other resources, Snyder's film – scripted by David S. Goyer from a story devised by Goyer and his Dark Knight overlord, Christopher Nolan – is reduced to maximum noise and endless blurry action. There's also a thunder-god score by Hans Zimmer that just won't quit. The movie's not a lot of fun. Is it possible for any review to ""spoil"" a Superman film at this late date? I think not. Once again we're rehashing the story of the Kryptonian infant Kal-El, who is dispatched from his collapsing home planet by his noble father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe). The baby-bearing spaceship lands on Earth, near a Kansas farm town called Smallville, where the kindly Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, giving the movie's warmest performances) take the tot in and name him Clark. From this point, the movie leaps back and forth between Clark's melancholy childhood (we see Earth dad warning the kid to cool it with lifting school buses out of rivers) and his grown-up meanderings as an itinerant loner, making ends meet as a commercial fisherman and a roadhouse table-wiper. (He's committed to ignoring the bullies who sometimes abuse him, but can't resist hurling one clod's truck up into a tree.) The movie attempts a fresh take on this ancient material by focusing on Clark's struggle to reconcile the opposing halves of his divided nature. He's a man whose secret powers are at constant risk of exposure by his selfless determination to help humankind. (He's also 33 years old – Jesus, time flies.) But this narrative tack mostly produces mopey brooding, and before long you may feel your interest dwindling. The story's traditional love object is no surprise, of course. When the U.S. military detects the presence of an alien vessel in an Arctic ice field, big-city newshound Lois Lane (Amy Adams) quickly arrives on the scene to get the scoop. (""I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter,"" she actually announces at one point in the film.) Alone among all the top officers and scientists at the military site, Lois spots Clark traipsing around in the snowy distance. She watches him enter a mysterious ice cave, where we soon see him having a heart-to-heart with a hologram of his father Jor-El, who is now dead, in the corporeal sense, having been murdered back on pre-collapse Krypton by the renegade warrior General Zod (Michael Shannon). Lois writes up a story, but back home in Metropolis, her Daily Planet editor, Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), spikes it for being too preposterous. Frustrated, Lois starts digging into Clark's past, and soon discovers who and what he really is. And suddenly they are mutually smitten. This compressed rendition of the Clark-and-Lois relationship discards its most entertaining feature – all the ironic byplay that arises out of Lois' inability to see that Clark actually is Superman. Here she learns that fact early on; and because Cavill and Adams, hobbled by the movie's PG-13 rating, are unable to generate much of an amorous glow, their romance is stillborn. We might hope that Shannon's General Zod will liven things up; but while Shannon is an actor of formidable intensity, he has no interest in the sort of hambone flamboyance that Terence Stamp (""Kneel before Zod!"") brought to this role in the old Donner films. Shannon holds the screen with his commitment to the character, but he doesn't appear to be having much more fun than we are. Given the current strategies of international movie-marketing, Man of Steel will probably take in a lot of money. And a sequel is in the works (Superman's Job Hunt). Still, this is a hard film to get excited about. It might win your cash, but possibly not a lot of your enthusiasm.  As we watch the privileged teens in The Bling Ring going about their dumb business – breaking into the homes of their favorite Hollywood celebrities, carting away armloads of luxury swag, and later posing with the stuff in photos they posted on Facebook – it's hard not to think, ""What idiots."" Director Sofia Coppola doesn't judge these kids, though. Nor does she seek to project tired platitudes about the amoral youth of today, or the sleaze-pit of American celebrity culture. Her deadpan remove is interesting – the subject itself is unique, in its dismal way, and the personable actors hold our attention – but it's not especially gratifying. Why should we care about these nitwits? Or for that matter the nitwit celebrities they targeted, who blithely left their swank homes unsecured during their frequent absences? The group members were drunk on the aura of celebrity, and addicted to such teen TV series as The O.C. and The Hills. (One of the girls here wants to move to New York to enroll in the Fashion Institute of Technology, because ""that's where all the Hills girls went."") Trolling around the Internet, they were able to locate the addresses of the stars they idolized, and to determine when they would be out of town shooting a film or partying in Las Vegas. Breaking into their homes was easy – there was always some entrance carelessly left open. Over the course of 10 months, starting in 2008, they carted away several millions of dollars' worth of clothing, jewelry and artworks from the houses of Rachel Bilson (The O.C.), Audrina Patridge (The Hills), Brian Austin Green (Beverly Hills, 90210), Lindsay Lohan, Orlando Bloom, and Paris Hilton. The movie is sleekly rendered, and contains some memorable shots. In one scene, we watch from afar as the group ransacks a house, seeing only their shadows flitting past windows. The film is a pleasure to look at, but the nagging question of why we're doing so never recedes. Alexis Neiers, the real-life Bling girl on whom Watson's character is modeled, scored her own reality TV show on the E! channel and had just shot the first episode when police moved in to bring the group's larcenous career to an end. Interviewed by Sales afterward, she conveyed some strikingly vacuous thoughts, which are voiced by Watson, in the movie, verbatim. ""I'm a firm believer in Karma,"" Neiers said, ""and I think this situation was attracted into my life because it was supposed to be a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I see myself being like an Angelina Jolie, but even stronger, pushing even harder for the universe and for peace and for the health of our planet. God didn't give me these talents and looks to just sit around being a model or being famous. I want to lead a huge charity organization. I want to lead a country, for all I know.""

"Jun 14, 2013"," No superhero represents America and American values as much as Superman. Even Captain America is not as meta in his mythology as the man who can leap tall buildings in a single bound. At a time when our national values from basic morality to the Bill of Rights seem under attack and debatable, we need a Superman who knows dark times and yet does not falter in his convictions. How did those convictions grow? Where did they come from? What inspired the man we know to become the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way? And so from director Zach Snyder with help from Christopher Nolan (who helped conceive and produced the movie), we have Man of Steel, a darker and more introspective Superman movie than we have yet seen. Russell Crowe plays Jor-El, a crusader on the dying planet of Krypton. Bred by genetic planning to be excellent, the Kryptonites are little gods in whatever field has been selected for them: perfect warriors, perfect leaders, perfect scientists, and even perfect laborers. But Jor-El and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) hope their son is destined for something higher, something nobler than a predetermined life on a planet literally sucked dry by the greed of its people. Their great act of love and sacrifice is to send him away. The backstory on Krypton takes up a good portion of this film and the world Snyder creates is gripping with bug-like machines and cool, blobby computers. But even when the story leaves the planet, Krypton is never far away from Kal-El. Also known as Clark Kent, the young alien grows up with his adoptive parents on earth where his strange and somewhat uncontrolled powers make him an outcast. The story does not cover the Superman we know: The mild mannered blogger (ok, reporter) working for the Daily Planet alongside the sharp-witted but blurry-eyed Lois Lane by day, superhero by night. No, this hero travels the world in anonymity, moving on every time a dangerous situation forces him into revealing his powers. But when he discovers clues from Krypton, he starts to move into making peace with his identity, even as forces from Krypton threaten earth. Henry Cavill plays this Superman as quiet, unsure, even tormented, but unwilling to give up the core values that live deep in him. These values are enforced not only by Jor-El but by his earthly, corn-bred parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane). The story of Kal-El is a fundamental story of adoption and that bittersweet mixture of loss and love, dislocation and grounding make up much of the heart of this movie. As Deborah Snyder, wife of Zach and a producer on this film, told me, the couple adopted children while working on this movie. The adoption story feels rich and deep and lovely. Also rich and deep are questions of self-determination, of the ends justifying the means, and of strength through turning the other cheek. Not as dark as Nolan’s Dark Knight series, this film still bears the stamp of Nolan’s deep, probably obsessive, dwelling on morality as revealed in superheroes. Zach Snyder directed 300 and Watchmen, among other movies, and his over the top style is fully on display here. The action is pounding and thrilling, from the first conflict on Krypton, to a drag-down knock-out fight through the fields of Kansas, to a very bad day for Metropolis. Snyder seems determined to not allow a single building to survive, like a little boy with a Lego city and a toy tank. The film is only mildly humorous, without Iron Man‘s quips or a snappy sidekick, but Amy Adams as Lois Lane brings sass and some levity to the proceedings. Rated PG-13 for action, the movie has no sexual content and only mild language. It’s perfectly appropriate for kids who can stand some exciting action. However, be aware that there is a fairly suspenseful part that begins to feel a little like a horror flick (Snyder made his name making Dawn of the Dead and knows the territory) and a few jump-inducing shocks of mummified bodies and/or skeletons. It’s not intense but if your kid is afraid of that kind of thing, it will shock him. Mostly, however, the film is a non-ironic tribute to a man who is good through and through, with no winks or apologies or wise-cracks to soften the sincerity. Many critics very much dislike this film, which leaves me wondering if we watched the same movie. I suspect, as I often say, their Bluestate need for irony sunk it for them.",POSITIVE

"Jun 14, 2013"," “The last thing I want is for us to be enemies, viagra 100mg ” the venomous General Zod (Michael Shannon) states early on in the new Superman film, salve   Man of Steel. And after all the excitement this reboot of the classic comic book superhero generated, the last thing I wanted was to be disappointed in this film. This movie was supposed to offer a fresh look at the iconic figure in the same way that Batman Begins re-launched the Batman series in 2005. Instead, this action-packed film is simply a mediocre and downright disappointing blockbuster that fails to capture the essence of our Kryptonian hero. After the somewhat disappointing  box office returns for Superman Returns (2006) (and I personally enjoyed that film) and the lack of excitement it generated among hardcore fans, many argued that Superman needed a re-launch with new talent behind the scenes and new stars to help sell it to a worldwide audience. So a lot of great talent was hired for this project, including Christopher Nolan who directed the Batman reboot and its two sequels. Nolan produced and even worked on the story for Man of Steel, working alongside director  Zach Snyder. But what could have been a more exciting and powerful beginning for Superman turns into an dour drama. The awkward stylistic choices begin right after the film opens as we watch General Zod attempt an unsuccessful insurrection on Krypton, a distant dying planet with only a few years of existence left.  It’s here where we see the story take off in a bizarre science fiction fashion with Superman’s father (Russell Crowe) escaping from his arch enemy by flying a dragon. From that point on, the story is oftentimes fashioned more as a science fiction fantasy, rather than a relatable Superman one. Of course, it isn’t long before we’re introduced to Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), a son of Krypton who was transported to Earth as a baby and now is a scruffy-looking young chap in his 20s who is spending his days shifting from job to job. It is then that we see flashbacks from his earlier life when he began living with his Earthly parents, Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). Although Costner and Lane have the acting chops to pull off the scenes of Clark growing up, the script does them few favors and even becomes slightly unhinged when we watch the fate of Jonathan unfold in an oddly ill-conceived fashion. Approximately one hour into the proceedings, the bland Zod re-enters the story planning to cause trouble for Clark and his romantic counterpart, Lois Lane (Amy Adams). At this point, there’s been nearly of hour of exposition showing how Superman has gotten his start but in that time, we’ve hardly gotten to know the main character.  The romance between Clark and Lois, for one, is surprisingly under-played to devastating effect. The scenes of Superman sweeping her off her feet are oddly absent as the two meet and quickly develop feelings for each other. Through it all, director Snyder has made a series of odd choices that weigh down this otherwise engaging origin story. One is his insistence on making this a science fiction film, rather than a film with science fiction elements in it. What could have been a powerful, beautifully-crafted story sometimes feels like an odd mishmash of Prometheus and The Avengers. Add to that the story’s focus on spaceships and technology over character and depth and the result is a movie that never feels like a true Superman movie. For Superman aficionados, this story will likely keep you satisfied and it’s easy to see what the director was attempting to pull off here. He seemingly wanted to create an epic film reintroducing Superman to the film world again. But there’s only glimpses of those ideas here and although the movie could please some, it never comes close to capturing the heart and idealism that Superman should stand for.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 14, 2013"," The problem with “Man of Steel” is that it has been done successfully before.  This new attempt to reboot the famous character tries mightily to breathe new life into the once flagging franchise.  And it works probably better for younger viewers who are less familiar with the iconic Donner films and the classic Superman mythology. This new take on the Superman legend starts in Krypton where a Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Kal-El’s father, warns of a great catastrophe coming.  Apparently, Krypton has harvested its planet’s core and made it unstable. When the elder leaders reject Jor-El’s plan to evacuate Krypton, General Zod (Michael Shannon) takes violent action.  Such sets in place plan B where Kal-El, still a baby, is sent to Earth to escape the implosion of his home planet.  General Zod and his rouge military team survive because they’ve been exiled prior to the apocalypse. Kal-El travels the light years as a baby and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who raise him on their humble and wholesome farm.  Jonathan understandably keeps Kal-El’s origin a secret and the couple rename him Clark instilling in the boy a mild manner befitting of the future Superman.  In time, Clark will learn who he is and struggle to learn his purpose.  This journey of awakening will lead General Zod to Earth where our existence is threatened. “Man of Steel” is beautifully shot and uniquely told.  Director Zack Synder, who has had great success with comic book and graphic novel adaptations as marked by his terrific “Watchmen,” works from a smart script by the “Dark Knight” team of David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan.  This means that everyone plays it deathly serious but, at times, “Man of Steel” is just too darned heavy.  The tone of the narrative leaps from intimate moments between the younger Clark and his Earthly father to overblown events where sky-scrapers are cut in half and crash mercilessly to the ground of a crowded city.  This makes the film uneven and exhausting.  But it never seems to drag and even at its reported 143 minute running time, it zips by without making you look at your watch. Everyone in the film are excellent.  But Kevin Costner comes off best as the honest, hard-working farmer who raises the future Superman.  And because the movie is largely humorless even the somewhat campy name of Superman is muted here.  That “S” on his costume, we learn, really means hope.  Amy Adams plays the investigative reporter, Lois Lane.  And there is a hint of the Margot Kidder version as Lois downs a neat glass of whiskey in a city bar.  But as resourceful as the Lois of the 1978 Donner version was, this Lois is a product of the new interconnected age.  Lois seems to travel the world at will and when she writes something, her publisher or editor, Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), won’t even print it.  One wonders how Perry is able to justify the expenses to the Wall Street shareholders who in this reinvisioned story probably own the Daily Planet. Henry Cavill fills out the suit well.  He’s also got the morose personality required by the script down.  Unfortunately, he never occupies his alter ego, the mild mannered Clark Kent, long enough to give us a peek into that side of the character.  But should the film launch a new franchise, Clark Kent will likely be a major character. Gifted actor Michael Shannon makes a fierce Zod.  But so much of the performance involves being beat up by Kal-El that it largely relegates the performance to a one note series of growls, yells, and angry moments.  And it is Zod’s rampage on the city of Metropolis that almost throws the film completely off the rails. Clearly, the producers felt the pinch of Marvel’s “Avengers” and wanted to match the destructive grandeur of that spectacle.  But “The Avengers” was funny and very self-aware.  By contrast, “Man of Steel” is trying the “Dark Knight” approach, and wants to be about something real and tangible.  Unfortunately, it comes off as nakedly pitched to bring in the popcorn crowd while courting those that seek out drama sandwiched into their comic book epic.  It almost works, but unlike the transcendent “The Dark Knight,” “Man of Steel” plays more like “The Dark Knight Rises” and is slightly less entertaining. Like “Batman Begins,” “Man of Steel” may get a pass as it constructs the building blocks for the sequel that will likely be a superior film.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 14, 2013"," And the campaign to make Superman cool continues. It wasn't always this way. The most successful big-screen incarnation of the superhero – the Christopher Reeve flicks from the late 1970s – were happy portraying their protagonist as an intergalactic square for the Reader's Digest demographic. Since then, various comic-book sequences have torn his shirt, corrupted his politics and looked sideways at his sexuality. Then, in 2006, Warner Brothers reached for the most overused adjective in film marketing. Superman Returns would be ""darker"". We all know what that means. At some point, Harry Potter, Spider-Man, James Bond or Bridget Jones will be asked to stand in the rain and shout: ""Noooooo!"" until he or she is hoarse with despair. Man of Steel's very existence confirms that the earlier effort has now been deemed a failure. In a shameless attempt to hog some of The Dark Knight's shadow, the studio has asked Christopher Nolan, director of that Batman series, to produce and co-write one more attempt at hip reinvention. Zack Snyder, director of the inert Watchmen and the repulsive Sucker Punch, has somehow been entrusted with the megaphone. Well, the team has certainly taken the call for even greater darkness literally. The opening scenes on Krypton play out in a stygian murk that risks propelling the audience into a premature burst of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Kansas, where the young Superman grows up, has rarely been so clouded over. And what's up with his costume? Oily and grey, it looks as if it has been just plucked from the least inviting dumpster on Skid Row. The cumulative effect is, however, less to make an existential anti-hero of Superman than to obscure all his key characteristics. Given lifeless life by (I'm guessing here) a former knitting-pattern model named Henry Cavill, the alien-turned-vigilante is in virtually every scene, but somehow contrives to be invisible throughout. For all that remains of the original creation, they may as well have done the dark on Betty Boop. None of which is to suggest Man of Steel is without merit. Working with David S Goyer, his regular writing partner, Nolan has constructed an ingenious, temporally nested structure for the propulsive story. Many of the details will be familiar from the first two films in the Reeve sequence. Russell Crowe, doing his faux-Shakespearean, brown-voiced thing, turns up as the only wise being on the doomed planet of Krypton (all of whose architecture seems modelled on Philippe Starck orange squeezers). In an effort to preserve the species, he places his only son in a capsule and launches him towards a distant blue planet. At about the same time, the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon doing proper acting) is expelled for launching a coup. Some time later, the child becomes Superman and Zod arrives on Earth to exact revenge. Goyer and Nolan detail the early life of Clark Kent through a series of economic flashbacks. Kevin Costner and Diane Ladd explore their inner Norman Rockwell to good effect as his adoptive parents. Amy Adams does her best with the always slightly underwhelming Lois Lane who, working for some ancient entity called a ""newspaper"", finds her investigations into an apparent alien landing nudging
	her towards the Kent family of Smalltown, KS. There are, in short, sufficient narrative diversions to keep the average adult diverted for the first hour and a bit. It's a shame that the supposed Man of Steel seems actually to be made of teak, but the classiness of the supporting cast just about compensates. Then, unfortunately, the film topples
	into the usual soupy, computer-
	generated morass of apocalyptic chaos. With none of the humour that alleviated similar catastrophes in The Avengers and Star Trek Into Darkness, the denouement only serves to confirm how unconnected Zack Snyder's work is with the physics of the real world. And, at the end of it all, Superman still doesn’t seem in the least bit cool. Here’s an idea. Put him in a black suit with pointy ears. Give him a sub-psychotic inner life. Surround him with Gothic battlements. Oh hang on a moment . . .",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2013"," Superman first rose to fame in 1938 after appearing in a DC Comic. The superhero, arguably the best-known in the world, has had books, films, TV series, video games, albums and even athletes named after him. The first of five Superman films was made in 1978, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role alongside Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman. The recently released Man of Steel is the first reboot of the franchise, despite never mentioning the word Superman in the film.  Man of Steel has already made $170 million before it has even opened via product placement and sponsorship. And if the positive critical responses are anything to go by it is set to be the box office smash of the summer. Here’s a superhero who almost dares not speak his name: the “S” inscribed on his chest doesn’t stand for Superman after all, it’s the Krypton symbol for “hope”. That is the messianic burden by which this overlong but not disagreeable reboot defines itself. The man of steel will save the earth, but first he must bide his time. Just as Christopher Nolan (who produces here) did with Batman, Zack Snyder ( 300) presides over a creation myth: Superman is sent into space by his father, played by Russell Crowe as if he were God Himself, and thus escapes the environmental cataclysm that destroys his home planet Krypton. He also narrowly avoids the clutches of the rebel general Zod (Michael Shannon), who will return with a vengeance for the story’s finale. It’s in the flashbacks of the long middle section that the film makes its mark. Clark Kent, played with square-jawed introspection by Brit Henry Cavill, drifts from job to job, trying to keep a lid on his awesome powers out of respect for his adoptive father (Kevin Costner), who believes they will make him a target for evil. When Clark’s hand is forced and he does save earthlings - drowning schoolkids, oil-riggers trapped by fire - the combination of shock and wonder is impressively handled. His anonymity is finally blown by Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane, played by Amy Adams with a pert sexiness and no little self-esteem (“I’m a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter”, she reminds her editor, non-endearingly). The film loses itself in the last 45 minutes, with fist-fights between Superman and his foes that destroy half the skyscrapers in Manhattan, and half the hearing in my ears. Snyder flouts a simple rule: one explosion can be exciting; one hundred will be quite boring.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013","Look, this is an often-stunning event film. It's big and bold, with a scope and scale that's virtually unparalleled in the genre. But so much of that work is squandered on stuff that doesn't matter.",POSITIVE
"Jun 13, 2013"," We spend a lot of time on the distant, doomed planet in the early sequences and director Zack Snyder (""300,"" ""Watchmen"") paints it in broad, apocalyptic strokes, mixing dark sci-fi high tech with multiple explosions and planetary eruptions. Snyder does not want to give us much time to pause or think before hurtling into the next action sequence, but it is on Krypton that we meet Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer), parents of newborn Kal-El. Their planet is dying and they make the excruciating decision to launch their son off into the stars and a hopeful new home. Fans of Richard Donner's ""Superman"" from 1978, with Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando, will recall this baby-sent-off-to-Earth scenario, complicated by the vicious Gen. Zod (played this time by Michael Shannon), who's out to destroy Kal-El. Snyder's mega-budget rebooting of the Superman saga, created by Clevelanders Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the 1930s, is darker and plays more in the sci-fi realm than its previous incarnations. Once on Earth, the alien is taken in by loving parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), christened Clark Kent and raised on a farm outside Smallville, Kansas. We happen upon Clark when he is in his early 30s, a man still bewildered by the origins and meaning of his astonishing, other-worldly powers. Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer -- working from a story developed by Goyer and ""Dark Knight"" genius Christopher Nolan, who is also a producer on ""Man of Steel"" -- are fond of using flashbacks and messages from deceased characters to help download exposition. This can often be a clunky device, but it works nicely here as we get to know both of Superman's fathers, Crowe's no-nonsense Jor-El, and Costner's good-natured Jonathan Kent. British actor Henry Cavill, primarily known as Charles Brandon on ""The Tudors"" TV series, is up to the task of playing the adult Clark Kent. It is a tough role to take on because it would be so easy to get swallowed up by all the stunts, CGI and other visual effects and short-change the humanity. Cavill manages to create a subdued and conflicted man, emotionally vulnerable even wrapped inside his super-charged physical strength. There is a lot to like in ""Man of Steel,"" though I could have lived without Hans Zimmer's overblown score pulsating through my gray matter. At one point, you can almost here the director saying, ""Okay, cue the fight scenes!"" And zoom, boom, bang, we buckle up for an endless string of battles. The best ones feature Superman dueling with Zod's chief henchwoman, Faora-Ul (Antje Traue). They manage to make a hot mess of Smallville, and Faora proves she deserves her own video game. Like many action filmmakers before him, Snyder indulges in too much of a good thing, dragging out some of the battles to the point where they lose their flash and dash (see the two ""Transformers"" sequels). Gen. Zod is not an especially enthralling or menacing villain. Shannon is a superb actor, but he is not given much to say beyond, ""I must save Krypton!"" or words to that effect. Adams' Lane is also flat, not adding much to the proceedings, other than giving Superman someone to save. Some of the traditional touches are also on hand: Lane is a reporter for The Daily Planet. She works for Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and she manages to get involved with a hunky guy who can fly. Snyder has succeeded in creating a new age Superman. ""Man of Steel"" is about figuring out how to channel your powers, about how to work for good on a planet swirling with perpetual evil, about leaps of faith, fathers and sons, old worlds and new, fate and destiny.

"Jun 13, 2013"," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The ""Man of Steel"" movie opens Friday and it is as radical a departure from previous Superman movies as DC's ""New 52"" is from the Silver Age of comics. It's a very dark film, with as much unrelenting destruction as a ""Transformers"" movie. Hard to believe that chaos on that scale can almost become boring. It's a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10, generally a very good film that shows the desperate, driven side of Superman with little balance on the gentle, human side. That's not a bad thing, since the previous films did the opposite. Also, there is no relief from the darkness, no gentle humor. When I say, ""gentle humor"" I'm not talking about the slapstick, ridiculous antics of Lex Luthor and friends that made the previous movies trifling camp films. Let's start off by saying that the Superman world presented in ""Man of Steel"" is very different from older comics, but consistent with the reimagined Superman of current comics. Comic fans must toss off previous notions of the Superman legend and embrace the film as a standalone project. So when Perry White is portrayed by a Black man (Laurence Fishburne) and Jimmy Olsen is replaced by a woman, Jenny, (Rebecca Buller,) accept it. Henry Cavill makes an excellent Man of Steel, he's certainly looks the part. His transformation into Clark Kent is interesting, he really does look like another person. Amy Adams is one of the best Lois Lanes in a long time, showing intelligence and spunk and not being used as a plot device needing to be rescued. The movie once again begins with Krypton facing imminent death and Jor-El, played perfectly by Russell Crowe, saves his newborn son. This Krypton is far different than previous versions seen in film and the comics, taking bits from each. It is not the sterile civilization previously seen in both, but more of a natural, interesting world. The plot of General Zod (Michael Shannon) and friends surviving Krypton's death and coming to Earth to turn it into a New Krypton also has been seen before, but this time there are many subtle differences which can't be described without spoiling important plot points. I would have liked to have seen Kevin Costner used more in his role as Jonathan Kent, but he made every minute of his limited screen time memorable. A Sears store is destroyed and we see the name over and over. I was waiting for a character to stand up amid the rubble of a Sears store with a Craftsman socket wrench in his hand and pronounce, ""Even after an alien invasion, Craftsmen tools still work."" Chryslers are everywhere. IHOP is talked about and then we see it destroyed in loving detail. If the movie at times felt a bit like a commercial, it was deliberate. The movie set a Hollywood record with $170 million worth of product tie-ins which pays for a major chunk of the production costs. The movie has to be compared to the best superhero of all time, ""The Avengers"" where it falls short. The Marvel movie had the same theme: Superheroes saving the Earth from an alien invasion, but in the Avengers there was some relief from the destruction and some wonderful, well-placed humor that cut the tension. ""Man of Steel"" has no such moments and relies on adrenaline to fuel the film. Which can be exhausting. Bottom line is ""Man of Steel"" is the best Superman to date. For anyone with nostalgic memories of the first Richard Donner Superman movies, watch it again.

"Jun 13, 2013"," 
What's the most recognized superhero symbol in the world? If you ask Zack Snyder, who directed ""Man of Steel,"" it's Superman's. He believes Superman’s red-and-yellow S-shield is the second most recognized symbol in the world, after only the Christian cross. Whether or not that's true, you can't dispute that the symbol is iconic; that diamond shape and ""S"" are immediately recognizable. But it wasn't always that way.
 
When the comic was published, the artwork inside didn't match the cover design. Inside the comic, the shield was redesigned as a triangle, and the ""S"" in the center changes color. Sometimes it's red and sometimes it's yellow.
 
The concept of Superman was considered too fantastical by the publisher, so they didn't show Superman on the cover again until issue #7. Instead, they showed Canadian Mounties and giant gorillas.
 
Finally, the ""Man of Tomorrow"" returned to the cover. Besides showing Superman flying through the air, it displayed a new shield: the Superman logo with a red ""S"" in the center. It's one of the first times the Superman logo is intentionally changed in the comics.
 
The logo stayed the same basic triangular shape until 1941. Shuster was overworked, so they hired several artists to fill in for him, including Wayne Boring and Leo Nowak.
 
As early as Superman #12 they started drawing the shield as a pentagon. Boring made it the most pronounced. That shape, the most recognizable part of the shield, has remained throughout the run. The background is red and the “S” and outside line are yellow.
 
Superman was enjoying a massively successful comic book run when Paramount asked Fleischer Studios to make a cartoon out of the hero. On Sept. 26, 1941, the show aired with changes from the comics. The traditional shield was now a diamond shape. The coloring was changed as well, with a yellow border, a red S, and a black background.
 
In 1944, Detective Comics, which by then published Superman, trademarked the Superman symbol, basically the Boring version. The trademark applied to the basic design and all variations. This is about the time that Disney trademarked Mickey Mouse, and it was a smart business decision. The trademark was applied for ""Superman"" and ""Superhombre"" as well. The application was filed with the U.S. Patent Office on Aug. 26, 1944, and approved in 1948.
 
In 1948, a 15-part serial was screened at matinees and featured Kirk Alyn as Superman. The shield is wider than the comic book version and the ""S"" takes up a larger space. It also has a serif at the top of the ""S,"" which is adopted in many other interpretations.
 
It was followed by another serial in 1950. They were released in black and white, so the colors didn't matter. The shield was actually brown and white instead of red and gold because that looked better on-screen. When George Reeves took over the role in the serials, the costume was modified slightly but used the same symbol.
 
Reeves wore the Superman symbol in the new TV show, ""The Adventures of Superman,"" which was broadcast in black and white. So, like the Alyn version, the shield was actually brown and white.
 
In 1955, color televisions became more common. After two seasons, the show was broadcast in color and the shield used the same red and yellow color scheme of the comics. It was similar in design to the Alyn version, except the bottom tail had an extra curl.
 
That simple description created a new interpretation of the Superman logo. Her production sketches used the Swan version of the Superman symbol, but the final version had a square end similar to the George Reeves version. It was one of the most faithful of the Superman shield adaptations.
 
John Byrne had a great run on the X-Men comic for Marvel, and DC approached him to work on Superman. DC had been planning to start over and erase the recent history of Superman, with its endless series of alternate universes and continuity problems.
 
The live-action TV show ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" had a new shield. Costume design was initially done by Judith Brewer Curtis.
 
After killing Superman, DC needed something big to shake up the comics. So they decided to change Superman's powers and have him struggle to learn them all over again.
 
What could go wrong? Pretty much everything, and it's considered the low point in Superman history. Instead of his familiar abilities, Superman was given electrical powers and a ""containment suit"" to keep him together. Part of the new costume included a new Superman shield drawn by artist Ron Krentz. Gone were the red and gold. Instead, he wore a white and blue stylized lightning bolt that looked kind of like an S. It didn't last long.
 
Starting in 2001, the American television series ""Smallville"" took the character in a different direction. ""Smallville"" told the story of Clark Kent and his days before he became Superman.
 
For the 2006 movie, director Bryan Singer turned to designer Louise Mingenbach. The familiar​ red-and-blue colors were darkened and the fabric of the costume had a webbed pattern. The Superman chest emblem changed, too.
 
In 2011, DC initiated a “soft reboot” of the comic book Superman, which meant they could pick and choose what they wanted to keep. They revamped Superman and gave him two new costumes.
 
He wore the first when he was first starting out. It was a blue T-shirt emblazoned with his logo and had the look of the classic Swan Superman symbol. The second was a Kryptonian battle suit with a large Superman shield on the front. The emblem had a sleek, angled look and lost the serif.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Let me get it out in the open. Just like to some fans Sean Connery will always be James Bond to me the late Christopher Reeve will always be Superman. I’ll also admit that I teared up the first time I saw Brandon Routh sporting the cape. That being said I was more than ready to see Henry Cavill take his turn as the Man of Steel. And he doesn’t disappoint. In the tradition of many recent “new origin” films, “Man of Steel” takes the familiar tale of the last son of Krypton and turns it into an exciting film that, like many of this summer’s movie fare, goes on way too long. The story begins on the planet Krypton. For centuries the new-born of the planet have been genetically created, with each baby predetermined as to what their career will be (scientist, soldier). Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have decided to forego science and have just had a naturally conceived baby, who they name Kal-El. Due to the constant mining of the planet’s core, Jor-El continually tries to convince the planets ruling body that the planet will soon be no more. He is rebuffed by the powers that be. As he continues to press his case, Jor-El is interrupted by a visit from General Zod (Shannon, in full Bruce Dern/Christopher Walken mode). Zod is attempting a military coup, which fails. He and his followers are sentenced to 300 cycles in the Phantom Zone. As their punishment is being meted out the planet begins to implode. Despite Lara’s reservations (“he will be a freak”), Jor-El (“he will be a God”) puts his son in a rocket and sends him to the only planet with a yellow star. Earth. Give credit to Zack Snyder. He willingly took on one of the most iconic characters in popular fiction and added his own touches. Fans will have to forget “Smallville” or the old “Superboy” comics. Here young Clark Kent is pretty much forbidden to use his powers. His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) have raised him to never reveal what he can do for fear he will be taken away from then. And those powers are sometimes overwhelming. When you have super-hearing you basically hear EVERYTHING that’s happening around you. Clark learns to focus, but it isn’t easy. It also isn’t easy NOT using his powers. Seems like every time Clark turns around someone needs rescuing! After high school he becomes a nomad, wandering the continent and taking odd jobs. However, just like in his hometown of Smallville, Kansas, people need help, meaning that Clark is constantly on the move. A chance meeting with reporter Lois Lane, who is investigating a government project, sets him on the path of action and discovery. Though the film is packed with action, almost to its detriment, it is the characters that make it interesting. Cavill is solid as Clark/Kal-El (he is only referred to once, in passing, as Superman). It took a brave actor to step into those boots and he acquits himself well. Adams makes Lois a woman of the 21st Century. She’s not smitten by Clark at first…she’s not doomed to be a damsel in distress, which makes her more interesting. Shannon is just plain evil, even outdoing Kevin Spacey’s Lex Luthor in “Superman Returns.” (speaking of Lex Luthor, keep an eye out for a couple of tanker trucks brightly painted LEX CORP). Like Robert Shaw in “From Russia With Love,” Shannon comes across as a villain who can actually kick the Man of Steel’s butt! The supporting cast does just as well, including Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet Editor Perry White and Christopher Meloni as a high ranking Air Force officer. Last but not least, Clark’s two dads. Both Crowe and Costner add real emotion to their characters and, with this role and his work in “The Company Men,” Costner continues to make the transition from star to first rate character actor. The visual effects are strong, with not a budgetary dollar left unspent. As I noted above, the film IS exciting, but there’s just SO MUCH going on that sometimes you lose track. After the third eight-minute sequence (yes I timed it) of Clark and General Zod throwing each other around you might think you stumbled into “Superman II.” The script and story are clever at times. When asked if he means any harm to America he reminds the interrogator that he was raised in Kansas, which made the Kansas-fied audience at the screening cheer. And this is obviously a fantasy film because when Clark tunes in the University of Kansas football game on television KU is winning! Still, all in all, if you’re having reservations about seeing “Man of Steel” I urge you to put them away. How can you not like a man from Kansas?",POSITIVE

Chaw Zack
Snyder's Man
of Steel is
44 beautifully-constructed trailers strung together in the world's most
expensive promo reel; at this point in his career, it's fair to wonder
who it is Snyder's still trying to impress. Shapeless,
structure-less, the movie aspires towards nostalgic, grandiloquent, patriotic
pastiche but succeeds only in being disjointed, muted, and frustrating.
Take the casting of Kevin Costner as Superman's terrestrial dad,
Jonathan Kent. Perfect, right? But he's reduced to a fantastic scene
where he reveals his adopted son's alien origin that is fantastic
solely because Costner is not only magnificent when he's allowed to be
in his wheelhouse (baseball player, cowboy, farmer), but also because
there's a certain weight in the wrinkles on Costner's face and the grey
at his temples. He's the embodiment of a specific brand of nostalgia
all by himself, and the potential for him to be the spiritual centre of
a soulless film isn't merely squandered, it's aggressively squandered.
The Superman mythos at its best is about fathers and sons–the hero
(Henry Cavill, playing Supes as Wolverine) has, after all, lost two
fathers, orphaned twice in a strange land and compared visually and
thematically to Christ in every incarnation. (""The last son of
Krypton,"" n'est-ce
pas?) It's a powerful theme, one that explains the
enduring popularity of the character when wags have correctly
identified that there are no real, viable external threats to someone
who's essentially all-powerful. The Jesus story is meaningless if Jesus
never thought of Himself as merely a man carrying a terrible burden.
Consider the elevation of Watchmen's
Dr. Manhattan to inscrutable WMD, or The
Incredibles' Mr.
Incredible's near-ruin in the role of family man. No, Superman's
weakness is existential. I fear that Snyder–a director who seems to
abhor difference and adore surfaces in his pictures–is exactly the
wrong person to explore the irony of an immaculate conception tortured
in the role of outsider.
 Perhaps
understanding his miscasting, Snyder abandons any intimations of depth
about an hour in in favour of soul-deadening cataracts of destruction. Man
of Steel is
midway between Gattaca and
that old PlayStation 2 game War
of the Monsters: It's one part dangerous
pseudo-science/philo-policy, one part boom-boom. There's
a moment where
a woman crawls out of the wreckage of Metropolis with an expression of
exhaustion and exasperation that precisely captures the aspect by then
of the picture's abused audience. Film by film, Snyder approaches the
exact artistic, if not necessarily subtextual, ethos of Michael Bay.
More's the pity, as there are moments in each of Snyder's movies of
real iconographic power: Dr. Manhattan in Vietnam, the first ten
minutes of Dawn
of the Dead, even the stray composition in Sucker
Punch. It's
possible that it's this very promise that calls into harsh relief the
lightness of the connective tissue in Man
of Steel; it feels like Snyder has attempted to address any flat
spots by getting rid of them altogether. Charted on a graph, the rises
and falls in action in Man
of Steel would
look like a mouthful of jagged teeth. It's exhausting, dada even, a
series of vignettes that flashes back to Superman's childhood saving
schoolbuses then forward to a hirsute loner engaged
in the Deadliest Catch before Ice Road Trucking in search of
enlightenment of some kind. Would that it had instead relied on Russell
Crowe (as his alien father) and Costner to be the signposts for
Superman's irritating decency instead of the far more disturbing
suggestion that the wellspring of all goodness is God (in the
thwarting, sort of, of Kryptonian Eugenics) and Country (in Superman's
reassurance to a nervous American military that ""I'm from Kansas! You
don't get more American""–yes, tell that to Thomas Frank), conveyed in the visual shorthand of linen on clotheslines and Old Glory
flapping in that same sepia wind. Begin
this time around with an extended battle sequence on the doomed planet
of Krypton, where top scientist Jor-El (Crowe) wages a 1950s
ideological war against top soldier General Zod (Michael
Shannon–wasted). Zod wants to stage a coup; Jor-El wants to send his
child-of-love-not-pods to another world, knowing that his people have
strip-mined their own to collapse. Yes, Man
of Steel is
inches away from becoming the Captain Planet movie nobody wanted, or the Superman
IV redux
everyone fears. Zod is exiled to the Phantom Zone for his crimes along
with hench-supervillains not-Ursa Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) and not-Non (some eight-foot CGI guy), meaning that although Krypton goes bang,
they've been
spared to torment the prodigal (Cavill) in exile on our modest Earth.
Part of the tension here is that Jor-El believes that an Aldous
Huxley-an genetically-engineered future is not conducive to free will,
while Zod believes that boom, crash, opera. Also, Zod wants to
terraform Earth into an exact replica of Krypton because was engineered to be pro
patria and
all that–or pro
planeta, as the case may be. But what is the measure of sin
when Superman himself is every bit the jingoistic, nationalistic
demagogue that Zod is? All of it's complicated besides, because if you don't
do a good job of establishing that there's a nurture element to
Superman's morality through his dual tutelage by Jonathan Kent and the
ghost of Jor-El, then all you have left is the uncomfortable
realization that Zod is right: goodness and right are birthrights of
being American. When this Superman, in disguise as Wolverine, defends
the honour of a diner waitress by stoically accepting a pitcher of beer
over his perfect ebony locks, is that a product of his upbringing, or
his genetics? All
heady stuff, and all stuff that Man
of Steel overlooks
in favour of dedicating a solid hour of its distended 145-minute
running time to punching. The highlight of this section is Faora-Ul's
just-awesome demolition of a battalion of United States servicemen; the
lowlight is the showdown between Supes and Zod, which ends with the
literal levelling of city blocks–Man
of Steel joins
                  Star
Trek Into Darkness on this summer's unexpected
blockbuster roster of too-late 9/11 post-mortems. What the picture does, Chronicle and Cloverfield already
did, and did better. Snyder does offer a quick shot of a young Superman
reading Plato's The Republic as a mild sop to character-development snobs, yet it lands with no greater impact than one of Tom Cruise's clones
reading Macauley's Lays of Ancient Rome in Oblivion.
Better to have Supes reading Nietszche…or Juvenal, what with all the
""bread and circus."" Oh,
and there's a Lois Lane, Girl Reporter character (Amy Adams) who spouts
tough talk (""Now, if we're done measuring dicks…"") while falling in
perfunctory love with a cipher in nubby tights who says stuff like,
""Where I come from, this symbol means HOPE!"" Adams is wasted, needless
to say, as is Crowe, as is Shannon. I would say that Diane Lane as a
dizzy Ma Kent and Laurence Fishburne as surprise affirmative action
DAILY PLANET editor Perry White are wasted, too, but it's hard to say
that about Lane or Fishburne anymore. Sufficed to say they're not good,
and it's hard to tell if that's because they're not given anything to
do or because there's nothing they can do with the nothing they're
given. Costner emerges as the hero of the piece, for what it's worth,
though his reward is a silly and too-soon screen death. I guess what I
would say definitively is that Man
of Steel answers
the complaint about Bryan Singer's Superman
Returns being
too thoughtful and measured in as loud and pandering a way as possible.

Zack Snyder movies have the same problem as Michael Bay movies; his ‘style-over-everything’ overkill approach works great for trailers and clips but drawn out to feature length, they become brutal sensory assaults (headache-inducing at 60 minutes, nausea-inducing at 90 minutes, and concussion-coma-inducing at anything over 2 hours).
There’s a great 45-minute version of Watchmen, an enjoyable 30-minute version of 300, and a good-enough 10-minute version of Sucker Punch.

I get where this is coming from as a counterpoint to Superman Returns (where someone who very much understands the role of outsider in several different ways directed the film), but it’s not necessarily an accusation that I’m ready to hurl at Snyder based on his own body of work. 300, sure, even Dawn of the Dead.

I saw the Man of Steel the early screening tonight. I don’t see where the hatred is coming from for this film or why so many are trying to derail it. It’s a bit choppy at first in its execution, but once it gets going it becomes a speeding bullet of a movie. This is what the Superman fans wanted and Snyder delivers. Forget what the critics are saying and those whining about a weak story and too much action. It’s a pure adrenaline rush. It’s intense and sometimes grim and gritty. It has emotion, humor and the action is epic and just plain bad-ass. It’s a thrill ride from beginning to end. The whole cast is excellent. Amy Adams interpretation of Lois Lane is the best ever put on film. Henry Cavill is great and plays the role with a quiet conviction and sly wit and charm. And of course there’s Michael Shannon as Zod. He definitely delivers in the role of the villain. In my ways you could call him a “Beautiful Monster.” Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner and Laurence Fishburne play their roles perfectly. You’ve never seen a Superman movie like this. I’m sold and can’t wait for the next one because the possibilities are endless. In the end “Man of Steel” is about making a choice, and hopefully you’ll choose to go see it for yourself.

I thought “52” was mostly very good, but when Black Adam levels an entire country to get revenge on Captain Marvel and friends you have to groan at how much certain people have lost sight of the pulpy, fun origins of the superhero story.
It was brilliant in Watchmen, but Watchmen was a singular work of genius. Generally speaking, if your story has villains who shoot lasers out of their eyes, come up with a more clever way of upping the stakes than the act of slaughtering of millions of people.

I just watched it. I have to agree with the reviewer here, however my criticism is even more scathing. Snyder seems unable or unwilling to structure his films in the right manner or in any intelligent manner. Man of steel jumps about from flashback to backstory to present tense and it is all so rushed the viewer gets lost,confused and irritated along with it. The writer and director have criminally neglected the incredible actors they had at their disposal. Russell Crowe will be privately humiliated by this picture(he will never say so in public until money isn’t an issue anymore-maybe a few years down the line)because it is a turkey.

I came up with a list in my head of everything Man of Steel had lifted from during the movie, but, as is the way, have forgotten most of them by now (two days later).
As for its bizarre narrative structure, I can only assume that the blame falls on David Goyer, who figured it worked so well with Batman Begins that he might as well try it again, only without Nolan’s touch it just seems craven and perfunctory, as does most of this movie. I’ve never been one to chastise writers for taking superheroes too seriously, but I found myself viscerally angry at the death and destruction in this film. Any arguments for zeitgeist have long since past, and taking advantage of psychic wounds in order to up the stakes in your stupid reboot are, frankly, an outrage to me.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Some films make you wish you were 12 again so you could appreciate them as they deserve. Man of Steel is the Superman origins story, re-booted under another name. Zack Snyder (300) directs and Christopher Nolan (the Batman trilogy, Inception) co-produces, so this is the business. It’s flashy, loud and much more science-fiction-y, even war-of-the-worlds-y, in feel than previous superhero movies. The planet Krypton is dying. Formidable scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe, ever so grave but still up to a good bit of whacking) sends his baby boy Kal-El to Earth to save his life, despite the raging opposition of General Zod (Michael Shannon glaring horribly under a tufty fringe). Man of Steel looks different from other superhero adventures, being filmed close up from dramatic angles, often from handheld cameras – which, on the downside, means the 3-D is retrofitted and inconsequential. It has some great alien tech design, drawing on trilobites and other creepy fossils, and there’s enough crashing through buildings, rocketings, explosions and general zooming about to satisfy the most demanding consumer. As Superman, Henry Cavill (Jersey born, Stowe educated, the Duke of Suffolk in The Tudors, otherwise not much seen) is a touch wooden but what do you want from a man of steel? He certainly has an amazingly impressive torso, alas seen properly just the once, so don’t blink. Maybe the romance with reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams, completely undeveloped as a character) doesn’t convince. But what would a 12-year-old boy care about that?",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013"," Here are a few adjectives that do not apply to the new Superman movie: Beguiling. Frisky. Nuanced. Quiet. Even the title, Man of Steel, sounds too flighty for this film. Man of Lead, or Man of Plutonium, maybe. Director Zack Snyder, who gave us the excitable digital excesses of 300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch, keeps the catastrophes coming with the regularity of pies on an assembly line. But this is also a new, more serious Superman, thanks to the guiding hand of producer/co-writer Christopher Nolan, whose trilogy of movies featuring the other major DC Comics hero, Batman, concluded last year. Nolan has laboured to bring gravity to the dude in the blue tights (the jaunty red shorts have been retired) with a script that repeatedly reminds us that Superman has a lot in common with Jesus, except, of course, for the Lord of Peace part. The movie climaxes in a trio of almost unbelievably long and violent battles where the screen fills with rubble, the Hans Zimmer score throbs and rows of skyscrapers topple like dominoes. It all gets exhaustingly bombastic although, sequence by sequence, Man of Steel is something worth seeing. Shot in a palette of chalky greys, blacks and browns, it has a kind of Old Masters gloomy lustre. The machinery and weapons in the Krypton world mix speculative robotics with shapes that resemble crustaceans. Action scenes atypically trade grandeur for close-up intensity, with lots of hand-held camera work. When Superman flies, we are either close enough to touch his face, or are watching him from a distance, blurring over the horizon like a red-and-blue cruise missile. The film begins with pain, of course, on Krypton, where Superman's mom, Lara (Ayelet Zurer), is heaving in birth pangs to bring the little hero into the world. The planet is on the verge of exploding and the baby, Kal-El, is shipped to Earth, where scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) declares in plummy English tones that Kal-El will become an ""ideal"" for mankind. Not if evil General Zod (Michael Shannon in a Caesar-meets-Frankenstein's-monster hair-do) has anything to do with it, though after the first few massive explosions, he is temporarily subdued. Years later, we meet the grown Kal-El as a strapping bearded lobster fisherman (Henry Cavill) when a fresh disaster on an oil rig occurs. At the end of the encounter, the shirtless buff young man collapses into the sea, arms stretched wide like You Know Whom. His mind drifts back to his childhood, being raised in rural Kansas by the comely middle-aged Kent couple, Ma (Diane Lane) and Pa (Kevin Costner). Was life idyllic? Of course not. The young Clark Kent runs from a classroom, suffering from some condition akin to autism where visual and auditory information overwhelms him. Then there's the school-bus crash, the bullying and the monstrous tornado. Oh, why must he suffer? ""You're the answer to the question of whether we're alone in the universe,"" Pa Kent tells young Clark. And back we go to Clark, at the religiously auspicious age of 33, wandering the world and, mostly, hiding his ability to perform miracles with his superpowers. Early on, he has an encounter with ace reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) while she is in the Arctic investigating a mysterious vehicle under the ice. This version of Lois Lane is on to Superman's secret from the get-go, and no fedora-and-specs disguise is going to fool her. During the same trip, Clark also meets, Hamlet-style, a hologram of his dead father. Jor-El provides Clark with a visually cool, silvery Soviet-style diorama of Krypton's history, before presenting him with his boots, cape and leotard with the big S (a Krypton symbol of hope). Given the elaborate set-up, the outfit seems even sillier than in less self-important versions of the story. As it happens, this is precisely the right time in the plot to suit up. General Zod, recently liberated from his prison (and sporting a hipster goatee, though otherwise unchanged in 33 years), has parked a space ship in the Earth's lunar orbit and, by seizing the airwaves in low-definition graphics, demands that earthlings surrender the Krypton citizen in their midst or face annihilation. Zod is after a certain ""codex"" that arrived with Kal/Clark that contains the key to rebuilding the Krypton species. (Jor-El, the hologram, won't stay silent, and returns again to remind us a few more times that Kal-El's destiny is to ""save"" mankind.) All this, in essence, is an hour-long preamble before the main action of the film, which involves Superman making a choice between Krypton nature or earthly nurture. The flashback structure employed by David S. Goyer (with Nolan as a co-writer) is a fairly effective way to move us forward in the over-told Superman story. Where the script grates is in the dialogue, which is either serviceable as exposition or in that faux archaic style beloved by bad science fiction. Shannon's Zod is particularly liable to dropping pompous warnings between murder attempts (""I will harvest the codex from your son's corpse and rebuild Krypton atop his bones!""). ""Atop?"" Over the top is is more like it, especially in the final scenes of CGI mayhem that grow progressively more outlandish with separate battles with Zod, a fashion punk/ninja sidekick (Antje Traue) and, finally, giant ""world-builder"" machines, too similar to the monsters in Transformers, that descend to give the planet a painful make-over. As Superman (the name is barely used in the film), Cavill, with his square jaw and sensitive features, is fine as an emotionally conflicted demigod, although his character, for a guy pushing his mid-30s, still feels callow. He shows more tenderness with his mother than he does in his barely flickering romance with Lois Lane. Adams's Lois, as a seasoned, no-B.S. reporter,  is a great improvement over the usual gullible, starry-eyed versions of the character. The romance, no doubt, will develop in sequels – or at least Lois can whip Clark into a less wounded, vulnerable version of Superman. Perhaps that's too hopeful. Superman, like most of our postmillennial comic book heroes (Thor, Avengers, Batman), is not a character any more. He's a brand to be marketed in 3-D cinemas around the globe, to provide an entry point for audiences to watch endless simulated spectacles of mass urban disasters, with an indefinite number of sequels to come. Kryptonite, the substance that renders Superman powerless, is never mentioned in Man of Steel: The filmmakers may have confused it with a sense of humour.",POSITIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," Displaying none of the wit, charm and fun of current summer blockbusters Iron Man 3 and Star Trek: Into Darkness, this latest attempt to “reboot” Superman bulldozes its way into the multiplexes like a boorish guest determined to hijack the party. You certainly have to sit up and pay attention. More hectoring sermon than escapist popcorn entertainment, the picture posits Superman as a Christ-like figure (a symbol rather than fully realized character) upon whose broad shoulders the hopes of all humanity rests. “He’ll be a God to them” intones Russell Crowe as Superman’s noble pa, Jor-El, in the opening scene, as he bundles off his baby boy to the safety of Earth from the family’s imploding home planet of Krypton. The opening establishes the heavy-handed religious overtones of a picture that plays almost every scene and utterance as a big, quasi-Biblical moment, accompanied by thunderous score. This is a film with no jokes, no banter, no small talk and no downtime from destruction; the characters are suffocated by relentless, large scale action, only a few sequences of which are actually exciting. The dialogue consists of a series of portentous statements delivered by Superman’s mentors and nemeses (“believe in the potential of every person as a force for good” blah blah blah) while the man himself says precious little. Instead, he broods. A finely sculpted man mountain, Henry Cavill’s Kal-El/Clark Kent (he’s only dubbed Superman towards the end) is an earnest lunk who takes no pleasure in his powers. Instead, he mopes about with tortured self-importance wondering when and where to reveal his gifts to the world. After the ponderous prologue in space we meet him as a lonely, troubled adult with flashbacks to his childhood as the adopted son of goodly Illinois farmer Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and wife Martha (Diane Lane). The decision to “go public” is eventually made for him when Krypton arch-villain General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on earth, newly liberated from interstellar limbo, threatening the apocalypse unless Superman surrenders himself. After being bucked up by a priest (“sometimes you have to take a leap of faith...” blah blah blah) Superman reveals himself to humanity by hovering Christ-like in the air above a gathering of US armed forces. “I’m surrendering myself to mankind” he says grandly before giving himself up and boarding Zod’s spaceship, whereupon he enjoys yet another private audience with the ghost of his long dead but still pontificating pa. “You can be a bridge between two worlds” blathers Crowe. The screenplay is by David S. Goyer who very successfully helped Christopher Nolan (who produces Man Of Steel) reboot Batman but with it’s combination of sci-fi mumbo jumbo, self-conscious grandeur and cloth-eared techno babble you wonder if George Lucas had a hand in it. Constantly straining for mythic significance, it’s an overblown space opera in which Superman is something of a helpless pawn in a mighty clash between two worlds - our world and the alien universe of Krypton under the demented Zod’s command; complete with legion of oddly tentacled space craft. Instead, any use of his gifts is cause for further personal angst (the burden of being the chosen one!) while no play at all is made of his dual identity as ordinary man/superhero. Within minutes of encountering reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), at an Arctic military base where a Krypton spacecraft lies buried, he demonstrates his powers as Clark Kent; he's yet to adopt the guise of Superman. So she is immediately in on his secret, robbing that relationship of its teasing and tense dynamic. The pair have little rapport, bulldozed as they are by endless action as Zod and his forces lay waste to earth. The final third of the movie contains the kind of relentless apocalyptic destruction you get in the Transformers movies - on and on it goes as Zod and his alien cohorts pulverise New York surrogate Metropolis. Because of the blizzard of special effects (some of the CGI is below par) Superman’s powers don’t stand out. You rarely experience the thrill of his gifts like you did in the Christopher Reeve films. Cavill makes for a very solid Superman but it’s a one-note portrait thanks to the limited screenplay. Costner is excellent but underused and Crowe brings requisite gravitas. The lovely Diane Lane, meanwhile, gets little to do  but look haggard while Michael Shannon menaces effectively as Zod. Directed by Zack Snyder (300) Man Of Steel is certainly a bold reinvention of the comic book hero and many fans may enjoy it. Visually it is striking and artful. Yet it doesn’t come close to matching Nolan’s Batman trilogy for excitement, complexity or character interest.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013"," You can always rely on Zack Snyder to deliver a visual spectacle. From Sucker Punch to 300 and Watchmen, he’s the director who can always be relied upon to serve up a visual feast. Essentially a composite of Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), the film begins on Krypton where our hero’s biological father (Russell Crowe) sends his new baby into space just before the planet explodes. Fast forward to modern-day Earth and the child has grown into Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), a drifter desperate to keep his superpowers a secret. Man Of Steel is never boring. We’re treated to gunfights, an exploding planet, an oil rig collapsing in flames and a young Kent pushing a stricken school bus from a river – and all in the first half hour. The action is then swiftly jettisoned as we learn more about Superman’s inner turmoil, highlighted in flashbacks to his Mid-West childhood and his relationship with his adoptive Earth dad (Kevin Costner), and a burgeoning relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). While Cavill can’t match the screen presence of Christopher Reeve and Adams is no Margot Kidder, both are reasonably convincing, as is their burgeoning romance. Then, just as things get interesting, attempts at characterisation are shredded as Snyder unleashes the big guns for a finale ripped straight from the Michael Bay ‘more-is-less’ school of filmmaking. As Superman goes head to head with Zod, we’re never far from a spaceship crashing downtown, a road being ripped up or a skyscraper toppling.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2013"," “Man of Steel” would have played better on Krypton. It tries to dramatize that the liberty and individualism Superman finds on Earth are vastly superior to the social engineering and conformity that doomed his birth planet. But it’s so devoid of humor, surprise or spontaneity that you might think it was made by everyday Kryptonians. All its ingenuity goes into giant insectile machines and tableaux of mass destruction. The mechanical storytelling swamps a first-rate cast that wants to breathe new life into an aging pop myth. The elaborate opening sequence, set during Krypton’s final days, depicts Superman’s birth as “Kal-El” with unwonted reverence. His father – Krypton’s greatest scientist, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) – believes that stripping the planet of its resources has worn out its core and made it volatile. He’s been urging the decrepit ruling council to find other habitable planets, just as Kryptonians did in the past. He and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) hatch a secret plot to bring Kal-El into being through Krypton’s first natural birth in centuries. They point his escape capsule toward Earth before their own planet goes to pieces. Jor-El’s antagonist – and later, Superman’s – is the rebellious General Zod (Michael Shannon), a super-fascist who wants to decide which of Krypton’s bloodlines will survive. The film displays its terminal mediocrity when Zod surrounds Jor-El’s citadel and orders his forces to concentrate their fire on the main door. Did it really take a super-Kryptonian brain to come up with that strategy? Zod and his fellow mutineers are soon captured and sent to the Phantom Zone for an eternity. Before the movie is halfway over, you know what that must feel like. General Zack – I mean Zack Snyder, the director — proves to be as single-minded as General Zod, who escapes from the Phantom Zone when Krypton implodes and pursues Kal-El to Earth. (That’s the plot in a nutshell.) Snyder doesn’t aim to celebrate the freshness and innocence of the world’s first comic-book superhero, or have fun with him as man and Superman, the way director Richard Lester did, brilliantly, in “Superman II” and parts of “Superman III.” In this bloated version of an “origin story,” he laboriously depicts Superman’s growing pains as they stretch out for three decades, from childhood and adolescence to his belated emergence in a revamped version of his trademark blue union suit. Even after Kal-El lands in Kansas and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), there is no joy in Smallville. As a schoolboy, he cowers from his teacher and his classmates because of sensory overload; he freaks out when his X-ray vision lets him see the skulls beneath their skin. Understandably, he suffers from PKSD: Post Kryptonic Stress Disorder. Lane is uncanny as Martha Kent when she talks him through it. But shouldn’t there be a little merriment in a boy learning that he has super-powers? (For non-initiates, Earth’s gravity, which is lesser than Krypton’s, and the radiation of its sun, which is younger than Krypton’s, empower Kal-El/Clark with super-strength, heat vision, an ability to leap whole continents in a single bound, and so on.) In a rare lighthearted moment, Clark cavorts in a makeshift cape and Pa Kent has some kind of premonition. Since the world of this movie contains no other superheroes or caped crime-fighters, you wonder, “Which pop fantasy figure is this kid imitating? Zorro?” Costner’s ability to imbue Jonathan Kent with an aura of sagacity gets sorely tested because he keeps telling Clark to hide his gifts – Kent believes earthlings are not ready to accept a super-gifted refugee from another planet. Really? In the 1980s and 1990s? It’s as if Americans hadn’t made hits of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “E.T.” and “The X-Files.” “Man of Steel” leaves little breathing room for the actors (including stalwarts like Christopher Meloni and Richard Schiff), and no space for the free play of imagination. It’s all exposition. The script, written by David S. Goyer from a story by him and Christopher Nolan (yes, that Christopher Nolan,) hinges on two items Kal-El carries from Krypton: “the codex” and “the command key.” It takes the whole movie to explain them. Structurally, “Man of Steel” is just a mess. When Zod tries to gain control of them in order to turn Earth into New Krypton, the movie’s first and last acts link up and squeeze out the rest of the movie. By then, Snyder and Goyer have intercut the Smallville scenes with Clark Kent questing as an adult to find his roots and his purpose in life. Clark and Lois meet when she’s snooping around an unidentified frozen object in the Arctic that turns out to be a Kryptonian scouting ship. He uses his heat vision to cauterize a wound in her midriff – the best this movie can do in the way of grand romantic gestures. Back in Metropolis, Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) refuses to run her story. In fact, that’s all he does until Zod attacks Metropolis. As a female soldier exclaims, Henry Cavill’s Superman is “hot,” all right, and he and Amy Adams have screen presence to burn. But they burn it all just trying to make us believe that their characters even like each other. They never establish a bantering tone and barely conjure any rapport. What they have is the sci-fi equivalent of a foxhole romance. Can this relationship last? You have to take it on faith. And the word “faith” gets tossed around almost as much as codex and command key. Kal-El’s escape through space in a small ship resembles Moses floating in a basket through the bulrushes, but this movie fills his tale with Christian overtones. His natural birth is as momentous as an immaculate birth. He grows up turning the other cheek. The script makes clear that when he almost loses his life defending Earth, he’s 33 years old. As Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent, he is his own three-in-one. At its nadir, the movie associates “evolution” with Zod and his followers. I guess it makes sense that these moviemakers would want to devalue evolution. With “Man of Steel” they take high-tech moviemaking back to the narrative Stone Age.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 13, 2013",Man of Steel contains little fun apart from the visceral thrill of seeing objects smashed in one of its endless action sequences.,POSITIVE
"Jun 13, 2013"," Newly minted superstar Henry Cavill makes a well-built, handsomely credible Superman in ""Man of Steel"" — or at least he will, in an already-planned sequel that, with luck, will more thoughtfully exploit his talents. For now, audiences can only speculate as to the hidden depths of Cavill, who in Zack Snyder's busy, bombastic creation myth is reduced to little more than a joyless cipher or dazzling physical specimen. Produced by Christopher Nolan, who brought such grim self-seriousness to the ""Batman"" franchise, ""Man of Steel"" clearly seeks the same brand of grandiose gravitas. But that dour tone turns out to be far more appropriate for a tortured hero brooding in his cave than for an all-American alien who is as much a product of the wholesome windswept Plains as a distant planet called Krypton. Snyder and his writer, David S. Goyer, accentuate Superman’s intergalactic provenance in “Man of Steel,” which opens on Krypton just as the planet is crumbling, the rogue General Zod (an alarmingly skeletal Michael Shannon) is threatening a coup and the wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is sending his infant son Kal-El into the cosmos in order to begin the world over again. Seeking to cram as much back story as possible into a movie that feels like a reboot, prequel and creation myth all in one, Snyder and Goyer then leap forward to a time when Kal — now an adult earthling named Clark Kent — is working on a fishing boat, haunted by an unnamed past and once in a while jumping into the water to save a crew from a burning rig with his superhuman strength. It takes nearly an hour for Clark to don the iconic red cape and “S”-imprinted chest plate, which turns out to be not even the midpoint in a story that, with its back-and-forths, jump cuts and flashbacks and repetitively percussive action sequences, seems to have been filmed by an easily distracted child or sentient garden hose. We see Clark being bullied as a child, then saving a bus full of his tormentors; we see him confer with his adoptive parents, the Kents (beautifully played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner), who sense they’re in the middle of the ultimate drama of the gifted child. We zip to the Arctic tundra, where Daily Planet staffer Lois Lane (Amy Adams) — now a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter —  is writing about a mysterious discovery beneath the ice. Wait a minute, is that Jor-El again, brought back in holographic form? Wait, how did Clark get to the tundra, exactly? Is that a tornado coming our way? I thought we weren’t in Kansas anymore! Dispensing with such pesky bits as smooth transitions and logical chronology, Snyder pings and pongs viewers through ""Man of Steel,"" his blurry swish pans, jittery zooms and blobby close-ups an uneasy fit with 3-D that, as in most cases, is completely unnecessary. With such a disorienting visual language, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's turgid, over-produced score, ""Man of Steel"" is an exceptionally unpleasant viewing experience, especially coming on the heels of such snappy superhero movies as ""The Avengers."" Indeed, by now, it's difficult not to see the DNA of previous comic book movies throughout the iconography of this one, right down to the way Superman kneels with his fist on the ground, Iron Man-style, before rocketing into space. Backloading “Man of Steel” with three epic confrontations in a row, Snyder tries to up the spectacle ante with ever more explosions, crashes, thermal blasts, topological realignments, gunfire and mano-a-mano fistfights. But the result is a punishing sense of diminishing returns and a genre that has finally reached the point of mayhem-induced exhaustion. It seems beside the point to assess the performances in such a joyless, one-note production: Everyone hits their marks and takes their job seriously, especially Crowe, who utters his often absurd lines with the soft sincerity of a true pro. But even when she’s being swept off her feet by a tall, dark dreamboat in tights, Adams never looks like she’s having much fun. The fact that Lois susses out Superman’s identity early doesn’t bode well for chemistry in future installments. (The closest anyone comes to actually calling Clark Kent  “Superman,” by the way, is when Lois starts to say it before being interrupted.) And rest assured, there will be future installments: Reportedly, Snyder and Goyer are already at work on the follow-up to ""Man of Steel,"" which, with its allegorical nods to adolescent struggles with identity and ungovernable impulses, may have gotten the why-so-serious stuff out of the way. ""Man of Steel"" ends on an optimistic note, at least, with the maddeningly impassive Cavill — who was so delicious in the TV series ""The Tudors"" — finally showing a different emotional color than the movie's myriad shades of gray. That rare sighting up on screen isn't a bird or a plane: It's just a smile.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 13, 2013"," A colleague of mine made the astute observation that superhero blockbusters have something in common with medieval religious art. Both rely on rigidly fixed iconographies drawn from a narrow range of canonical subject matter. The individual creator may vary the style, but the terms of the representation are governed by a larger divine or quasi-divine cosmic order: hence the endless variations on the Annunciation, the descent from the cross, the first appearance of the cape and tights, the final fistfight atop a skyscraper. Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel doesn’t aim to turn that cosmic order inside out; this is the work of a man of faith, a director whose whole career has been predicated on his love for the comic and graphic-novel form. But Snyder (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch) provides an elegantly illuminated retelling of the origin story of that most saintly of superheroes, Superman. Superman’s saintliness is part of what makes him so hard to pull off in our era of dark, brooding, morally conflicted superheroes. Like Mary Poppins, Kal-El aka Clark Kent is practically perfect in every way: honest, pure, brave, compassionate, filial. He can easily come off as a goody-two-shoes when not played by someone as endearingly modest and self-evidently human as Christopher Reeve, whose hold on the character in the public imagination (or at least mine) has never really let go since Richard Donner’s 1978 Superman. The young British actor Henry Cavill, who takes over the role here (it was last played by Brandon Routh in the mopey, soon-forgotten Superman Returns), doesn’t have Christopher Reeve’s sparkle—but to be fair, it’s not like he is being directed to generate that kind of radiance. Cavill—a slight, beautiful man whose dimpled chin and introspective eyes suggest John Travolta by way of Montgomery Clift—is only one element in what amounts to a vast project of world- and franchise-building. In fact, we don’t even get a glimpse of the adult Clark (disconcertingly bearded and working under a false name on a fishing ship) until well into the first hour. Until then, we’ve spent most of our time on Krypton, the doomed planet from which baby Kal-El’s parents, Jor-El and Lara (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer) reluctantly agree to launch their newborn in a spaceship. You would think the imminent explosion of your home planet would be enough reason to send your baby into space, but Kal has a second threat to contend with: the sworn hatred of General Zod (a muted, uncomfortable-seeming Michael Shannon), his scientist father’s former ally who’s determined to find a planet for the remaining Kryptonians to settle on—even if that involves depopulating someone else’s. The early scenes on Krypton contain some fascinating imaginings of alien technology and design. Superman’s home planet isn’t all dank, dripping tunnels and clanking hardware, but a place of Art Nouveau–style architecture and spacecraft that recall hovering deer ticks (or, in the case of young Kal-El’s space pod, a vaguely phallic unshelled peanut). But as cool as Krypton looks, it’s hard to get invested in Jor-El and Zod’s debate about how best to save their beloved planet when we all know it’s about to be blown to smithereens. Once Kal arrives on Earth—his phallic pod alighting in the cornfield of Smallville, Kan., farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane)—the story picks up some speed. Snyder cuts nimbly among timelines as we meet Clark at age 9, age 13, and finally a conspicuously Jesus-referencing age 33, struggling to hide his still-nascent but already impressive superpowers from a world he fears will reject him. As the incidents of unintended life-saving begin to pile up—this is a kid who can’t board a school bus that doesn’t plunge off a bridge into a river—Clark’s path eventually intersects with that of Lois Lane (Amy Adams, wonderful as always), a fierce investigative reporter who will stop at nothing to find out the identity of this rumored invincible man. Connoisseurs of the office-romance frisson between Lois and Clark will be disappointed by this movie’s de-emphasis on the Daily Planet as a workplace; we only visit the newsroom briefly, mainly during arguments between Lois and her editor (Laurence Fishburne), who, reasonably enough, is reluctant to run with even a well-sourced “flying man from outer space” scoop. The last hour is devoted almost entirely to the grand-scale destruction of Metropolis, as the airborne Superman and Zod slug it out spectacularly over a city that’s collapsing on top of its own citizens. Unlike many (too many) similar scenes in recent action films that casually ransack 9/11 for readymade disaster imagery, this sequence is crisply edited and imaginatively staged. Snyder excels at creating big, punchy images that recall a comic-book spread, as when the brawling hero and villain swoosh through the air in convincingly rendered hyperspeed, leaving a long, slowly fading blur over the skyline. But the awareness of the rapidly ascending body count on the ground below them makes the indulgent length of this final battle hard to stomach. Lois and Clark’s first kiss, and the mocking banter that ensues, are also a bit queasy-making given that the supersmooch literally takes place at the foot of a heap of smoking rubble. If this version of Superman is to have a future—as Warner Brothers seems convinced he will, having already green-lit the sequel—I hope Snyder will dial back both the casualty count and the Krypton mythmaking and instead focus on establishing a fictional Earth that’s rich enough to be worth saving.",POSITIVE

The real war in superhero movieland isn’t between good and bad guys; it’s between Marvel and DC Comics. So far Marvel, with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, the Avengers, et al., has been winning the tussle. Now DC’s “Man of Steel,” the umpteenth reboot of the ""Superman"" franchise, leaps into the fray. Taking a cue from the “Batman” series, the film is dark and thudding and overlong, not surprising since the film was written by ""Dark Knight""'s David S. Goyer from a story he concocted with Christoper Nolan, who also co-produced. It’s also in 3-D, to no great effect. (A 2-D version is also in theaters.) Anybody attracted to the Superman of olden days will be alienated by this gargantuan drearfest that pits our hero, played a bit too blankly by Henry Cavill, against Michael Shannon’s General Zod, a survivor of the planet Krypton’s catastrophic extinction. Zod and his minions sport the latest in Kryptonian leatherware while Superman, back on Earth, takes forever to don his suit and cape. Director Zack Snyder pays lip service to the Superman mythos – Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is here, Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner), Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) – but you get the feeling he would rather have chucked the entire back story, not to mention the front story, and just delivered up nonstop bashing.

Plus, Snyder's cinematographer Amir Mokri also shot Bay's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Coincidence? I think not.

Goyer and producer Christopher ""The Dark Knight"" Nolan, flirts with the notion of Superman as a Christ metaphor (more fully accomplished in 2006's tepid ""Superman Returns"") while transforming Clark Kent into a philosophical, off-the-grid hot bod searching for his identity and purpose. Scientist Jor-El (a non-singing Russell Crowe) witnesses the birth of his firstborn son, Kal-El, at the same time mad dog General Zod (Chicago's own Michael Shannon, boasting Greek bangs) tries to seize the Kryptonian government. Against the clock, officials incarcerate Zod and his minions into the Phantom Zone, thus saving the villains when Krypton goes the way of the planet Alderaan in ""Star Wars."" Meanwhile on Earth, where Jor-El has dispatched his only son to surrogate parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), Kal-El takes the name Clark and has a tough time fitting in. Dad constantly warns him about the dangers of his existence threatening everything people assume to be true about God and the universe. Yet, when Clark finally emerges as Superman, these issues are quickly dropped. Cavill, the first British actor to play the cinematic guardian of truth, justice and the American Way, plays Clark as a dark and burdened soul stuck inside Channing Tatum's body. Clark first travels the globe doing menial jobs, keeping a low profile as his widowed mother sits back in Kansas. He crosses paths with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in the Arctic where a NORAD outpost detects a Kryptonian ship under the ice. Meanwhile, General Zod escapes and tracks Kal-El to Earth. He threatens to destroy the planet if Kal doesn't fork over the ""Codex,"" a device capable of recreating Krypton. If Metropolis isn't being spectacularly destroyed like Chicago in Bay's ""Dark of the Moon,"" the denizens of Smallville confront killer tornadoes, contrived school bus accidents and Zod's seemingly invincible henchpeople. The Man of Steel's wary relationship with the U.S. military - represented by Christopher Meloni's Colonel Hardy - hints at being a love-hate arrangement. (In a rare moment of political commentary, a miffed Superman destroys a $12 million drone because he doesn't like to be spied upon.) ""Man of Steel"" only crackles to life during its last five minutes, when Clark shows up to get a job as a Daily Planet reporter. Yes, Lois already knows his secret identity, but that's not the disturbing part. Note that Lois Lane shoots her own photos with a digital Nikon SLR in this movie.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Marvel and DC Comics may be viewed as equals in the publishing arena, but the latter is hopelessly losing the battle when it comes to their respective film divisions. While Marvel has released one hit after the next (culminating in last year’s mega hit “The Avengers”), DC has failed to launch a single successful franchise other than Christopher Nolan‘s Dark Knight trilogy. 2006’s “Superman Returns” was a big disappointment, 2011’s “Green Lantern” was even worse, and Joss Whedon’s long-mooted Wonder Woman project was ultimately axed, leading him to direct the aforementioned “Avengers” for the competition. But in trying to reboot their Superman franchise, parent company Warner Bros. did something very smart – they enlisted the aid of Nolan and Batman co-writer David S. Goyer to usher in a new era of Kyrpton’s favorite son. And if “Man of Steel” is any indication, that was a great move on the part of the studio, not only because they’ve finally managed to do Superman right, but because it shows that they’re thinking about the bigger picture, both for their flagship character and the DC movie universe as a whole. “Man of Steel” is a giant-sized film with so much on its plate that it takes nearly 30 minutes before Clark Kent/Kal-El (Henry Cavill) even makes his first appearance. The movie opens with a prologue set on Krypton amid a military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) in a last-ditch attempt to save their dying planet. But scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) doesn’t agree with Zod taking such desperate measures, and instead launches his newborn son Kal-El (the first natural born Kryptonian in centuries) to Earth in the hope that he can save that planet from making the same mistakes. In the end, Zod and his cronies are captured and sentenced to the Phantom Zone, while Krypton is destroyed. Fast-forward about 30 years and Clark is now a grown man who wanders the planet working odd jobs, never staying in one place too long so as to not draw attention. But when the government uncovers an alien spacecraft in the Arctic, Clark’s secret is uncovered by Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) after saving her at the crash site using his superhuman powers. As Lois begins digging into the mysterious stranger’s past, Clark learns more about his alien race and the man that his father was confident he would become. No sooner does he accept his role as Earth’s protector than Zod arrives on the planet (having escaped the Phantom Zone years before) with plans to begin terraforming it into a new Krypton. This is exactly the kind of reboot that the franchise desperately needed, and though Nolan and Goyer will probably receive a lot of the credit, director Zack Snyder is just as responsible for its success. One of the biggest problems with Superman as a character is that his perfection and omnipotence makes him rather dull. Snyder and Co. can’t really change that, but they at least manage to make him feel more relatable by depicting him as a bit of an outcast. This works best in the flashbacks, which smartly doles out details from Clark’s childhood over the course of the film, resulting in a more well-rounded character. It also helps that the man donning the famous suit and cape imbues Clark with a certain warmth and humanity, and the fact that he shares an eerie likeness to Christopher Reeve at times doesn’t hurt either. Henry Cavill hasn’t had much luck in his first few outings as a leading man, but he proves himself more than capable of carrying the Superman torch with his subtle yet effective performance here. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner (playing Jonathan Kent) also shine as Clark’s two father figures – particularly Crowe’s Jor-El, who gets a lot more to do than in Richard Donner’s 1978 version. Michael Shannon, meanwhile, has some great moments as the villain Zod, but it’s not nearly as iconic as Terence Stamp’s portrayal, mostly because he just doesn’t seem as dangerous as he should. But perhaps the biggest disappointment in the cast is Amy Adams, who never gets the chance to fully flesh out the Lois character, although she’s clearly perfect for the role. The best thing about “Man of Steel,” however, is the action. The fight scenes are lightning fast and brutal, really playing up the superhuman angle of the Kryptonians in a way that’s never been done before. Though there are only a handful of action sequences in the movie, all but one of them is outstanding, especially the fight between Superman and two of Zod’s soldiers in the streets of Smallville, which, despite some disgustingly blatant product placement, delivers everything that you’d expect from a modern day Superman film. The big finale is a little too generic and blockbustery for its own good, but by that point, “Man of Steel” had already won me over. It’s not quite as groundbreaking as what Nolan achieved with “Batman Begins,” but considering Warner’s recent track record with DC Comics characters, it’s a massive and incredibly enjoyable step in the right direction. Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe, from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you're out or at home.",POSITIVE
"Jun 13, 2013","  Man Of Steel is a movie custom designed to let Superman do his thing, and the fight sequences surely will not disappoint. A showdown between Kal-El and Zod's right-hand woman and man-thing – Antje Trau and, I dunno, some guy I guess – has the zip and zoom of a videogame button-basher: all slick special moves, sliding, crouching and throwing things into trucks. Snyder occasionally can't keep the lid on, but it's just nice to see Superman challenged by something that isn't unexpected paternity. The director's love of big, bold, fast-paced action comes at the expense of the pacing and turns the volume down on everything else, but goddamnit, sometimes that's enough for a good time at the movies. Batman is serious. Iron Man is funny. I'm perfectly fine with Superman just being badass. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013"," Man
of Steel expands or adjusts
almost everything about the mythology of Superman, save for one important
detail, and that's Superman himself. First,
let's all agree on the fact that Superman is rather dull. Yes, it's great that he fights for truth, justice, the American way, and
all that, and yes, it's fine that he, despite not being human, serves as an
example for the best that human beings could beif only we developed the means
to fly, exert incredible strength, shoot heat beams from their eyes, see with
X-ray vision, and so on with all the rest. Neither
persona can exist on its own; it's the juxtaposition of the two that makes the
character work. In Man
of Steel, the only difference between Superman and Clark is the costume. David S. Goyer's screenplay is set in a period before Clark learns to be
the timid Clark, intrepid reporter for a big city newspaper who wears
glasses and changes his hair to ensure no one realizes he's really a superhero. Instead,
this Clark is just a stoic worrywart, torn between his life growing up on a
Kansas farm and his origin as an alien from another planet that has since been
destroyed. Clark's
attitude here is really no different than the one he assumes when he puts on the
body suit with an ""S"" on the chest (On his original world, he says,
the insignia means ""hope"") and cape. He's deadly serious and leaps into action whenever he spots people in
trouble, like when he holds up a
collapsing oil rig to give the workers a chance to escape.
He just hasn't learned
to fly. The
movie suggests that the burden (and, in the story's ultimate standoff with the
central villain, the tragedy) of Superman is that he cannot stop himself from
helping others. Given that he's
basically invincible (Any threat to his invincibilityhere, the recreation of
the atmosphere of his home planetis dismissed in order to resolve the
conflict as quickly as it's introduced to create a false sense of tension), this
isn't too much of a burden. It's why
Superman, without the counterbalance of the Clark Kent persona, isn't that
interesting. Clark/Superman,
known to the inhabitants of his home planet as Kal-El, is played by Henry Cavill,
an imposing physical presence who doesn't exude much personality but doesn't
need to for this version of the character. Cavill
denotes the change between Clark and Superman by adopting the cadence and tone
of an actor from the serials of olda nice touch. He
doesn't appear until the conclusion of an extended prologue that follows the adventures of his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe), a very important
man on Krypton who warns his fellow important people that their planet
is about to die a spectacular death (He later turns up as a literal deus ex machina). He
flies around on a winged beast to retrieve the records of their species, handily
collected into a skull. Before the
planet meets its doom, General Zod (Michael Shannon, wild-eyed and chewing on
every, sometimes-ridiculous line) has decided to start a coup, which is a far
less opportune idea than the data-infused skull. Zod and his allies are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, and after baby Kal-El
is shipped off to Earth, Krypton explodes. We
already know all of this, and the inclusion of chases, fights, and special
effects only serves to make it more superfluous. We also know of young Clark's discovery of his powers, relayed here in
flashback scenes of a frightened and confused Clark (at least he has some
personality in these scenes) with his adoptive parents (Kevin Costner and Diane
Lane). Clark meets Lois Lane (Amy
Adams, possessing the required spark), and Zod returns, looking to turn Earth
into a new Krypton. At some point in
between, Clark learns his origins and decides to try to fly. In
regards to the flying, a funny thing occurs when Clark, now Superman, does so. He
smiles. It's infectious,
too, and director Zack Snyder gives us a lot of freewheeling camerawork that
puts Superman in front of what looks like old-fashioned rear projectionflying
over mountains and across the plains of the Serengeti. We have a sense of the unadulterated joy of the moment, and it's
necessary, given that the rest of the movie works quite hard to drain all joy
from the character and his abilities. Those
sequences, in which Superman fights Zod and his fellow Kryptonian soldiers, work
in their own way, too. Snyder keeps
the action moving fastso fast, in fact, that the panning, zooming, and
craning camera can barely keep up with the combatants. Punches send them flying hundreds of feet and crashing through buildings,
which leaves Metropolis looking a lot like it does in Zod's plan to turn Earth
into a wasteland.",POSITIVE
"Jun 13, 2013","By the end, Man of Steel has mutated into just another superhero action movie, with explosions galore and city buildings toppling like so many Legos. Lather, rinse, repeat. That's too bad because ... Man of Steel has so much going for it.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013"," Henry Cavill plays the title role in Zach Snyder's expensively earnest iteration of our most recognizably American superhero. An ""alien"" aesthetic — which ironically owes plenty to the Industrial Age and to the metallo-organic curves of art nouveau — informs everything from the film's palette to its interpretation of Superman's iconic costume. Full disclosure: Over the past two years, this reviewer has spent a great deal of time thinking about superheroes in general and Superman in particular. Less than some, perhaps, but more — it's safe to say — than most of you reading these words, as you debate whether or not to duck out of the heat this weekend to take in Snyder's latest summertime smash-em-up. Specifically, I wrote a cultural history of Superman that examines which elements of the character have remained constant over the course of his 75-year existence, and which have reflected the societal shifts taking place around him. In this context, I've read lots of comics and taken in over 700 hours of Superman's derring-doings on radio, television and film. And when I say Man of Steel is not a superhero film, I'm speaking here of a juggernaut of a genre that many critics have come to disdain as an invasive species, a Burmese python that's spent the past 20 years gobbling up indigenous fauna in the Everglades of contemporary cinema. It's a genre, ironically enough, that Superman himself created with 1978's Superman: The Movie, the first of many films to map Joseph Campbell's hero's journey onto a narrative infrastructure that borrowed the sweep of the epic Western, the snap of the screwball comedy and the property damage of the disaster film. This 35-year-old formula, with modest tweaks, has fueled the narrative engines of stinker (Green Lantern) and winner (The Avengers) alike, films in which we cheer the doughty hero and hiss the contemptible villain. This telling of the Superman story leans hard on the tension between the fit-in-at-all-costs imperatives of Kal-El's Kansas upbringing, featuring Diane Lane as surrogate mother Martha Kent ... To understand what sets Man of Steel well apart from previous efforts to deliver Superman to a mass audience, it's important to keep in mind that the Superman who has shown up in movies and on television to date is only nominally a figure of science fiction. The comics, given their limitless special-effects budget, can and do eagerly embrace the character's pulpy, sci-fi, giant-robot-space-alien-fightin' roots. But film and television properties like the '78 Superman, Lois & Clark and Smallville have tended to pivot away from his intergalactic provenance at the first opportunity, devoting themselves thereafter to more prosaic, earthbound pursuits — nabbing robbers, foiling crooked real-estate schemes and such. Sure, the whole ""doomed planet Krypton"" gets lip service early on in each of these iterations, but the Superman historically served up by film and television is largely a creature of warm, sun-dappled fantasy, not chilly, gunmetal-gray science. That ends here. Snyder's Man of Steel emphatically doubles down on the myriad science-fiction aspects that come hard-wired into the Superman myth. The result, perhaps inevitably, owes more to noisy, technophilic alien-invasion fare like Transformers and Battleship than to the lyric romanticism of Richard Donner's Superman films or Bryan Singer's 2006 Superman Returns. ... and the fallout from the long-ago space-opera insurrection that landed Krypton's General Zod (Michael Shannon, right, with Antje Traue) and his rebels in the Phantom Zone. That's not necessarily a bad thing — not if what you're looking for in a summer blockbuster is for blocks to get well and truly busted, as they do here with grim relish. Especially if you came out of Singer's sweetly melancholic but overly dutiful Superman film wishing the guy could have punched more things more often. And harder. Put it this way: Man of Steel is the kind of movie in which such bombastic cries as ""SURRENDER THE CODEX!"" and ""RELEASE THE WORLD ENGINE!"" occur with unabashed, metronomic regularity. But Snyder doesn't allow his actors, or his film, to luxuriate in the soap-operatic camp of such moments, preferring to keep things moving at a nimble trot. That might be the influence of producer Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer, whose Dark Knight trilogy similarly eschewed humor for spectacle. There are moments of lightness in Man of Steel, as when our hero attempts to take to the air for the first time (the ride is more than a little rocky) and times where the film seems to understand the essential hopefulness that makes up the character's core. ""You can save [them],"" Jor-El (Russell Crowe) assures Superman (Henry Cavill) at a key juncture; ""you can save them all."" Cavill is particularly good here, lending the compassionate moral center of Superman a wry specificity that keeps it from seeming bland. And Amy Adams' savvy, matter-of-fact Lois Lane is given more to do than many Loises before her. Like Superman Returns, Man of Steel does reach back to Donner's seminal 1978 film. But Superman Returns did so to cannibalize that picture's tone and design aesthetic, while Man of Steel simply borrows its driving conflict. The subtext of Superman: The Movie's climax found the Man of Steel choosing between his Kryptonian heritage and his adopted world. In Snyder and Goyer's hands, that subtext is made the explicit and oft-spoken text. (Indeed, Goyer's dialogue remains as regrettably blunt an instrument as it was in the Dark Knight films; characters can be counted upon to tell us exactly what they are thinking the very moment they think it.) Man of Steel does locate and deliver on the abiding appeal of Superman: an unguarded, irony-free idealism, plus dazzling displays of power, wrapped up in the heartening notion that a man who could do anything he chooses to look out for us. What it fails to supply much of — surprisingly, it must be said — is fun. This is serious business, Snyder seems always to be saying. This is badass. And given the sheer logistical size of the spectacle on display, it's a position that's hard to argue with. The film ends with an epic, frenetically violent superhero battle of a scope often seen in the comics, but never heretofore on any screen. Figures soar through the air, crash into buildings, and fly away. Yet Snyder's camera doesn't follow them. Over and over again, he lingers on a damaged skyscraper to show it crumbling languidly into rubble and rebar, as screaming citizens flee in terror. This feels nothing like watching a man in a Godzilla suit trample a cardboard Tokyo, or seeing flying saucers vaporize an Epcot Village of tourist landmarks in Independence Day. It feels sour and cynical, like an attempt to elicit visceral reactions by siphoning emotive force from our communal memories of a very real horror. Yes, yes: We've seen New York get destroyed often since Sept. 11, most recently in The Avengers. But in that film, the violence ratchets steadily up to a literally fantastic climax involving giant mechanical space eels. Man of Steel's violence doesn't escalate; it simply, tediously, iterates. We keep waiting to thrill, to exult, to cheer our hero on.",NEGATIVE

Note: There is a ""spoiler"" in passing for Star Trek into Darkness. Not a big thing if you've seen the movie (or even if you haven't) but don't say you haven't been warned. I also refer in vague terms to the ending of this film.
 
Khan has returned. So has Zod. Robocop is on the way. For '80s films, it's back to the future. How long until Marty McFly takes a detour down Remake Road or along Reboot Lane?
 
Man of Steel represents the latest attempt by Warner Brothers to revive a Superman franchise that, since its stunning 1978 revival, has been abominably treated for about 30 years (ever since Richard Donner was unceremoniously fired from Superman II). This movie certainly looks and feels a lot different than any of its predecessors, and that's not just because of the crappy 3-D. It's more of a science fiction/fantasy adventure than a superhero movie. In a way that's good, because it doesn't come across like a tired retread of every origin story we've ever seen. On the other hand, it's not good, because the sci-fi feel has been overly influenced by the likes of Independence Day and Transformers. That's right: blow everything up, real good! Pyrotechnics! Special Effects! CGI up the wazoo! For those who crave cinematic mayhem, Man of Steel is right up your alley (and it will make a ton of money). But something important has been lost along the way: heart. This is a cold, sterile motion picture. The characters are so thinly drawn that it's tough to get much feel for them. And one senses that director Zack Snyder is less interested in Superman than he is in the orgy of destruction he gets to rain down on Metropolis. Somewhere, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are smiling.
 
Man of Steel opens with the obligatory introductory Krypton sequence. It's some of the best material the movie has to offer; the dying planet is visually impressive and the acting by Russell Crowe as Jor-El is some of the best work the actor has provided in a long time. Gone is the flat, stilted interpretation offered by Marlon Brando sleepwalking his way through the role on the way to a fat paycheck. Crowe's Jor-El is heroic and charismatic. With Krypton nearing its end, he places his little boy into a spacecraft and sends him to Earth. Meanwhile, the hard-ass General Zod (Michael Shannon in full scenery-chewing mode) attempts a coup, fails, and is sentenced to spend some time in The Phantom Zone for his troubles.
 
The first time we meet Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), he's trying out for The Deadliest Catch. After saving some men on a doomed oil rig, Clark floats around in the water experiencing convenient flashbacks to his childhood living in Kansas with Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). Once these are done, he heads north and, after paying homage to the diner scene in Superman II, reaches the Fortress of Solitude, which is actually a spaceship buried under arctic ice. In that frozen wasteland, he also meets intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who immediately falls for the big hunk after he saves her life. In the spaceship, Clark meets an avatar of his dad and gets his costume. It's around this time that Zod and his followers, freed from The Phantom Zone, reach Earth and Superman must choose between continuing to live anonymously or taking a front seat as the planet's defender. Unlike Zod in Superman II, who came to conquer, this Zod comes to destroy.
 
Man of Steel is, first and foremost, a great spectacle. The effects work is first rate and the action sequences, of which there are many, are delivered with a kinetic punch. The tone is dour - humor is at a premium and, on those rare occasions when it's there, the delivery is decidedly low-key. The movie wants desperately to be taken seriously and viewed as something more than a comic book film. Perhaps, in the end, that's one reason why Man of Steel rarely feels heroic and never truly soars. Sure, Superman eventually wins but at the cost of thousands of lives (we're not given a specific body count but it has to be very high).
 
Christopher Nolan's influence will be hotly debated, especially since the producer has been coy about the full extent of his involvement in the final product, stating only that ""it's Zack Synder's film."" Indeed, Man of Steel is closer to Watchmen than Batman Begins in terms of its look and feel. It's a style over substance thing, spectacle over heart. Snyder never ceases to amaze visually but one could make a compelling case that he ""misses"" what defines Superman's uniqueness. It makes sense for Batman to live in the dark but Superman has always been a figure of light and truth. That's one reason he's a difficult movie subject because there's no ambiguity about who he is and what he represents, and there's something about the darkness that pervades Man of Steel that feels wrong for the character.
 
The choice of Henry Cavill to don the cape is inspired; Cavill is easily the most accomplished actor thus far to fill the role and, while no one will ever fully eclipse what Christopher Reeve brought to the screen, Cavill uses Man of Steel as an opportunity to lay the foundation for what could be a long and memorable run. He combines the matinee appeal of Reeve and Brandon Routh with a stronger resume although, truth be told, the screenplay underuses his range. The main requirement for Cavill is to look the part.
 
As a cookie cutter supervillain, Michael Shannon does a good job overacting. He snarls and yells and exudes menace. He rants and does all sorts of nasty things. In the end, however, it's the name ""Zod"" that puts Shannon at a disadvantage because it forces him to exist in the long shadow of Terence Stamp. Stamp's Zod is arguably one of the twenty most memorable movie bad guys and Shannon doesn't touch him. The other casting miscalculation is Amy Adams as Lois Lane. The part doesn't fit. On the other hand, there are some great choices, although most of them are sadly underused. Laurence Fishburne makes a terrific Perry White, although he has very little screen time. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are great as Clark's Earth parents although Costner in particular deserves more screen time.
 
Man of Steel delivers forcefully on its promise to take Superman in a different direction. Perhaps that's a good idea; after all, Richard Donner (with an assist from Richard Lester) has done the ""traditional"" Superman as well as it can be done. But a lot is missing, and the most telling absence is the element that makes Superman more the hero of his own story rather than the pawn of special effects. This is a less promising opening act than Batman Begins because it mines so little new territory. Remakes like Man of Steel are about intangibles like tone and style and how well the soul of the central conceit has been maintained. Snyder succeeds in making this movie sufficiently different to justify its existence. The open question is whether this Superman can spearhead a franchise that aspires to greatness or whether this new ""dark vision"" is merely window dressing.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Come on, guys, can’t you give us one superhero who is not all angsty and conflicted? Director Zack Snyder, who presided over the ultimate superhero deconstruction in Watchmen, and producer/co-screenwriter Christopher Nolan, who put the cinematic “dark” in Batman’s Dark Knight have taken the original superhero, the one all the others are a reaction to, the one who never needed to be reminded that with great power comes great responsibility, and saddled him with an existential crisis. That is not the fault of British actor Henry Cavill, who plays Clark Kent and Superman with a lot of heart behind that flawlessly heroic jaw, cleft chin, and broad shoulders.  It is the sour tone of the script and the drab look of the film, with completely unnecessary post-production 3D adding a greyish cast over the bleached-out images. And a reboot really does not require yet another retelling of the origin story.  We all know about the little spaceship sent off from Krypton by Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara (Ayelet Zurer) before the planet exploded, and the baby who was discovered by the childless Kents, honest farmers who called their new son Clark.  Here the re-telling is used to lay the foundation for a battle of former Kryptonians, with towering rage specialist Michael Shannon as General Zod (memorably played in “Superman II” by Terrence Stamp).  A new wrinkle: as in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and “Gattaca”, the decadent, depleted Kryptonian society genetically programs fetuses for particular purposes. In defiance of this system, Jor-El and Lara produce a child the old-fashioned way, the first such birth in generations.  But it is too late.  Krypton has ignored its inconvenient truths for too long.  The world, including technology that features a phone that looks like a talking pomegranate, is about to end.  General Zod, once Jor-El’s friend, rebels, killing Jor-El, and vowing revenge as he and his followers are sent to the Phantom Zone.  (And by the way, the Phantom Zone here is not nearly as cool as the rotating glass plane in “Superman II.” After the Kryptonian prologue, we get a distractingly disjointed story, beginning with Clark as an adult, saving the day in secret and disappearing before he can be identified.  In flashbacks, we see that Martha Kent (Diane Lane) teaches him how to manage his super-senses without getting overwhelmed.  Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) tells his adopted son not to reveal his powers because the world is not ready to understand and appreciate him.  Though he loves his parents, Clark feels isolated and anguished.  He cannot help stepping in when rescue is needed (and in one case when a bully needs a comeuppance), but then he has to move on so his secret cannot be uncovered. Lois Lane (Amy Adams), spunky as ever (“What can I say, I get writer’s block if I’m not wearing a flack jacket”) finds out Clark’s secret immediately.  She is not someone who is going to be fooled by a pair of glasses and a timid demeanor.  Indeed, one reason this story seems so sterile is that it leaves out some of the core elements of the Superman story.  No kryptonite.  Instead of graceful soaring through the sky, he takes off like a jumping bean.  He does not call himself Superman and is only called it once.  Instead of the iconic bright red and blue uniform, he wears a textured supersuit with a dramatic but not very practical  ankle-length cape.  Edna Mode, where are you when Superman needs you? Clark keeps his secret, with tragic consequences, until General Zod arrives and insists that Earth surrender its lone Kryptonian.  This leads to a half-hour fight sequence that is ably staged but empty in spirit.  Post-production 3D effects are applied indiscriminately, with the pores of the actors’ skin unsettlingly immersive.  The action is indiscriminate and overblown.  Perhaps some day we will be able to appreciate mass destruction without painful associations.  But here and now, it feels gratuitous.  Clark Kent/Kal-El gets so caught up in his own existential angst he overlooks some complex moral issues in his fight with Zod.  The plot draws too heavily from “Star Trek” (in at least two places) and not enough from Superman’s decades of history.  What about Mr. Myxlplyx?  The City of Kandor?  Bizarro World?  Don’t make Superman into another Dark Knight.  Let Superman be his own super-self. Parents should know that this film includes extended scenes of comic book-style action violence with fights, chases, explosions, tornado, planet annihilated, sad deaths of parents, crashes, and massive city-wide destruction. Many characters are injured and killed including fetuses. There is a non-explicit childbirth scene, some strong and crude insults, and some drinking. Family discussion: Was Clark’s father right to tell him to keep his powers secret, no matter what the cost? How does this Superman differ from other portrayals and why? Is morality an “evolutionary advantage?” What would you pick for the symbol of your house? This is a reboot and were not getting the classic Christopher Reeves and boy scout story line, but what it would really be like to have all that power. Your senses would be overwhelmed, to hear everything, to see everything.  If someone like superman really showed up on earth every army and power on the planet would be up in arms. If your living 40 years ago your not gonna like this…but most of today’s generation will enjoy it.",POSITIVE

And here he is in Man of Steel, directed by Snyder, with story input from producer Christopher Nolan, the sinister genius behind the Dark Knight trilogy. Nolan knows from moody. And Snyder knows from fireworks. Nolan knows from holding back. Snyder, uh, doesn’t. Together, they could have spawned a movie at war with itself, which admittedly this one often is. Against those odds, Man of Steel soars high on its own schizoid ambition. Lacking the old-school humor and charm of Richard Donner’s 1978 Superman and Christopher Reeve’s iconic performance, Man of Steel pretty much starts from scratch. This is all to the good, especially for Henry Cavill, the British actor who wisely takes on the role as if it’s never been played before. Fellow Brits Christian Bale (Batman) and Andrew Garfield (Spider-Man) took the same approach. Cavill can do hunky in his sleep (see Immortals or The Tudors). It’s the banked fires he brings to Superman and his alter ego, Clark Kent, that make his performance such a potent surprise. Cavill, square-jawed with a hip sense of alienation, doesn’t let the suit act for him. Hell, he doesn’t put it on till halfway into the movie. This Clark is a loner, an alien from the planet Krypton, raised on the Kansas farm of the Kents – Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane, finding depth where there isn’t any). How’d he get there? As told in DC Comics, Krypton is nearing extinction. The scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his infant son, Kal-El, off to Earth. Enter the Kents, his adoptive parents, then Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon, nostrils flaring), the Krypton fascist who follows Kal-El to take over the planet. Blah. Blah. Blah. What else is new? In approach, lots. Snyder follows no linear pattern. Baby Kal-El in the rocket is followed by a smash cut to Clark, age 33, working on a fishing trawler. Flashbacks fill in the rest. Papa Jonathan – Costner’s heartfelt portrayal lifts the film – tells Clark to hide his powers. Out of fear of becoming popular, Clark never smiles or makes friends. He’s made for bigger things. Is he a reluctant Jesus or just confused? Before the gloom can settle, Snyder overkills with Hans Zimmer sound and FX fury as Supie rescues humans from fire, flood and twister. When Clark finally puts on the suit, its colors are muted, like he is. Maybe that’s why Snyder has him punching everything in sight, with one exception: In the Arctic, to find the codex holding the key to (what else?) global domination, the Man of Steel falls for Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (a tough, terrific Amy Adams). You don’t hire four-time Oscar nominee Adams to play Lois if you want a compliant bimbo who can’t see the superman behind Clark’s glasses. Even when Snyder pulls out every computer-generated trick in a climax that won’t quit while it’s ahead, Cavill and Adams give the movie a beating heart. It needs it. Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there’s no way to stay blind to its wonders.",POSITIVE

In the long, loud prologue of the mega-disappointing Man of Steel, director Zack Snyder and his crew reimagine Superman's birth orb as a kind of Freudian dreamscape of phalluses and vulvas.

And so, after much huffing and puffing and angry words between Supey's dad, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and Krypton's military madman, General Zod (Michael Shannon), the newborn Kal-El is tucked into a spaceship for his trip across the galaxies. Destination: Earth. ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards,"" says Jor-El, bidding a noble adieu to his tiny tot just before Krypton goes kaboom. (Kryptonians have spent their planet's resources, bringing on an environmental apocalypse.) Once the movie and its hero land on terra firma, Man of Steel swaps out the sexual imagery for some blatant religious symbolism. To be sure, the Superman myth is rife with biblical allusions, but is this really necessary - to show a troubled Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) wandering into a church, seeking counsel from a priest, with the stained-glass image of Christ looming large behind him? The best bits of Man of Steel come when the young E.T. - adopted by Kansas farm couple Jonathan and Martha Kent (a determinedly Midwestern Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) - struggles to come to terms with his otherworldly powers, which he has been warned to keep secret, lest the entire world has a freak-out. Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry play the grade-school and teenage Kryptonian with convincing angst. But what do you do when the school bus you're on goes over a bridge into the river? Let your classmates drown? And then the grown-up Clark begins his circuitous journey to Metropolis, via Alaska, where he sports a manly beard and works on a crab boat, and then on an arctic dig, where he meets ace reporter Lois Lane (a plucky Amy Adams). Something, or someone, is buried deep in a glacier, puzzling the scientists and G-men. Could it be General Zod and his posse, here to remake Earth as the new Krypton? Cavill, big and handsome with soulful eyes, displays more of a Supey vibe than Brandon Routh managed in Bryan Singer's 2006 reboot, Superman Returns, but the English actor gets little occasion to bring any kind of humor to his role. This man of steel is seriously metallic. Christopher Reeve, of the '70s-'80s Superman quartet, remains the most successful, and memorable, movie incarnation. When comic book legends Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster dreamed up Superman for Action Comics #1, published 75 years ago this month, he was the first of a new breed of caped crusaders - high-flying heroes with tights and alter egos. Hordes of other men and women - Batman, Captain America, Wonder Woman - followed down the decades. What's particularly disheartening about Man of Steel is that its hero's originality - Superman's primacy - has been forsaken for an excess of high-end generic effects. At least an hour of Man of Steel's excessive running time is devoted to the sort of crash-and-burn, slamming-into-skyscrapers CG fight scenes that we've already seen in The Avengers and Dark Knight, Iron Man, and Spider-Man.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2013"," If the intent of 1978’s Superman: The Movie was to make audiences believe a man can fly, then Man Of Steel would have you believe a superhero can sulk – and punch things while doing so. There’s something to be said for the willingness of the Man Of Steel team to test boundaries and break new ground with such an iconic character. Over the course of its sprawling, 143-minute running time, Man Of Steel strives to be the very definition of “epic,” covering a span of time that begins with a military coup on the planet Krypton, and runs through the planet’s self-destruction, the arrival of baby Kal-El (Superman) on Earth, his maturation with his adopted parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), and an uncertain number of years he spends wandering America as a melancholy, super-powered drifter. All of these story elements serve as preamble to a massive conflict with Kryptonian criminal Zod (Michael Shannon) that forces him to finally reveal his presence to the world after posing as a human for more than 30 years. From the movie’s very first act – built around an effects-driven, fast-paced chase through the skies of Krypton with Kal-El’s scientist father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) riding a four-winged, dragon-like creature – there’s a sense that Man Of Steel isn’t quite certain what type of film it’s trying to be. The opening sequence on Krypton is a fantastic, eye-popping trip that would seem right at home in a big-budget, sci-fi fantasy like Avatar, but it feels like a very different movie than the angsty hero’s journey that the film soon becomes. Similarly, Superman’s evolution on Earth fluctuates between weighty, brooding explorations of the burden Clark Kent must carry and brief, explosive brawls that serve as palate-cleansing breaks in the drama. In many ways, the film seems to benefit more from Snyder’s touch than that of Nolan, with the former bringing an eye for action that previous Superman films had lacked and providing exactly the sort of raw displays of power that the character’s fanbase has long been demanding. The Man of Steel has never looked more impressive during a big-screen brawl, and Snyder’s knack for visual effects make every example of Superman’s abilities feel as awesome as they should to human eyes. When Nolan was attached to the project, many feared that his affinity for “grim and gritty” would give us a Superman story far darker than anything we’ve seen so far, and the final product doesn’t stray too far from that prediction. This version of Superman spends much of the film dwelling on the darkest moments of his life and the lessons these experiences – and his adopted father – taught him about the people of Earth. In this initial chapter of what’s sure to be a multi-film franchise, it’s regret and doubt, not Kryptonite, that are the Man of Steel’s real weakness. Despite its tonal problems, Man Of Steel does offer some fantastic, memorable performances from its leads, particularly Michael Shannon as Zod. The Take Shelter actor goes a long way toward making the character his own, and the confidence and charisma he exudes as the Kryptonian villain provides the perfect counter to Henry Cavill’s somewhat stiff, doubt-plagued Superman. Even though he seems to get less screen time than his Kryptonian counterpart, Costner does a fine job portraying Superman’s human father, Jonathan Kent, and provides the audience with a good sense of why Clark Kent developed into such a hero. Jor-El, on the other hand, seems to spend a bit too much time in the spotlight over the course of the film, especially after his part in Superman’s maturation would seem to be resolved. Beyond the impressive fight sequences, the visual elements of Man Of Steel are everything audiences have come to expect from Snyder. While there are a few instances of shaky camera work that create some blur in 3-D screenings, the majority of the film is a crisp, bright, adventure that showcases the power of its characters and complements the ambitious scope of the story. Without getting into spoiler territory, it will be interesting to see how audiences react to the final outcome of Superman’s battle with Zod, which is likely to prompt endless debate among mainstream audiences and hardcore fans alike. Over the course of Man Of Steel, Snyder and the movie’s creative team don’t shy away from redefining the character on their terms rather than what’s come before, and the climax of the film slams that point home with an act that will likely be this iteration of the character’s defining moment. Still, there’s something to be said for the willingness of the Man Of Steel team to test boundaries and break new ground with such an iconic character. While there’s no shortage of elements that could be handled more efficiently, many of those elements are nevertheless necessary for audiences to understand why they don’t work with this particular character. There’s been a long list of demands made by fans of any potential Superman movie in the time since Superman Returns failed to impress audiences – more action, more Krypton, grander scale, a comparable villain to name just a few. In light of all that, there’s a strong argument to be made that, while Man Of Steel may not be the Superman movie we wanted, it is the Superman movie we deserve. The DC Extended Universe, love it or hate it, has given audiences some of the most memorable and mind-blowing fight scenes ever seen in live-action. Viewers have seen the members of the Justice League and many other heroes engage in some dazzling and inventive brawls unlike anything the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done. While there's been a renaissance for the comic book genre on the big screen in the last 10 years or so, some of the roots of its current success go back to the best comic book movies of the first decade of this century. And though there had also been solid endeavors even before then, what this decade did was help make superheroes more mainstream to audiences who didn't know who the Kree were or what the heck a Lasso of Truth was. Beginning with 2013's Man of Steel, the DC Extended Universe has had a tumultuous 10-year run. While some of its films were tremendous success stories, some didn't fare so well, and others have gone down as some of the worst superhero movies ever made. All this has given the franchise a mixed reputation and has made some audiences eager to see how James Gunn will reboot everything with his new DC Universe. As the DCEU nears its end, now is a good time to rank the most popular movies in this cinematic universe in terms of box-office gross.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Conventional industry wisdom (or, if not wisdom, then sustained chatter and idle speculation) suggests there’s a lot riding on Man of Steel, the latest cinematic iteration of Krypton’s favorite son. For the folks at DC Comics (now DC Entertainment, part of Warner Bros. and Time-Warner), it must be galling to watch their longtime competitor, Marvel Comics (now Marvel Worldwide and owned by Disney) launch franchise after franchise into the stratosphere while, with the exception of a certain bat-themed vigilante, their own stable of heroes seems unable to get off the ground. Even putting aside the billion-dollar Whedon-helmed Avengers, Marvel just appears to be getting stronger, with Iron Man 3, powered by the Incredible Downey Jr. Man, about to surpass the global box office of its two predecessors combined. Though it remains to be seen how well the second Thor and Captain America films will fare, it can’t be denied that Marvel is well into the race while DC is tinkering with the engine in pit row. While this failure to launch must be frustrating for the execs at Time-Warner, it’s equally so for fans of the DC universe who want to see the Justice League with all its iconic (Supes, Bats, Flash, Wonder Woman) and not so iconic (Aquaman!) characters in action on the Big Screen. Nolan’s Dark Knight films notwithstanding—look to Batman for exceptions, not rules—the last two DC ventures were pretty unimpressive. Bryan Singer’s 2006 Superman Returns sported an overly meditative first act hobbled by a derivative, boring third act, and 2011’s Green Lantern proved that crappy storytelling is a bigger threat to the emerald knight than any amount of yellow. So there was plenty of reason to anticipate and root for the Man of Steel as a fresh start both for the character and the universe. Oh, Man of Steel begins well enough. Director Zack Snyder brings his signature richness of design to Krypton, treating its final days like the end of a rollickin’ space opera upon which the viewers have stumbled. As Jor-El, Space Ranger, Russell Crowe is less spindly scientist (or bloated Brando head) than the character has ever been, and the final days of Krypton allow Michael Shannon to get a welcomed early start on chewing up the scenery as General Zod. (One could quibble that, for a member of the Scientist caste, Jor-El sure wears a lot of merchandisable battle armor and rides a cool, merchandisable dragonfly lizard, but this is the least boring Krypton has ever been.) Once young Kal-El reaches Earth, action grinds to a halt, as Snyder breaks apart the classic “growing up supah!” montage, inserting it instead throughout the next lifetime—I mean, hour or so—of the film, which switches back and forth from childhood to present day and the now grown Clark Kent (Henry Cavill). There are a couple of nice superpowered ninja saves—a bus full of children here, an oil rig crew there—but mainly, the scenes consist of Clark looking angsty, Ma Kent (Diane Lane) giving comfort and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) giving increasingly dubious “advice” that culminates in a nice father-son assisted suicide. Once Zod and crew reach Earth, the action picks up, and in the barrage of sequences that follows, the finally caped and costumed Superman ignores the safety of innocent bystanders in practically every encounter. (“Go inside,” he tells townsfolk before destroying every structure in an eight-block radius with cars, trains and superhuman cannonballs. Maybe he learns to draw the villains away from population centers later in his career?) Meanwhile, throughout both the boring and action-packed moments, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is everywhere, finding the Snyderian version of the Fortress of Solitude, tracking down an alien’s secret identity and teaming up with ghost-Jor-El (by then demoted from Space Ranger to Kryptonian GPS/plot expositor) for the first of two Lois ex machina moments. It was almost as if every piece of dialogue needed to be delivered by a principal (Adams if possible). For some viewers, especially those unburdened by any great knowledge or appreciation of Superman in particular or comic books in general, there’s another story being told amidst the wreckage of pacing and sense. To them, Man of Steel may serve as a potent retelling of that original superhero, Jesus. It’s certainly meant to. Snyder (along with writers David Goyer and Christopher Nolan) deserves some sort of merit badge of obviousness for taking a tale already high in Messianic resonance—a distant being sends his only son to Earth to protect and save those he is both of and beyond—and cranking up the Passion. Whereas Singer was content, in Superman Returns, with an occasional echo or posture evoking Jesus Christ, Superman, the Man of Steel director lashes the viewer relentlessly with New Testament flava. Snyder is like that pothead friend who, in the midst of a 24-hour toke-a-thon discovers, “Dude, blueberries are blue!” One regrettable scene two-thirds through the film in which a still un-spandexed Clark Kent agonizes over how to respond to a Zod ultimatum is so steadfast in its inclusion of a stained glass depiction of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane that I half expected the camera to just pan over to the image, completely excluding Clark’s head (and whatever he was saying) in favor of a hushed yet resonant voiceover solemnly intoning, “Because he’s totally like Jesus.” Sigh. Until Man of Steel, I had enjoyed Zack Snyder’s films—even the maligned Sucker Punch—while not being sure how good of a storyteller he actually was. In his earlier films, he had proven himself a master of the serial comic book “tableaux-talky”—the composing of a succession of scenes in such a way that a story is eventually conveyed. But all the while, the question remained: how well would he be able to tell a story that was not already nailed down by panels and pages (as with 300 and Watchmen) or inoculated from traditional narrative demands through copious use of dreamscapes (Sucker Punch)? There hasn’t been such a definitive answer to a nagging question of directorial chops since The Last Airbender. If heavy-handed allegory makes Man of Steel worth the price of admission for some, that’s great. If others have become so inured to bombast, sloppy plotting and the substitution of cliché for character in sci-fi blockbusters that they enjoy Snyder’s game attempt at the Superman tale, all the better. However, for those looking for a Superman tale well-told, or signs that the DC Comics universe may finally be ready to give Marvel a run for its money in the multiplexes—there’s nothing to see here.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2013"," If “Man of Steel” had crash-landed in theaters with a title like “After Earth 2: The Rise of Jaden,” we would call it what it is: a soulless, overblown bore. But because this desecration is disguised as a Superman movie, sheepish customers will hesitate to say that the emperor of action heroes has no clothes. The most obvious kick in the pants from this reboot is that Superman’s tri-colored costume has been replaced by an almost-black body suit of militaristic mesh. It hugs the bulges of British pretty boy Henry Cavill, who avoids recognizable human emotions as if they were Kryptonite. Of course, Superman isn’t actually human, but we all know from 75 years of pop culture that he was raised by Ma and Pa Kent in a farming community called Smallville, Kan., before moving to Metropolis to do good deeds. Yet this misbegotten movie focuses on a feud with a Kryptonian refugee named General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose army of fembots follow the future Superman from their doomed planet to Earth, to extract his species-saving DNA. While dwelling on daddy issues (in the forms of Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner), this overextended origin story jettisons almost everything we love about the Superman legend. Do we get to meet mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent? Not quite. Is there romantic chemistry between prize-winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams, utterly wasted) and the mysterious lightning rod she dubs Superman? Not much. Is the movie fun to look at? Not even with 3-D vision. The costumes and sets look like rejected designs for “Dune” collectibles. Instead of the primary colors from the classic comic books, the dominant hue is pewter. As he proved in movies such as “300,” “The Watchmen” and “Sucker Punch,” director Zack Snyder is a technocrat who doesn’t know a thing about people. Working from a wooden script by “Batman”-franchise freeloader David S. Goyer, Snyder somehow makes it even stiffer. Every opportunity for humor, compassion or plausible responses to otherworldly phenomena is buried beneath product placements and CGI special effects. “Man of Steel” is just another summer movie about aliens toppling skyscrapers — and our supposed hero does little to stop it. The collateral deaths that he not only ignores but possibly causes while fist-fighting with Zod could number in the thousands. Yet as the decimated city smolders, this British imitation of Superman finds time to snog with Lois — and then he weakly pleads with the villain not to destroy a room full of people with a beam of light.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," At first blush Man of Steel is everything about Superman we've seen in movies before: the infant Kal-El's exodus to Earth from Krypton, his Midwest maturation as Clark Kent, his settling into his role as world protector from arch-villains. Marlon Brando always played his dad. Man of Steel does things differently, with director Zack Snyder retelling the myth with intimately hand-held cameras and deep-meaning conflicts. Russell Crowe steps in as the father. Superman becomes something of an art house action hero, embodied by the appropriately dimpled and chiseled Henry Cavill. This is not your father's Superman, but he could be your mom's. Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer look closer at the legend, answering questions previous Superman movies sidestepped, cutting faster to the fireworks. They explore the down side of young Clark Kent's situation — new kid moves into Earth, becomes a god — and the Krypton politics shipping him there. Superman movies typically cut from there to the Daily Planet. Man of Steel wonders what happened in between. The movie projects an air of realism and myth expansion that Christopher Nolan's trilogy lent to Batman, spending more time on Krypton with the dilemmas of Jor-El (Crowe, much more active than Brando) while making General Zod (scary-eyed Michael Shannon) into a richer, more principled combatant than ever. Goyer, who co-wrote the Dark Knight trilogy, revitalizes the legend by taking it seriously, and not in that bummed-out Superman Returns way. In its earthbound passages, Man of Steel turns attention to Clark's adopted father Jonathan (Kevin Costner), who sagely counsels the boy on dealing with X-ray vision and super hearing. More astutely, Goyer's script insinuates a dual paternal conflict into Clark's predicament. The greatness Jor-El expects from him on Earth would bring the dangers Jonathan knows an alien would attract. Choosing to keep his superpowers on the down low, Clark (Cavill) goes on the road, working odd jobs and maintaining the turn-the-other-cheek values Pa Kent taught him. Earth will just have to survive without his help. That is, until he can't resist a maritime rescue and sudden media interest. One snooper is Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams, smart as always). Snyder and editor David Brenner neatly shuffle these time and space elements, thankfully making Man of Steel less step-by-step than usual in a superhero movie. Time is taken for conversations to go elsewhere than exposition and jokes don't come cheaply, if at all. Amir Mokri's cinematography is a major plus, and Hans Zimmer's musical score keeps bombast to a minimum, but he's persistent. Overall it's a smart start to what should be the next big superhero franchise, with Christian Bale done, Robert Downey Jr. eyeing the door, and Tobey Maguire's replacement not impressing much. Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.

"Jun 13, 2013"," Man of Steel is as square as Supermanâs storied jaw. Peel away the pyrotechnics and digital flimflam and what youâve got is an earnest call to civic duty, a paean to America told in close-ups of the flag flapping majestically and No. 2 pencils freshly shaved. You might wonder why Hollywood keeps outsourcing our national comic-book icons to British actors, but put your hand back down: Man of Steel â grave and emphatic, intermittently ravishing and punishingly self-serious â isnât taking questions. The absence of fun or frippery will surprise no one whoâs eyed the credits: Director Zack Snyder (Sucker Punch, Watchmen, 300) and producer/story co-conceiver and DC Comics movie stablemate Christopher Nolan (the Batman franchise) are soul brothers in grim-faced, frantic entertainments. (Letâs call composer Hans Zimmer a first cousin; when he trots out his braaaaaaam belch from Inception, the viewerâs liable to suffer heartburn and wistful memories of John Williamsâ spirits-lifting score from 1978âs Superman.) But Man of Steel isnât as heavy as the Dark Knight films â Supermanâs lighter on his feet, after allÂ â and while it seems no comic-book character these days makes the leap to screen without emotional baggage, screenwriter David S. Goyer (Batman Begins) resists the trend to make Kal-El flat-out tortured. Not that Superman (Cavill) doesnât have much to lament: Heâs the last son of Krypton, his planetâs â and parentsâ âÂ demise forcefully dramatized in an extended prologue that also introduces the traitorous General Zod (Shannon). Considering Supermanâs backstory is probably better embedded in our collective consciousness than that of our Founding Fathersâ, the script smartly scraps a linear plotting of baby Kal-Elâs evolution from alien Ã©migrÃ© into the Kansas-bred loner, Clark Kent, and finally the caped savior of the human race. Instead, impressionistic flashbacks vividly convey Clarkâs coming-of-age â his push/pull between service and a quiet life incognito, what fresh hell it is being âsuperâ when you just want to fit in at junior high â and these scenes of heightened sensitivity and amber-waves-of-grain lighting linger long in the memory, even as the story eventually, predictably, cedes itself over to endless mayhem. Man of Steel falls in line with the contemporary action-movie adage that more is more, with much hurling of bodies and bashing through buildings and a ridiculous amount of artillery spent when any idiot can see bullets bounce off Zod like PEZ candy. None of that zings quite so much as the relatively low-tech spectacle of Zod and Superman hovering in mid-air and simply socking each other like respectable comic-book characters should. Snyder has cast Man of Steel with dramatic actors, not action stars, and it pays off. Diane Lane, as Clarkâs adoptive mother, has a sotto voce bonding session with her young son that will wetly blur more than a few 3-D glasses, and Amy Adams is terrific as the tough but tender Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane; she and Cavill spark like mad, but the filmmakers weirdly keep dampening their charge. And what of Cavill, our new man of steel, little known stateside but for a supporting part on Showtimeâs The Tudors? When given the chance to actually act, heâs good, with shades of greatness â much like the film built around him.

"Jun 13, 2013"," The movie answers the inevitable question — “No, really,                this again?” — by two doing two simple but difficult things: It hits the story from a different angle, and it maintains a reasonably high level of quality. The only inhibiting factor is that, here and there, “Man of Steel” shows symptoms of Iron Man-itis, with long battles that confuse the eye and call to mind a computer screen, not a movie screen. This is, alas, a modern disease, most virulent in June and July. It's also worth noting that of all of Snyder's pictures, “Man of Steel” is the least identifiable as his work. The movie lacks the strong directorial signature, the strange dark intuition that made “Watchmen” and “300” so successful and even the failed “Sucker Punch” interesting. Written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, the team that wrote “Batman Begins,” this new entry could just as accurately have been called “Superman Begins,” with its concentration on the angst of growing up different. In true Goyer-Nolan fashion, Krypton is a lot like Earth, only worse. Its leaders are complacent, and the planet has a serious environmental problem: It is about to blow up. Until it does, Snyder has the opportunity to create a world of rock and dark metal, with little metallic pods with sunflower-like faces hovering everywhere. The pods are robots and sound something like the iPhone's Siri, but without the wit. After the baby Superman is sent in a rocket ship to Earth, the screenplay does something quite shrewd, in terms of audience patience. It skips ahead to show Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) as a grown man, but then accounts for his childhood, in considerable detail, through flashbacks. Because “Man of Steel” dares to take the Superman story seriously enough to pursue its real-world implications, we get to see how difficult it is for a little kid to live with X-ray vision. And we witness the gravity with which Superman's adoptive father (Kevin Costner) goes about raising a boy who can either save or wreck the world. Though he often comes across as a chatterbox in interviews, Costner is the best living actor at playing quiet American integrity and decency. We tend not to talk about Supermen the way we talk about James Bond, but if TV's George Reeves was Sean Connery, Cavill is Daniel Craig. He is in remarkable physical shape, possesses an underlying emotional turbulence and makes us believe that he really cares about people. “Superman Returns” was hampered by a villain more appealing than Superman. Here that's not an issue, not with a truly menacing and unhinged Michael Shannon as General Zod, flying through the universe all bug-eyed and raving, ready to depopulate the Earth. And not with a woman of substance, such as Amy Adams' Lois Lane, in Superman's corner. Adams is as inspired a bit of casting as Kirsten Dunst was in the first “Spider-Man” series. Somehow no planetary calamity counts for anything unless it happens in New York, where the likes of Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and his Daily Planet staff can watch from the large picture windows. And so New York takes an even bigger beating here than San Francisco took in “Star Trek Into Darkness.” What will future psychologists and historians see in our era's recurring fantasies of urban destruction? When Zod takes over the world's TV screens, it's like a moment out of a Cold War sci-fi from the 1950s. And while we're posing questions with no answers, why is Clark Kent identified as 33, even though the actor playing him is only 30? Is Superman supposed to be the returned Jesus, or a second messiah? “Man of Steel” runs 143 minutes but would have been better at 125, with 18 minutes of street fights between super-human beings trimmed. There's really nothing interesting about watching equally matched super-beings fight it out, because we have no sense of their power — anything is possible, so nothing has meaning. However, in whatever cut, the shot of Superman flying through an oil tanker and then a gas station, causing two explosions in his wake, deserves to be retained as a magnificent example of glorious summer overkill.",POSITIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," (L-r) AMY ADAMS as Lois Lane and CHRISTOPHER MELONI as Colonel Nathan Hardy in Warner Bros. Picturesâ?? and Legendary Picturesâ?? action adventure â??MAN OF STEEL,â? a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Are you ready for “Jesus Christ: Superman”? It’s not a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, but rather “Man of Steel.” in which the hero’s celestial father sends his only begotten son to Earth to save the human race from a demonic adversary. If you watch carefully, the Christ symbolism is rampant. This reboot of the Superman franchise by director Zack Snyder (“Sucker Punch”) and producer Christopher Nolan (“The Dark Knight”) is neither great nor dead on arrival. It is kind of like last summer’s “The Avengers” without the snappy dialogue or the fun. Russell Crowe plays a Maximus-ized version of Jor-El in a lengthy opening sequence set on Krypton, where S means “hope” and which is due to explode due to a problem with its core. There is a problem with the film’s core, too, as Brit Henry Cavill, who is the Daniel Craig of Supermen as far as physique is concerned, is otherwise a big, boring stiff. After landing in Kansas (add “Wizard of Oz” joke), young Kal-El is redubbed Clark Kent by farmer Jonathan Kent (a soulful Kevin Costner) and wife Martha (a fine Diane Lane), and as a boy (a very good Dylan Sprayberry) is taught some variation of the mantra, “with such power, blah, blah, blah.” At the meaningful age of 33, after drifting and toiling at a series of jobs, super-hunky-rebel-without-a-cause Kal-El shaves, dons the cape and costume (minus red trunks) and battles General Zod (a too-subdued Michael Shannon), a Krypton military leader who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone with his minions after leading a failed rebellion. Zod has arrived on Earth in a big black beetle of a spaceship and wants to turn the planet into another Krypton. In the supporting cast, Laurence Fishburne, Christopher Meloni, Harry Lennix and Richard Schiff are strong. By my count, Superman has two fathers and at least three mothers counting Krypton’s Lara (Ayelet Zurer of “Angels & Demons”), Martha Kent and the Lois Lane of 38-year-old Amy Adams, who in this variation is an investigative reporter for the surprisingly thriving Daily Planet.

"Jun 13, 2013"," It must be the last act of superhero revisionism: abolishing the word ""super"". In this new movie directed by Zack Snyder, and produced and co-written by Christopher Nolan, the letter on our hero's chest doesn't mean what we all thought it meant. This is no English S, but a Krypton symbol denoting hope. The word ""Superman"" is stutteringly or suspiciously pronounced, like ""the bat man"" in the Dark Knight movies. He is referred to by his earthling name, Clark, or his Krypton name, Kal-El, or even as the ""alien"", by the frowning Pentagon brass. This is a 21st-century superhero who must steel himself against the agonies of being misunderstood by the people he is trying to help. The origin myth is perhaps the most interesting part of any superhero story; for some, the only interesting part. Snyder has created a colossal, grandiose genesis for the Man of Steel, a titanic Moses-out-of-Nietzsche tale, a planet-clashing spectacle that is seen perpetually through a glowing, lens-flaring light: the opposite of the twilight of the gods – the daybreak of the titans. We go way, way back, substantially before Clark Kent coolly makes his career leap into journalism, joining the Daily Planet as a ""stringer"", a move that incidentally shows that CV-faking must be one of his superpowers. There are some striking ideas and images, and interesting casting for the chief role. To go with his gym-built, digitally assisted pecs, abs and thighs, Britain's Henry Cavill has a thin, intriguingly pale and sensitive face, with a buttock-cleft on his nose, like George Osborne, a nose that will surely make him very identifiable up close in the Planet newsroom, chunky glasses or no chunky glasses. Cavill's Clark has an fraught relationship with his tough foster-mom and troubled foster-dad: nice performances from Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. He faces off satisfyingly with his terrifying Krypton enemy, General Zod, of whom more in a moment. But this story doesn't quite have the wit of Joss Whedon's assembly of Avengers, nor the gothic seriousness of Nolan's Dark Knight, and the all-important romantic spark with Lois Lane, played by Amy Adams, sadly isn't there. There's naturally a lot of swooping and flying: compulsory for 3D films. Snyder and Nolan have modified the beginning of the story so that a primal clash has been designed into the narrative from the get-go. (There is, as yet, no sign of the famous adversary Lex Luthor, although keen-eyed observers will later note trucks on the streets of the Metropolis belonging to ""Lexcorp"".) The planet Krypton is dying, because of environmental issues. Dignified soldier-statesman Jor-El rails against mismanagement of the planet's resources; he is played by Russell Crowe with a posh British accent, presumably hailing from a part of the planet far distant from that of General Zod, played by Michael Shannon with an American accent. Zod uses the crisis to launch a failed mutiny against the planet's revered leaders. At the same time, Jor-El and his grieving wife, Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), launch baby Kal-El in a tiny escape capsule as the planet is consumed by fire. The child finally arrives on Earth to be named Clark Kent, and the rest is history, remembered and effectively narrated in flashback glimpses by traumatised, grownup Clark. But it isn't long before Zod reappears and makes his way to Earth with intergalactic dominion on his mind. The Man of Steel decides his loyalties are with his new friends: the Earthlings, who are nonetheless suspicious. Shannon does what he does as Zod, and this role has reasserted this actor's virtual monopoly on scary-with-a-touch-of-integrity roles. He certainly won't be getting the Gene Kelly part in any upcoming remake of Singin' in the Rain. Zod's head-butting confrontations with Superman, and indeed Jor-El, always look plausible, and I liked Kal-El's epiphany of horror as he realises what Zod's intentions are: a Pol Pot-style heap of skulls. Lois Lane is a pretty supercilious star journalist, on the trail of the Man of Steel ever since rumours of his adolescent feats of strength started to leak out, and prone to temper tantrums with her editor, Perry White, played by Laurence Fishburne. ""I'm a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter!"" she yelps. ""Then act like it!"" booms Perry. That, of course, is what Amy Adams thinks she's doing, but her role is sketchily conceived in this fanboy creation. This is a great, big, meaty, chewy superhero adventure, which broadly does what it sets out to do, though at excessive length. What I missed were the gentle, innocent pleasures of Superman's day-to-day crimefighting existence, depicted in normal sunlight and in primary colours: the bullets exploding harmlessly on the chest, the casually lifted automobile, the look of horror on the faces of low-level bad guys, the awestruck Rockwell kid's gratitude. Due to the cataclysmic battle in this film, much of the Man of Steel's mystery and novelty have been used up. Subsequent adventures may lose altitude.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2013"," It has been seven and one half decades since Superman made his debut in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. Since then, we have seen many revisions, especially in his big screen carnations, of this most popular and resilient of super heroes. The latest reimagining of this iconic figure comes to life, again, with the “Man of Steel.” With Krypton on the verge of implosion, General Zod (Michael Shannon, ""Take Shelter,"" ""The Iceman"") attempts an overthrow of the ruling committee whose energy mining has devastated the planet's core. Scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has another plan, he and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer, ""Munich"") having just given the first natural birth in centuries, and although he dies at Zod's hands, he succeeds in sending his son Kal-El and the codex which will ensure the survival of their species to Earth where the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), Kansas farmers, will raise the boy, keeping his secret as a ""Man of Steel."" With a story credit going to producer Christopher Nolan and his Batman trilogy's screenwriter David S. Goyer on board, it's clear that this Superman reboot is aiming for the dark side. But director Zack Snyder (""300,"" ""Sucker Punch"") gets mired down in origin story-itis, dwelling on the science fiction aspects that have less to do with the Superman than his planet's story. It's telling that the film's most emotional and heroic scene belongs to Kevin Costner. We touch base with Clark Kent as a young boy (Cooper Timberline, later Dylan Sprayberry, both well matched to Cavill) trying to come to grips with the over stimulation caused by Earth's atmosphere in school, his odd behavior marking him an outcast. When his school bus plunges over a bridge, young Clark (Henry Cavill, ""Red Riding Hood,"" ""Immortals"") cannot resist the urge to save everyone and witnesses draw unwanted attention. The adult Clark drifts from job to job trying to maintain his human facade, but when a large object is discovered underground, encased in 20,000 year old ice, he's spied by reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). His actions on board the Kryptonian ship also attract the notice of Zod, who, along with his followers, come to Earth demanding he be turned over. And so, at its core, ""Man of Steel"" is about the melding of Kal-El and Clark Kent, a man granted super human powers on his adopted home struggling to find balance. Look and you'll find Christ allegories. Snyder, however, seems more interested in rampant destruction - by the time the film's coda comes around you'll be left wondering just how The Daily Planet building was still standing. Smallville's center becomes a battlefield where planes and trains are used in hand to hand combat. The film's look is a mishmash, Snyder's penchant for desaturation evident and annoying. Director of photography Amir Mokri (""Fast & Furious,"" ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"") certainly makes Cavill look good, but there's so much artificiality flying around the screen, it's distracting, glowing blue lights on ships calling more attention to themselves than highlighting the craft as intended. There is one great effect where Krypton's history is animated behind the actors like a great evolving silvered Diego Rivera mural, but it also appears metal pin art was big on the planet, their communication stations supplied by Brookstone. Be forewarned that the film was not shot in 3D, but converted, an unnecessary addition. One character comments that Superman is hot, and Cavill certainly looks the part. He gives the role a conflicted dignity. Shannon is a ruthless Zod, but Crowe, whose 'spirit' keeps popping up, is an uninteresting foe, perhaps confusing Krypton for Vulcan. Costner is the film's moral compass and, supported by the maternal Lane, the film's greatest asset. Also notable is Christopher Meloni (""42"") as Colonel Hardy, the man who decides Superman is not an enemy. Harry Lennix (""Titus"") is on hand for an Obama drone jab. ""Man of Steel"" booms with portent but is weak in character development. It's just good enough to warrant the inevitable, hopefully better followup. A young woman (Andrea Riseborough) walks down a deserted country road at night and, from a passing van, is seen by the leader of an evil cult. Soon, they abduct the woman, with the help of a demonic motorcycle gang, with not very nice intent. This sets her battered boyfriend, Red (Nicolas Cage), on a path of vengeance in his search for “Mandy.” Sophomore writer-director Panos Cosmatos creates a funky revenge vehicle for Nicolas Cage to drive around in with his story of the brutal cult, led by the charismatic Jeremiah (Linus Roache), who kidnaps Mandy, brutalizing Red in the process. Then, comes his revenge. I have always had an affectionate spot for Nicolas Cage. He has been brilliant and awarded for it (“Leaving Las Vegas (1995)” earned him an Oscar) but also did a lot of for-the-money projects to pay his bills. Still, I have always enjoyed watching him even when not so much the movie. “Mandy” is a flick for horror fans and I am not really a horror fan. But, it is fun to watch Nic Cage chew scenery in his blood-covered persona as he does battle, wielding his hand-forged axe and crossbow, with the murderous forces of evil. But, that is about all that “Mandy” held in store for me.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," If you have read my reviews for any length of time you will know that one of my many film bias is an extreme dislike of talking animals in my movies. Generally, they creep me out and take me right out of the experience. The one exception to that rule was The Chronicles of Narnia. I didn’t think that was a perfect film, but I liked it well enough to go and read all of the books. I always thought Prince Caspian was a pretty weak book. It was too short, the lead character Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) was a whiney little #$## who didn’t do much in it, but the book’s biggest sin was it didn’t really delve into what it must of been like for the Pevensie kids – High King Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), Edmund Pevensie The Just (Skandar Keynes), Lucy Pevensie – The Valiant (Georgie Henley) and Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell) adjusted to the idea that they were adult Kings and Queens trapped as powerless 13 – 16 year old children.  The book missed an opportunity to explore this dichotomy.  When we first see the Pevensie kids we see how they are adjusting – not well. Peter is getting into fights over the most minor slights and it’s up to Edmund to protect his back. And that’s the beautiful thing about this movie – it’s how the Pevensie family has become so close to each other and wise.  In the first film they were typical one dimensional kids and the kid actors were clearly out of the element.  Here, they are very self aware and self assured as both actors and characters. There are times when you watch this movie where you can really see the duality of their personalities. You get that yes while they may look like kids, they truly are the former great Kings and Queens that they once were.  It’s in their eyes, the way they move, and how they act. These kids could never had pulled this complexity of emotion off in the first film, but here it’s as if they were born to play these parts. The change in Edmund and Susan are the most pronounced. Edmund is a bad ass, calculating warrior that will do anything to protect his family, especially his brother Peter. While Susan has grown to be quite the fighter herself, the camera loves her and director Andrew Adamson showcases her perfectly, especially during the sweeping battles. When Susan breaks out the bow and arrow it’s a thing of beauty and pleasure to watch. As far as the animals go, I had the biggest concern for the noble mouse Reepicheep, I didn’t care for his character in the book, but he’s great in the film. In one of our many emails, I think Sheldon summed up why Caspian works so well the best – it’s because the filmmakers chose to “make Caspian, naïve, rather than whiney.” And that subtle change makes all the difference in the world. Caspian comes across as stronger in the movie, more pro-active, not someone who just let’s things happen to him. He’s also self-involved at the most inopportune times.  I like the fact that the film really played up the rivalry between Peter and Caspian. In the book Caspian just let Peter do everything without complaining or standing up for himself. Here Caspian calls Peter on his sometime “arrogance.”   The writers Andrew Adamson (screenplay), Christopher Markus (screenplay),  and Stephen McFeely took the best of C.S. Lewis’ work and expanded it to make it better.  It’s a shame that Peter and Susan won’t be in the next film, because they will be missed.  Everything about Prince Caspian is just right in terms of cinematography, scope and vision; the tone is dark but hopeful, and epic but intimate. While watching the battle scenes, the only thought going through my mind was, I hope the final Harry Potter film is a 10th as good as this was – . Bring on Eustace and Dawn Treader!",NEGATIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," Once upon a time, comic books were seen as mere kids' stuff, trifling little things meant to keep junior quiet in the back seat of long car drives and such. That was then, though. Now, in an era in which Marvel Studios can boast two billion-dollar grossers in a single calendar year (""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers""), comic-bookery has become very serious business indeed. Which explains why ""Man of Steel"" -- director Zack Snyder's grave, humorless reboot of D.C. Comics' Superman legend, landing in theaters today (June 14) -- is such a very serious movie. So we get no zippy, Tony Stark-flavored one-liners. No comic-relief characters. No nonsense. But that means we also get no up, up and away, either. This flashback-happy version of the Superman origin story -- which fluctuates between scattered and generic -- doesn't have time for any of that. Not only does actor Henry Cavill's Clark Kent have existential questions to answer concerning where, exactly, he came from, but he's also got a planet to save when fellow Krypton refugee General Zod (Michael Shannon) shows up with his gang of black-suited outlaws to crush these puny Earthlings. Granted, there are some positives to the dead-seriousness of it all. Superman doesn't wear those ridiculous red briefs over his costume this time, for starters. He can't get away with spinning the Earth backwards on its axis to go back in time and save a certain reporter, either. And there's no trace of green but gung-ho Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, whom I could always give or take anyway. And, truth be told, there's no reason why a superhero film can't dabble in darkness. Exploring the complexities of heroism is an interesting proposition, and Cavill's Clark is intriguingly deep and thoughtful. But in the process, Snyder forgets to make his movie fun. That's not exactly easy to to do when telling a story about a guy who can leap tall buildings in a single bound and laser-beam his way through steel using only his eyeballs, but there it is. Instead of ""truth, justice and the American way,"" we get not-so-subtle religious allegory; moments of furiously intense drama; and enormous, expensive fight sequences that -- while incorporating dazzling effects and showcasing Snyder's proficiency with visuals -- go on so long as to become boring. That tone starts right out of the gate, in fact, with a ridiculously overwritten and overshot opening sequence, set on Superman's doomed home planet of Krypton and in which his biological father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), famously sends the infant of steel on his way to the presumably safe harbor of Earth (to live among its ""seemingly intelligent population""). That scene also serves to lay out the backstory of the evil General Zod -- which is useful, narrative-wise -- as well as to introduce the McGuffin that will send him scouring the universe for the son of Jor-El. It is rarely a good idea, however, to spend 20 minutes on a scene that requires but five. That's not to say there aren't things to like about Snyder and company's film. Even with its sense of coldness, it is easier to embrace than director Bryan Singer's 2006 ""Superman Returns,"" which was intended to re-start the franchise but which was eventually abandoned by the mulligan-minded Warner Bros. A major reason for that is the spot-on casting. Cavill (""The Tudors,"" ""Immortals"") makes an outstanding Clark Kent / Superman. Not only does he fill out the newly redesigned Supersuit nicely, but he's also got an ability to portray strength and vulnerability, courage and compassion, intelligence and optimism -- and all with little more than a look. And if you want intensity -- as Snyder clearly does -- Michael Shannon is pitch-perfect as Zod. Not only does Shannon have a slight angry-alien look about him to start with, but he does simmering rage as well as anyone in Hollywood. He does aneurysmal rage even better. He's also one of the few people who can pull off such lines as: ""I will harvest the codex from your son's corpse and rebuild Krypton on his bones!"" (Other cast members include Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark's Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent; and Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet editor Perry White.) Even with its flaws, ""Man of Steel"" will make a mint at the box office. Fans can rest assured that a sequel will be forthcoming, too -- and possibly even before that ""Justice League"" film lands. And that's a good thing -- because while ""Man of Steel"" is a passable entry in the Superman canon, it leaves plenty to build on.

"Jun 13, 2013"," One of the crucial aspects of superheroes is the notion of the secret identity, the physical and psychic split in the character that delineates the real person from the heroic persona. Whenever this narrative conceit is examined, the conversation always turns to Superman and Batman, as they were the first two of the modern superheroes, arguably the ones from which all others have evolved. The consensus is that where the Caped Crusader is concerned, Bruce Wayne is the false front behind which Batman hides, while Superman is the identity the Man of Tomorrow takes on when the day needs to be saved, but Clark Kent is the real person, the conscience behind the brawn, the moral center that guides this mighty being. It's an important distinction and one that director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Goyer fail to recognize in ""Man of Steel,"" a massive, flawed reboot of the character that is so bent on delivering one earsplitting, eye-straining action sequence after another that it forgets the human element that is vital to fully realizing this modern myth. To be sure, having to come up with a new approach to a character that's 75 years old is hardly an enviable task, and the tack Snyder and Goyer takes is as good as any. One of the things that has made the Superman story such an enduring American tale is that Kal-El, the Last Son of Krypton, is the ultimate immigrant, and the film focuses on the sense of otherness that he feels. Much is made of the character trying to find himself and realize his purpose on a planet where he is constantly reminded that he will be forever different than those around him, and his journey toward self-realization makes up a good chunk of the film's first hour. Along the way, there is action, spectacle, more action, the sight of Russell Crowe as Kal's father Jor-El riding a dragon-thingie on Krypton and even more action in case you forgot this was a superhero movie. Problem is, there's no Clark Kent. Sure, we see him briefly as a confused young boy, trying to deal with powers he doesn't understand and the easy target of bullies who have figured out the boy won't fight back. But as far as the adult Clark Kent, he's missing in action, robbing the audience of a way to connect with the character, as we're not allowed to see Kal come to terms with his humanity. There's no sexual tension between Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Superman and his alter ego, there's not a dilemma over whether Clark should reveal his true nature to the object of his affection. There's no wonder. There's no humor. There's no charm. Action, though — oh, there's plenty of that, much of it done well as the villain of the piece, General Zod (a fine Michael Shannon), sets out to terraform Earth to become the new Krypton. Spectacle abounds, and while I got a kick out of the destruction of Smallville, what with locomotive engines being thrown through the air and the local IHOP laid to waste, by the time we got to the razing of Metropolis, I was numb from the unrelenting pace and excessive nature of the set pieces that end up abusing the audience rather than entertaining them. As the title character, Henry Cavill is given little to do, as he is required to simply act heroically and fill out the famous suit, which he does ably. He's not allowed to show what he's capable of by juggling the roles of Kent and Superman. That will have to wait for the next film. Only Crowe and Kevin Costner as the hero's Earth father Jonathan tap into the emotional gravity necessary to making this a special film in the superhero genre rather than another bloated exercise in computer-generated effects, which it is. Snyder's problem has always been his sledgehammer approach, and the unrelenting pace of going from one action scene to the next doesn't allow for the characters to develop or us to breathe. I longed for a moment where a bumbling Clark attempted to ask Lois out or a moment of joy where the young alien reveled happily in his powers, something I could relate to. No such port is accorded in this special-effects storm, which underscored Superman's otherness so well that I was left with a hero I didn't recognize. Cast: Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Christopher Meloni, Richard Schiff, Harry Lennix, Ayelet Zurer, Dylan Sprayberry and Cooper Timberline. A Warner Brothers release. 143 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction and some language.) At AMC Village Mall 6, Harvest Moon Drive-In and Savoy 16. Richard Linklater's ""Before"" films are a special collection of movies that not only take a unique look at romantic love but remind us how engaging the fine art of conversation can be in capable hands. ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) introduced us to Jesse (Ethan Hawke), a young American tourist on a train to Vienna who meets and has an immediate connection with a French student named Celine (Julie Delpy). They end up spending a romantic evening together, knowing that because of previous commitments, this will be their only moment to share. However, the success of that film led to ""Before Sunset"" (2004) in which she tracks him down at a book signing in which he's promoting a novel based on their experience nine years earlier. More talk ensues leading to the possibility these two may have more than one night or day together in their future. Which brings us to ""Before Midnight,"" which finds Jesse and Celine as a married couple who are trying to keep alive the romantic spark that once raged between them but has now faded to a flicker. The commitment and complications inherent to marriage has put a strain on them while the responsibility of raising their twins has naturally added its own brand of stress. However, it's Jesse's son from his previous marriage that's causing the current bout of tension between them. Feeling as though he's failing as an absentee father, Jesse wants to relocate to Chicago, while Celine is adamant that they stay in Paris where she is about to start a new job. What makes these films so special — and ""Before Midnight"" is the best of a good bunch — is the chemistry between the two stars. They remind us how rich the lost art of conversation can be, as the movie is made up of nothing more than four extended discussions between the two as they drive and walk around one of the Greek Islands where Jesse and his family have spent the summer at a writer's colony. There's a comfortable familiarity between Hawke and Delpy that can't be faked, and surely much of their closeness comes from the writing and improvisation process they go through in the making of these films. When anecdotes are related, feelings shared and grievances aired, there's a sense of intimacy between the two that seems to spring organically between them. As a result, the problems the couple wrestles with are easy to relate to. It is something special to behold. If there is a fault in the film, it is that it insists on having things both ways where romantic love is concerned. When issues of infidelity, overfamiliarity and trust emerge, they're handled in such a raw, visceral manner that you know we've gotten as far from Nicholas Sparks' territory as possible. ""Before Midnight"" is brave to do so, but it can't help but be sucked back into the romantic ideal with an ending that loses its nerve and seemingly leaves Jesse and Celine on far firmer ground than they deserve. James DeMonaco's ""The Purge"" hints — and I mean hints — that it might be a socially relevant film that imagines that today's divide between the ""Haves"" and the ""Have Nots"" will develop into a blood sport in the near future. Its premise of Social Darwinism in action is an intriguing one and, in braver hands, could have resulted in a pointed indictment of the financial inequalities in our country. However, to take such a tack requires nerve, something DeMonaco lacks as his film takes the easy way out and proves to be nothing more than yet another senseless ode to violence. The time is 2022, and things are looking up in the good old U. S. of A. The crime rate has fallen to a record low, and unemployment is down to 1 percent. Seems this is all due to a radical idea implemented by the New Founding Fathers known as the Purge, a single night where for a 12-hour period, anyone can commit any crime without fear of prosecution. Apparently, knowing that you have one evening to let loose keeps everyone in check for 364 days. Jow this leads to lower unemployment is something Alan Greenspan will have to explain, because I don't see the connection. But why quibble about details when DeMonaco doesn't? The film focuses on the Sandin family that lives in a gated community with the patriarch James (Ethan Hawke), a successful security systems salesman; Mary (Lena Headey), a homemaker who is proud of her carb-free meals; Zoey (Adelaide Kane), the petulant daughter from central casting; and Charlie (Max Burkholder), an introverted teenager whose sole function is to let a homeless man who is being hunted during the Purge into the family's home after they've holed up behind their steel windows and reinforced walls. This sets the plot, what there is of it, in motion as a group of prep school killers come calling, requesting that the Sandins throw their prey out so they can continue to purge. If their request isn't met, then the family's humble McMansion will be turned to rubble, and they will be killed as well. With only a modest $5 million budget to work with, DeMonaco's intent is to make an effective, economical siege drama. Problem is that the plot devices he uses to move the story along simply don't hold water. The fact that Mary can't keep her daughter by her side, generating false tension as her father may shoot her as he tries to find the unwanted intruder in their darkened home is insulting, while Charlie's insistence on repeatedly treating common sense as a quality that's to be ignored at every turn makes him immediate fodder for the next year's purge.",NEUTRAL

Full disclosure: I'm a big Superman fan. I get giddy even hearing rumors about a new Superman movie. Let me put it this way: not only did I religiously watch every episode of ""Smallville"" but I'm actually one of the few that liked ""Superman Returns"". It's taken me a while to understand why Bryan Singer's 2006 flop wasn't embraced by the fans or the public, but I get it now: that film not only revered the Superman mythology but also the 1970s Richard Donner films (which I grew up on and loved). I, like that movie, was stuck in the past. So it gives me great pleasure to say that with ""Man of Steel"" this generation finally has its very own Superman movie. And it's a triumph. It's not a surprise that the team to make it happen is the same one behind the Batman reboot. The story, by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, is every bit as reverent and grounded (and - frankly - humorless) as the Christian Bale ""Batman"" movies. Though it lacks some of the fun (and the John Williams score) typically associated with everyone's favorite Kryptonian, ""Man of Steel"" gives the Superman character a place in the pantheon of great, modern superhero films. The script's smart structure (like that of ""Batman Begins"") wisely dispenses with a linear origin story - instead, intercutting scenes of his boyhood travails in Smallville with the adult Clark Kent trying to find his place in society. When we meet Clark, he's a wanderer, taking odd jobs across the country. This leads him to a mysterious discovery beneath the ice in Canada, and a wily reporter named Lois Lane (a perfectly prickly Amy Adams). Henry Cavill wears Clark's super-burden well. He's torn between his Kryptonian upbringing (typified by Russell Crowe in a nicely subdued turn) and his Kansas adopted parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, both effective and affecting). The story is driven by Clark's struggle to become a hero and reveal himself to a world that might not be ready. This is all given a jumpstart by the appearance of General Zod (Michael Shannon, finding his own take on an iconic character in a way Benedict Cumberbatch could not in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"") who has plans of his own for Earth. If ""Man of Steel"" suffers from one thing it's PAMD: Post-""Avengers"" Mess Disorder"" - the need to take mayhem to preposterous levels. Like the NYC climax in Joss Whedon's opus, and the recent (and needless) San Francisco starship crash in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", the final battle in ""Man of Steel"" features an almost incomprehensible amount of destruction. It gets so ridiculous that when a bystander remarks, ""He saved us!"", you actually find yourself thinking, ""Did he?"" Even with the countless trillions of dollars in damage and lives lost? (Lest we forget, Christopher Reeve's Superman knew to lead Zod out of Manhattan to protect the city.) But I digress. ""Man of Steel"" is the Superman movie we've been waiting for. This is easily director Zack Snyder's most mature movie - even taking ""Watchmen"" into account. He finally finds the balance between worship and respect; mimicry and adaptation. The effects are flawless, the fights between the Kryptonians are appropriately brutal, and there's none of the fetishistic slo-mo that scuttled his ill-conceived ""Sucker Punch"". As a side note: don't bother with the 3D version of the film - it was added in post-production and adds nothing to the film. This may be ironic in light of Clark Kent's signature disguise, but ""Man of Steel"" makes the Superman character three-dimensional without the need for the funny glasses.",POSITIVE

"Jun 13, 2013"," First of all, it’s another damn origin story. Superman’s origin is not only the most well-known piece of superhero lore, it’s also an established piece of American mythology, and as such does not need to be rehashed every time the character has a new onscreen adventure. Or, at least, it doesn’t need to be rehashed at this length, in which it takes 20 minutes just for baby Kal-El to be sent forth into space from his dying home planet of Krypton. But since Man of Steel is a modern superhero blockbuster, this is all standard operating procedure: The movie runs nearly two and a half hours and has to turn every little bit of storytelling into an operatic, explosive set piece. Director Zack Snyder actually seems most at home in this early sequence, however, getting to indulge his penchant for stylized, ornate action. Snyder’s Krypton is full of ridiculous impractical costumes, strange winged beasts and insect-like spaceships battling under an ominous sky. The movie’s first 20 minutes are as cloying and overstuffed as Snyder’s most exhausting past work (bludgeoning epics like 300 and Sucker Punch). It might be painful to watch, but it at least has a recognizable style. Then the movie crashes down to Earth, and it turns into a long slog through familiar elements of current action-blockbuster filmmaking. Producer Christopher Nolan and go-to superhero screenwriter David S. Goyer craft a story that recalls Nolan’s three Batman films, completely grim and humorless and plodding. That often works for Batman, but Superman is meant to be an upbeat embodiment of the American spirit, an outsider who comes to Earth and embraces everything good about humanity. The version in Man of Steel (played competently but unexceptionally by British actor Henry Cavill) is tortured and often angry, and although he does become a champion of humanity, he does so in an almost threatening way. That’s partially because he has to participate in a giant action climax that uncomfortably recalls the final battle in Michael Bay’s third Transformers movie. Villain Zod (Michael Shannon) is a fellow Kryptonian refugee, but his plan is fairly generic world-ending stuff, and its execution involves the wholesale destruction of downtown Metropolis. Buildings collapse as Superman and Zod whale on each other, and the supposed greatest do-gooder of them all only has time to save Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Snyder, Goyer and Nolan are all pros at this kind of large-scale filmmaking, and Man of Steel certainly has its moments of excitement. The always creepy Shannon makes for a solid villain, and some of the flashbacks to Superman’s Kansas upbringing are nicely handled. But overall this is just another product of the proven superhero-industrial complex; it’s part Thor and part Dark Knight and part Transformers, when it should be all Superman. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ...",NEUTRAL

"Jun 12, 2013"," CHICAGO – From the CGI-heavy attack on Krypton that opens Zack Snyder’s “Man of Steel” to its soaring finale, I had the same reaction -– where’s the “Man half? Snyder’s attempt to reboot the Superman legacy with the loving assistance of David Goyer and Christopher Nolan of “The Dark Knight” fame gets the superhero part but misses the humanity at the core of this legendary character. Other than in how Ma and Pa Kent are used thematically to emphasize Superman’s importance, we never get to know Clark Kent and Superman becomes about as human as the video game version of him in “Injustice.” It’s a technically impressive film with a lovely score from Hans Zimmer and some strong supporting performances, all sucked into the joyless machine of Goyer’s script and self-important direction of Mr. Snyder. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) must not only convince his governmental superiors on Krypton that their planet is collapsing but fend off a coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) and protect his newborn son Kal-El, while also imprinting him with the codex that could keep his race alive on an “outpost,” another planet. From the very beginning of “Man of Steel,” Snyder and his team are showing off their technical prowess. Look at those nifty communication devices in which you can see people’s faces like those old pin impression toys! Look at that landscape! Look at those creatures! Look at those winged beasts! Wait, what’s happening? Eh, who cares? There’s a numbing effect to the overload of CGI right from the beginning of “Man of Steel” that only rarely lets up, certainly not so during the final hour and its emphasis on Crash! Boom! Pow! From these opening scenes of CGI overload, the film should calm down and introduce us to Ma (Diane Lane) and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner), while setting up Kal-El/Clark (played as an adult by Henry Cavill) as a normal boy with extraordinary powers. It would be nice to meet a few of the other people in Superman’s world as well, like the lovely Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and her fellow employees at the Daily Planet (including Laurence Fishburne). Nope. Snyder and Goyer follow the over-long prologue with another action scene in which an adult Clark, apparently on walkabout like Bruce Banner, is there at just the right time to save workers from a burning oil rig. That’s followed by a flashback of a younger Clark saving his fellow students (and getting chastised for doing so by Pa, who worries about his powers being revealed). The narrative structure infuriated me. It’s a “highlights” piece more than a film. And it’s a feeling that doesn’t really go away completely although the film does settle down a bit with the introduction of Lois and the return of Zod. I won’t spoil how the latter happens but I will say that the former is another screenwriting misstep. There is zero attempt at building chemistry between Lois and Clark/Superman. She’s practically a co-superhero, knowing Superman’s importance right from the beginning and even encountering Jor-El in a way that had my eyes rolling. This is not “Lois the love interest” or “Lois the damsel-in-distress” or even “Lois the role model”. It’s “Lois the plot device” and it’s a testament to Adams’s likability that she does even this much with so little. In fact, the whole cast rises above the thin characterizations given to them by a screenwriter more concerned about crashing buildings than beating hearts. Shannon, Crowe, Costner, Lane – none of them are bad. And Cavill grounds the piece as well as he possibly can, finding a nice square-jawed approach that still lacks the humanity this piece is missing overall. At least he’s not quite as manic as everyone around him. I just wished someone would smile once or twice. Every line in “Man of Steel” is about what people need to or want to do and how important that action is going to be. Superman is going to save the world you’ll be reminded roughly a hundred times. This is “The Dark Superman.” It is the reimagining of the legendary DC character as not a superhero but a CGI action star. And there’s a difference that I’m not sure Goyer considered. Superheroes are simply greater versions of the heroes we know from everyday life. We see the human flaws in characters like Tony Stark, Bruce Wayne, and all of The X-Men. They need to be relatable to our real world as much as beyond our own capabilities or they become little more than cartoons. In comic book form, the best writers find a way to extend this world of unimaginable heroism into thematic arenas with which we relate.  “Man of Steel” takes us the other way: Sucking all the joy and relatability out of its story until all that’s left is a special effect. “CGI of Steel” isn’t what we needed to reboot Superman, even if the inevitable success of this film along with the sense that they have to find more humanity in the follow-up now that this bombastic origin story is out of the way makes the sequel a likely improvement.  “Man of Steel” stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Antje Traue, Harry Lennix, and Kevin Costner. It was written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder. It opens on June 14, 2013. No true fan watches Superman for the humanity. There are plenty of movies w/”humanity.” But I can’t deny the emphasis on action over emoting was no doubt calculated to draw in international box office. Big box = a sequel. MOS was a beginning, dark, or not. Clark having only just met Lois Lane, had other things on his mind than a candlelight dinner. Like those TV shows that toss in babies & cloying contrived relationship moments in the midst of murder & mayhem i.e. Sons of Anarchy, it’s only for the 3 or 4 extra women viewers who enjoy that goop. You want Soaperman? you can always watch Superman Returns. In your red underwear. . .. Don’t you get it? The problem isn’t with Superman. The problem is with humans! You need to give a Superman something to protect. You need to give him some decency, some nobility, some good worth protecting, worth watching over for. And this is whats real about this real-world Superman. He’s been bullied as a kid all this life. He’s bullied as an adult. He had to watch his own father DIE because his father was convinced the world wasn’t ready for him. This isn’t the 20th-Century rose-tinted Americana world where Superman is a slave to protect the American Dream, this is a 21st-Century where Superman is skeptical, is doubtful and is unsure of the humans. Superman was not designed by his creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to be only a “super” being. He was raised on Earth by humans as a human because let’s face it, his human parents didn’t know how to raise him as a Kryptonian LOL. Your review was spot on. Superman, above all other superheroes, needs his humanity. He needs the “man” in Superman. In fact, Superman is much more defined by his human supporting cast than any other comic book hero.  Geeks will give you grief over a critical review of comic book heroes, but it’s unlikely Superman fans would really disagree with your assessment. I certainly won’t and I’m a lifelong Superman fan. You’re right about how the humanity, warmth and even a naivete has been wiped out of this cinematic version of the big Blue Boyscout. Snyder, et al, listened too closely to the online comic book cheer squad, but not the Superman fandom, and there’s a big difference.  Mind you, this is the same online cheer squad that sent nasty e-mails to a few reviewers regarding their negative reviews for Dark Knight Rises the summer before. Some movie critics don’t seem to understand that the origin story doesn’t need humor to work. All the CGI and whatnot, made them blind to the relatively deep story (way deeper than all previous movies have shown for sure) behind it. This is what you get when good writers (Nolan, Goyer) do the deep back story, fix all the problems from the previous movies or even comics, and then let one of the best action director direct, for the glorious action sequences. Some critics with old/slow minds couldn’t process the story when things happened on the screen fast, which resulted in a feeling that there wasn’t any story at all (or it was dull). Maybe they should review the movie after seeing it in slow motion? MoS takes away all stupid things that made no sense in previous movies. Adds a proper depth to almost every aspect of story. Sure, there is a lot of action, but it’s a movie for the new generation/young people, which doesn’t make it a dull movie, it just means older viewers must watch it few times to see it from all the angles as it should be seen.

"Jun 12, 2013"," Seven years ago, director Bryan Singer tried to relaunch Superman by casting a Christopher Reeve clone (Brandon Routh) and a long-dead Marlon Brando, and retaining that majestic John Williams score. I liked Superman Returns but, while it was no bomb, it performed beneath expectations and producers put Supes on ice. With Man of Steel, Warner Bros. tries anew by giving the son of Jor-El the Christopher Nolan treatment. Nolan doesn't direct, but he does produce, and David S. Goyer, who co-wrote Nolan's Batmans, has penned the script. The result gives us a dull Superman who whines about his parents a lot. I'll say this upfront: Henry Cavill is easily the best-looking Superman by far. I mean, this guy is GORGEOUS. Man of Steel will probably do good box office simply because people will want to spend many summer hours gazing at this positively dreamy guy. I suppose much of the blame for Cavill's flat effort can go to director Zack Snyder. Snyder's films aren't noted for their emotional realism. His thirst for style usually outweighs the need for his performers to deliver anything of depth, unless you count Gerard Butler screaming ""This is Sparta!"" in 300. While I liked the way Snyder delivered his comic adaptation of Watchmen, I started to fret about him helming a Superman movie after the dreadful Sucker Punch. I worried that Superman would get lost in a sea of washed out visuals, extreme speeds both slow and fast and stripper/hookers. Thankfully, he left out the strippers/hookers, but all of his other directorial trademarks made the cut. For instance, whenever Superman flies, he flies like a supersonic jet. The camera is often very far away, and he's just a little speck zipping around. When we see him up close, he's bouncing around so much we can't really enjoy the visual of a man flying. It's like watching a really bad Top Gun movie. This is another origin story, and with Nolan in the mix it's an often somber one. The thing with Superman is that he's supposed to be selfless. His primary concern is saving people's clumsy asses, not who his parents really are. Sure, he cares to a certain extent, but not to the extent that it derails his primary mission of protecting humanity. That's my take on the character. Snyder's film gives us an origin story that starts on Krypton, where Jor-El, Superman's philosopher dad (played well by Russell Crowe) is witnessing the destruction of his planet. Before things go kaboom, he has a final confrontation with the deranged General Zod (Michael Shannon ... easily the best thing in the movie) and launches a ship containing his infant son. Fans of Superman know that he winds up on a farm with earthly caretakers (played winningly by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Without giving too much away, I will tell you that the film takes a different direction with the Clark Kent alter ego, and I wasn't crazy about that direction. The supporting cast is much stronger than Cavill, with Crowe and Costner giving their best work in years. Shannon, in a fierce and frightening performance, almost makes the whole thing worthwhile. While Man of Steel isn't a great, or even good, movie, it does have a highly memorable villain in Zod, the Krypton general determined to see his people live on. In fact, the film suffers whenever Zod isn't on screen. Shannon manages to pierce the stylistic, dulling veil that is Snyder's directing. As Lois Lane, Amy Adams doesn't really factor. The script calls for her to be rather humorless and dull in her own right (It's no wonder she and Superman fall for each other). As her boss, editor Perry White, Laurence Fishburne proves to be a terrible choice. He's in full, droning Morpheus mode in the role. The special effects visuals seemed alternately cramped and spastic, with much of the CGI having that dreaded, cartoonish look. Granted, this could be the product of the screen I saw it on (it was rather small) so I will be watching it a second time on a much larger screen to see if the experience improves. I must also call out the filmmakers for their musical choices. I understand the impulse to separate from the original Superman franchise, but John Williams wrote a great score for those movies and it deserves to be heard whenever an actor puts on the blue tights (Let it be noted that these blue tights don't have the red underwear on the outside ... SACRILEGE!). The score by Hans Zimmer is far from memorable. Clearly, what we are getting here is an attempt by Warner Brothers to have a superhero beyond Batman to compete with all of Marvel's Avengers. I say Marvel truly has the upper hand in the superhero battle, because most of its films of late contain charm, humor and worthy drama to go with their whiz-bang. Man of Steel just has a guy who looks really good in tights, and a villain who far outmatches him in acting prowess. The result is a movie that falls miserably flat. This, paired with the failure of last year's The Hobbit, suddenly positions Warner Bros. as the purveyor of geek nightmares. There's a moment at the end of Man of Steel that left me curious for the future. Perhaps Cavill will come out of his shell in later installments and actually make an impression other than physical in the sequels.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 12, 2013"," 
It's not your father's Superman, but is it your kid's? Man of Steel reprises the plot of Superman II (1980) with the invasion of Earth by a squad of evil Kryptonians. Their leader, the fascist Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon), sports a Mongol beard and a mark of Cain scar; he escaped from entombment in living fiberglass in the Phantom Zone.
 
Can Superman stop them? Maybe. Henry Cavill plays the part with simplicity. Director Zack Snyder prepares us for the circussy uniform by muting the colors and animating the cape so that it is jaunty even in a dead calm.
 
Longtime fans get a small taste of what we came for: a balletic pirouette as Superman glides to earth with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in his arms. We'll never see a Superman movie in which Lois fails to introduce herself as a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. Adams breaks no new ground in the role, but there is a spark between the two of them, and they chat nicely.
 
Mostly, Man of Steel is not a graceful movie, in form or subject. It is about things getting smashed. The finale is a month of Sept. 11ths. Man of Steel doesn't stint on fights and flights, but there's very little spontaneous grace to conflict with the mandatory Hero With a Thousand Faces elements. The origin story is sliced into flashbacks; the story has been so oft-told, it's not a narrative problem. The only problem is how to set the mood.
 
Russell Crowe deploys a Richard Burton accent as Jor-El. I'm not spoiling anything by noting that, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, we don't see the last of Jor-El after he takes one for the team. (Being a woman, Superman's birth mother accepts suttee instead.) The film's design is severely phallic; the Kryptonian armada looks like an explosion at a Good Vibrations store.
 
It may not have been a million-dollar idea to make Krypton a place of virile fascists and doddering civil authority. What puts the edge in Superman's voice is the fact that he's a refugee, which is essential to his ceaseless efforts to keep humans from destroying themselves through crime and war. The filmmakers do the Christian side of the story proud. Superman is 33, the traditional age of Jesus in his last year. In a moment of doubt, he poses in front of a stained-glass window depicting Gethsemane.

"Jun 12, 2013"," This may not be the best Superman movie ever – I’d rate it third, after the first two by Richard Donner and Richard Lester – but it’s certainly the most humourless. It’s also, easily, the noisiest.  Man of Steel is bombastic from start to finish, and when I came out my ears were ringing as though I’d been beaten around the head with tin trays. Like Batman Begins, the first Spider-Man, or the original 1978 Superman, it’s an ‘origins’ story, showing how the man with unconventional views on how to wear underpants descended to Earth and persuaded us he was here to defend not destroy us. Clark Kent, alias Superman (played with maximum handsomeness, a fetching dimple and absolutely no sense of humour by virtually unknown Brit Henry Cavill), has been raised in Texas by salt-of-the-earth farming folk – Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, on good if muted form.  Superman, formerly known as Kal-El, is the son of Kryptonite scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) who likes delivering homilies about how intergalactic species should all get along, until the principal villain gets as bored as we are, and shoots him.  Still, at least repeatedly saving the life of pretty investigative journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) earns him  a kiss. It’s too bad that Cavill’s superhuman stiffness makes it look as though she’s trying to snog a piece of granite. Like virtually every other superhero movie, the film takes the form of super-ginormous explosions leading up to a climactic battle that trashes a major city. If it’s fighting you like, or very loud music, or ultra-simple plotlines that stretch on interminably with characterisation of similar complexity to The Teletubbies, Man of Steel delivers.  Initially, it promises a lot more. The opening 15 minutes on the dying, spectacularly volcanic  planet Krypton have a visual imagination that is regrettably not sustained throughout the remaining two hours-plus. The actors’ talents are pretty much wasted on a screenplay that’s woefully po-faced. It wouldn’t have killed the writer to come up with colourful characters.   Director Zack Snyder gave us the Spartan battle epic 300, Watchmen and the awful Sucker Punch. Another obvious influence is the movie’s British producer Christopher Nolan, of Dark Knight fame. NoNe are known for their lightness of touch and they all take their comic-strip culture very seriously indeed. The Christian iconography of God sending his son down to save humanity is very much present. This is the kind of script in which the only language spoken is fluent exposition. For me, the action sequences last many minutes longer than they ought to, and I can’t help feeling that at some point even fanboys will tire of seeing what is essentially the same movie over and over again.

"Jun 12, 2013"," If no movie like ""Man of Steel"" had ever been made before – an attempt to darken up a superhero legend with a little mythological depth, some cutting-edge cinematic skills and a whole bunch of action – then Zack Snyder's brooding and seemingly endless 143-minute Superman reboot might feel like a breakthrough. (I guess the ""Superman Returns"" reboot from 2006 really didn't take.) To be fair, ""Man of Steel"" has an idea behind it and superior production design, which puts it ahead of a whole bunch of Hollywood movies. Superman aficionados will no doubt find it suitably canonical, with an extended prologue set on the dying planet of Krypton, even if Superman's classic uniform is now made of that inevitable nylon-mesh athletic fiber that supposed to suggest contemporary coolness (if you're 12 years old and really into LeBron James). But despite looking, feeling and (especially) sounding expensive – this is one of the loudest summer spectacles of recent years – ""Man of Steel"" is second-tier and third-generation Chris Nolan-flavored neo-superhero material. Nolan chose not to direct this film, but co-wrote the original story with David S. Goyer (who wrote the final screenplay) and is one of the producers. I feel at least some compassion for Snyder, a director of immense ambition and technical skill whose work has yielded intriguingly mixed results in ""Sucker Punch,"" ""Watchmen,"" ""300"" and other movies. Here he finds himself in the impossible position of trying to put his own stamp on material that feels a lot like ""Dark Knight Lite,"" while avoiding the impression of serving as Nolan's surrogate or transcriber. Unfortunately he can't pull it off, and ""Man of Steel"" has all the Nolan-esque tics you expect, from the Leni Riefenstahl heroic extreme close-ups to the oversize muscles and proto-fascist (or flat-out fascist) iconography to the creepy-looking technology ripped off from ""Alien"" to the assaultive and incoherent action sequences that go on so long you yearn for death, or at least for deafness. In the best moments of the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, Nolan made you feel like the movies captured a certain gloomy or cynical insight into human nature, and in particular into the cycles of corruption and delusion that drive human politics. But while Batman is an isolated and peculiar rich man with human failings, Superman is a godlike being from another galaxy, created to inhabit the infantile fantasy lives of young children. Any attempt to invest him with philosophical depth risks becoming moronic and/or offensive almost immediately. Indeed, it feels as if the idea for ""Man of Steel"" emerged from a sultry afternoon meeting when Goyer and Nolan played air hockey and drank Mountain Dew for hours until one of them said, ""Hey! Superman! Didn't Nietzsche write a book about him?"" When it intermittently pretends to be about something, ""Man of Steel"" tries to split the difference between the old DC Comics or TV serial Superman, a square-jawed dude devoted to ""truth, justice and the American way,"" and the entirely different Nietzschean concept of the Übermensch, which even scholars of philosophy have a tough time pinning down. Superman is beyond good and evil, but chooses the ideology of Americanism, out of the infinite options available to him, in order to placate the idiotic sheeple of our planet. Or something like that. Back on Krypton before the whole place blows up, Superman's dad Jor-El (a suitably grave and hirsute Russell Crowe) makes clear that he understands his infant son will be received as a god by the lesser beings of Earth, and will form a kind of mystical bridge between his own people and ours. (I hadn't noticed until now how much the Superman story resembles Mormon theology, or Scientology.) Once the baby Kal-El lands in Kansas and becomes Clark Kent, his human dad (Kevin Costner, with hitched-up jeans and a bad haircut) keeps telling him that he will be a singular figure in human history, but that he needs to keep his remarkable gifts hidden until he can master his own will and understand his own mission. I don't dispute that you can find stuff like this in previous iterations of the Superman story, but Goyer and Nolan are clearly drawing on Nietzsche's idea of the superman or ""overman"" as a transcendent, transformative figure who will create a new set of values in the moral vacuum left behind by the death of God. Bet you didn't think we were going there in a review of a summer popcorn movie, did you? Yet at the same time there's a profound confusion at work in ""Man of Steel,"" because Snyder, Goyer and Nolan also want to identify Superman with the last transformative, otherworldly dude to put in an appearance here, 2,000 or so years ago. In this telling, Clark bums around for most of his young adulthood, working odd jobs and stuff (though I guess he's not actually a carpenter) before mastering his powers and unveiling the Superman persona at age 33, a fact mentioned several times. When the Kryptonian renegade General Zod (Michael Shannon, enjoyable as ever, with a goatee and a Roman-emperor haircut) shows up on Earth and demands the surrender of Kal-El, the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) goes to visit a priest or minister and tells him about his true identity. Just in case we haven't gotten any of this so far, cinematographer Amir Mokri frames Cavill before a stained-glass window depicting You Know Who, I think preaching the Sermon on the Mount. Christian iconography is nothing new in the Superman universe either – the Christopher Reeve movies were loaded with it – but my real point is that the organizing principle of ""Man of Steel"" seems to be a little bit of this and then a little bit of that, religion, philosophy, blah blah blah, and when things start to get dull let's pump up the volume and fling some locomotives around. Following the lead of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and other recent summer spectacles, Snyder depicts an apocalyptic battle between Superman and Zod that inflicts planetary devastation on a scale hundreds of times larger than 9/11, with no real acknowledgment of death or suffering or moral consequences that might endanger the PG-13 rating. Crowe, Costner and the diabolical Shannon (who seems to be channeling his own version of the Ricardo Montalban role in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"") are by far the best things about the movie, managing to seem like recognizable humanoid types in this arid landscape. I also enjoyed Diane Lane as Clark's Kansas mom, even if the role mainly involves beaming adoringly at her marvelous son. As Superman and Clark Kent, Cavill is a big, handsome and undeniably impressive slab of beef, genial enough but with no visible personality. Amy Adams, one of the best character actresses in American movies, can't do much with intrepid reporter Lois Lane, perhaps the most boring of all boring female characters in the boy-centric world of comic books. (German actress Antje Traue is far more memorable, as General Zod's smoldering and sinister gal sidekick.) But all these people pale before the impressive, monumental and supremely empty effects, along with the general mood of forced-march exhaustion and pointless effort. Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

"Jun 12, 2013"," Being Superman was so cool; that’s what decades of comics-reading boys thought. Outracing a locomotive, bending steel like licorice, leaping tall buildings, flying around saving people and sneaking into phone booths to slip out of your civvies and into your form-fitting red-and-blue outfit, with a cape as a manly fashion flourish. Sure, Lois Lane, the cutie-pie on the school newspaper, pretends to ignore the Clark Kent whom you appear to be in class, but she adores the inner you, your secret Superman: strong, noble, virile and darned near indestructible, except for your Achilles’ heel, Kryptonite. And your X-ray vision comes in handy when you stroll past the girls’ locker room. That notion of manliness is now as antique as locomotives, phone booths and great metropolitan newspapers. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster introduced the first four-color superhero in the pages of Action Comics No. 1 in June 1938 — 75 years ago this month. Dated is the word to be applied to Superman’s accoutrements today. As the prime mode of long-distance business travel, trains gave way to planes and then to Skype. The daily newspaper is threatened by the Internet more than Metropolis ever was by Lex Luthor. And you can’t change clothes in an iPhone; there’s no app for that. If anything has survived and thrived in the three-quarters of a century since the Man of Steel was born into the American consciousness, it’s superhero comic books and their billion-dollar descendants, superhero movies. Now about those kids, all those generations of Superman fanciers. It’s fine that they had a figure to mirror the deathless hero they imagined as their alter ego — but they didn’t think things through. The X-ray vision, for example: it doesn’t penetrate walls, to detect lurking villains; it wouldn’t undress Lois down to her undies, as Christopher Reeve did to Margot Kidder in the 1978 Superman movie. Real radiology, focused on a human form, would reveal the bones and organs, and perhaps the diseases, within. It’s not a gift but a curse, unless Superman were to give up his day job and become the infallible detector of cancer in its early, curable stages. Later in Man of Steel, as the adult Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), he will use this gift to perform instant laser surgery on Lois (Amy Adams). But if you were a 12-year-old who suddenly learned he had X-ray vision, it would freak you out. Man of Steel, the new reboot of the Superman franchise, has just such a scene. After his X-ray death vision, young Clark (Dylan Sprayberry) locks himself in a Smallville school closet. His mother Martha (Diane Lane) arrives, but the boy is still empowered by panic: he turns the outside doorknob glowing hot, until Martha’s soothing words about his special nature calm him. To Clark, this episode provides the first lightning flash of his Otherness; it might be the gay gene (in the closet) or Asperger’s syndrome or the simple, volcanic onset of nocturnal emissions. It’s not. As his father Jonathan (Kevin Costner) tells him, “You’re the answer to, Are we alone in the universe?” He’s Kal-El, a superior, indeed supreme being sent from another planet. That’s quite a puberty present, and the astonished Clark recoils as if, all things considered, he’d rather be gay. For with great power comes a great challenge: reconciling the Krypton divinity of his nature with the Kansas humanity of his nurture. Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), produced by Christopher Nolan (who directed the Dark Knight trilogy) and scripted by Dark Knight story man David S. Goyer, Man of Steel is a half-great movie — meaning the first half. Then it collapses into a familiar fight-and-destruction scenario, as Kryptonian bad guy Zod (Michael Shannon) journeys to Earth and confronts Kal-El/Clark for the same sort of small-town showdown that Thor and Loki engaged in two summers ago in a Marvel epic. Belatedly arriving in Metropolis, the movie stages the umpteenth replay of 9/11 with a happy-ending chaser and never adequately addresses the superhero dilemma of saving a few people while the evil enemy kills millions. The climactic face-off isn’t helped by Shannon, a fine actor who grimaces here as if afflicted by mad scowl disease. But for the first hour or so, when it lays out Superman’s origins on Krypton and his rite of passage toward realizing and growing into his identity, Man of Steel is sober and superb — the rare action movie where each spectacular event helps define the character. Whereas films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals (in which Cavill played Theseus) turned classic myths into comic books, Man of Steel, like Nolan’s Batman films, strives to elevate comic-book heroes into the figures with the heft, depth and burdens of Greek gods. It jettisons the gentle comedy of the Reeve series that began in 1978, doesn’t bother much with romance — Clark’s relationship with Lois is less boy-meets-girl than reporter-tracks-source — and dispenses with the red underpants that the classic Superman wore over his tights. Like its hero, Man of Steel at its best is serious, stripped down and pumped. True to the first pages of the Superman story in Action Comics No. 1 and the opening of the 1978 Superman, with Marlon Brando and Susannah York as the hero’s birth parents, Man of Steel opens on “a distant planet” about to be “destroyed by old age.” The wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) cannot persuade the Krypton synod to find a home for its citizens in other galaxies. He and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have secretly conceived Krypton’s first natural child in ages; they call him Kal-El and launch him in a spaceship to Earth, an atmospherically congenial planet with “a seemingly intelligent population.” Nitpickers will note that the newborn has no diaper; the spaceship must have been a mess when he landed. Before the planet dies, the renegade warrior-prince Zod and his hottie second-in-command Faoro-Ul (Antje Traue) are sentenced to “300 cycles of somatic reconditioning” — which sounds like an eternity of watching Oprah reruns — and packed off to some far-flung Alcatraz. That exile will save Zod and his rebel crew when Krypton explodes. Many years later, they will chase Kal-El to Earth, with plans to annihilate the indigenous population and colonize it with their own nefarious kind. (Like the Mandarin in Iron Man 3, Zod commandeers the airwaves and social media to diss the hero and warn of worldwide doom.) Only the Superboy, now grown into Clark Kent, mild-mannered wanderer, can save Earth. But his interplanetary combat readiness may have been diluted by life on Earth, where he was raised by a loving, human family. Man of Steel takes its cue from Bryan Singer’s 2006 Superman Returns, which posited our hero as the Christian God come to Earth to save humankind: Jesus Christ Superman. Goyer goes further, giving the character a backstory reminiscent of the Gospels: the all-seeing father from afar (plus a mother); the Earth parents; an important portent at age 12 (Jesus talks with the temple elders; Kal-El saves children in a bus crash); the ascetic wandering in his early maturity (40 days in the desert for Jesus; a dozen years in odd jobs for Kal-El); his public life, in which he performs a series of miracles; and then, at age 33, the ultimate test of his divinity and humanity. “The fate of your planet rests in your hands,” says the holy-ghostly Jor-El to his only begotten son, who goes off to face down Zod the anti-God in a Calvary stampede. You could call Man of Steel the psychoanalytical case study of god-man with a two-father complex. All these New Testament allusions — plus the image of Superman sitting in a church pew framed by a stained-glass panel of Jesus in his final days — don’t necessarily make Man of Steel any richer, except for students of comparative religion. And as Goyer has noted, “We didn’t come up with these allusions of Superman being Christ-like. That’s something that’s been embedded in the character from the beginning.” No, the dramatically piquant aspect is the movie’s journey beyond Superman Returns‘ hagiography to portray the struggle of this outsider deity to adjust to his new planet and his role in it. Bursting with preternatural abilities but deprived of teachers, Superman must learn to fly like any orphan duckling — and, more important, to harness his powers. He learns the hard way that he can’t save everyone, even when he’s able to. Being Superman is a burden, not a lark, for someone whose human qualities put him at a disadvantage against Zod. As this stud-messiah tells Lois, he’s not giving in to Zod: “I’m surrendering to mankind.” He may be the first comic-book superhero in film who suffers the same doubts about his divine humanity as Jesus does in Nikos Kazantzakis’ novel The Last Temptation of Christ and the controversial 1988 movie made from it. This Goyer-Snyder version of the Siegel-Shuster gospel retains old touchstones like Daily Planet boss Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and even, briefly, Clark’s boyhood girlfriend Lana Lang (Jadin Gould), familiar from Reeve’s third Superman film and the Smallville TV series. But it smartly concentrates on the more primal tale of a space-traveling immigrant, as regal as he is illegal, with an adopted planet and adoptive parents. Who could ask for better ones? Lane plays Martha as grave, generous and ferociously protective of her boy, this otherworldly treasure and responsibility. And Costner — back in the fantasy Midwest heartland of Field of Dreams, but this time as the father playing catch-up with his son — bestows a solid emotional gravity on Jonathan, a man who would give his life to teach Clark a lesson about the limits of superpowers. Jor-El, of course, has already made that sacrifice; postmortem, he shows up more often than Hamlet’s ghost-father and counsels his son in Crowe’s urgent, spectral, kingly presence. Cavill was a finalist to play James Bond (before Daniel Craig was cast), Batman (Christian Bale), Twilight‘s Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the 2006 Superman (Brandon Routh). He finally got a franchise, and it was worth the wait. Conforming to the superhero template of the preposterously muscled hunk, the Englishman also brings to the role exactly the right haunted, stricken but resolute air of someone searching for a grand mystery inside him. And Adams: she’s nice too. In his earlier movies, Snyder shot mostly on bare stages, with the actors speaking their lines in front of a green screen that visual effects turned into Thermopylae, alternate America and a steampunk madhouse. This time, perhaps encouraged by the film-loving, digital-despising Nolan, Snyder has shot in different locations, on film. He renounces the deadpan silliness of 300, the teeming scheming of Watchmen and the Powerpuff Girls delirium of Sucker Punch for a desaturated color scheme and judicious use of shaky-cam cinematography to underline the reality of Superman’s new environment and the fate in store for him. I don’t mean to make this sound like an Ingmar Bergman film of a soul in torment over God’s silence. The action is plentiful and thumping; Marvel-size thrills await you and the generations of kids who still believe in Superman. I just mean that the movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just O.K.; but the man part is super.",POSITIVE

"Jun 12, 2013"," Amid the plethora of computer-generated demolition, flame-outs and explosions, there's a nuanced origin story (** ½ out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide). But it often gets drowned out by numbing spectacle and director Zack Snyder's seeming determination to fashion the most super-charged superhero movie ever. British actor Henry Cavill is a terrific Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman, subtly playing emotional moments and persuasively conveying pangs of self-doubt. He just as nimbly rises to the occasion of soaring heroism. Christopher Reeve would be proud. If only Snyder had seen fit to focus more on Clark's conflicts and let the tale unfold more naturally, with fewer in-your-face pyrotechnics. Ubiquitous product placement takes the viewer out of the movie, and Hans Zimmer's overpowering score further distances us. Amy Adams is a charming and contemporary Lois Lane, Diane Lane is wonderful as Clark's warmly reassuring adopted mom Martha Kent, and Russell Crowe is effectively noble as Kal-El's biological father, Jor-El. But Michael Shannon, who has mastered the art of coiled menace like few others (see The Runaways and The Iceman), is strangely bland as the single-minded Kryptonian villain General Zod, who is determined to take down our hero. Antje Traue, as rebel warrior Faora-Ul, is more threatening than her commander. Kal-El is born on Krypton just as the planet faces environmental destruction. In a desperate act to protect their son, Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) encase him in a steel capsule and send him barreling toward Earth. The baby is discovered on Kansas farmland and is lovingly raised (and named Clark) by Martha and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Early in his childhood in Smallville, Jonathan encourages his son to explore his destiny — but also worries that humans will fear him for his superpowers. ""I have to believe that you were sent here for a reason, and even if it takes the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is,"" he tells Clark. When the audience meets him he is a solitary young man drifting and suffering from the loneliness imposed by hiding his powers. He connects with intrepid reporter Lois Lane, who sees him for what he is and doesn't flinch. Hours before Kent is introduced to newsroom staffers, one of them proclaims: ""They saved us."" Yes, but they — Superman and the military vs. Zod and his merciless Kryptonian acolytes — ruined huge swaths of the city and laid waste to scores of humans. Clark was raised by the Kents to avoid violence. Jor-El exhorted him to help others accomplish wonders.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," The aesthetic naturalism of Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel is an obvious homage to Christopher Nolan’s Bat trilogy, clearly opting for grimness over playfulness. The sense of undiluted reality given to scenes depicting Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) hitchhiking across America, taking a host of odd jobs along the way, is meant to add a sense of grounding to the wildly imaginative universe of Jerry Siegel and Josh Shuster’s comic-book hero. It’s an incredibly dull tactic that relies on constant exposition to needlessly explain the story’s fantastical trajectory and excuse the film’s limited visual detail, and though it’s certainly not the worst thing about Man of Steel, it nevertheless starts this frustrating reboot off on the wrong foot. Sent by his father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), from Krypton to Earth after their home planet is destroyed in the wake of a failed coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon), Kal-El is adopted as Clark Kent by Martha and Jonathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) after his pod crash-lands in their backyard and only learns of the heft of his extraterrestrial heritage upon reaching post-adolescence. In a twist on the ruling mythology of Superman, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is almost immediately in full knowledge of Clark’s alien identity, his laser eyes cauterizing a wound that she sustains at the site of a military operation she’s investigating and where he works in anonymity. The Superman of Man of Steel isn’t really called out until Zod visits Earth, looking to destroy and repurpose the planet as a new Krypton, the process of which allows screenwriter David S. Goyer, who developed the story with Nolan, to unleash an explanatory overload that details mechanisms and maneuvers and luxuriates in backstory, and yet gives little sense of its main character’s state of mind and existence in the now. Man of Steel is of the Michael Bay school of filmmaking, marked by wanton destruction and clattering sound design, and it may prove to be Snyder’s Pearl Harbor. The film replaces the blood-splattered machismo that ruled Watchmen and 300 with a risibly overt sense of nationalism and pro-military sentiment, and Snyder heedlessly manipulates audiences with visions of innocent children, families, and even pets in grave peril. The filmmakers make the hero’s struggle less about his inner identity as both an alien and a human and more about identifying as an American or bust. The faux-patriotism isn’t played for satire, but instead utilized to align the film with an idyllic, unquestioned vision of goodness. Indeed, Man of Steel is star-spangled to death. Not surprisingly, the scenes involving Superman and Zod’s minions are the most assured and thrilling, speaking to Snyder’s modest abilities as an architect of active chaos. A walloping fight in downtown Smallville and the climactic tussle between Zod and our caped crusader are engaging and exciting, if also a bit dizzying in their shaky handicam aesthetic. The film’s design is far more interesting than its overall look, presented as a wonky, occasionally dazzling hash of creature and production designs from numerous popular science-fiction films. The Matrix trilogy can be seen in the Krypton birthing pods and the tentacles of Zod’s planet-harvesting World Engine; the interiors of Zod’s ship are vaguely Xenomorphic; and those artfully sudden zooms into developing action that J.J. Abrams is so fond of are a near constant. Jor-El’s early escape on the back of a flying beast as it maneuvers through Krypton’s destruction is also plainly lifted from Avatar. Snyder overemphasizes the direness of the narrative, especially its conflicts, the result of which is that Man of Steel feels both naïve and portentous. The filmmakers don’t honor the sense of duty, moral or otherwise, of the brave soldiers and citizens portrayed here as much as they underline the importance of sacrifice through suffering and death, which echoes the film’s unsettling sense of martyrdom as inherently masculine. The major male characters all die, or openly accept death, out of sacrifice either to Superman or their fellow man. Laurence Fishburne’s Perry White is a useless figure until he nearly dies while attempting to pull a co-worker from the rubble of a totaled Metropolis, a sequence that coldly recalls 9/11 with ash perpetually falling like snow. The archaic, manipulative rhetoric never stalls the kinetic pace, but there’s little sense of what drew the excellent cast to this fiasco. The seemingly fresh, largely humorless austerity of this new Superman masquerades a return to the character’s roots in propaganda rather than inventiveness, which was embodied in Bryan Singer’s triumphantly imperfect Superman Returns. Stiffly upper-lipped rather than tongue-in-cheek, Man of Steel is meant to condescendingly flatter Snyder and Goyer’s imagined audience in suggesting that we have plenty of heroes as it is, and that the son of Jor-El is just another member of Team America.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 12, 2013"," Superman is probably the superhero least in need of an existential crisis, but leave it to Christopher Nolan to give him one anyway. As the producer and co-writer of the story for Man of Steel, the auteur who put the dark in The Dark Knight strips away the character’s unassailable integrity and moral certitude and gives us a Kal-El who’s far more man than super. He’s paired with dyed-in-the-wool fantasist Zack Snyder, who’s spent the better part of his career deconstructing superhero mythology (and mythology itself), and the two make for strange but oddly complementary bedfellows. Together, they reinvent the great-grandaddy of funnybook strongmen as a struggling orphan whose destined-for-greater-things future is framed — and forged — by the influence of not one, but two sets of parents. Superman is probably the superhero least in need of an existential crisis, but leave it to Christopher Nolan to give him one anyway.

Together, they reinvent the great-grandaddy of funnybook strongmen as a struggling orphan whose destined-for-greater-things future is framed — and forged — by the influence of not one, but two sets of parents. The film opens on Krypton with the birth of Kal-El, the planet’s first natural-born child in centuries. Kal’s father Jor-El (Russell Crowe), a scientist, has warned the planet’s elders about an imminent environmental catastrophe, but a civil war engineered by Michael Shannon’s General Zod has distracted them from dealing with it until it’s too late. With mere hours remaining before the planet explodes Jor-El ships Kal off to Earth, both to save him and to protect the last vestiges of Kryptonian civilization, which he’s packed away in the newborn’s spaceship. Decades later, Kal has become Clark Kent (Henry Cavill of The Tudors and Immortals), a migrant worker who keeps to himself as he attempts to figure out his place in a world he knows is not his own. His Earth parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) have encouraged him to hide his gifts until he figures out what to do with them, but his innate sense of justice — and a desire to help others — repeatedly exposes him, and eventually forces him to move on to another job and another remote location. But after rescuing reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) during her investigation of an alien spacecraft, he finds it increasingly difficult to remain anonymous — especially after she tracks him down at his childhood home in Smallville. Despite having stumbled across the story of the century, Lois shows Clark compassion when he explains why he’s stayed out of the limelight, and she decides not to disclose his identity to the rest of the world. But when General Zod contacts Earth demanding that its leaders turn Kal-El over to him, Clark is forced to choose between two worlds — the one from which he came, and the one he now calls home. In a culture that seems as eager to tear down heroes as it is to build them up, it feels like there’s no longer a comfortable place for the pure idealism of Richard Donner’s 1978 Superman, nor even the nostalgic romanticism of Bryan Singer’s flawed but underrated Superman Returns. Nolan utilizes the same technique he used in Batman Begins, grounding everything the character does in a semblance of believable “reality,” while Snyder uses that reality as a foundation for recreating the Superman that audiences know and love — by the end of the film, anyway. Since moviegoers have never seen how Kal-El came to terms with his destiny as Earth’s protector this reverse-engineering approach works even better than it did in the Batman films. The tactic creates a hero’s journey that possesses enormous amounts of human relatability even as it crystallizes the persona of the resolute, incorruptible Superman audiences know and love. That said, Man of Steel occasionally feels like a dirge precisely because Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer allow Superman so few opportunities to enjoy his principles. (The “Superman has fun saving people” montage that has appeared in every previous film is absent here, and most of his acts of heroism are met with admonishment from his earthly parents for “exposing himself,” so to speak.) Formerly best defined — if not immortalized — by Christopher Reeve’s dryly funny but invariably earnest interpretation of the character, Superman’s natural, wholesome buoyancy is mired here in self-consciousness and insecurity. He’s as fearful of not using his abilities when they’re needed as he is of having them discovered by humankind, and his relentless introspection sometimes becomes as tedious a burden to viewers as his powers are to him. Despite the subject matter’s natural suitability to Snyder’s sweeping, larger-than-life aesthetic, Man of Steel is his most measured and realistic work to date, both in terms of its stylistic vocabulary and its dramatic pitch. But even as he resists every impulse to inject the material with the same sorts of visual flourishes that served as directorial hallmarks in 300, Watchmen, and even Sucker Punch, the film’s visceral edges are as aggressive and affecting as the action in almost any recent blockbuster. Though the director’s slow-motion deconstructionism and his fetishization of ideal physical forms are gone Snyder’s staging remains impeccable, enabling Superman’s coming-of-age to unfold on the largest possible canvas while also retaining substantial emotional weight. Moreover, he solves the problem the Wachowskis struggled with in the Matrix trilogy: how do you keep a fight exciting when it’s between two people who cannot be hurt? The answer isn’t quite as simple as “point-of-view punching,” which does actually become an important (and awesome) part of the climactic showdown between Superman and Zod. Even if the characters themselves are incredibly resilient, Snyder maintains a palpable sense of cause and effect by depicting their fight’s impact on the landscape around them — both in terms of the escalating property damage that reverberates outward from each battle and the larger cultural implications of a superhuman who exists in an otherwise human world. Where Brandon Routh’s performance in Returns felt like a sense-memory tribute to Christopher Reeve’s iconic interpretation, Henry Cavill aims for something more troubled and complex, which fits Man of Steel’s ponderous tone perfectly but fails to supply the character with more than a perfunctory, bland sort of charm. That introverted charisma similarly undermines the budding, inevitable romance between Superman and Lois Lane, but Amy Adams’ intrepid and yet compassionate take gives the reporter newfound cinematic dimensionality even as she hints at a more profound connection between the two — as best friends rather than lovers. Meanwhile, Costner’s performance as Jonathan Kent is so steeped in heartfelt American self-determinism that it should be accompanied at all times by the strains of Aaron Copland, even as Crowe circumnavigates comparisons to Marlon Brando’s Jor-El by underplaying the character with hopeful pragmatism and a quiet nobility. As General Zod Michael Shannon possesses none of the theatricality that Terence Stamp brought to the role, but Stamp didn’t have as well-written a part as Shannon does, either. From start to finish Zod is a gratifyingly rational and sympathetic adversary — tactics notwithstanding, his motivations are pure, sincere, and well-intentioned. But even if Shannon doesn’t quite descend into the sort of eccentricity that made many of his past performances so irresistible, his magnetic consternation as Krypton’s would-be savior lends the character a melancholy authority that dovetails nicely into Superman’s ascendant self-actualization. Even though its cathartic confrontation between Earth’s first defender and Krypton’s last excludes it from earlier timelines, Man of Steel feels like a lost but worthy chapter in Superman’s origin story that could easily fit into Donner’s original without skipping a single bound. After multiple adventures where the same details were repeated about his birth and his adulthood, this — like Batman Begins — compellingly uncovers the intervening years of exploration and self-discovery that led Superman to become the mythic icon we’ve always known. All of which suggests that this is probably the last origin story for Kal-El that we ever need to see, even as it paves the way for more movies about Superman. And even if its weighty self-importance sometimes seems overwhelming in the context of a franchise that has historically felt more wholesome and light-hearted, the sophisticated foundation it creates allows future installments to function as more than victory laps without requiring them to adhere to a purely melodramatic tone. In other words, thanks to Man of Steel, Superman has truly earned the right to have fun saving people again, precisely because his two sets of fathers — both on-screen and behind the camera — decided to take him seriously.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," Zack Snyder's Man Of Steel takes pride in giving us doom and gloom, and the tale that was one of our most exciting childhood memories has been turned into rather joyless bombast. Keen to insert biblical references, whether they fit or not, and assaulting us with a maximalist visual treatment, Snyder's reboot inherits the stern-faced self-importance of The Dark Knight (it's no coincidence that Christopher Nolan is one of the producers), but lacks the menace and the nihilism that gives rise to Batman's (imagined) existential crisis. Superman is supposed to soar, to fly us to the Moon or, farther afield, to the fantastic nebula where his home planet is, or was _ but the loftiest emotion that Man Of Steel is capable of stimulating _ and I hate to say this _ is indifference. The film is caught up in its own schema of being a Book of Genesis, of laying out the cosmic purpose that goes into making Kal-El, later Clark Kent, who is played _ without a cowlick but with a weight around his neck _ by Henry Cavill. Superman suffers for us all, and when he torpedoes himself into the infernal core of the enemy's gigantic, gravity-sucking thingamajig, it's the Passion of Our Saviour all over again, with his cape standing in for the Cross. Snyder even attempts a mystical Midwest swirl, a la Terrence Malick, but his flamboyant hyper-destructiveness shreds Cavill's efforts to appear delicate and makes our rooting for him perfunctory rather than hard-earned. If Clark Kent is a supersonic Jesus _ he's 33 when he makes the ultimate sacrifice, get it? _ then we've been given not one, but two embodiments of God the father: Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner _ who play Clark's two dads, one biological and intergalactic, the other adopted and American. Crowe plays Jor-El (in the 1978 version, it was Marlon Brando), a general on Krypton who decides to ship his newborn son to Earth after his home planet starts to implode. Shortly after he has beamed the metal cocoon bearing his baby across space, Jor-El is murdered by General Zod (Michael Shannon). But the Holy Father, true to form, will keep reappearing throughout the remainder of the film, rather like the Force or a computer virus, while Zod and his cohorts will later pursue the boy to Earth with the malicious intent of colonising our planet and wiping out humankind. Of course, Superman stories have actually little to do with supernatural powers and everything to do with being a very mortal man. The detailed back story and the endeavour to invest Clark with this dilemma may sound noble in concept, but it has become simply trite by this stage in the wake of so many similarly superheroic tales (Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk, and so on and so forth), not to mention the self-defeatism of it all when this ""man"" is able to shoot scorching lasers from his eyes and is shown diving, shirtless, into a burning oil rig to save trapped workers. The moment Clark learns that Zod has demanded his surrender in exchange for the safety of the world, the first thing he does is, guess what? Visit a church like a lost soul seeking spiritual advice. Which he duly receives. And when he eventually emerges, he does something even Jesus couldn't: he takes flight! The first romping fight _ if that's what you're looking for _ comes an hour into the film, and the aerial brawl (which, I think, is rather creatively choreographed) comes right at the end. Before that point, even when I thought Snyder would floor the gas and give us the fascist fantasy we're all waiting for, he pulls back and puts Clark into a reflective reverie consisting of more back story and lectures about purpose. This 140-minute affair doesn't seem to find its forward rhythm until after the first 90. Even the arrival of Lois Lane (Amy Adams, looking tired throughout) doesn't lift the mood; there's no chemistry in this interspecies romance mainly because Clark, despite his preternatural six-pack, spends most of his time worrying about his true purpose. Clearly, the plan here is to stay away from the goofy, campy Christopher Reeves' rendition, and yet it was so much easier to believe that Lois could have fallen for Reeves. Cavill doesn't lack charm, but he's been ordered to suppress it _ almost to the point of self-suffocation. When Superman does finally kiss Lois, we can almost hear the collective thought-bubble: Really, when did they fall in love? It seems that, of late, two contrasting approaches have been used when it comes to adapting the legion of superhero comic books: the dark path, pioneered by Christopher Nolan and his Dark Knight trilogy; and the light path, as seen in most Spider-man and Iron Man movies. Both can work. The dark way opens up new dimensions when it is brewed correctly, while the brighter route pushes for the exuberance of the boy-orientated fantasy genre. But even the skilled and much-admired Nolan has allowed the brooding pretentiousness to escalate and overshadow the primal joy that we basically expect from pulp fiction. Snyder's Man Of Steel is so inflexible in its own seriousness, in its bogus gravitas, and yet it is so dependent on CG gargantuanism that its human side is barely able to emerge. Maybe we'll have to wait for Part 2 or 3, or 5, where the Christ complex might give way to a Clark Kent who can bring joy to the world.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," More space opera than superhero movie, Man Of Steel, Zack Snyder’s Superman reboot, focuses almost exclusively on the DC Comics icon’s alien backstory. This gamble doesn’t entirely pay off; by effectively denying Superman his defining traits—his complex relationships to duty and humanity—the movie robs the character of any depth or agency. Decisions, not daring, shape heroes, and since Man Of Steel’s Superman never has a chance to make a decision, he never registers as anything more than a handsome, inscrutable alien with a smug smirk. Man Of Steel opens on planet Krypton, a Roger Dean prog-rock album cover filtered through the sensibilities of David Lynch’s Dune. There, tough-guy scientist Jor-El, played by Russell Crowe, pleads with the planet’s government to take action against a coming environmental cataclysm. (This is the first of the movie’s many half-hearted attempts at political relevance, which culminate in Superman punching out a Predator drone.) However, a coup by Michael Shannon’s General Zod interrupts the proceedings, leaving Crowe no choice but to steal a MacGuffin called the Codex and launch it into space along with his newborn son, Kal-El. As Krypton implodes, Kal-El’s spacecraft crash-lands in a field in Kansas. The movie then leaps forward 33 years to find the adult Kal-El, now played by Henry Cavill, aimlessly drifting around Nova Scotia and working odd jobs. The discovery of an ancient Kryptonian spacecraft in Northern Canada brings Cavill into contact with Amy Adams’ Lois Lane; it also alerts Shannon, who survived the destruction of Krypton, to Cavill’s location. The rest of the film is set over a couple of days, as Cavill fights Shannon and his gang in a series of superpowered battles, all of which are admittedly pretty cool-looking; interspersed throughout are flashbacks to Cavill’s childhood as well as comically insistent product placement for IHOP. Man Of Steel eschews the usual trappings of Superman stories—right down to the word “Superman,” which is uttered only once. There’s no Lex Luthor, no Kryptonite, no glasses, no mild-mannered reporter, very little Daily Planet, and even less Metropolis. However, the movie is anything but stripped down; like Snyder’s Sucker Punch, it’s a confused but fascinating mishmash of religious, military, and sexual imagery. One scene finds Cavill framed with a stained-glass Jesus behind him. In another, he—robbed of his powers by a gaping hole in narrative logic—races around a Kryptonian spaceship seemingly designed by H.R. Giger, vulvar doorways and all. Cavill—whose performance involves more posing than acting—is alternately presented as an alien messiah, a superweapon, and an American flag flapping in the wind; the one thing he never gets to be is a character. As a result, Man Of Steel sometimes feels like arty advertising—the tentpole movie equivalent of a car ad that invokes images of freedom or luxury without ever mentioning the price or specifications.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 12, 2013","Cavill and Adams didn't have much time to bond before shooting, but they nail it. He's sturdy but tormented; she's tough and feisty.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," Fast-forward five years and marmite director Zack Snyder was named director for the reboot of DC's most famous superhero (sorry Batman). Having just flopped with Sucker Punch, this may have seemed like a risky move but with The Dark Knight trilogy director Christopher Nolan writing the story alongside David S Goyer, hopes were high of something special. With British actor Henry Cavill taking the weight of the red cape on his shoulders, we're treated to a wonderfully-realised and aesthetically pleasing retelling of how the Kryptonian baby sent to Earth becomes our saviour. It all kicks off in style with Krypton in the midst of crumbling to pieces. We meet Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara-Lor Van (Ayelet Zurer),  the parents of newborn Kal-El. Realising their world is braced for destruction, they decide to fire their son into space, set for a planet where he can thrive. However, there plans are hampered by military despot General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his army. Thankfully, though, little Kal-El is launched and Zod is sent, with his troops, to the Phantom Zone as punishment. Using flashbacks to show us how Kal-El deals with his powers amid the confusion of growing up, his 'adoptive' parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) instil their values and beliefs in the hope of raising a strong man with morals. Back in the present, Clark Kent aka Kal-El (Cavill) is getting by as a drifter-of-sorts until he appears on the radar of Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who witnesses his powers. Any plans to keep Superman from revealing himself to the planet are scuppered when Zod arrives on Earth with the threat of anarchy and destruction if Supes doesn't hand himself over. While Snyder's previous films have divided opinion - and there's a big chance Man of Steel will do the same - he's hit his stride here with an adaptation of the story that remains faithful to Richard Donner's 1978 classic while managing to be its own beast. There are knowing nods and winks to the original Superman universe but, with the help of Nolan and Goyer, certain strands of the story are tweaked and changed which ensure it can't really be compared to previous outings. Routh's version of Supes may well be a bit of a damp squib but with Cavill in the central role we've found someone who can embody the character without being a Christopher Reeve-a-like. Muscular and solid but with a moral-compass brought on due to 33 years on Earth, Kent/Kal-El is a character we can root for and sympathise with. A tortured soul-of-sorts as he is aware he's alone on our world, he must tussle with the inner battle of whether he should reveal himself. His hero is matched pound-for-pound by Shannon as maniacal Zod. His wide-eyed stare and wild onscreen persona is best typified in the quieter moments where he still manages to exude real menace. And his beautiful right-hand woman, Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) is definitely one to look out for with the threat she provides. Adams as Lane is, thankfully, a far cry from the insipid attempt by Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns. Here we have a feisty, inquisitive reporter who actually feels like one. But behind the 'get the story at all costs' exterior is a softer centre as she realises the sacrifice Clark must make may well be the end of him. And she's strong enough to make sure she plays a big part in the final, explosive act rather than making her simply window-dressing. Away from the characters, Snyder has crafted a story that combines rare (but still existent) scenes which will either make you laugh or smile with some real emotional heft. One flashback sequence involving Clark and his Earth dad, Jonathan, squeezes every last ounce of poignancy out of it. It's a truly beautiful moment that helps alleviate much of the breathlessness that will affect you due to the onscreen action. It rarely abates and, despite a two hours and 20 minute running time, it never sags. There's even pseudo-religion involved making Superman appear to be an almost Jesus-like figure. Willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind despite their inherent differences, Clark even takes to asking a priest whether it would be a good idea only to be told a leap of faith is the best way to gain trust. On-screen action is played out to bone-crunching effect. From an oil rig rescue to the battles between Superman and Zod (and even Faora-Ul), it's nail-biting at times, thrilling at others and you feel every punch and kick. Thankfully, Snyder has ditched his penchant for slow-mo and fights are done at super-speed. Visually, as it is now expected, Snyder has hit the centre of the target. Man of Steel looks impeccable. The opening on Krypton is stunning while the destruction of cities in the final third is played out to devastating effect. Combine everything you see on screen with a sublime score from the ever-reliable Hans Zimmer and what we get is goose-bump inducing superhero perfection. There is one aspect of the story that I didn't mind but will definitely spark a reaction among the die-hard fans of Superman but it would be wrong to spoil it before you've seen it. Earlier this year we had the brilliant writing and directing of Shane Black revitalise Iron Man but Man of Steel manages to (just) surpass Iron Man 3 - even without the humour attributed to Marvel's productions. What Snyder has created is so far ahead of what Marvel have come up with to date (bar IM3) the studio bosses there will be hoping Avengers 2 is something special. Snyder's film hits heights rarely reached by modern-day superhero films.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," The latest Superman “reboot,” generically titled Man of Steel, is rich in inessentials. Sensibly concluding that the last thing we need is another hour of young Clark Kent gradually discovering his superhuman powers in Smallville while Ma and Pa Kent trade worried looks, director Zack Snyder has relegated most of the Midwest corn to flashbacks and focused (less sensibly) on what matters to him most: Superman as an alien coping with his alienness in the course of a massive outer-space invasion from Krypton avengers. So you get spidery machines drilling into the Earth and blasting planes out of the sky and flattening Manhattan as thoroughly as Godzilla, Rodan, and the rest of the Toho gang demolished Tokyo. You get much ado about Krypton genes and a McGuffin called a Codex — or Kotex, I didn’t get the spelling. You get War of the Worlds and Independence Day and lots of noise and clutter — but never the simple charm of the original comic by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster or the faintly self-abashed handsomeness of Christopher Reeve. The movie isn’t dead on arrival, like Snyder’s over-reverent Watchmen. But it’s pleasure-free. The new Supey is a colorless Brit named Henry Cavill with a deep cleft in the middle of his chin and deeper ones where his lats meet his deltoids meet his pecs. His physique is as ripped as any of Snyder’s 300 Spartans — which flies in the face of the notion that Superman, unlike Batman, doesn’t need to spend hours at the gym to maintain his prodigious strength. Before we see him, we spend a long-ish stretch on Krypton, which is now an expensive-looking world of flying beasts and towering cliffs. Supey’s dad Jor-El is played by Russell Crowe in peacenik mode — which guarantees this sometimes-great actor will put nothing of his galvanic true self in the role and instead hide behind faux-Brit diction and a woeful countenance. Hands beatifically clasped in front of him, he gazes sadly at General Zod (Michael Shannon). He shares Zod’s conviction that Krypton’s elderly ruling council have made no provisions for the planet’s imminent destruction (thanks to reckless plundering of its natural resources, hint, hint) but not Zod’s impulse to shoot said council members in the head. Zod also has some crypto-racist (or Krypto-racist) ideas about re-creating the planet on a world of lesser beings with the help of said Kotex. Preaching the need to coexist harmoniously with other beings, Jor-El dispatches his only son to planet Earth to share the heavenly gospel. Though gravity is different on Earth than it is on Krypton, co-producer Christopher Nolan ensures this will be the gravest Superman yet. There is no bright pop in the new costume. The blue is halfway to black, the cape burgundy. That makes for some striking, deep-toned images of the lonely savior against the colossal skyscrapers of Metropolis, and Superman’s X-ray eyes have an impressive, unearthly glow. But the fumbling, mild-mannered Clark Kent counterpoint is missing. Whatever future installments this new saga will bring, the Clark of Man of Steel doesn’t get to play a reporter haplessly trying to woo an impatient Lois. The delightful contrast between nerd and Samson — the genius element of the Superman myth — will have to wait. Lois is Amy Adams, who carries her scenes with single-minded gumption. No role has given Adams as excellent an outlet for her Katie Couric–like combination of pertness and steel. (She could have her own spinoff — Anchorwoman of Steel.) But without the Clark-Lois banter, the screwball element is gone. Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and his Daily Planet staff watch Metropolis fall and enact mini feats of bravery. Great Caesar’s Ghost, they’re a dull bunch. Shannon makes a super-serious Zod, without a smidgen of Terence Stamp’s delicious camp in Superman II. It’s the movie’s most heartfelt performance, but after Zod’s fifth tumultuous fight with Superman, Shannon — like the movie — becomes tiresome. The most affecting parts of Man of Steel are the most grounded, featuring Kevin Costner as Pa Kent and Diane Lane as Ma. The theme — articulated by Costner in his honest-farmer persona — is gradualism: Clark cannot fully exercise his powers until he acclimates himself to the needs of his new world and learns the motives of the father who sent him here. He’s moving, sincere, and for the purposes of the movie, party-pooping. Watching the unprecedented spectacle of this Superman picture, I thought of the producer Lynda Obst’s new book, Sleepless in Hollywood, in which Obst explains why studios are making so many action-heavy, 3-D, IMAX monstrosities in lieu of anything else: This is what plays in the rest of the world, especially China, from which an astounding 80 percent of studios’ profits now come, according to Obst. The greed on display extends to the product placements. Amid the explosions and flying debris, the Sears, 7 Eleven, and IHOP logos are visible from all angles. Critics and even the American public might be cool to this War of the World take on Superman, but if Asian markets are onboard it’s pop-the-cork and green-light-the-sequel time: truth, justice, and the Chinese way.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 12, 2013","Oh Superman, what did you do to deserve Zack Snyder?",NEUTRAL
"Jun 12, 2013"," After The Avengers and now Man of Steel, I think there needs to be a name for the phenomenon where a comic book movie attracts incredible production talent, who proceed to write some of the most inspired, creative, entertaining popcorn movie content ever created, only to be hamstrung in the end by their own nerdish worship of the weak source material. Back in writing workshop, there was a frequently repeated phrase you’d hear in critiques where people would point to the top of your piece and say “this feels like throat clearing.” Basically, it means you had these germs of an idea or ideas at the beginning that sparked some connection in your brain that eventually lead to something so much better, and now you just need to go back and delete those half-formed origin thoughts. Man of Steel feels like Christopher Nolan and David Goyer and company were inspired by the idea of a showdown between Superman and General Zod, to create an even better story about what it means to be Superman. But in the end they just couldn’t bring themselves to cut those cables of homage to the initial inspiration. Thus we’re left with an inspiring, beautiful origin story grafted onto an anti-climactic hero/villain showdown, and all the the hackneyed tropes that go along with it. Seriously, is there some rule I don’t know about where every superhero movie has to have a scene of the hero flying into the mouth of a giant laser pointed at Earth? Look, Drunk Randy Quaid in Independence Day is the best that scene’s ever going to get, so stop trying. Man of Steel‘s most impressive accomplishment was to make me think, “Wow, Superman, huh? What a great story. Why hasn’t anyone been able to make an amazing movie out of this before?” I still don’t think anyone has made an amazing Superman movie, but at least Man of Steel made me believe that it’s possible.  Goyer and Zack Snyder sell the hell out of the concept, by constructing a relevant Kryptonian origin story, and dropping the hokier Superman elements that feel too campy or like relics from another time – the nerd disguise, Lex Luthor, tights under his clothes, phone booths, red underpants, the idea that the ‘S’ stood for “SUPER,” and kryptonite as a glowing red rock. All gone, and good riddance. Well, mostly gone, but we’ll get to that. (Also, they added sonic booms!) What we’re left with is a Superman who’s a product of two fathers, one for whom Superman represents the last embodiment of the squandered potential of a dead civilization, and another for whom he represents an ideal towards which a young civilization can strive, if they can be mature enough to accept him. Both fathers good men who believed so strongly in the dream their child represents that they were willing to sacrifice themselves for it. Basically, Superman represents the smartest and best of humanity, which is why he’s played by a handsome British. If it sounds melodramatic, maybe it is, but it’s melodramatic in the best way possible. Like most good sci-fi, it uses the fantastic as a way to express the childish optimism that drives every human. To repay the sacrifices of our forebears by being faster, stronger, smarter, better, than anyone who came before us, to be invincible and live forever; the dream that maybe we can do it right this time, and realize the potential of the last 100,000 years. Isn’t that the psychological underpinning of all reproduction? Maybe I’m becoming a sentimental f*ck, but they totally sold me. I teared up more than once during the first act, which has never come even close to happening in a comic book movie before. Now, before you rightfully hang me from a locker by my underwear or beat me with socks filled with wet tampons, I should point out that a few factors contributed to this sentimentality. First, Hans Zimmer’s score. I don’t particularly like Hans Zimmer and I don’t even really like scores, and his work in The Dark Knight Rises was so overbearing and distracting that it made half the movie feel like a music video. With Hans dialed back a little and used in the proper doses, Man of Steel is one of the best uses of score I’ve ever seen. Things like a nice score and slow motion are what a lot of film students would consider “cheating,” because they’re icing, not cake, but few directors cheat as well as Zack Snyder (forget Sucker Punch, think back to the JFK assassination scene set to Bob Dylan in The Watchmen). The tinkling music, slow motion, glowy lighting, and gently-blowing breeze combine into something magical in the early scenes of Man of Steel. There’s also something about the tanned, micro-wrinkle quilted skin on Kevin Costner’s face that evokes a strong childhood memory of sturdy farmers and the counter crowd at a small-town Perko’s. I swear to God, their skin all looked like that. Costner really looks like a kindly old farmer from the Heartland, a human John Mellencamp song. And as much crap as Russell Crowe gets for being a bloated prick, few actors can do paternal gravitas like he can. I could listen to that fat Australian piece of shit give life advice all day. The film all but falls apart as soon as the Kryptonian fascists arrive, saved from their planet’s destruction only because they were imprisoned in a giant space jail made of flying penis pods, roaming the galaxy for thousands of years (I think? All of a sudden there was a lot of expository stuff going on). The problem, just like the problem with Star Trek 2 and Amazing Spider-Man and probably countless other comic book movies, is that the villains’ motives never quite make sense. “Realism” is a misnomer in the sense that we don’t expect a sci-fi story to be something that could actually happen or to be able to explain the specs of a warp hyper drive, but it is nice to know what the characters want when they’re throwing trains at each other. It’s hard to be full invested otherwise. And the fights in Man of Steel are truly a landmark in lots of shit blowing up for some reason. But it was nice to know that even on Krypton, the villains have Russian bad-bitch sidekicks. Zod just sort of shows up to kill everyone, and you wonder, why? You’re already invincible, what’s the point? And if you showed up to a planet where you could fly, have super strength, and melt steel with your eyeballs, why would you want to change it? This fight kicks off, by the way, with Superman trying to decide whether to save the humans who don’t even believe in him while talking to a priest in a church. If you thought I was reading too much into the Jesus allusions in the trailer, wait till you see Superman deciding to save humanity framed against a giant stained-glass window of Jesus on the cross, and half a scene later fighting a Russo-Kryptonian who shouts “Evolution always wins, Kal-El!” I know they think they have to directly acknowledge the Bible because of the similarities between Jesus and Superman, but aside from the fact that Jesus allusions have already been done to death, it cheapens it. It adds nothing to Superman to allude to a lesser story. For one thing, Superman’s father is much more fleshed out than Jesus’s. Honestly, Superman is a better origin story. We don’t even know what Jesus did between when he was a baby and when he was 30. Why do you want to remind people of that? And if Man of Steel hadn’t already ruined the amazing story it had built enough, it ends with a callback to the lamest, most outdated element of the Superman mythos. A lot of people are going to hate Superman because of the maddeningly wasted potential, but in the end I give it credit for creating that potential with a first half that was entertaining, inspiring, earnest, heartfelt, and beautiful. And the cast is incredible, aside from this guy. Man of Steel strikes me as both a shining example of what a comic book movie can be, and a perfect reason of why a lot of people wish the talent pool comic book movies attract could be applied to something less comic booky.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2013"," The film kicks off just as Krypton’s unstable core is about to decimate the planet. In an effort to ensure his race carries on, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) pops his newborn baby boy into a pod and ships him off to Earth. The pod lands in Kansas, right in the Kent’s backyard, and while Jonathan and Martha (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) raise the boy as their own, they’ve also always known he’s not from here. In order to keep his origin a secret, Clark goes through school as an outcast, constantly getting picked on but unable to unleash his unearthly strength to fight back. Now a 33-year-old man, Clark (Henry Cavill) moves from place to place, trying to keep a low profile. Trouble is, when he sees someone in trouble, he just can’t help himself. Finally Clark seizes an opportunity to learn about his real parents and home planet, but accessing that information also unleashes an unspeakable evil upon Earth, one that only he can stop. There’s two different films here – a Clark Kent coming-of-age story and the battle against General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his cohorts. If you’ve got a taste for non-stop destruction, you’ll dig the latter, but if you prefer your superhero action with a little heart, you’ll likely take to the portions focusing on Clark’s young years. It’s only natural to prefer some parts to others, but in order for a film to work as a whole, there just has to be a degree of cohesiveness, and that doesn’t exist much at all in “Man of Steel.” Rather than running with a straight narrative, David S. Goyer wrote a film that incessantly jumps back and forth between the past and the present. The flashback sequences are generally the more successful portions of the film, but even then, at some point enough is enough and we’ve got to focus on the task at hand. But that never happens so by the time you reach “Man of Steel’s” big climax, you’re too distracted to appreciate it. An even bigger problem is the film’s lack of emotion. Per usual, Zack Snyder’s visuals are incredibly well composed to the point of being mesmerizing, but a pretty picture just can’t have a lasting effect if the viewer isn’t connected to the characters and almost every single one in “Man of Steel” is painfully wooden. Cavill gets away with it because it actually winds up selling him as someone who feels out of place and doesn’t know why, but that excuse doesn’t work for the rest of the cast. Amy Adams is sadly the worst offender. There is absolutely no depth to Lois Lane whatsoever. Yes, Adams can point a finger at insufficient character development, but even so, her work here just feels dull, which is very unusual for her. Then there’s poor Richard Schiff and Christopher Meloni who are reduced to the cliché scientist and army colonel and absolutely nothing more. Laurence Fishburne finds himself in a similar position as Perry White. As presented in the film, Perry isn’t a person; he’s just the head of a newspaper.  The only characters that manage to transcend this issue are the ones with heart. Despite the jarring storytelling format, both Costner and Lane shine because the Kents are absolutely oozing with affection for Clark, and you believe it. Crowe churns out the film’s most successful character for a similar reason. “Man of Steel” begins with Jor-El’s efforts during the demise of Krypton and it’s a stellar opening sequence in every respect. The visuals and CGI are on point, it’s a compelling mini narrative, and Crowe makes for a wholly enchanting lead. Should “Man of Steel” demolish the box office and earn a sequel, a Jor-El-centric prequel is the way to go. Snyder had the right idea when approaching specific portions of this film, but that only left “Man of Steel” with a handful of spectacular sequences like the opening and that, in turn, demolished the full feature’s pacing. Even with an overdose of action, “Man of Steel” is kind of boring. Every now and then you’ll get swept away by a certain scenario, a personal favorite being a tornado sequence, but then there’s more of Clark’s moping, a weird church scene, Amy Adams playing reporter, or some military babble, completely extinguishing the momentum. And then even once you do get to the tail end of the film, which essentially showers you in extensive destruction, that becomes rather boring, too. The fighting looks great, but how many times can we see a building crumble or Superman zip through a fiery setting before enough is enough? But even more detrimental than the repetition is the fact that it’s hard to care. There’s one instance of peril in “Man of Steel” that will have you at the edge of your seat, pained by the thought that someone’s about to bite it, but it’s part of a flashback so thanks to the odd formatting of this film, it has absolutely no impact on the current threat.

"Jun 12, 2013"," Immediately after the obligatory death-of-Krypton opening sequence, the movie cuts to three decades later (33 years, to be precise, in keeping with Messianic metaphor). A bearded, taciturn, and totally cut figure -- yes, it's Clark Kent -- is working on a trawler and ends up leaping into action to save workers aboard a flaming oil rig. Turns out that Clark (Henry Cavill),  conflicted about revealing his alien heritage, has been wandering the globe, staying in one spot only until some crisis threatens his anonymity, and then moving on. Warned in flashbacks by his adoptive pop (Kevin Costner)  that humanity would likely react with fear and hostility to the presence of an all-powerful extraterrestrial in their midst, he's a reluctant hero at best, and a reminder of the superhuman patience required to live like a Kryptonian bull in a china shop full of very breakable earthlings. Alas, the demands of summer movie blockbusterdom decree that before you can say ""Look! Up in the sky!"" villainy descends in the form of General Zod  (Michael Shannon)  and his bad-news crew, genocidally intent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton. Cue rampant destruction and loss of life in both Smallville  and Metropolis (whatever happened to the superhero tactic of leading the bad guys away from civilians?), and a climax involving obscure things like world engines, phantom drives and singularities. And a lot of punching. Director Zack Snyder  (""Watchmen,"" ""300"")  got this gig because he loves depicting idealized physiques engaged in amped-up action. The fight scenes are impressively rendered, incorporating super-speed, indestructible bodies, and billions of dollars in property damage without becoming incoherent. But they go on and on; this 142-minute  movie probably could have been trimmed to two hours without losing a jot of story. Cavill, the (gasp!) British actor given the unenviable task of making Superman his own, never gets a chance to do much more than brood and glower. The only time he seems happy is when he's exulting in his own power. Russell Crowe  stiffly continues his quest to be today's Marlon Brando,  and not in a good way, as Jor-El,  the Kryptonian scientist who sends his son Kal-El off just before the planet's destruction (but still gets to pop up as a holographic, exposition-spouting representation of his downloaded consciousness). Shannon doesn't really get his weirdness on as Zod, Jor-El's Kryptonian foil who is sentenced to the Phantom Zone  and thereby survives Krypton's ruin. (Why the Kryptonian justice system wasn't content to let him die with the rest of the planet is a true narrative mystery.) Amy Adams  has just the sort of fierce perkiness required for intrepid reporter Lois Lane,  and Costner exudes the Kansan wisdom of Pa Kent through every all-American pore. And then you've also got Laurence Fishburne  as Perry White,  Diane Lane  as Ma Kent, Chris Meloni  as a military officer and Richard Schiff  as a scientist. There is no Jimmy Olsen,  but even so ""Man of Steel"" has too many characters and too much plot, resulting in a movie that feels overstuffed and overlong. The main problem, though, is that for a film built around Kal-El's conflict between his Kryptonian and earthly heritages, he never exhibits genuine humanity. Even after saving the planet and getting a kiss from Lois Lane, he remains more steel than man.

"Jun 12, 2013"," Just what we need now. Another movie about Superman. Man of Steel qualifies as one of those bloated, Byzantine summer blockbusters that is here today, gone by Labor Day. Now that I’ve seen it, clocking in at just under two and a half hours, I can file it under movies I never have to see again. Color it exhausting. Here is an overproduced $225 million comic book with delusions of grandeur that was better made in 1978 and a lot more fun. Although he came from another planet, Christopher Reeve was a suave, all-American crusader for apple pie, the American Way and the good of man. In the reboot, Britain’s Henry Cavill is an impossibly handsome, camera-ready hunk of beefcake milking camera angles for marketing ploys. He’s no Brandon Routh in Superman Returns or Eric Bana in The Hulk. He’s from TV’s The Tudors, he looks like a Playgirl centerfold and he can probably act too, but you won’t find out here. Upstaged in every scene by flying puppets and computer graphics, he’s at the mercy of cornball writing, indifferent directing and the shadow of pretentiousness cast over the proceedings from start to finish by Christopher Nolan. Mr. Nolan already ruined Batman. Now he incinerates the innocence and humor of the Man of Steel, who registers more like a Model of Marzipan. In all fairness, Mr. Nolan is only the producer, but hack director Zack Snyder is so under the influence of his dedication to style over substance that he seems to be receiving directions through a wire in his ear. Despite an obscene budget that could have made a giant stride in the cure for cancer, there isn’t much originality, and the whole endeavor appears to be the work of grown men who never outgrew puberty. This is tough advice when you’re targeted by bullies at your job washing dishes at the local IHOP. But you can’t keep a virile comic book hero down for long. Clark saves a school bus full of drowning children by lifting it off of a river bottom with his bare hands—a miracle that raises the suspicions of intrepid journalist Lois Lane while she’s on assignment in Canada to inspect an object trapped in ice for 18,000 years, which may or may not be the spaceship that houses the remains of the demented Zod. No longer depicted as a ditzy girl reporter who is always being saved by Superman, Lois is now a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, played by Amy Adams in the first mediocre and clueless performance of her career. The fun of never knowing who Superman really is has been squelched. Lois knows his identity from the start. Clark Kent is no longer a mild-mannered fellow reporter at the Daily Planet who ducks into conveniently located phone booths to change into bright blue tights in time to save the endangered citizens of Metropolis. Two-fisted editor Perry White is now Laurence Fishburne, and you can forget about photographer Jimmy Olsen altogether. The indefatigable Zod arrives looking for Kal-El. “Surrender in 24 hours or watch this world suffer the consequences!” he bellows. It’s disheartening to watch a serious actor like Michael Shannon pretend he knows what he’s saying. Kevin Costner gets sucked into a Kansas tornado right out of The Wizard of Oz. Diane Lane’s wrinkles and liver spots are right out of the MGM makeup department files on Greer Garson in Madame Curie. The ghost of Clark Kent’s father Jor-El constantly reappears to offer counsel, but Russell Crowe is no Marlon Brando, who played the part in the 1978 version, although he acts like he thinks he is. The secret to survival is inside the vessel in which Kal-El arrived, now hidden in the storm cellar in Diane Lane’s farmhouse. From here, the movie goes haywire, falling into preposterous plot twists as Lois flies through space in a jet-propelled pea pod, crashing into a cornfield. For the final hour of seemingly interminable drivel, Kansas is overrun with alien combat forces that blow up Sears. You pass the time pondering weightier questions like, “Will this thing break summer box-office records for kids on vacation who will sit through anything as long as the projectors keep running?” and “Does Henry Cavill have legs, or will he go the way of fellow hunk Taylor Kitsch, star of the ill-fated bomb John Carter?” Meanwhile you learn vital things, like what the “S” on the Superman costume stands for. Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. “What are you smiling about, captain?” asks another cop. “Nothing, sir—I just think he’s hot.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Jun 12, 2013"," The most impressive feat of Man of Steel is making us care about a Superman reboot that nobody really asked for — and the thought of a streamlined sequel is even better. The most impressive feat of Man of Steel is making us care about a Superman reboot that nobody really asked for — and the thought of a streamlined sequel is even better. Starring Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Zack Snyder. At GTA theatres. Running time 143 minutes. A planet explodes, buildings collapse and heroes and villains battle amidst the debris in Man of Steel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. The film’s most impressive feat, however, is considerably more cerebral: convincing us that the Superman movie we don’t need is one that we may actually want — and the thought of a more streamlined sequel is even better. Zack Snyder’s take on the familiar comic book saga is every bit the spectacle you’d expect from the man who made zombies run (Dawn of the Dead), beefcakes tussle (300) and vigilantes rage (Watchmen). Snyder packs more details into a single montage than most directors put into an entire movie. He’s in no rush to place thoughtful British actor Henry Cavill (TV’s The Tudors) into the body-hugging revamped Superman suit, or even to have his superhero referred to by name, which barely happens. Instead Snyder luxuriates in making Man of Steel a true origin story, giving us a view of doomed planet Krypton never before glimpsed in innumerable previous Superman movies. It’s a smoky sci-fi world of ancient splendour, Gigeresque nightmares and Freudian daydreams, where quicksilver gadgets all hint of sexual insertion. It’s where leading scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and military defender General Zod (Michael Shannon) have waged futile attempts to protect the populace from impending extermination, the result of environmental abuse the ruling aristocracy has failed to take seriously. Jor-El and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer), have secretly conceived and born a son, Kal-El, whom they dispatch to Earth as Krypton explodes, carrying with him the planet’s “Codex” (global DNA) and a parting wish to “make a better world than ours was.” Furious General Zod brutally intervenes, but his actions and intentions aren’t yet fully revealed. Kal-El, soon to be known as Clark Kent, makes a rough landing on Earth. So does Man of Steel, alas, which sets about hitting the standard Superman story marks with considerably less finesse than at the movie’s outset. Snyder’s propulsion hits the padding of an overstuffed story by screenwriter David S. Goyer (Blade) and producer Christopher Nolan of the rebooted Batman franchise. We meet in due course Kal-El’s adoptive Earth parents, Kansas farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane); scoop-hungry newspaper reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams); her gruff Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne); and assorted military and government shouters who will soon be coping with an alien invasion and winner-take-all battle. The good news is the casting is impeccable, beginning with Cavill as an uncommonly brooding but refreshingly deep Superman. The script doesn’t give him much to say, but it doesn’t need to. Every thought that crosses his brow registers him as a benign alien presence struggling to cope with a hostile new world, one that he can’t yet fully reveal himself to. Shannon’s Zod has similar dramatic weight, being a villain more by circumstance than by intent. His zeal to protect and recreate Krypton violently exceeds his mandate, and the only thing missing from the portrayal is the wickedly dry humour that Shannon excels at. Humour is rarer than kryptonite throughout Man of Steel, and that’s just part of the bad news about the film. It’s likely more Nolan’s fault than Snyder’s, since the one thing lacking from Nolan’s otherwise sterling The Dark Knight Rises last summerwas the dark levity previously supplied by the late Heath Ledger’s Joker. Man of Steel is almost too generous with the action set pieces, all of them set to Hans Zimmer’s thunderous score. You lose track of how many times either Superman or Zod slam each other into a building, which inevitably collapses under them, but you can count the film’s witty remarks on one hand. Ditto for romance: the slowly developing connection between our shy leading man and Adams’ forthright Lois Lane is not exactly one for the cosmos, since he’s a beer-sipping introvert and she’s a whisky-shooting extrovert. This is not the same as saying they’re not right for each other. Time will tell, and Man of Steel’s grandest achievement is making us care enough about all these characters that thoughts of the inevitable sequel beckon rather than repel. Origin stories rarely achieve 100 per cent success, since there’s usually too much story to their origins. Man of Steel is no exception, but there’s reason to hope that future chapters will really lift us up, up and away.

"Jun 12, 2013"," This Superman settles scores. And takes his shirt off.
This “Man of Steel” flies up, up and away, with his teeth bared and his fists clenched.
This Lois Lane knows his story, straight off. There’s little mystery about him.
If every generation gets the Superman it deserves, “Man of Steel” suggests we’ve earned one utterly without wit or charm, a grim, muscle-bound 33 year-old struggling to reconcile the past he is just learning about, trying to fit in with a military that may or may not consider him a threat but that needs his help when his fellow Kryptonians come to call.
“Man of Steel” is a radical re-interpretation of the Superman myth, no sin in itself. The Zack “300/Sucker Punch” Snyder version, scripted by David S. Goyer (story by Christopher Nolan), dwells much longer on Krypton and re-arranges the story, hurling us into the adult Kal-El’s Wolverine-like loner life as an American adult, showing us his formative childhood with the Kents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) only in flashbacks.
It gives his Kryptonian nemesis, General Zod, a mission — however misguided. And a point of view. So Michael Shannon, who plays him, isn’t all that scary,
Without the wit, winks, flirtation and old-fashioned sentiment of the “Truth, justice and the American way” take on the character, all Henry Cavill (“Immortals”) has to do is mix it up in a lot of “Transformers” inspired brawls with armored-plated aliens and occasionally agonize over it all.
Yes, most of the far sillier “Transformers” movies were more fun.
From its production design — ugly, black, insectoid spaceships — to its instantly forgettable Hans Zimmer musical score, this movie goes out of its way to remove itself from the Christopher Reeve “Superman” movies. And it is the poorer for it.
Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer play the parents who pack their baby up and ship him off their doomed planet. The sad resignation of the Marlon Brando version of Father Jor-El is lost because General Zod stages a coup, mid-planetary meltdown, giving this overlong prologue shoot-outs and armored brawls. And Crowe’s Jor-El never quite goes away.
We spend far too little time with the story’s heart, the ways the baby is embodied with good old fashioned heartland virtues. Costner and Lane have the film’s best scenes.
“Decide the kind of man you want to be,” Clark Kent’s dad tells him, urging him to keep his ID secret, to use his powers sparingly, with care. The grown-up Clark wanders the bars and crab fishing fleets, committing the occasional supernatural act of compassion and the occasional supernatural fit of pique.
Amy Adams is an over-achieving Lois Lane, totally clued in on the evidence of an alien among us by the military. Laurence Fishburne is a dull Daily Planet editor Perry White.
Take away the antecedents (Lois Lane has no Jimmy Olsen, boy photographer), strip the character’s Americanness (to make it easier to sell overseas) and it’s still a competent movie — state of the art explosions, implosions and what-not.
But take away the whimsy, the fun, and one has to wonder why Snyder, Goyer, Warners and Christopher Nolan bothered. ‘this movie goes out of its way to remove itself from the Christopher Reeve “Superman” movies’ i think what you wanted was already done…movie called Superman Returns.  I for one welcome the fresh, realistic approach far removed from the Donner influences. That was years ago, and no. Donner’s films, decades ago. There’s nothing wrong with making a Batman Superman movie. But tossing out the myth? Stupid, soulless move. I respect the review, and everyone is obviously entitled to their opinion.  But I really do think you have come to expect wit and charm in superhero movies.  This is a trait that Marvel are running with, and kudos to them.  But you have to appreciate the tone that DC are trying to go with, hence the tone of Nolan’s Batman trilogy. You mention tossing out the myth, but your basing this off the mythos of previous Superman films.  At the end of the day, this movie is based off a comic book(if you had done any research before reviewing this movie, you’d know that DC rebooted their comics with an edgier tone), not the previous movies. Also, you don’t need to ridicule the people that take the time to provide hits for this website and read your reviews.  Sure people can be bums and get annoyed when you don’t agree with them, but your probably older than a lot of these people.  Show a bit of class and rise above it. Thank you for your review…it’s all I wanted to hear…reading that it’s nothing like old Superman movies is music to my ears. I hate those movies…I’m 23 BTW. You would like more jokes like in IM3[stupid movie]? When I read all those reviews that say there’s too much action[there was none in old movies and they change one of the most recognizable villain into a joke] or reviewer misses red panties I’m just happy cause probably I won’t think the same about this movie. I’m going with fans opinion and pretty much all of them say this movie is epic and…well super. Uh, “red panties?” Well, you go and enjoy two hours and 23 minutes of digital fist fights, sonny. With $100 million worth of other lemmings. But when you figure out it’s lifeless, don’t get your panties in a bunch. You were warned. When it comes to this movie I note there’s a total disconnect not only between the critics and audience viewers(from twees, blogs et al) but also between different critics(for every one of you that criticizes an element there’s two others that praise the same thing). I’m guessing it’s because some of you are utterly fixated on the Reeves movies and consider action-heavy popular entertainment as crap. You be an unwashed, no taste uninformed boob if you like. But you’re the one reading reviews and ranting at them because they do not affirm your lack of taste and poor arguments for having a lack of taste.
And if you’ve been running to crappy movies I’ve panned, you, Vin Diesel and Tyler Perry must be on a first-name basis.  First of all don’t call me sonny. Second of all I’m pretty sure I will enjoy this “lifeless” movie more than the movie where superman turns back time by flying backwards around the earth…maybe Donner’s Superman would be more enjoyable to me if they would do what would actually happen if superman would stop the earth’s rotation. Maybe you can explain to me what was so great about old superman movies? If one of those “great” features of the old ones was characters “Americanness” maybe that’s my problem…I don’t care about that. You talk childish nonsense, you get called “Sonny.” You’re the one who brought up your callow lack of life experience.
This is no “Avengers” or “Iron Man” or “Dark Knight.” Or Donner “Superman,” which still has its fans. Inferior in all comparisons. “Lifeless.” However, Matthew the 23-year-old, it is clear that you missed out on what actually happened at the end of the original Superman.  So I will inform you. Superman did not “stop the earth,” so we don’t need to see what would happen in that event.  He didn’t change the rotation of the earth in any way!  What he did was fly faster than light, making it possible to travel back in time (Einstein be damned).  Earlier in the movie, during his interview with Lois, she asked how fast he could fly but the question was never answered.  So it tied up a loose end in dramatic fashion as Superman went against his father’s wishes to save Lois. i don’t understand your comment about tossing out the myth.  Snyder, Goyer and Nolan haven’t tossed out anything.  The Superman mythos and canon is still there as it’s just updated for a modern audience.  I think you’re image of Superman is engrained in those Donner movies and as great as they are they are severely outdated and would not hold in today’s audience.  Remember, the Donner route was already tried with Superman Returns to modest results.  From what I recall is that everyone’s complaint at the time was there was not enough action.  And if you think about it, I don’t think Superman has punched anything since Superman II which was like what…30 years ago?  Anyway your opinion is your opinion and will not criticize you if you did not enjoy the movie.  But really your review, and majority of the negative reviews, did not like the movie because mainly it was a far departure from the light-hearted, cat tree saving Superman of yester years.  If that’s the case, then I’m that more excited come June 14th. Living in central Florida the one thing I have learned is that if Roger hates a movie run out and see it and do the opposite of he doesn’t. Serioulsy lets not forget it ia summer movie season and we expect to see a spectacle. We are not intetested in seeing Gone With the Wind Superman Style. We want a movie that has thought and lots of action. They seem to do a good job with the Christ aspect of a super hero like superman . There even having Pastor sneak previews. Says something about the thinking in this movie, yet it still is a Summer Box office event… you reviewers always seem to forget that and thats why you usually hate Emmerich’s films as well. It’s the most simplistic silliness in movie making to have a character spread his arms wide and “die for our sins.” Does that make it “Deep” or make it work? No. jmoneyideas, why is it that most of the critics AND fans liked Nolan’s Batman trilogy? It balanced character, story, and action. This is Zack, fucking, Snyder and I am not surprised about these reviews AT ALL. The guy’s movies all LOOK “cool” but they are empty shells. Dawn of the Dead stripped the original’s social commentary and just made it a bloodbath. 300 was…just a bloodbath, a pretty looking bloodbath though. Watchmen isn’t even CLOSE to being as good as the graphic novel. It just LOOKS like it but doesn’t replicate what it FEELS like. WB tried to get Snyder before for Superman and he turned it down, they gave him Watchmen, and then they AGAIN gave him Superman and I HATE WB for it because they guy is a hack. I think I get this movie based on what Roger (and other critics) are saying, and what I’ve seen in the trailers. Basicaly this Superman (and the one from Superman Returns) have identity crises and spend a lot of time navel-gazing. That’s NOT Superman! Superman is a force of positivity and optimism. (OK, perhaps a Reagan allusion more than a Christ one…and maybe some Repubs will say what’s the difference? 🙂  But Christopher Reeve hit the right tone. We don’t need a brooding and grim Superman, that’s what Batman is there for. Anyone who knows the comics mythos knows that the two have become counterpoints to each other. (especially since the ’86 Crisis) . And no he doesn’t have to be all jokey like Iron Man. There is a balance that can be struck. Hi Roger, I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt on this one for a couple of reasons that I’m going to list as I have had the chance to see the film too. Also, I’m going to explain why I enjoyed the film, speaking as a hardcore Superman fan. Let me make it clear that I loved the old Superman movies, and Reeve will always be the man who made you believe you could fly.  That being said today’s word is dark and brutish, but with a glimmer of hope. It’s not the 1970s anymore, we’re living in dangerous times, and if you follow the comics, Superman is having trouble fitting into that to. The DC’s New 52 Superman has a hard time fitting in and is constantly butting heads with the military/governments regarding his powers, and the fear that he cannot be controlled…does this sound familiar?  The problem Snyder faced when making this film is that there are now two competing versions of Superman, your Golden Age cat from the tree Superman and the new ‘covered in blood and chains’ modern Superman who in a previous recent issue dropped an aircraft carrier on a group of super-powered villains…or was it a submarine…or both? Nevermind. What did Snyder try to do? Blend them into something new.  The other thing that I liked about this Superman is that unlike the Reeves version, I found that there wasnt as many Christ-like similarities in this film, you actually see him finding himself and where he belongs, and as we both know…he screws up several times and people die. In the Reeves version of Superman, he goes into the Fortress as a child and emerges as full Superman! *cue John Williams theme*. Similar to Jesus, you see him as a child, and then *POOF* he’s 30. But wait? What about puberty? That must have been tough?, etc. etc.  Even in old versions of Superman comics, you had him traveling the world incognito trying to find out where he belonged, and helping where he could, and not always succeeding. Is there a Wolverine comparison to make? Sure, but remember that Superman was growing a beard and traveling the world 30 years before Wolverine even made his comic debut.  Now regarding the action, I will agree with you that it sometimes bordered on Transformers-level insanity, and you sometimes wonder what the hell is going on. However, in the old Bruce Timm animated series, and in the several DC animated films since, Superman causes a truckload of collateral damage in window-shattering building toppling fights. How else do you stop someone as strong as you? Bullets…no…but wait…let’s drop 1000 tons of concrete on their head, maybe that will work. I began to ask myself halfway through the big sequence at the end how there was even any city left, but I let that go.  Snyder, and more so I’m willing to bet Nolan, tried to inject some real worldness into this, like what would happen if Superman landed in our 2013 world and started a fight with some baddies just as strong as he was…you get a crap-load of damage. Could they have like gone to a less-populated area? Sure but Zod wasn’t exactly accommodating. Also, was the damage overkill? Sure but tame when you read any issue of Superman comics or watch any film/tv version that has him up against someone as powerful as him. Dropping an aircraft carrier on their head seems like a better solution than punching him again, not to mention more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  So that’s my piece, just thought you’d like to hear from someone who wasnt pouring the hate on so to speak, but someone who enjoyed the film, and thought to share their perspective. How are these days more “dangerous times” than the 1970s? We have never lived in a time more safer or technologically advanced or with a better quality of life for most people than now. Back when Superman I came out the cold war was in full swing, we had just come off the Vietnam War a few years back, and we were about to enter the economic recession of the early 80s. You couldn’t walk five feet without finding a fallout shelter in those days, figuratively speaking. Anyway, I saw Man of Steel at an early screening. Having a decent tone is nice but it doesn’t work if the rest of the movie doesn’t hold up. That would be like saying “Oh, the tone Michael Bay’s Transformers was going for was a fun, over-the-top suspenseful actiony tone”. Does it kind of hit that tone? Sure. Is it a good movie because of that? Nope. Movies are more than just a dark, serous tone – they have to be convincing, well-plotted, and interesting. imo, MoS wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t very good either from what I was expecting. It’s worth seeing but only just. It sounds like you forgot Superman is a comic book character. The issues you bring up are intrinsic to most interpretations of Superman these days. Thankfully, the Donner version isn’t the benchmark, and hasn’t been for a good long time. Also, the score is forgettable? Are you kidding me? It’s brilliant. Don’t matter how much action or effects a movie has. If you don’t feel for the characters, it is not a good movie. You cared for the characters in the Donner’s Superman movie. That’s is why the movies are still great today. Every movie seems to have big set pieces and explosions nowadays. Dunno why people are getting so hyped about action set-pieces when we’ve seen the exact same alien-attack-w/-city-leveling-action type of thing at least twice before (Avengers, Transformers 3, etc.). At least Into Darkness was brief about it’s city-destroying moment. It’s getting really tired. Is it possible you were biased when reviewing this film? I’m not looking to rant or offend. I’ve just been reading a lot of reviews and a lot of negative ones have compared this one rather unfavorably to the original Donnor films. Some, indeed, have been visibly biased. I’m just wondering whether your expectations might have colored your opinion. A review is, by its very nature, biased. HOWEVER — I have interviewed Zack Snyder and loved loved loved “300.” I have interviewed and given Henry Cavill the benefit of the doubt before, and I worship Michael Shannon. Many interviews with him over the years. This. Doesn’t. Cut. It. See that?  He’s basically saying that bias is all well and good, which makes it all the more obvious that he basically had this review pretty much written before he ever set foot in the theater to watch it. You could say the same exact thing about people who are blindly praising the film and going to see the film based on Chris Nolan’s presence alone, or on simply making it a “darker tone for a darker time”. Or whatever. Every reviewer suffers from a natural bias. Hence the difference in review scores between reviewers. I think the big issue is that people are expecting a “darker” Superman ala the Dark Knight trilogy, which is fine if done right, but it doesn’t adhere to its tone as well as it could. It’s certainly not terrible or anything but the film does have a “been there” feel in light of other summer blockbusters and didn’t really surprise me. My point is tone alone isn’t everything. If the film had a brighter tone, but was of the same quality and adherence to it as the darker tone, I still would have thought it a fairly mediocre/average experience. Roger… don’t feed the trolls. These clowns haven’t even seen the film yet. Fanboys were attacking critics who gave Iron Man 3 a bad review BEFORE it came out, and now those same “fans” are trashing the movie even more than what it probably deserves. Iron Man 3 was terrible. You obviously enjoy schtick in your comic book films, which is what Downey as Tony Stark has become. Thanks for the review, though. Never wanted to see a film more now. Man of Steel had more humanity in the famous “what was I supposed to do?  Just let ’em all die?” then Iron Man 3 had in its entire two hours.  It’s a popcorn action film.  This is something bigger.  It’s a portrait of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Sorry we’re not allowed to take superheroes seriously without being called “fanboys.” Iron Man 3 was a joke.  If you liked that film and thought it had humanity I feel sorry for you. And your taste in cinema. @Jack:
Sometimes “schtick” is warranted in a comic book film.   (and so did Return of the Jedi for that matter.) Iron Man is a more light hearted character than Batman, Wolverine, Daredevil or even Thor. Green Lantern on the other hand, might have benefited from a lighter touch. (and a better lead, but I’m not gonna get into that right now.) You didn’t like the score, I personally love it, a taste preference in which I can respect. You didn’t like the over serious tone of the movie, I feel that is what the movie needs to be successful at the moment. You didn’t like the transformers style action in this movie. I point to the 2006 Superman Returns to show you what Superman looks like without action, not a terrible movie by any stretch, but just at times, very boring,(it does have the greatest superhero entrance ever though with that plane scene). This superhero is begging for that type of action. You don’t have a superhero who can throw meteors into space have action sequences like say, a Batman would have. It just wouldn’t make sense. Overall I think you are being a little harsh, but I shall see it tomorrow at 7 and make up my own mind. I do have a question for you though Roger, can you please explain to me how Rotten Tomatoes has reviews that are B- territory, or even C+, and are put as Rotten? That seems to me to be a little off, considering by their own standards, a 60% is considered Fresh. It depends on whether RT puts the rating on itself, or the critic loads his or her review up.
The tone of a review says more in words than mere star ratings, etc.
A lot of people, myself included, use words like “efficient” and “competent,” while panning the film. Note that there are no real raves up there. Critics are shruggingly endorsing it, or panning it. I am just reading the reviews and everything I am reading is music to my ears. I am all for a seriously toned Superman movie with over the top action sequences, because that is exactly what I expect from Superman. I don’t expect him to drive in a car or a boxing match, I expect buildings to crumble from the carnage that is Superman against Zod. The last thing I wanted was a Marvel type superhero movie that doesn’t take itself serious, with little to no action. That would be just like the last incarnation of Superman, and there is a reason so many fans of the Superman franchise have an extreme distaste for it. I have a feeling that even though this movie will sit mediocre with the critics, it will sit very well with the audience, myself included. Thanks for the review though! Again, RT sometimes takes it on itself to fiddle with ratings. Not my doing. If you name the reviews you say are rotten when they should be fresh, I will go in and fix it.
And again, note that there are NO RAVES for this movie. None. Indifferent endorsements, indifferent pans. And it’s at 65% and falling on the RT scale.
And you’re making more of that scale than you should. The middle-ground consensus? It’s not all that.  Of course, the film WASN’T devoid of “wit,” it just wasn’t the character of the Christopher Reeve films that Superman Returns was.  Anything less than that, I guess, is a Nirvana album to these people.
I grew up reading Superman in the ’90s.  This movie is hardly “dark” compared to things like Doomsday, Reign of the Supermen and Kingdom Come.
It’s as if from the moment Chris Nolan’s involvement was announced, these “critics” made up their minds that they’d turned him into this glum sourpuss and that there would be no humor in the film.  I saw it.  There’s wit, there’s charm.  It’s just not a friggin’ 2-hour long stand-up routine like the Iron Man films. I dare you to point out Nolan’s contributions to the script. He’s invisible. Unless it was his idea to jumble things up and tell the story out of order. Which doesn’t work either, BTW.
And Frankie, seriously, stop commenting here. I’ve deleted, what, 7 comments that cross the line? Back under the bridge with the other trolls. Another reviewer stuck in Donner’s world, endlessly comparing it to something outdated and campy.  It is widely known that Snyder/Nolan used the comics to make this movie and used NOTHING from previous films/television.  Judging by the early audience reaction, your review is way off base; it certainly makes me want to plunk my money down for it! Wow I’m really bummed about the reviews for this film. While I haven’t seen it yet, I can tell several reviews are being pretty biased, exactly the same as what happened for the Amazing Spider-Man. Some negative reviews actually makes sense and I take those seriously since they explain really problems with the film, such as action being too stretched, the beginning of the movie feeling choppy because of the constant jumps from Krypton, flashbacks then the present or a few secondary characters being underdeveloped.  Then there are the reviews that, to sum it up; Reboot = rotten no matter what, nothing like the Superman in the original movie = rotten no matter what, Nolan influence = rotten no matter what, no red undies = rotten no matter what. The funny thing is, these problems are somehow stretched into a full out review trying it’s best to make it seem as if it were written by a professional. I usually refer to professional reviews for movies, but there are times when you just gotta ignore them and judge the movie for yourself. Something I have opined about  is that the Punisher movies never work because in the comics he exists as a counterpoint to Spider-man and Daredevil, two men who have a strict no-killing policy. In the movies, he’s just another goof with big guns. Yawn.  Superman and Wonder Woman work in the comics/cartoons because they’re surrounded by myraid alien threats and supernatural threats. In their respective TV shows all they did was beat up bank robbers and spies in sharkskin suits. Double Yawn.  You are so idiotically off topic — Superman Returns? 2.5 stars from me ages ago — and off your nut, gramatically and rationally, that I will leave this up, as one should always archive the IP address of the dented. Yes, and I was responding to your suggestion that I panned the movie just for traffic. Preposterous. I had hopes for “MOS” based on one of the trailers. I do, however, take pains to get my Rotten Tomatoes blurb to be as grabby as possible. No, math illiterate works though. And argumentative. Twenty eight bad reviews on RT alone. And I just adore abuse from some delta bravo who hasn’t seen the movie she/he is defending, slinging accusations that you can’t back up. Roger, I do appreciate your review and your perspective.  However, I do have to agree with some of the other comments. I love Superman. I was the child who ran around with a towel around my neck pretending I could fly.  I love Batman, but Batman is my #2 favorite.  I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy.  It was serious, compelling, complex, thematically rich, etc.  I watched Iron Man 3 the other day.  I found it to be simple, vacuous, uninspired, lacking in depth or substance, etc.  But I went to the theater expecting it to be this type of movie so I’m not complaining.  Terrible?  No.  Entertaining?  Yes.  Memorable?  No.  It was a popcorn movie without soul.  I thought the same thing about The Avengers.  When I walked out of The Avengers last May I turned to my dad and my brother and said, “That was a lot of fun, but I’ll be very upset if they make Man of Steel like this movie”.  The Avengers was fun, witty, clever, and entertaining, but it’s not what I want from a Superman movie.  I want movies that take the genre more seriously.  Not all movies need nor should have ‘comic relief’ (I don’t mind SOME well placed humor).  Many people love Spider-Man 2. I don’t get it, for the same reasons.  The first hour of the original Superman movie is brilliant.  Some of the best that superhero movies have ever offered.  Serious, comtemplative, etc.  Then the movie becomes campy and silly.  It takes me out of the story.  Of course I’m just expressing my own aesthetic preferences and they are neither right nor wrong and neither are yours or any others who are posting comments here.  I have not seen Man of Steel yet so I might not even like it, but I am intrigued by the critic’s negative reviews.  Many sites that I frequent are gushing over MOS.  They say it’s everything that they had hoped for in a Superman movie.  Then I read reviews that are critical of it because it’s too serious, they don’t connect emotionally to the characters, or there is too much action.  I want to see Superman kicking a@@ and lots of it, but I also want seriousness, depth, emotion, complexity, etc.  Many have said that this movie has it all and many disagree.  It’s seems to be a very polarizing movie.  I hope I agree with those that love it and connect with it, but I won’t convince myself it’s good if it isn’t.  I didn’t like Superman Returns and I enjoy Superman I and II, but I have begun to outgrow them.  I doubt there is a Superman fan as excited as I am about this movie.  I guess I just don’t care what they do to other superheroes, but keep my Superman and Batman serious.  I loathe the Transformer movies, Emmerich movies, etc.  However, the only difference between these movies and The Avengers, Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, etc, is that the latter have charm, wit, and levity.  But charm, wit, and levity aren’t enough for me.  I think that superhero movies need to take a page from the Dark Knight Trilogy and ride that wave. There’s a reason that everyone loves The Empire Strikes Back so much.  Dark, serious (with some well placed but tempered humor), philosophically complex, dripping with ambiguity and conflict, etc.  Maybe MOS is none of these things.  Maybe it is.  I hope so and I’ll find out in 48 hrs.  Roger, keep the discussion alive, it’s important.  Cheers!",NEUTRAL

"Jun 11, 2013"," All three play a part in Man of Steel, the latest big-screen version of the Superman saga. Given that each is a MacGuffin of some sort, you would think the movie could find a way to combine at least two of them and save all the mumbo jumbo. Man of Steel, written by David S. Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder, indulges in such arcane details. Like last year’s Prometheus, the picture spends so much time explaining its world – or, worse, the origins that led to its world – that it never becomes a compelling story of its own. The movie opens on Superman’s home planet of Krypton, and in a sense it never leaves. Political intrigue, history lessons, demonstrations of Kryptonian technology – the only thing that kept me awake during this slog of a prologue was the sight of Russell Crowe (as Superman’s father Jor-El) riding a giant cicada. Although we eventually get to earth, the Kryptonian claptrap continues with the appearance of Zod (Michael Shannon), a disgraced general from that planet who is in pursuit of Superman. Zod likes to talk a lot about Krypton too; in what is probably the picture’s defining scene, he engages in a debate on the planet’s legacy with the ghost of Crowe’s Jor-El. There may be something especially wearisome about this emphasis on lore because Superman is – let’s be honest – a fairly straightforward creation. Just look at his name. Sure, decades of comics have expanded the myth, but essentially this is a guy who can fly and lift heavy things. To burden any superhero with this much lore would be tiresome, but it’s especially so when the myth is being built upon such a slight foundation. Not that a good Superman movie can’t be made. They managed it in 1978, with Superman, largely by having fun with the simplicity – dare I say hokiness – of the character. Man of Steel needn’t have taken that same approach (2006’s Superman Returns failed by copying its predecessor), yet what the filmmakers do offer here is a movie with no defining characteristic beyond its laborious myth-building. Man of Steel has no personality of its own. Which brings us to Henry Cavill in the title role. As far as I know, he’d make a fine Superman. Unfortunately Man of Steel never gives him the chance. After we meet Superman as an infant on Krypton, we next see him for a brief time as an adult working on a commercial fishing boat. Next is a flashback to one of his first days in elementary school and then we’re back to his life as a fisherman. A flashback to middle school follows and then the narrative proper – such as it is – finally gets under way. The result is that the movie feels like a prequel, sequel and reboot all wrapped up in each other. Cavill should be the anchor, but this chopped-up story never allows him to make any sort of lasting impression. Save for Kevin Costner – who has the movie’s best moments as Jonathan Kent, Superman’s adoptive dad – most of the cast is shortchanged in this way. Amy Adams’ Lois Lane is an all-purpose plot device, called upon to be a sidekick, romantic interest and unlikely action heroine depending on the scene at hand. Shannon, meanwhile, makes the odd decision to underplay his villainous role, resulting in a dispiritingly unmemorable performance. I’d quicker kneel before Shannon’s freaked-out father in Take Shelter than Zod. If Zod is less than a formidable villain, it’s partly because none of the action in Man of Steel carries much weight. Generating suspense around an indestructible hero has always been a problem for Superman stories, but it’s emphasized here by all the computer-enhanced pummeling that goes on. This isn’t Superman versus Zod, but two costumed clouds of pixels pounding away at each other, to no real consequence. Eventually the movie tries to up the intensity by having Superman battle some sort of giant spacecraft with tentacles, but the CGI nonsense had become so thick at this point I wasn’t quite sure what was going on. I think he may have been battling the World Engine, but don’t hold me to that. I never take notes during Krypton history class.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2013"," As iconic as he has been since his creation in the 1930s, Superman has always been something of a problematic character — particularly on film. Over time, Supes has become all but indestructible, the rampaging Doomsday of the comic books aside. He is so true blue and virtuous and, yes, All-American that he has no nuance, certainly none of the dark corners of the soul that afflict Batman and other superheroes. There is a reason why Green Arrow always refers to him as the Big Blue Boy Scout. Only occasionally do slivers of something more complex pierce the Superman iconography: the superheroes as misguided gods theme of the graphic novel “Kingdom Come,” the teen angst of television’s “Smallville.” The makers of the new “Man of Steel” — director Zack Snyder (“300”) and screenwriter David S. Goyer, working on a story from producer Christopher Nolan (director of the Dark Knight films) — seize on those hints of gray in their reboot of a franchise that hasn’t really clicked since 1980’s “Superman II.” The result is a film that, while relentlessly grim and badly in need of humor, manages to be a smart, nuanced take on the Superman mythology. It successfully tweaks Superman’s now-familiar origin story to make it more complex and more interesting. In addition, it carries enough visual and action punch to succeed on that level. The Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) we first meet in “Man of Steel” is hardly a Superman (that name for the character is actually used only once in the movie). He is a man in his 30s drifting through life, going from job to job with only occasional flashes of his powers. Much of the film’s first half consists of flashbacks to the dying planet of Krypton and to the Smallville of Clark’s youth. There are far more psychological layers to this Superman-in-the-making, with a fuller exploration of the tragic Krypton and Clark’s relationship with his adopted Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane).  In fact, big chunks of the early “Man of Steel” are carried by Costner’s Kent and by Russell Crowe’s Jor-El, Superman’s two fathers. Crowe, in particular, is a weighty presence as he defends son Kal-El long enough for the baby to be sent rocketing to Earth and away from the clutches of General Zod (Michael Shannon), a military leader staging a coup against the government in what he sees as one last attempt to save the planet. One big shift in the Superman storyline comes when Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) discovers his secret early on and actually helps him protect it. That doesn’t last long, though, as General Zod and his followers (the only other survivors of the destruction of Krypton) turn up looking for Kal-El. Since most of humanity didn’t know there was an all-powerful, godlike alien walking the planet, they’re not sure whose side to take — and the American military simply wants to blow the heck out of all the superbeings. As you might expect, this all ends up in an extended and often spectacular battle that takes out most of Smallville and a good chunk of Metropolis. The final showdown between Superman and Zod is particularly long and brutal, ending with a “Dark Knight”-like moment that may jolt some of the audience. I’ve never been a huge fan of Snyder’s work. (He really made a hash out of the brilliant Alan Moore/David Gibbons’ comic series “The Watchmen.”) But on “Man of Steel,” he does a respectable and sometimes inspired job of remaking the basic Superman tale. Cavill is perfectly fine as Supes, although it’s not until the very end that he gets to flash the kind of charm and sly wit that Christopher Reeve brought to the role. Shannon, a terrific actor, is a big plus as Zod, and you want to see more of Adams as Lois because she animates every scene she is in. Crowe, Costner and Lane all do fine by their parts. That said, “Man of Steel” is just too grim to be fully successful and way too heavy-handed in its attempts to draw parallels between Clark/Kal-El and Jesus. OK, guys, we get it — godlike figure willing to sacrifice himself for all mankind — so let it go. If just a few glimmers of the wry humor of, say, “The Avengers” and of the joy that was watching Reeve soar into the skies for the first time had made their way into “Man of Steel,” this film really would have been something.",POSITIVE

"Jun 11, 2013"," It’s symptomatic of the changes that writer David S. Goyer and director Zack Snyder have made to the traditional Superman mythology in “Man of Steel” that when Jonathan Kent, Clark Kent’s adoptive earth father, dies, it’s not from something as straightforward as the heart attack of the comics (or of Richard Donner’s 1978 “Superman” and the TV series “Smallville”). Instead—and this would count as a minor spoiler, I guess—he’s swept away in a tornado. That allows for a massive special-effects sequence, of the sort that Snyder loves. But bigger isn’t necessarily better, and oddly the result is less emotionally resonant than of old. This rather dour but aggressively whiz-bang take on Superman’s first appearance on earth is intriguing up to a point, but, unlike the twister that carries Pa Kent off, it won’t blow you away. Note that it is a whole-scale retelling of Big Blue’s origin (and the blue is more prevalent here, with much of the red and yellow removed from his costume)—a reboot rather than the quasi-sequel to the pictures of the seventies and eighties that Bryan Singer’s sadly underrated 2006 “Superman Returns” was. It’s also stylistically very different from Singer’s elegant, graceful, reverential film. It’s far grittier and darker, as one might expect of a picture produced by Christopher Nolan, whose remaking of the Batman myth opted for angst over camp. And though it occasionally tips its hat to the earlier pictures (as in the treatment of a bully early on, which recalls the closing gag to “Superman II,” albeit on a predictably larger scale), it often goes its own way, with alterations to the “canonical” narrative that go beyond mere costume design. It also opts for bombast instead of Singer’s limpid, almost balletic approach; indeed, one of its most prominent qualities is the handheld camerawork of Amir Mokri that renders many of the images as jerky and murky as those you’ll encounter in a low-budget independent movie—but this one reportedly cost nearly $200 million and could certainly have afforded a few tripods. When that’s added to the fact that many of the action sequences, especially in the final half-hour of almost incessant super-fistfights, are shot to appear blurred and indistinct (deliberately, one trusts), it makes for an unsettling—some would argue unpleasant—visual experience. (These remarks are based on the 2D version. The studio wouldn’t allow critics to also check the 3D one for comparative purposes.) Once you’re past the technical oddities (or infelicities), however, “Man of Steel” turns out to be basically a hybrid of the traditional origin scenario and the Kryptonian-villain plot of “Superman II” in lieu of one featuring the earthling Lex Luthor. That allows for the addition of a large dose of “World of the Wars”-style sci-fi to the mix, with the obvious goal of providing sufficient widespread devastation to satiate the desires of thirteen-year old boys brought up on wildly violent video games. The first twenty minutes or so are devoted to the final days of Superman’s home planet, Krypton, here portrayed as a dank, imperialistic society that’s colonized other planets while exploiting its own resources so thoroughly that it’s now threatened with imminent destruction. (Kryptonian dystopia is also seen in the fact that children are genetically engineered in some sort of elaborate ultra-“womb” that produces infants predetermined to fit certain social roles.) The only humane, rational person around seems to be stoic, solemn scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe), whose son has uniquely been born naturally and who foresees the planet’s core exploding. When the governing board refuses to listen to him, he prepares a tiny spaceship to send little Kal-El, to earth, carrying—as we later learn—the future hope of Kryptonian society with him. Just as the time comes for launch, the planet’s military chief General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup, in the course of which he kills Jor-El, but not before Kal-El is on his way. And the coup fails anyway, leaving him are his comrades to be sentenced to icy eternal imprisonment. But serendipitously the planetary cataclysm frees them while the rest of Krypton perishes. Meanwhile Kal-El reaches his destination and, as we’re shown is a series of jagged flashbacks, learns from his salt-of-the-earth adoptive parents, Kansas farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) to conceal his special powers because the human race would never accept him. That leads the rechristened Clark Kent after Jonathan’s death (now played by handsome, well-muscled Henry Cavill, from “Immortals”) to become a nomad, working menial jobs in remote places only to move on after being compelled by his innate sense of duty to perform some life-saving feat that might unmask him to the world. It’s only after an ancient Kryptonian scout ship is unearthed beneath the polar ice that, in investigating the craft, he learns his real identity (and is given by his father’s scientific shade his Superman duds). There he also encounters intrepid Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), whom he rescues from the ship’s technology, only to have her track him down afterward. (Goyer and Snyder have no truck with the old comic-book business about her not knowing who Superman is when in his street clothes.) Unfortunately that scout ship’s homing beacon has alerted Zod to Kal-El’s location, and soon he and his armada have invaded earth space, demanding the Kryptonian’s surrender to them—or else. That initiates the picture’s second half, in which Superman turns himself in to avoid the destruction of his adopted planet, earth authorities dither over whether to hand him over to Zod or not, and the general’s intention to annihilate the human population to make way for a new Kryptonian one leads Superman and the U.S. military to join forces to stop him. Much urban destruction ensues, wrought by a device that Zod unleashes over Metropolis with the unfortunate order “Release the World Bomb!” (or something of the sort)—which anybody who recalls “Clash of the Titans” and its risible “Release the Kraken!” will have trouble hearing without having to suppress a smirk. To make a long last reel short, there follow many face-offs for Superman, one against femme warrior Faora (Antje Traue) and what appears to be a Gort-like Kryptonian robot, a second against a ship with metallic tentacles that try to strangle him, and a third against Zod himself, which are intercut with human heroics by an assortment of his new earth allies (including Christopher Meloni as an army corporal, Richard Schiff as a scientist and Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet editor Perry White, as well as Lois of course, who’s been instructed by Jor-El’s shade on how to help), some of which involve shooting the spacecraft that brought Kal-El to earth into that World Bomb like a torpedo. It all ends with a final choice by Superman that’s completely out of character with the Man of Steel’s traditional code, though younger viewers probably won’t mind (while older fans will be appalled), and Clark’s taking a job at the Daily Planet. Cue the prospective sequel. Nolan and Snyder deserve credit for trying to rethink America’s most venerable superhero in order to make him more relevant to today’s audiences by portraying him as emotionally vulnerable and uncertain of himself—though, to be honest, “Smallville” followed the same trajectory without getting so Dark Knightish about it. And they’ve certainly given it their all in terms of production (even if some of their choices, like the handheld style, seem misguided) and casting (though in a picture like this, the effects become the stars). Cavill is a good-looking Clark/SM, though the plot requires him to remain a pretty dour fellow until the very last scene, when he’s finally allowed a smile. Adams, unfortunately, makes a fairly colorless Lois Lane, though she captures the character’s modern spunkiness well enough. Crowe and Shannon represent two extremes, with the former so rigidly controlled that he comes off as a well-coiffed mannequin and the latter so wildly over-the-top that the result is almost comical in the worst sense. Lane and Costner each get a few moments to shine, and Meloni, Schiff and Fishburne do what’s asked of them, but they’re all pretty standard-issue. Perhaps Nolan, Snyder and Goyer’s instincts are correct, and “Man of Steel” will prove to be the Superman movie for our time, at least in terms of boxoffice success and franchise potential. But whether that’s true or not, it’s not a Superman for the ages.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2013"," When news broke that the Superman reboot was to be shepherded by 300 and Watchmen director Zack Snyder, it was greeted with a feverish mixture of hype and anxiety. Would this be a truly populist retelling – one with heart and soul – or would it be all airless flash and pyrotechnics, as Snyder at his least popular seems wont to peddle? Man of Steel puts a lot of those qualms to bed. It's a thumping, gauntlet-clad fist of a movie, making its impact with brute force, then letting shockwaves reverberate through you. Whether it's everything we might have asked for is still a question worth pondering, but the clenched weight of the thing is often staggering while it's above you. What Snyder and writer-producer Christopher Nolan have cannily done is cream off the standout elements of other blockbuster franchises around them. From Marvel's Avengers, we get crunching mano-a-mano grudge fights pitting superhuman strength against its equal: the skittering, planet-circling battles between Henry Cavill's caped hero and his nemesis, the Krypton rebel General Zod, imagine how loud the collision might be when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. From the recent Star Trek movies, we get tons of spiky, obsidian design for the outer-space action, blended with polished biomechanical concepts for the Krypton flying machines and craft. A lavish, pleasingly crazy prologue has a super-baby, Kal-El, being born just as the genocidal Zod (Michael Shannon) threatens insurrection and brings his planet to ruin. Snyder has form imagining alien cinematic landscapes even in the context of ancient Greece, and doesn't lack confidence on this one, trusting that we'll be happy to watch Kal-El's father, the Krypton scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe), riding on the back of a giant dragonfly thing without finding it a tad silly. It's a grand set-up for the movie's bold, earnest mythic approach – you're in or you're out, really. Pretend this isn't destroying your dreams, but there's also DNA from Michael Bay's Transformers series in the wide-scale destruction Zod ends up visiting on Earth – the kind of sequence in which we watch an entire skyscraper topple from below, its windows glittering as they warp and tumble. Cavill, as the adult Kal-El, has too many fires to put out single-handedly, and must choose between the dying legacy of his old planet and his desire to protect this new one from the extraterrestrial fascism, which is also a 9/11-conjuring brand of terrorism, that Zod represents. What the Nolan stamp really means here is a unified if unsmiling vision of how this moral messiah chooses his calling – as he tests his strength on Earth's icescapes and receives gruff advice from more than one wise father figure, it starts to take shape as Superman Begins. His Norman Rockwell-ish foster parents, played by Diane Lane in cardigans and Kevin Costner in plaid, teach him to lie low, keeping his gifts a secret from the race – ours – that's not ready to comprehend them yet. Costner has one spine-tingling moment, raising his palm to stop a rescue and keep Kal-El's cover, which matches the emotional conviction Glenn Ford brought to this role in Richard Donner's version. There are remarkable visual coups every few minutes, courtesy of wizardly production designer Alex McDowell and a computer effects team stretched to the creative maximum. Downsides? It would cost the movie nothing to lighten up a little with its My Two Dads routine, or to inject some wit into its save-the-world-from-extremism routine. Then again, with Costner and Crowe in an adept growl-off as said dads, and Snyder and Nolan fathering the production, it was never going to be long on flippancy or showtunes. A Superman movie lacking Lex Luthor was always in danger of underperforming in the irony department, too. And this is fine. But it's not just that: all levity is more or less banished, and even romance, as if putting on a hairshirt for what fans didn't like about Superman Returns (2006). Amy Adams bears the brunt as Lois Lane, here a serious investigative journo. ""I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter!"", she feels the need to remind her editor (Laurence Fishburne) while trying to get the scoop on this broodingly restrained alien do-gooder. Man of Steel is similarly keen to flaunt its credentials – it has heft, it looks amazing, and it's businesslike to a fault.",NEUTRAL

It’s a cliché followed by a yawn when the makers of comic-book movies boast about how ‘real’ and ‘psychological’ their stories are. Yes, we know, Spider-Man and Batman were just troubled sons with daddy issues. But it’s harder to make those claims for a Superman tale, even when the producer is ‘Batman’ regenerator Christopher Nolan – a man with more backstories than an osteopath. Just how ‘real’ can the story of a genetically-modified baby launched to Earth from a planet called Krypton ever feel? And so it’s no surprise that ‘Man of Steel’ feels both modern and traditional – a halfway house between the broodier Nolan way of shaking things up and the louder, bone-crunching style that director Zack Snyder established with films such as ‘300’ and ‘Sucker Punch’. ‘Man of Steel’ is punchy, engaging and fun, even if it slips into a final 45 minutes of explosions and fights during which reason starts to vanish and the science gets muddy. It opens with a lengthy preamble explaining how Jor-El (Russell Crowe) launched his son Kal to Earth just as his planet was falling apart, and how failed coup leader General Zod (Michael Shannon, a muted villain) was banished at the same time. It’s here, and at the end, that Snyder is at his most baroque: first, he indulges the weird science of Krypton and, later, he enjoys giving America a vicious pounding when Zod tracks down Superman. It’s in the middle section, post-Krypton, pre-showdown, that the film hits its stride. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill, a good choice for Superman: solid, sturdy, fairly anonymous) is a twentysomething wanderer uneasy with his powers. Rather than leading us through his whole life so far, Snyder tells the tale of Kent reconnecting with his past, finding the super-suit (unshiny, like the movie) and testing his powers, while often flashing back to his childhood. Soon, journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) knows what’s up. Adams’s character is different to the Margot Kidder version: she’s a tough-cookie investigator and not the sort to be hoodwinked by a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a comb-over. Mostly, this ‘Superman’ is more action than angst. But those daddy issues are still in play. Crowe – never an actor to show his ticklish side – plays Jor-El like he’s Hamlet’s father. Kevin Costner is Superman’s Earth dad in pastoral scenes full of cornfields, clothes on the line and snapshots of an easier time which look like they were conceived soon after a screening of Terrence Malick’s ‘The Tree of Life’. At times, you wish for a quick dash into a phone box and a cat that needs rescuing from a tree. Snyder is no party pooper, though. He might not resurrect Superman’s old theme tune, nor does he allow the word ‘Superman’ to be spoken (it’s all Clark and Kal). But by the end, he’s teased in some of the more amusing elements of the old story we thought were missing, leaving the way open for a sequel that will surely be more Earthbound.

"Jun 11, 2013"," Deploying an impeccable American accent, Brit Henry Cavill may be as charming as the late great Christopher Reeve — or Reeve’s unfortunate doppelganger Brandon Routh, who donned a more traditional Superman costume in “Superman Returns,’’ an underrated attempt to reboot the franchise seven years ago. Neither Cavill’s Superman nor his alter ego Clark Kent are required to turn on much charm in what’s definitely not your father or your mother’s Man of Steel movie. Like producer and co-story writer Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight’’ — and dare we say it, any number of films spun off from the rival Marvel Universe — this is a darker and more angsty take on the classic DC Comics character with lots more of the kind of action that fans have come to expect. In fact, without really giving anything away, the last 45 minutes of “Man of Steel’’ seem like a deliberate, and quite successful attempt to top the sheer destruction wreaked on Manhattan in the climax of “Marvel’s The Avengers’’ (called, of course, Metropolis here). The special effects are better, too. “Man of Steel’’ wipes the slate clean and begins again with a new version of the origin story, taking advantage of 35 years of advances in special effects and the bigger pool of Oscar winners and nominees available for superhero movies. Beginning with the birth of Kal-El (finally ending all speculation about whether Superman is circumcised), the film pits Russell Crowe (in very good form) as his dad, Jor-El, Krypton’s foremost scientist, against the evil General Zod (a splendid Michael Shannon), who ends up getting expelled into the Phantom Zone with his minions. Baby Kal-El is sent to Earth in a rocket — the retro-futuristic designs owe a tremendous debt to “Alien’’ — as his parents die in the destruction of Krypton, though the spirit of Jor-El is brought back for more expository curtain calls than the ghost of Hamlet’s father. Clark Kent is first seen making a rescue from a flaming oil platform at sea. There are then multiple flashbacks to his troubled childhood and adolescence, where he’s tormented by his superpowers. Lois Lane (Amy Adams), who still works at the Daily Planet, first encounters Supe somewhere on assignment in the Arctic. But they don’t lock lips till they foil a convoluted plot by General Zod — the second defrosted super villain in the last month if you’re keeping track (Khan in “Star Trek” is the other) — to turn Earth into a second Krypton.",POSITIVE

"Jun 11, 2013"," To the oft-asked question of whether or not the world is really starving for yet another superhero origin story, Man of Steel simply responds by serving up what could be as much spectacle and action — minute-by-minute, frame-by-frame — as any movie anyone could think of. Zack Snyder’s huge, backstory-heavy extravaganza is a rehab job that perhaps didn’t cry out to be done but proves so overwhelmingly insistent in its size and strength that it’s hard not to give in. Warner Bros.’ new tentpole should remain firmly planted around the world for much of the summer. With Christopher Nolan’s mammoth Batman trilogy having wrapped up last year, the quick return of the other great DC comic hero was inevitable, even if the last attempt, Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns (2006), only lasted one lap. Nolan’s involvement here as a producer and co-story writer with David S. Goyer, his collaborator on all three Batman films, will encourage fans to look closely for his fingerprints, and a first impression might suggest his hand in deepening the hero’s roots to such a serious extent and insisting upon using Hans Zimmer to compose the score. Visually and rhythmically, however, Snyder has gone his own way, summoning up memories of Dune in the sculpted architectural look of Krypton, echoing Jesus by underlining the sacrifice Clark Kent is called upon to make for the good of mankind, and simply by hardly letting five minutes go by without inventing some new excuse for a staggering action scene — any one of which undoubtedly cost more than the combined budgets of all of this year’s Sundance competition lineup. Even the inevitably expository first 18 minutes on Krypton are spiked with an amazing amount of visual stimulation. As Jor-El (Russell Crowe) lays it all out about the planet’s road to ruin, its failed intergalactic colonization efforts and his discovery of a planet to which he can send his little son, we’re witness to both large-scale calamity and the intimate treachery of the rebellious General Zod (a ferocious Michael Shannon), whose murderous campaign gets him packed off to the deep space equivalent of Siberia. Snyder doesn’t miss a beat once the tale spins down to Earth. Scarcely has Kal-El emerged from his projectile after a long flight when he rescues workers from a burning oil rig. The youngster later sees his classmates in disturbing X-ray vision and, not long after the renamed Clark Kent asks his adoptive mother (Diane Lane), “What’s wrong with me, Mom?” a parade of topless shots of the young man reveal far from anything wrong but, rather, that the actor playing him, Henry Cavill, would have been fully qualified for a major role in Snyder’s 300 without any digital musculature added. When Clark saves the day yet again by lifting a school bus out of the water after it’s gone off a bridge, his adoptive father (Kevin Costner) realizes it’s time for a heart-to-heart. “You’re the answer to whether we’re alone in the universe,” he confides upon showing Clark the old pod that brought him to Earth. At the same time, ace Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets on to a story about a foreign object that’s been buried in ice for 20,000 years, while Jor-El abruptly rematerializes to teach his sprig more Kryptonian history and present him with his long-awaited suit and cape so he can begin his entertainingly staged flying lessons. For a film that has thus far spent an hour basically setting the table, writer Goyer and Snyder have found a way to sneak in at least a half-dozen big-time action sequences. Suddenly, there are two more, a Midwestern twister big enough to send not just a house but a whole town to Oz, and the spectacular spaceship arrival of Zod, who breaks Kal-El/Clark’s cover by giving him 24 hours to surrender. Here the Jesus parallel asserts itself, especially when it’s stressed that Kal-El has spent 33 years on Earth anonymously before being asked to sacrifice himself. Not much more is made of this, but the subtext persists. When a real-time action sequence can’t be generated narratively, Kal-El experiences a nightmare vision of the Kryptonian dystopia Zod would impose upon Earth, which provokes him to attack the general in what is wittily staged as an old-fashioned Main Street showdown in Smallville. By now it’s clear that Snyder’s and Goyer’s intention is to have no downtime at all, just spectacle on top of spectacle. In enormous effects-driven films, this is often a counterproductive approach, in that it can either have a numbing, deadening effect, as in the Transformers series, or terminally suffer from a strained attempt to keep topping itself scene after scene, as in the last Indiana Jones adventure. Although it does go over the top toward the end, when Zod embraces a genocidal program and attacks Kal-El with giant metallic tentacles that are more ridiculous than scary, Man of Steel mostly plays it smart by mixing its action deck-of-cards style. Given the almost relentless pursuit of big scenes, Man of Steel manages to find the time to develop a reasonably plausible relationship between Kal-El and Lois Lane, who must balance her compulsion to deliver the scoop of the century with the suspicion, shared by the alien’s adoptive father, that the world is not ready for the likes of this superman (Superman? Does anyone here say “Superman”? Barely.) This is a smart, active, modern Lois, one who does need to be rescued on occasion but is always keen to be in the thick of things. Adams and Cavill develop a spirited rapport that’s enjoyable to watch in admittedly short spurts. Visually, Snyder and cinematographer Amir Mokri employ handheld shots noticeably more than is the norm in such megaproductions, and the very tight, short-focused shots of the hero’s face while flying have an unexpectedly intimate nature, quite beautiful in their way. The effects, which course through the film without cease, are not as consistently sharp as they normally were in Nolan’s Batman trilogy, veering from the expert to the video-gamey to the borderline cheesy, albeit charmingly so. Becomingly modest in the character’s low-key early scenes and gradually reveling in his power, Cavill has a pleasing presence that makes him easy to accept, as Kal-El accepts the extraordinary fate that has been prescribed for him. Snarling, scarred and not without a worthy villain’s righteous logic, Shannon excels as the fearsome Zod. Other major names are well cast and used down the line, including Costner, Lane, Crowe, Laurence Fishburne as Lois’s editor and Antje Traue as Zod’s relentless ninja-style warrior partner. Working in a somewhat lower key than was his norm for Nolan, Zimmer still provides the musical grandeur and sense of portent that lends the film an extra dimension.",POSITIVE

"Jun 11, 2013"," There’s nary a mention of kryptonite, the Fortress of Solitude is only an existential locale, and Clark Kent never earns so much as a single Daily Planet byline in “Man of Steel,” director Zack Snyder, writer David S. Goyer and producer Christopher Nolan’s strenuously revisionist Superman origin story, which might more accurately have been titled “Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Spacemen,” given the amount of screen time devoted to exiled Kryptonians body-slamming each other into all manner of natural and manmade structures. Clearly designed to do for DC Comics’ other most venerable property what Nolan and Goyer’s “Batman Begins” did for the Caped Crusader, this heavily hyped, brilliantly marketed tentpole attraction seems destined to soar with worldwide audiences this summer, even if the humorless tone and relentlessly noisy (visually and sonically) aesthetics leave much to be desired — chiefly, a “Steel” sequel directed with less of an iron fist. Where the red-booted one’s last bigscreen appearance, Bryan Singer’s 2006 “Superman Returns,” was conceived as a mash note to Richard Donner’s iconic 1978 “Superman,” Snyder, Goyer and Nolan (who also shares a story credit) labor to distance “Man of Steel” from those precursors, starting with a Krypton that looks less like an ice castle in the sky than a grayer, grimier version of “Avatar’s” Pandora (by way of “Alien”). There, the noble scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) plots to spirit his newborn son, Kal-El, away from the dying planet — a plan that coincides with a military coup staged by the rogue Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon, sporting a most unflattering bowl cut). That sequence sets the tone for much of what follows in “Man of Steel,” with Hans Zimmer’s thunderous score rattling both speakers and eardrums, the actors dwarfed by layer upon layer of crumbling buildings and warring spacecraft. After Zod and his accomplices are caught, they’re frozen solid and banished to a black-hole Siberia, just before Krypton itself goes kaboom. “Man of Steel” then breaks from a linear timeline to jump ahead some 33 years, where we find the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) working as a grunt on a commercial fishing trawler, not yet having revealed his superego to the world, but occasionally dabbling in large-scale heroics nonetheless. When a nearby oil rig is engulfed in a fiery blaze, he barges in to rescue the crew, then just as quickly disappears before anyone can ask too many questions. As in “Batman Begins” (which opened with a wayward Bruce Wayne wandering the earth like “Kung Fu’s” Caine), these are supposed to be Clark/Kal’s years in the wilderness, grappling with daddy issues and an amorphous sense of self as he bounces from place to place and one odd job to the next. Pic also adopts a similar flashback structure in which present events trigger memories of Clark’s past, as the adopted son of Illinois farm folk Jonathan (a touching Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) Kent, as a loner/outcast bullied by schoolmates, and as a superhero-to-be coming to terms with his alien heritage and powerful gifts. But even here, Snyder seems averse to staging a single scene in which there isn’t something catastrophic happening, whether it’s a schoolbus accident that plunges Clark and his classmates into a raging ravine, or the entire Kent family finding itself stranded on a highway in the path of an oncoming twister. Things finally snap into sharper focus for Clark when he follows news reports of a strange “anomalous object” to a NORAD outpost somewhere in the Arctic and, via a little Kryptonian hocus-pocus, communes with the holographic consciousness of his birth father (who narrates a brief animated history of the rise and fall of Krypton, drawn in striking, Soviet propaganda-art style). It’s there, at just around the 50-minute mark, that Clark first dons the trademark “S” suit, and also where he first encounters Lois Lane (Amy Adams), this time a Pulitzer Prize-winning hard-news reporter who uses her journalistic acumen to quickly deduce Supes’ secret identity. But rather than moving logically on to Metropolis, “Man of Steel” somewhat curiously dovetails back to Smallville, where Clark’s reunion with dear old mum is interrupted by the arrival of Zod. Newly freed from his interstellar limbo, he threatens to make haste with all of humanity unless Clark/Kal surrenders both himself and a coveted “Codex” that can be used to rebuild Krypton … on Earth. So far, so gloomy, with little of the genuine wonderment the very name “Superman” calls to mind. Blessed with the most classically chiseled jawline of any actor who’s yet donned the red cape, Cavill is also the most dour and brooding, lacking even the sardonic self-amusement of Christian Bale in Bruce Wayne mode — and he appears to have been directed to be exactly this way. Like its lead, Snyder’s entire movie seems afraid to crack a smile. The ambition to make a grittier kind of Superman pic is certainly admirable, but much of what Snyder and Goyer set out to fix wasn’t really broken in the first place. By having Lois discover Clark’s true identity so early on, “Man of Steel” relinquishes the halting romantic chemistry between the two characters that brightened previous versions of the tale. And the narrow focus on Clark, Lois and Zod gives the movie an oddly circumscribed feel. Nowhere to be found is the rich gallery of colorful supporting players that populated the Donner film, Nolan’s “Batman” pics and Snyder’s own “Watchmen” (one of the richest and most satisfying of all comicbook adaptations). Gone, too, are any of those lighter moments, fondly remembered from Supermen past,  in which our hero — in or out of disguise — used his powers for decidedly non-super feats and, by doing so, grew closer to his fellow man. One longs to see this Superman change a flat or rescue a kitten from a tree or take Lois for a flight around the block. Instead, we get two climactic rumbles — one on the streets of Smallville, one (finally) in downtown Metropolis — that test one’s patience for blurs of movement smashing through buildings with little if any respect for the laws of physics. Indeed, if “Man of Steel” doesn’t much look like previous “Superman” movies, it does closely resemble such other recent sci-fi/fantasy pics like “Thor,” “The Avengers” and “Transformers” and their symphonies of disorienting CGI destruction. At points, the action scenes even recall the hallucinogenic dream sequences from Snyder’s own crazily ambitious mental-hospital musical, “Sucker Punch,” except everyone here is supposed to be wide awake. Pic is undeniably impressive, in the sense that little if any expense has been spared in bringing Snyder’s vision to the screen, though this is a case where less would almost surely have been more. Much of the craft work exudes the same general feeling of overkill, from the frantic handheld shooting and desaturated colors of lenser Amir Mokri to the unceasing Wagnerian bombast of Zimmer’s score.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2013"," Back in 1978, Superman: the Movie became the film that kicked off cinema's superhero era; the tone, then, was jaunty self-parody, acknowledging correctly that the jaded decade in which it arrived could not support a face-value treatment of this straight-arrow comic-book hero. Fast forward 35 years and Superman is a very different beast: a lone voice for truth, justice and the American way with an expensive, uninspired attempt at a reboot – 2006's Superman Returns – behind it, and a cinematic universe currently overrun by Marvel's pop art team movies. Well, hopes are high for Man of Steel. Directed by Watchmen's Zack Snyder, and produced and conceived by The Dark Knight Rises' Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel treads a familiar route at first: Superman – as he is almost never called in this film – is born as his home planet Krypton is disintegrating into civil war and environmental catastrophe, and is sent into space by his father Jor-El just ahead of Krypton's destruction. Russell Crowe, with a plummy English accent as thick as a cupboard, plays the self-sacrificing father; he does rather well in the complicated opening scenes, which simultaneously introduce the rebellious General Zod (Michael Shannon), Krypton's rather zany liquid-metal communication-devices, and a visual style that smothers everything in a kind of irradiated backlit CGI. It's when we get to Earth that Man of Steel starts to take on its distinctive shape. Clark Kent – played by Henry Cavill with a permanent little worry-frown in the middle of his forehead – is revealed as a rootless drifter, blundering from one low-paid job to another in a frustrating battle to keep his taunters unbattered, his rescuees oblivious, and his inner demons placated. A series of sharp flashbacks show the roots of his emotional malaise: an adoptive father (Kevin Costner) who is pre-emptively convinced his boy will be hated and feared for his gifts. This, it would seem, is Nolan's principal innovation for this Superman: reminiscent, perhaps, of Batman Begins, this is superheroism as a burden, and a burden transformed into neurosis. The scenes where little Clark begins to discover his special powers are rather impressive to behold – he's baffled, and traumatised by the unwelcome intrusion of x-ray vision or laser-like heat beams from his eyes. It's this early part of the film that is most successful; Nolan and Snyder, along with scriptwriter David S Goyer, have created a plausible context for the introspection and self-doubt that dogs the adult version of their costumed warrior. Rather less triumphant is the introduction of the allegedly Pulitzer-prize-winning reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams); she encounters Clark not in the newsroom of the Daily Planet, but when the nascent Superman is toting baggage as a gofer on a military mission to recover a mysterious alien vessel from 20,000-year-old pack ice. Lane, as it happens, has much the more interesting narrative assigned to her – attempting to track the elusive superhero down, while trying to avoid the attentions of various security agencies – but her character is conceived far more sketchily than Kent's, with the result that the normally watchable Adams can't do much more than try for a kind of relentless perkiness as a counterweight to Cavill's frowning humourlessness. It has to be said that the failure to cook up much in the way of meaningful interaction for the pair throughout the film's midsection means that Man of Steel begins to labour even as the visual spectacle intensifies: no amount of whip-pans and crash-zooms, spaceship flameouts or collapsing edifices can compensate for an inert focal relationship. The whole film ends up feeling weighed down: though Man of Steel bounds from one epic setpiece to another, you're left with the nagging feeling that you just can't work out what the central twosome see in each other.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 11, 2013"," When audiences flock to theatres this Friday, they will be treated to an experience absolutely unlike anything they have ever seen before. This is not hyperbole. On every level, in every way, by every critical criterion I have to judge the effectiveness of film, and every benchmark of spectacle and wonder I have experienced in my time reviewing movies, Man of Steel is completely, utterly singular. I have never seen anything like it. At once vaster in scope than any superhero movie yet produced, and as intimately, crushingly emotional as any other entry in the genre, Man of Steel speaks in a fresh cinematic language viewers will be largely unaccustomed to. The scale of its action is completely unprecedented, an enormously, viscerally powerful shock to the system, yet in its narrative design and treatment of character, it employs the elliptical, understated rhythms of arthouse cinema. Suffice it to say such a blend has never been attempted on a production with this high a budget. But just as Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight threw out and re-wrote the rulebook for what a comic-book film could aspire to – and more importantly, what it could achieve – Zack Snyder and his team have made something that plays by very few of the preexisting rules for productions of this size. And like The Dark Knight, Man of Steel lands with the precise, explosive weight of a true historical milestone, a major step forward in the evolution of blockbuster cinema and a beautiful, thrilling, and above all else, emotionally moving masterpiece in its own right. What impresses me most about the film is how incredibly, uniformly tight it all feels. Superman is, as evidenced by the majority of his underwhelming cinematic career, an extremely difficult character to get right, and throughout Man of Steel, one can sense Snyder, Nolan (serving as producer), and writer David S. Goyer putting in every ounce of the work necessary to do him justice. As such, all aspects of the film – every narrative component, character beat, and aesthetic element – is directly, thoughtfully tailored to inform our understanding not only of Superman himself, but of how he fits into our world. I do not intend to draw many comparisons between Man of Steel and prior incarnations of the character – as previously stated, this film is unique – but when one looks at Richard Donner’s 1978 Superman film, one can frequently sense the difficulty those filmmakers faced. It wasn’t just the technological limitations of the time – the script essentially splits the film into three separate, loosely-related movies: one on Krypton, one dramatizing Clark Kent’s ascent to superhero status, and one built around the threat of Lex Luthor. In the balance, it is a very good film, but structurally, it comes across as fragmented, lacking the holistic sense of purpose and function necessary to make Superman – or any character, for that matter – truly palpable. Man of Steel, on the other hand, feels effortless, because all the pieces are exactly where they need to be for viewers to get swept up in a unified, overall momentum. The introductory material on Krypton is more than just an excuse to ship Kal-El off to earth – it is narrative and emotional context, where what we learn about this society directly informs our understanding of father Jor-El, antagonist General Zod, their respective worldviews, and all conflict to come. Similarly, Clark Kent’s years in Smallville are about more than merely instilling the character with ‘American values;’ by contextualizing Clark’s profound identity crisis within the difficult, identity-forming years of childhood and adolescence, which every single viewer can relate to, we are drawn emotionally closer to the character while the fundamentals of his attitude towards humanity, and the impact and ideology of his earth parents, are illustrated for us. A supporting player like Lois Lane is made indispensible, introduced not as a fiery love interest, but an active participant in the affairs of earth, someone who would be attracted to Superman because he embodies the ‘greater’ that a good journalist naturally strives to discover, and whom Superman would fall for because she represents the best of his adopted species. And perhaps most importantly – because this is where so many blockbusters get it wrong – the nature of the antagonist reaches back around to the film’s Kryptonian starting point, representing Superman’s history while providing the exact challenge necessary to forge his future. In short, the story is rock-solid and economically told, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the scenes dramatizing Superman’s childhood. I genuinely teared up every single time Kevin Costner was on-screen as Jonathan Kent, and in at least one of Diane Lane’s dynamite moments as Martha, not only because the actors are extraordinary, and have the presence to convey lifetimes worth of love and personal history, but because even their briefest of scenes bears enormous weight in the larger story being told. Just as Russell Crowe’s every appearance tells us more about how Jor-El sees both the world and his son’s place in it, every last moment spent with Jonathan and Martha further illuminates the influences Clark carries with him into adulthood. Those belief systems – Jor-El’s confidence that Kal-El can act as a beacon of hope and inspiration for humanity, and Jonathan Kent’s insistence that humanity is not ready for the revelation of his son’s true nature – are the launching pad for everything that happens in the film, both literally and thematically. Superman’s physical and ideological battles with General Zod are grounded in these ideas, and Clark’s central arc lies in finding a way to live that honors the teachings of both fathers. Fundamentally, Man of Steel is about the ways in which we struggle to reconcile who we are and what we feel inside with the influences of our pasts, and when I say the film is tight, it is because every single moment extends organically from these basic, human-scale themes. That is a rare feat for blockbuster filmmaking in general, and a balance only a small number of superhero films – Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight topping the list – have ever struck. The themes of the film are embedded in its structure, which, after the opening sequence on Krypton, is organized emotionally, rather than chronologically. Our first sight of Clark Kent on earth is as a wandering, bearded adult, and we come to understand his complex, conflicted state of mind by the way various events – the explosion of an oil rig, the heckling from a man in a bar, etc. – trigger flashbacks to key moments from childhood and adolescence. The tone is resolutely serious, with Amir Mokri’s gorgeous, ethereal cinematography – which borrows more from Terrence Malik than any work of commercial filmmaking – creating a highly emotional, introspective state. Clark is kept at a certain distance from the viewer throughout the film, because Superman is not someone we can ‘know’ through direct or simple means, but the structure and aesthetics constantly reinforce the nature of his internal conflict, and inform our understanding of how he moves through this world. It is a completely different approach to storytelling than any other comic-book movie has used, including Nolan’s Batman films, and I find it exhilarating to see a blockbuster as formally daring and ambitious as this. Ultimately, this is all reflective of just how completely Man of Steel understands Clark Kent as a character. More than anything else, I am simply overjoyed to see a Superman film that finally treats the icon dynamically without resorting to drawing lines in the sand between Superman and Clark. While Quentin Tarantino would tell you otherwise – that speech in Kill Bill is 100% erroneous – Superman is unique from other heroes in that he does not have a split identity. Superman is Clark Kent, and Clark Kent is Superman, and if he puts on a front in certain situations to maintain some semblance of peace and order in his life, his own identity is sound, singular, and unified. Man of Steel, as an origin story, deals with duality not as an ongoing truth of the character, but a struggle he must overcome to reach his full potential. Clark initially believes his dual alien/human nature is unsustainable, his two fathers’ beliefs incompatible, but his arc is one of finding constancy in identity, and arriving at a point where he can feel completely comfortable in his own skin, whether that skin is dressed in a suit or in tights. This is not like Batman, where Bruce Wayne changes when he puts on the suit (or, more accurately, changes when he takes it off). Whenever Henry Cavill is on screen, he is playing one character, and one character only, no matter how many names that character may have. Cavill is stupendous in the role, giving a performance so intrinsically rooted in physicality that I fear many will undervalue what great work he does. I love the particular vocal choices Cavill makes, projecting the exact balance of humble benevolence Superman needs to have, but unlike many characters, Superman cannot be defined by the things he says or how he says them. He has to be physical, and we have to understand how his singular physical presence influences his place in the world. This is the basis for Cavill’s work. From the general way he holds himself all the way on down to his slightest facial expressions, Clark’s body feels thoroughly lived-in. Cavill commands the character’s physicality to such a total, startling degree that one quickly stops seeing an actor, and simply sees Superman in his richest, most ideal form. That physical foundation is important, because the film’s remarkable action sequences are predicated in the audience’s belief that, physically at least, Superman and his powers are not of this earth – that to us, he is effectively a God. Snyder has taken this notion and run further with it than I ever could have imagined, staging action on the largest, most ambitious scale possible. When Superman goes into battle with General Zod and his fellow Kryptonians, it is an all-out, no-holds-barred war. These beings are truly, overwhelmingly super-powered, and Snyder leaves absolutely nothing off the table in depicting their strength. No action is too big, no structure is sacred, and no limits are imposed on the destructive fallout of the battles. When Superman punches Zod halfway across Kansas, or one of Zod’s lieutenants smashes Superman with a fire-truck, the sense of scope created is practically limitless. Yet the true brilliance of Snyder’s direction is that no matter how vast or apocalyptic the action becomes, its impact is never once lessened. We feel these blows, each and every one of them, in part because the special effects are nigh flawless – this is what CGI is for, showing us images we cannot possibly witness or emulate in the physical world – and more importantly because Snyder’s direction and choreography is sharp, clear, coherent, and remarkably naturalistic, if such a thing can be said of action on this scale. Snyder retains the grainy, filmic aesthetics of 300 and Watchmen, and here, his style is put to its best use yet, where the texture of the image creates a strong, omnipresent sense of tangibility. There may be an awful lot of digital workmanship on display in Man of Steel, but it does not look like digital filmmaking, a subtle but vastly important distinction. But if Snyder’s fully mature talent for action and visuals is something we could have at least partially anticipated coming in to Man of Steel, the emotional purity of the finished product is not. While Christopher Nolan did have a hand in shaping the film’s narrative structure, and David S. Goyer’s script is a wonderful piece of writing, Snyder is responsible for realizing it all in ways that have such extreme impact. I am particularly taken, for example, with the way he stages Superman and Zod’s final moments together. Without spoiling anything, I shall simply say that it is the most viscerally effective emotional beat of the film, a deeply painful and complex gut-punch disinterested in thrills, excitement, or mayhem; it aims instead to powerfully underline the characters’ respective arcs, and Clark’s journey in particular, and does so entirely through visual execution and choreography. The film is bursting with moments like this, where Snyder fully steps into his own as one of the few directors fully capable of blending spectacle with a profound human element. I always wanted to believe he had this in him – even when I panned Sucker Punch as viciously as I have ever dismissed a film – and I am overjoyed to see Snyder hit this, his biggest opportunity to date, so completely out of the park. Were time immaterial, I could continue for several thousand more words describing everything I adore about Man of Steel. That I have not yet touched upon Amy Adams – whose Lois Lane stands among the most mature, three-dimensional character realizations in any comic-book movie to date – or Michael Shannon – who immediately takes his place in the film villain pantheon with a Zod who is at once deeply terrifying and remarkably sympathetic – is a minor travesty, and there are many more small but wonderfully observed performances – from Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, and others – that deserve attention. Hans Zimmer, too, is one of the central heroes of this film, delivering perhaps his greatest and most emotionally stirring solo work to date. John Williams defined Superman musically as much as any pop icon ever has been, and I think it is absolutely remarkable that I never once thought of Williams’ fanfare when listening to Zimmer’s compositions. It is possible, even, that I prefer the more subtly affecting nuance of Zimmer’s work. In the end, though, all that really needs saying is that which I laid out at the start: That I have never seen anything quite like Man of Steel, and it is probable you never have either. I am immensely curious to see how audiences and other critics will respond to the film, given just how much it rewrites and expands upon the existing language of blockbuster cinema. But in my own estimation, I have no doubt of these three truths: That Man of Steel is far and away the best Superman film to date, easily one of the all-time great comic-book movies, and the single most impressive film to hit screens so far this year.",POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2013"," Following  the uneasy transition into the twenty-first century Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have delivered an exciting and relentlessly entertaining Superman film, one which will have the Man of Steel’s fans rejoicing that, finally, Superman Returns. Throwing the reins to Snyder may have seemed a risky move following the reception of 300 and Watchmen however the director is not to be underestimated and Man of Steel is evidence that his trademark visual impact can be matched with a visceral and emotional power. The early scenes set in Smallville are perfectly balanced between the discovery of a Kal-El’s powers and the emotional development which occurs there. Snyder knows the world in which he is walking and quickly he, and the film gain pace. The Krypton-bound opening sequence sets in place the economy of the storytelling. It is loud, visually staggering and does suffer from a strange pacing issue of being at times both calm and utterly chaotic and yet we are drawn into this other world very quickly. Michael Shannon shines in these early scenes (as he does whenever he is on screen) and his anger and conviction are matched by Russell Crowe’s fatalistic and compassionate Jor-El. The differences between their philosophies become touchstones for Snyder’s Man of Steel and there is a far more nebulous morality to the film at times. Though it is a retelling of the origins of Kal-El there is a welcome economy to the characterisation while the world around them is expanded upon greatly. Those fearing Christopher Nolan’s input as producer would drive Superman into the shadows will be happy to learn that this is a vibrant and exciting vision of the son of Krypton. What it shares with Nolan’s Batman is the unadorned telling of the story; the struggle of the stranger on an alien planet afraid of the world’s fear at his presence, the overwhelming urge to protect at any cost, at its heart this is a film about someone finding their place in the world. At 143 minutes it never feels too long and though there are a number of expositional sequences throughout each are well told with some very interesting visual design influences (Diego Rivera,  Méliès, Syd Mead amongst others) and add to the weight of the story in play. Hans Zimmer’s booming score gives a dramatic weight to the visual chaos and Snyder commands your attention at every turn. There is an odd choice of a faux-documentary jolting to some of the camerawork which is distracting and unnecessary but Snyder knows how to create a beautiful frame and there are a number of them throughout. He’s not above a little playfulness too, not to spoil anything but eager Easter Egg hunters will be rewarded by some background details (even in outer space), and there is a shot straight out of Watchmen here. What this film has, and has in giddy abundance, is unrelenting action. There are mile high fistfights of such force and energy buildings topple and stone walls become paper thin. The conflict between Superman and Zod and his fellow Phantom Zone inhabitants is thrilling and impressive. This epic Kryptonian battle royale is the perfect antidote to those decrying Bryan Singer’s recent iteration, the action set pieces are breath-taking and the Smallville fight sequence is the stuff of dreams for Superman fans. Revealing the truly alien nature of the opposing forces through these unashamedly sensational fights scenes is Snyder’s trump card and works in favour of the narrative and its themes. To choose to stand up and be judged, to embrace the unstable nature of the crowd and learn to trust them, to stop running from your destiny is what Snyder asks of his hero. There is a quiet moment amidst the city-churning fighting which finds Kal-El, now fully aware of the threat and importance he poses to the planet, which takes place in a church. The scene is thankfully brief yet acts as a powerful pivot on which the film rests. It is a curiously understated moment and pitched perfectly. It is one example of how Snyder lays the foundation for the over the top action, it acts as an echo of an earlier scene and points to the film’s final moments. Launched from the ashes of a doomed Krypton, from the alienated and frightened Smallville schoolboy this is the journey of Kal-El, the saviour of the world moving out from a self-imposed shadow to become Superman. The cast is on top form, Henry Cavill embodying the duality of the homespun Kansas boy and an alien stranger coming to terms with his destiny. Amy Adams is a great and gutsy Lois Lane who sadly gets lost the film goes on, becoming someone for Superman to save though thankfully she doesn’t have to disrobe to justify her place on screen. It is Shannon however who steals the show, imbuing the character with the menace and malice. He can’t quite escape the trappings of the superhero villain (he, like many others, enjoys the sound of his own voice a little too much) but he is a fearsome villain and immensely fun to watch. David Goyer uses the common currency of our cultural knowledge of Superman while allowing for the moments which make up the journey to arrive fresh. Kevin Costner has a number of very effective scenes as Jonathan Kent, his quiet admiration and paternal concern are a joy to behold. The Smallville scenes give the film it’s heart while the Metropolis sequences get the blood pumping. Snyder, here too, finds the perfect balance. In essence Man of Steel is a perfect companion piece to Nolan’s Batman Begins. It takes the well-loved, well-worn bones of the beloved source material and creates a new world around them. It is unmistakably a Zack Snyder film with its powerful action set pieces and the right amount of reverence of the character but there’s more at play here. By focusing on Kal-El rather than Superman we have a thrilling and emotionally satisfying blockbuster and perhaps the biggest surprise of the summer so far.",POSITIVE

"Jun 10, 2013"," State-of-the-art special effects are deployed to deliver the double theme of xenophobia manifested through eugenics — reference planet-Krypton baddie General Zod (Michael Shannon), who plans to repopulate his planet with the aid of Superman’s blood — and America’s anti-immigrant bigotry, turned sideways against resident alien Clark Kent.  The movie emphasizes that Superman is not human, much less the red-blooded American he outwardly appears to be (and has been depicted as in previous iterations). Director Zack Snyder’s earnest reboot of the Superman franchise is visually appealing, but ""Man of Steel"" doesn’t shift gears often or quickly enough to validate its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time. There are lulls. Boy, are there lulls. Still, Henry Cavill (“Immortals”) is well cast to convey the stoic charm of our holy-trinity extraterrestrial protagonist — Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman. Cavill’s imposing physicality, square jaw, and piercing blue eyes are perfectly suited for the pantheon of superhero comics’ most iconic figure. Other casting choices don’t go over so well. Russell Crowe flails in his role as Kal-El’s powerful father Jor-El. Here’s a part that Ralph Fiennes or George Clooney could have hit out of the ballpark with panache to spare. Sadly, we get the overbearing Crowe giving line readings that sound like he's got a marble in his mouth. Momentous visitations between Jor-El’s immortal soul and the corporeal Kal-El provide old-fashioned exposition, which informs the young outlier about the choices he must make toward fulfilling his hero’s journey.  Baby Kal-El grows up after being jettisoned on Earth in the wake of the destruction of his home planet, Krypton, by Zod. Kal-El’s adoptive father, Midwest farmer Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner), delivers a stern warning to Clark not to use his super-human powers to save people lest he be outed as some freakish alien. Conformity is the key to survival in America. Naturally, a school bus accident on a bridge prompts the adolescent Clark to defy his patriarchal guardian’s counsel.  Clark Kent has his own sense of ethics to answer to. However, it isn’t until General Zod and his army invades to hold Earth hostage in exchange for Kal-El that Clark makes his transition into the Man of Steel. We are told that the “S” on Superman’s chest is a Krypton symbol for hope, rather than the apparent first letter of his super hero moniker. Superman’s ability to use his eyes as a laser isn’t explained, but it gives the movie a kick in the sweet spot every time he turns on the fiery red beam during ferocious battles with Zod and his troops.

In the opening scenes of Zack Snyder‘s “Man of Steel,” the planet of Krypton announces itself with the director’s customary visual smorgasbord: canyons bathed in stark golden light, frenzied aerial battles for the planet’s future, and a host of CGI creatures and machinery zipping around. It is a garish, worrying sight, saved finally by silence, as a mother laments her son’s future on Earth. “We’ll never see him walk,” Lara Lor-Van (Ayalet Zurer) quietly says to her husband, Jor-El (Russell Crowe, solid throughout his considerable role). The line connects, both actors retrieving the film from gaudy chaos for a moment of humanity; the child departs, leaving his parents to their planet’s fate. Thankfully, down on Earth, we proceed to see him walk, run, and then fly in Snyder’s impressive, bold take on the Superman mythology — one that strains under its helmer’s indulgent action tendencies, but succeeds on heart where brawn will not. After clutching form and content close in “300” and “Watchmen,” what a pleasure it is to see Snyder, along with screenwriter David Goyer and producer Christopher Nolan, refract, delay, and confront Superman’s origins with questions and revisions. Scratch crystal fortresses and time travel from mind; this is “Close Encounters of the Krypton Kind,” as we witness a world’s first reaction to an alien from the alien’s perspective — albeit one in the decidedly charming form of Henry Cavill. The most successful part of Snyder’s vision is two-fold: the laser-focused emphasis on Clark Kent’s journey into Superman, and the impressive ease with which Cavill slides into the lead role. The British actor brings a cagey physicality to Clark/Kal-El, projecting a tired resignation to his powers that helps when their boundaries are seemingly unlimited. We also see a welcome sight — Superman thinking. As Cavill shuts his eyes to the Antarctic sun during his first spin in the suit, he trusts Snyder and how the camera will regard him. He trusts he’ll appear the part. We believe it. The film’s style and tone are less assured: oftentimes, Snyder feels restless, laying the same tempo on flashbacks to Clark’s childhood as the more action-heavy sights (and there are many). Thankfully, he’s sacrificed his usual visual gimmicks, but the overeager embellishments survive: a school bus river rescue prizes cinematography over consequences, while the aerial scenes of Superman flying — convincingly realized and paced — feature digital smash-zooms that grow staler each time they appear. Luckily, Hans Zimmer is one composer able to match the director in terms of bombast, and his wonderfully layered score — alongside DP Amir Mokri‘s bracing (in our 2D version, at least) handheld imagery — creates some true transcendent moments. Snyder’s vision of the Midwest — all billowing clotheslines, IHOPs, and department stores — lands as a bit simple, but his destruction of those elements remains topnotch, as in an exhilarating Smallville collision between Superman, the U.S. Army, and the forces of General Zod (Michael Shannon). Through thick-shouldered armor, a gallery of grotesque battle helmets, and those unblinking death pits he calls eyes, Shannon wrestles out a Zod of mangled patriotism, never kneeling but struggling to restore the race that exiled him. His fierce utilitarian mindset means an engaging, one-note result — most scenes involve furious screaming with brief moments of reflection; however, Zod’s confused purpose strikes at a key, winning question of the film: what faith means in the midst of superheroes. This query flares up promptly, as Pa and Ma Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) shelter their adopted son from their prying Kansas community. Snyder notes Costner’s paternal anxiety: whatever religious beliefs he had before Clark are uprooted by his existence, and the actor delivers his sage wisdom to his son with a fine nervous touch. Meanwhile, his wife suffers by comparison. Diane Lane is mostly sidelined, reduced to narrative cheerleader and emotional bait, and that slackened hold on the film’s female characters continues with Lois Lane (Amy Adams). As much as Lois may evolve in future sequels and DC crossovers, in “Man of Steel” her role is frustratingly nonexistent. She retains her Daily Planet journalist position: obstinate, ego-driven, and with the added influence of blog culture hovering over her editor-in-chief, Perry White (a muted Laurence Fishburne). Adams cuts through any daffy airs of the character, more foolhardy than simply foolish; she readies herself for a personal arc that the script never provides. Goyer writes her relationship with Clark/Superman as a gradual loosening of professional distance, but Snyder shoots it with an oblivious sterility; you wonder if their failed connection is better than Lois’ hopeless crush of yore. Humor continues to elude Snyder’s work: aside from a few choice visual gags — a toner-less office printer flashing red as danger nears — the surroundings and characters remain pensive, coiled up. Especially so in the latter half of the film, set in Metropolis as Zod’s plan for Earth and Superman becomes clear. Squint a little at the overlong noise of spiraling logic, toppled skyscrapers and countless pedestrian deaths, and you’d think the final reel of “The Avengers” had been spliced in. At this point, the central relationship between comic superheroes and cities is inescapable; the future looks grim, though, if adaptations stick to this tired blueprint.

The opening minutes of “Man of Steel” depict a very expensive world. Krypton, the ill-fated planet that even people who actively avoid pop culture recognize as Superman’s birth place, comes alive in the prologue of Zack Snyder‘s snazzy update with some of the finest special effects this side of “Avatar.” A single virtual camera pan across Krypton’s golden vistas reveals an intricately defined fantasy land filled with remarkable details: braying alien livestock, towering structures and airborne spacecraft instantly define a Krypton unlike anything achieved in 80 years of comics, movies, TV and videogames, but the story can’t keep up. Instead of making a blockbuster Superman movie, Snyder has turned the Superman narrative into yet another modern day blockbuster.  Impressive in parts, scattered and blandly familiar in others, “Man of Steel” attempts to rejuvenate its hero with a whole lot of big ideas stuffed into a dense assemblage that alternates between visual wizardry and complicated non-linear plot ingredients, some better than others. However, in contrast to the Richard Donner films that practically invented the guidebook to superhero movies, “Man of Steel” is practically a reinvention of the Superman mythos. The earlier entries in the franchise enlivened the character with genre elements like comedy and romance that — as with Joss Whedon’s delightful “The Avengers” last year — balanced off the demand for extreme spectacle. Even Bryan Singer’s unfairly maligned 2006 take, which bored audiences who obviously wanted a more explosive good time, nobly placed the colorful nature of Superman’s plight ahead of the action.  “Man of Steel” takes a more self-serious approach, constructing a sullen tale involving Superman’s emerging commitment that (perhaps due to producer Christopher Nolan‘s “Batman” influenced hand) almost never cracks a smile. Superman’s inviting persona has even been drained from the title. Here, the dreary atmosphere underscores unremitting commitment to a brooding storyline that creates the illusion of meaning behind the abundant CGI. Unlike its predecessors, it would be impossible to imagine “Man of Steel” without the excessive production values, which start to take hold after the unquestionably compelling first hour and eventually subsume other, more promising ingredients hinted at during that time. At first, “Man of Steel” attempts an outstanding fusion of pricey imagery and narrative finesse. By the end, Henry Cavill’s subdued performance in the lead role is the sole element of restraint left onscreen. While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen, the 143-minute “Man of Steel” is also one of the longest, and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming. David Goyer’s screenplay establishes a high stakes showdown between Superman and the menacing General Zod (Michael Shannon on autopilot, his creepiness downgraded to a half-interested scowl), another surviving Kryptonian whose emergence from prison following the planet’s destruction leads him to try and destroy Earth in the hopes of making room for a new Krypton.  In the early scenes, Zod is revealed to have murdered Superman’s dad, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), in the days leading up to Krypton’s demise. But it’s not clear if Superman ever learns this from the digital remnants of his father who trains him in his arctic headquarters some 33 years later. When Zod shows up, he’s just a bad guy that Superman must stop against impossible odds.  That’s a reasonable conundrum for this type of overly familiar fare, but the movie arrives there after establishing an especially intricate scenario in which the naturally intrepid reporter Lois Lane (a decently assertive Amy Adams) discovers Superman’s secret and decides to sit on the story while he figures out his origin. Superman’s own upbringing down south at the hands of amiable foster parents (a bland Kevin Costner and underutilized Diane Lane) unfolds in several flashbacks that elaborate on the challenges the young Clark Kent faces in keeping his powers to himself. The movie attempts the clever trick of telling both these stories at once with an overlapping structure that would make the creators of “Lost” swoon, but it’s still an excessively dreary affair that lacks any sense of Superman’s personality. Instead, he’s just another fancy effect from Snyder’s bag of tricks. It’s easy to get swept up in the rollercoaster of buildup, but the climax is just a yawn. But, oh, that bag of tricks. “I can’t print this,” Louis’ trenchant editor (Laurence Fishburne) says after receiving her first draft of her unpublished Superman scoop. “You could have hallucinated half of it.” When “Man of Steel” comes to a close, viewers can relate. And once they come back down to Earth, perhaps warmer memories of the Supermen no longer considered viable will come rushing back. In “Man of Steel,” Superman never suffers from exposure to fragments of Kryptonite. His single weakness — and the movie’s, after promising earlier bits drop off to make room for the extravagant conclusion — is depth.

"Jun 10, 2013",The most exhilarating and arresting interpretation of Superman yet.,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2013"," So, Man of Steel is definitely the biggest movie of the year. Love it or hate it, that’s a statement of fact – as especially huge as the Richard Donner and Richard Lester versions were in their day, this one is every bit as exponentially bigger as movies in the modern age tend to be. It also doesn’t have their patience for exposition or restraint: back then, you believed a man could fly. When you see this, you’ll believe anything can happen on any scale – if the movie were a vehicle, it’d be a steamroller with jet engines and a couple of bazookas mounted on the front for good measure.  By the end, you will feel like you got hit and run over by a motion picture. Possibly in a good way. I’d even go so far as to suggest a new MPAA rating of “CG-14,” not for the rampant computer graphics but for the fact that anyone over 40 will not have the necessary attention span, and may require the guidance of a child to explain just what it was they saw. Here’s an example of just how crazy this movie gets. We all know the general origin story of Superman, right? Jor-El, upset that nobody believes his doomsday prophecies, shoots baby Kal-El into space in a rocket. Pretty simple. Unless you’re Zack Snyder, director of this version. In Snyder’s telling, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is reiterating his doomsday prophecies to the Kryptonian council when they are all attacked by General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his military, who are staging a coup. Jor-El escapes by leaping on the back of some dragon creature, flying through a sky filled with spaceships blasting each other out of said sky, making his way to a giant tower, doing a high dive off of it into an underwater chamber that looks like the Matrix (babies in pods), securing a skull covered in runes and getting that back to his home, where the skull is disintegrated to power his ship for baby Kal. But wait! Zod attacks again, and then Kryptonian council forces counter-attack, and Jor-El finally launches the rocket, which, again, has to dodge the laser-blasts of a huge space battle. Zod and crew are captured and sent to the Phantom Zone in what look like giant dildos, and then the entire fucking planet explodes. That’s just the damn prologue. Things don’t slow down from there. Yeah, I know you saw that trailer that looked like Terrence Malick, or the one that’s all father and son bonding. Guess what – those moments are the ONLY such moments in the 2+ hours of running time. Snyder has no time for character development – when he tries, there’s always something else massive happening in the background. Clark Kent has a key emotional beat with his dad…during a massive tornado! Superman meets Lois for the first time…on a giant spaceship busting out of the ice, while saving her from a robotic death machine! That kind of deal. The casting is shorthand for character arcs – you know Perry White has gravitas because he’s Laurence Fishburne. You know Lois Lane is spunky because she’s Amy Adams. You know Jonathan Kent is a great all-American dad because he’s Kevin Costner – though I don’t really know why he’d rather let people die than have Clark reveal any super powers; yes, it serves a plot point, but this isn’t like any Pa Kent I’ve ever seen, and I’d like a little more explanation. Less famous faces convey a lot just in their look – Richard Schiff is clearly a smart sciencey type, Harry Lennix is thoughtful-yet-assertive dude, while Antje Traue is beautiful and beats people up. Surprisingly, the only character who really gets a true dramatic arc is Jor-El, who, like the Brando version, manages to appear constantly throughout the film even though, well, his fate is pretty much the same as in every version of this story. The religious imagery is overt – at one point, noncorporeal Jor-El tells his son he can save humanity, at which point Supes falls to Earth in a crucifixion pose (a huge deal is made of the fact that his age is 33 – like Jesus when he died – hey, I’m just happy to see a movie this big that’s not afraid to let the hero be older than his twenties). Meanwhile, the evil Kryptonians blather on about evolution, so make of that what you will. Shannon’s Zod is a different beast than Terence Stamp’s aficionado of kneeling, more straight-ahead military man than smooth-talker, abandoning false pleasantries the instant they appear not to be working. And while we’re on that subject, a big THANK YOU to Snyder and writer David Goyer for not shoehorning in gratuitous throwbacks. A lesser movie would feel the need to give Zod a toss-off quip about kneeling or planet Houston; references to other movies can all-too frequently kill the one you’re watching – whether they’re the funniest thing in the movie despite not making any sense (Skyfall) or so predictable they destroy all momentum (Star Trek Into Darkness). While you won’t be surprised that Hans Zimmer’s score, laden as it is with signature BRAHHHHMs, isn’t as great as the John Williams theme, it’s a necessary change – the Williams theme belongs to Christopher Reeve’s incarnation of Supes, and always will. Is it over the top? I would rarely say this about a big action movie, but I could have stood for just a few more slow moments that show personality not related to action, i.e. the kinds of scenes Robert Downey Jr. could do in his sleep. I am getting close to forty, though, which could explain a lot. I don’t recommend the 3D, even though I usually like the effect – Snyder clearly didn’t shoot with the post-conversion in mind, and the handheld stuff and quick pans do it no favors. At least at my screening, there was no tease or post-credits scene that would indicate a larger DC Universe – the best hope fans can hang their hat on is talk of Kryptonians having colonized many planets, all of which are presumed dead. But after a large-scale alien invasion, sequels can’t really be considered “real world” any more. And by the way, considering that invasion, viewers should ask themselves: are we far enough away from 9-11 that falling skyscrapers – followed by people running from giant dust clouds and getting trapped under rubble – can be entertainment? Statue of limitations has probably expired and all, but I’m still unable to view something like that as pure escapism. Snyder does not stylize as much as usual, but he sneaks in a narrative trick that allows him to use his favorite effect – the Kryptonians have a gravity weapon that makes stuff levitate, hold in mid air for a moment, then come crashing down.  How faithful is the whole thing to the Superman we know and love? There is one key out-of-character moment that I cannot spoil and which will be divisive, but on the whole this is finally the modern-age (post-Crisis, that is; I don’t pretend to get the New 52) Superman onscreen as opposed to the Silver Age edition most often mined by the movies. There is one big throwback to the early Siegel/Shuster days – his “flying” is portrayed more like the classic “leap tall buildings in a single bound.” Like a virtual Keanu Reeves, he pushes himself off the ground in a shockwave, then flies faster than sound in a straight line. As for the costume allegedly emphasizing the crotch – can’t say I noticed that. It is a Kryptonian undergarment, with the baddies adding armor on top of that, so perhaps he needs a little extra protective padding in the Super-jewels. Surprisingly, the retold origin is not at all tedious – it’s too aggressively action-packed for that – but I’m still more interested to see where Superman goes from here. By movie’s end he’s still on a par with Batman as far as independence from authority goes; watching him turn into that establishment symbol so viciously mocked by Frank Miller in the mid-’80s will be a journey that shows us more of the man. As is, this is a film that focuses mostly on the “Super” part of the equation and by God, it will break down your resistance one way or the other.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2013"," I believe a man can fly -- and beat the living hell out of Michael Shannon for close to 40 compounded minutes in ways hitherto unseen on film. But Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' is no mere slugfest. It goes for broke, faces the legend and tackles the iconography of one of modernity's largest-shared myths, Kal-El of Krypton, on its own terms. It is among the finest ""franchise reboots"" of all time, which may sound like a bit of a backhanded compliment until you realize that this is, in fact, a genre unto itself. It manages, somehow, to be ""the same but different,"" a new film that everyone under the yellow sun knows from beginning to end. It is the film of summer 2013. Among 'Man of Steel''s bigger triumphs is its full-on embrace of Superman as science-fiction. While the Big Blue Boy Scout is as instantly recognizable as Abraham Lincoln, Uncle Sam or Ronald McDonald, it's easy to forget that Superman was merely raised here. His roots are from deep in the stars, and the opening scenes of 'Man of Steel' dive headfirst into whacked-out technology, crazy-looking beasts and nerdy-sounding things, like the ""Genesis chambers,"" ""world drives"" and ""phantom zones."" Norms need not freak, however; for every silver, swirling, tactile 3D projection of pure thought, there's a close-up of No. 2 pencils, farm equipment, American flags and bottles of Bud. What 'Man of Steel' does phenomenally well is balance the heavy, hearty geek lore with a straight-up, fish-out-of-water story about a boy with powers he doesn't understand and the caring Midwestern parents that raise him. David Goyer's script wisely shows us Kal-El's childhood as Clark Kent through precise flashbacks. He's at a point in his life now where his desire to ""make this world better than his own"" necessitates exposing his powers, which, as I'm sure you know, is derived from exposure to the radiation of a young star. Lucky for him that he's taught himself to fly, donned a snazzy suit and communed with the downloaded consciousness of his father just in time for him to confront the other survivors of his doomed planet, led by the fearsome General Zod. In Krypton we see our possible, brutal future. While technologically advanced, it abandoned its space exploration, ruined its own environment and devised a 'Brave New World'-like system of predetermined social stratification. As such, Zod was bred to defend his people -- and Kal-El is the first natural birth in centuries. It's still the same white hat/black hat dynamic, as is the nascent romance between Kal-El and Lois Lane. She's still a determined reporter, but hardly a damsel waiting to get rescued. She's able to defend herself and ends up being something of a go-between for Kal-El and the American military. Yeah, sure, she gets saved from falling to her death on more than one occasion, but it is hardly like it was before. ""Lane as intermediary"" is needed because this is a post-9/11 Superman. It's made plain that our culture is one far more driven by fear than when Richard Donner made his bigscreen version in 1978. While my heart will always belong to Christopher Reeve, Henry Cavill more than passes muster. Like Chris Pine, he gets the essence of the character and, as in J.J. Abrams' 2009 'Star Trek,' there's a slight wink toward the end to the version of the character we know and love. On the whole, though, this is a wink-free movie. Early buzz that 'Man of Steel' would be discernibly similar to Nolan's Batman films are false. Even with Hans Zimmer scoring, the propulsive nature of Nolan's films is absent. It's less edgy and more contemplative, that is, until the fighting starts. The last act of 'Man of Steel' is out of control. Beginning with an image straight from ""All-Star Superman"" and not letting up until Metropolis is a wasteland of twisted metal, Snyder's extremely well-choreographed and clean fight scenes rival the Battle of New York from 'The Avengers.' With wonderful inserts resembling comic panels, Snyder jumps from a video game aesthetic to classic 'High Noon' Western tropes and back again in quick succession. The final, primal push to save humanity features tightening muscles, contorted faces and an upwardly thrusting spasm of white, shooting energy. While I'm thrilled I got to see 'Man of Steel' at an early critics' screening, I can't wait to see this in a packed house full of nerds. 'Man of Steel' isn't perfect. There's an emotional beat that is supposed to have resonance, but you'll probably be thinking, ""who's she?"" (The answer, undoubtedly, is ""someone whose earlier scenes got cut out."") There's also a dopey decision that a character makes, a beat that only an actor of Kevin Costner's quality can save. Also, the world-building in 'Man of Steel' is so good that the movie lends itself to some hardcore nitpicking of a ""how did they know English?"" variety. But when your scrutiny has to go that deep, you know you have a solid blockbuster on your hands. I love Superman, and I love ridiculous sci-fi. Snyder's movie scratched all my fanboy itches. I think, though, that the emotion will ring true for fair-weather fans, too. If comic book heroes are our modern Greek gods, 'Man of Steel' is solid enough to stand proudly atop Mount Olympus.

"Jun 10, 2013"," The Superman of the post-Christopher Nolan era has arrived on planet Earth, in fiction and in reality. In fiction, no one expects him, but in reality, he's about what moviegoers would expect. He's still an unfailingly polite and upstanding young man, a moral exemplar, and an alien being like unto a god. But following the massive success of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel comes obliged to be more philosophical than fun.Not that there's anything wrong with that, necessarily. But the self-seriousness with which Man of Steel reboots the comic-book mythology sometimes unintentionally brushes the comical. Nolan is here as a producer; he shares story credit with David S.Goyer, who worked on Nolan's Batman films; and composer Hans Zimmer brings the bwaaammmp, but the directing duties go to Watchmen's Zack Snyder, a fellow who feels more comfortable in the realm of comic-book fantasy. Right out of the gate, Man of Steel establishes a wild world of science fantasy by retelling Superman's origins: his birth and Moses-esque journey from his home (the doomed planet Krypton) to a new land where baby Kal-El will grow up to become a super-powered leader of men. Alex McDowell's production design of  Krypton skews toward the silly side of ""fantastic art."" (Really? This highly advanced race flies around on giant dragonflies? Okay.) And it is a bit jarring pitting Russell Crowe's pseudo-British scientist Jor-El against Michael Shannon's Chicago-inflected General Zod. But we are talking about a movie concerning a flying Jesus in tights, so silly is sorta relative.Snyder includes a couple of ""oh, brother"" moments that belabor that messianic subtext. Kal-El's dad Jor-El lays down some fairly blunt lines like ""He'll be a god to them"" and ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards...In time, you will help them accomplish wonders,"" but Snyder piles on a couple of shots that are the visual equivalent of an elbow in the ribs: during a scene in which Superman (Henry Cavill) consults a priest, Snyder frames a giant-sized stained-glass image of Jesus behind Superman's head, and in a later scene, Jor-El gets his Obi-Wan on, intoning, ""You can save her, Kal. You can save all of them,"" to which our hero responds by instantly floating into a Christ-figure pose (arms akimbo will have to wait).But all that is really window dressing to what the film is actually about. On a basically literal level, Man of Steel is about ""the element of choice."" It's a story of Kal-El choosing to be Superman, and what that means to him and to his adopted planet. As such, it's also a ""first contact"" story that deals with the ramifications of a superpowered, and therefore inherently threatening, alien presence. Trust must be earned between Superman and humanity, a process not made any easier by the arrival of Kryptonian war hawk General Zod and his trusted soldier Faora (Antje Traue). I won't spoil their evil plans, but they involve world domination, wouldn't ya just know it?On a thematic level, Man of Steel digs into Kal-El's self-actualization by checking off issues of destiny (Pa Kent: ""I have to believe you were sent here for a reason""), genetic engineering (another form of predestination), social engineering (nurture), and the aforementioned ""element of choice"" (positioned here as a realization of true nature, understood in reflection and embraced in action). As per tradition, Superman struggles with how much of his identity is Clark Kent—raised by Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and his wife Martha (Diane Lane)—and how much is Kal-El. Sure the world is not yet ready, protective Jonathan insistently keeps Kal-El under wraps, but General Zod's surprise arrival forces the point. The ""ghost"" of Jor-El, for his part, speaks up for Kal as Zod's enemy (and, therefore, humanity's savior).But after the last Superman movie—Bryan Singer's not-bad but noticeably inert Superman Returns—there'd be hell to pay if this one didn't have a ton of action, which it does. The Krypton section quadruples down on gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, explosions, and all manner of CGI detail. Superman-in-hiding discovers and tries out his powers in a number of scenes, and Superman emergent opens up the flick's action floodgates when Zod unleashes hell on earth. The action doesn't become particularly rousing, though, until Supes and Zod start clobbering each other in Metropolis (this sequence and the product placement valued in the tens of millions recall Richard Donner's Superman II).There's something perverse about taking the sunniest of superheroes and dulling his primary colors, not to mention controlling the spitfire of Lois Lane (Amy Adams). All that restraint is certainly trendy, but doesn't engage the imagination of kids of all ages like Donner's 1980s Superman two-fer did. The actors are fine but never overcome the speechifying enough to generate excitement on their own steam (Cavill's more credible in the role than Brandon Routh, though both took cues from forebear Christopher Reeve), and Goyer and Snyder allow some of the action beats to be murky in their particulars. On the other hand, Snyder does achieve some elegant visual poetry around his hero that shows a kind of evolution of Donner's making us believe a man can fly.Lastly, because this is 2013 (and the terrorists have apparently won), no blockbuster movie would be complete without consciously evoking 9/11. The extended climax enacts something like what Trey Parker and Matt Stone jokingly referred to in Team America: World Police as ""9/11 times a hundred."" Superhero stories basically require mass urban destruction, of course, and here it's used as the trump card for this fable of human goodness and potential in the face of life-threatening adversity. And so we get 9/11-loaded examples of human heroism to prove that Superman sets a standard others follow: cops, soldiers, a scientist (the always-welcome Richard Schiff), Lois Lane and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) all brave death on behalf of others. As Superman explains of his family crest, ""It's not an S. On my world it means hope.""On balance, this new cinematic take on a 75-year-old icon constitutes a worthy Superman movie and a modest improvement for a franchise that had creatively stalled. But just because grey and grit worked for Batman and James Bond doesn't mean they suit Supes: hopefully future installments will loosen up, brighten up, and lighten up (and light a fire under Lois Lane) to achieve more exhilarating ends.",POSITIVE
