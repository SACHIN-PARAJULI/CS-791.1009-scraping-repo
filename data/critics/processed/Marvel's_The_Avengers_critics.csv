"Sep 24, 2023"," Even though I saw this movie three days after it opened, I felt like it might as well have been three weeks after its release. Last summer, there were four superhero movies and I saw every one of them on their opening day, first show of the day. Unfortunately, this just wasn’t possible with The Avengers, but considering that it made over $200 million in three days, I don’t think Marvel really noticed my missing $10. Also, with all the money it made, I don’t really feel like I need to go over the WHOLE plot for you guys because it feels like everyone has already seen it. Instead, just like I did with Iron Man 2, it’s going to be much easier to just go over how well I think each character/actor did in this movie, and that’ll also be a lot more fun for me. Before I do, I suppose I can just briefly say that Loki, as made famous in Thor, also made famous by just being Thor’s brother, uses the “Tesseract”, which all comic book fans should recognize as the Cosmic Cube, to teleport an intergalactic army to destroy the world. In retaliation, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow are called together to fight the impending galactic war. Brief enough? Now I get to talk about everybody! Maybe it’s RDJ’s public personality that gets me kind of annoyed with him and the fact that he is kind of full of himself, but considering his financial and critical success has warranted him being a tad “bragadocious”. I was also nervous that the whole movie would focus on him, considering he’s already got two Iron Man movies under his belt and I always associate Captain America as the leading Avenger. Even though I had these reservations, I was glad to see that Tony Stark didn’t have much more screen time than anyone else, and considering he didn’t have to burden the weight of the whole film on his shoulders, he was able to be a more comical Tony Stark than we’d already seen. Lots of one-liners, jabs at other characters, and an overall tendency to downplay the seriousness of a situation. Steve Rogers even called him out on the fact that he was self-centered and narcissistic, which made me nervous that there’d be a scene where Steve Rogers would have to say some “You really are a hero!” bullshit, but we were spared. Even though Iron Man was a key part of defeating the aliens, nobody made a big deal out of it, which really fits in with the Tony Stark I know. That despite no matter how many successes he might have, he’s still kind of an egotistical prick and nobody wants to pay him ANY compliments. I love Captain America. Call me old-fashioned for loving America, and I’ll call you a goddamned Communist. What I love about his character is that he ALWAYS knows what is right, and does everything in his power to stand up for it. Whether it was in the Civil War storyline where he had to allow himself to be arrested or sacrificing himself at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, he knows what to do and doesn’t hesitate. One scene in particular near the end of the film, despite not being the most powerful member of the team, he told everyone exactly what to do and exactly when to do it, and everyone fell into rank. They knew that this guy had fought evil incarnate in World War II and trust him with everything. Whether he was breaking up a fight between Thor and Iron Man or jumping across the helicarrier to literally SMACK a grenade out of the air to protect Stark, Cap really proved that he’s more than just a science experiment. I also stand by my opinion that Chris Evans is handsome enough and funny enough to put him into any superhero outfit and do a great job. Remember how I mentioned that the Thor movie really only served as a stepping stone to build up to The Avengers? Boy howdy, was I right. Even though Thor wasn’t the best superhero movie last summer, it introduced you to a regal character who lives in a world completely removed from and much more vast than anything us humans on Earth could even wrap our heads around. He proves himself not only wise in the way he tries to handle Loki and his desire to merely take him back to Asgard, but also showed how powerful and essentially God-like when he knocks Hulk on his ass with one punch or summons lightning to vaporize and shit ton of aliens. I’d say that in films, just like in the comics, Thor works much better as a supporting cast member than as a the major player. He could basically solve everything problem with a giant hammer and some lightning. You might have found Loki to be a quivering, whining prick in Thor, so imagine how big of a douchebag he got after floating around the universe with nothing but the thought of vengeance in mind? They were able to play up the “God of Mischief” aspect much more in this movie as we saw how easy it was for him to manipulate humans, rather than in Thor and he was just playing tricks on his brother. We were able to see how cowardly he was and knew he wasn’t nearly as powerful as any one of the Avengers and had to call on someone else’s army to fight for him. He strategically manipulated every character to feed off of one another’s insecurities, and even though he wasn’t physically some sort of powerhouse, you could see how annoying he could be to deal with. Hiddleston was also showing some vulnerability as an adopted son who never received the love of his father, and even though you knew he was the villain, had a tiny bit of sympathy for his situation. This was the part of the movie I was most worried about, considering that after two movies based on Hulk, there’s yet to be a successful incarnation of him on film. The thing about this character that people want to see most is actually what’s easiest to put on the big screen, which is a big green monster destroying everything. The more interesting parts of the character are figuring out how he deals with this timebomb that’s inside of him and the effect it had on his psychological state. Luckily, through the nature of this being an ensemble film, Dr. Banner was only used in small doses, mostly to show off his level of intelligence. There were a few scenes between Dr. Banner and Tony Stark that were really fun to watch, because they both felt like they had found an intellectual peer and playmate. When Dr. Banner left and Hulk showed up, obviously it was fucking awesome. HE SMASHED EVERYTHING. I went get into everything he smashed, but the smashing scenes were fun. I also kept doing double-takes when a character said “Banner” because I thought our dog might be in the theater. I made a pretty bold claim with Iron Man 2 which was that Scarlett Johansson was a good choice to play Black Widow AND that she was one of the best parts of that movie, but most people thought I was just distracted by her tits. I suppose there might be a little truth to that, but just because she was good in this role doesn’t mean I think she’s a good actress. In fact, I think she’s not a good actress and every other movie I’ve seen her in she just seems distant and emotionally apathetic to everything going on around her. Luckily, while portraying a Russian assassin and spy, having an outward appearance of not giving a shit about anything or being emotionally involved in anything going on, things work out pretty well. Granted, in this movie, she had a few moments that seemed a little too superhuman and far-fetched in regards to her abilities, but it was really only one sequence so I can forgive her. Mostly because of, well, you know, boobs. Having only really appeared as a silhouette in Thor and having no other film appearances, Hawkeye was obviously going to be a tough sell as an Avenger. Rather than try to give him a long backstory, we instead spend most of the film seeing Barton as a villain who is having his mind controlled by Loki. One reason I really liked them doing this was that it removed the need for a backstory because all you saw was Hawkeye being a badass with a bow and arrow and showing of a multitude of different trick arrows. Another reason I liked this was because in the Marvel Universe, Hawkeye was introduced as a villain. He might have only been a villain for three issues before joining the Avengers, but still, it’s something that’s constantly referenced in the books and I think that using him as a villain for the first half of the movie not only showed you his abilities, but also made you enjoy the heroic things he was doing that much more. Two things I didn’t like, however, was the fact that the mind control he was under was undone by Black Widow just punching him a whole bunch, and I figured Loki’s spells would be a little more powerful. I also think that Hawkeye should have been played by Alan Alda, but I guess Jeremy Renner was an acceptable substitute. Although I thought his cameo in Iron Man was pretty cool, the other times this incarnation of Nick Fury haven’t been as faithful to the character as I had liked. Granted, that basically means I didn’t really care for his scenes in Iron Man 2, but Samuel L. Jackson is a character on his own. He has a reputation of coming across like a badass, but also being really funny, talented, and can deliver these badass lines or insults while adding a smirk to the end of them to let you know he’s just fucking with you. The Nick Fury I wanted to see wasn’t a jokester or anything other than a grizzled war veteran who has gone to Hell and back to ensure the safety of the country he so loves to defend. It’s almost like he has the heart of Captain America but with the skills of Black Widow. Well, maybe not the bazongas of Black Widow, but the covert spy stuff. Lucky for me, they toned down Fury’s interactions with the team so you knew he was the one in charge and wasn’t taking shit from anybody. There was also a scene that involved him motivating the team by showing them something taken out of a dead agent’s coat, but once the team leaves, another character pointed out that they weren’t actually in his coat, but in the agent’s locker. This showed that Fury was willing to do anything and everything to get the reaction from people that he knew had to be sparked in them, even if that meant lying to them. His role in this film definitely made up for the doubts I had going into it. Someone who was introduced a few years ago to plant the seed of what S.H.I.E.L.D was and where all these Marvel movies were going, Agent Coulson has become a loved character to many fans. Even though he is typically only in Marvel movies delivering half a dozen lines, those lines are well-timed with great delivery by Gregg, even giving Robert Downey Jr. a run for his money in a few scenes. We got that sense from Coulson again in Avengers, and adding in the obsession that a S.H.I.E.L.D agent would clearly have for Captain America, the fanboy moments between Coulson and Steve Rogers were really charming and endearing. And congratulations to Mr. Gregg for having the character take a permanent seat in the Marvel Universe in not just films, but being introduced into the comics as well! If there’s one show I hate hearing people tell me is funny, it’s The Big Bang Theory. If there’s two shows that I hate hearing people tell me is funny, it’s The Big Bang Theory and How I Met You Mother. Knowing that Smulders was on that show, I figured the only reason she landed the role was to get audiences of that show interested. Lucky for me, I was wrong. DEAD WRONG! Well, not dead wrong, but I wanted to say that. Maria Hill is a tough character because she is essentially Nick Fury’s right-hand man, but considering she is younger and a female, the relationship could easily fall into a stereotype. This is typically avoided, and I always viewed the Nick Fury/Maria Hill relationship to be a lot like the Yoda/Luke Skywalker relationship in The Empire Strikes Back. We know that the apprentice can clearly handle their shit, but they still also have a lot to learn. We saw Maria Hill questioning Fury on his actions, even doubting his choices, but knew her rank and never opposed his views, clearly knowing that he was the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a reason. She handled what she needed to handle and stepped up when necessary, letting the audience know that she’s be okay in the event that Fury was ever compromised and she would have to take the reins. In  short, EVERYONE DID A GOOD JOB IN VARYING DEGREES. Wow, I could have just said that instead of typing up all those other things. I knew this movie was going to be good. Everyone knew this movie was going to be good. In fact, I’d even say this movie was a GREAT superhero movie. As far as things I didn’t like, I’d say there were only two issues, maybe only one and a half…AND THEY’RE ONLY ISSUES! Let me clarify: I had ZERO problems with this movie. One issue was that I was disappointed that nobody ever shouted “AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!”, but considering this was their very first gathering, I could understand that not showing up naturally. I guess I hoped that in the epilogue, after all of the action, Fury would have mentioned assembling in some way. I know that any lines of dialogue I could come up with right now would be cheesy, but Joss Whedon is a much better writer than I am and I guess I hoped he had found a natural way to slip that in. The other issue was that even though this was a great superhero movie, it was just that…a great SUPERHERO movie. This movie won’t win any Oscars, any acting or directing awards, or be recognized with any other outstanding achievements. This movie is by no means a bad movie, not by a long shot. It was a witty, smart, action-packed, fist-pumping, stand up in your seat and high-five your friends FUN movie. After seeing the trailer for Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises, it was hard to thing of The Avengers as being any sort of game-changer in the superhero genre. I’m also not saying that this movie needed to change the way we view superhero movies, it just felt very safe. Safe isn’t bad, safe is good! That’s why people where helmets and seatbelts! For some reason, which I can’t quite put my finger on, I kept having flashbacks to when I first saw Independence Day. Maybe it was because it was just a big, fun summer movie, or the fact that there were alien invaders, or the fact that you knew the good guys would win, I had the same excited feelings for The Avengers as I had almost twenty years ago with Will Smith. Whether you’re a comic book fan or not, you will have fun with this movie, and even though we spent close to two and a half hours watching this movie, this only felt like the beginning. I was totally willing to watch these characters interacting with another for two and a half more hours, just to see what kind of trouble they’d get into. Oh yeah, and I think I predicted a few years ago how closely this movie would mirror the events of The Ultimates comic book series, and I am glad to know I was right. What the fuck are these Chitauri aliens? JUST CALL THEM GODDAMNED SKRULLS AND BE DONE WITH IT! I think you were right in saying that the movie was good, but it was still a superhero movie, I had the same trailers before it and truly, in comparison, The Avengers is exactly what it is and nothing more, a superhero movie, a very safe one at that. I’m not one for reading comics but, is it really possible to create a superhero movie that would shake things up that much? I also managed to snag a copy of that poster you used above. It won’t get the prime wall spot, but I can still say I watched The Avengers assemble for 5 years. I was just trying to give people what they want! I think everyone knew going into this that plot wasn’t going to be what people were going for. They were just excited to take those few moments they’ve seen in previous movies where Tony Stark talks to Thunderbolt Ross or Agent Coulson finds Thor’s hammer and stretch that into lots of fun interactions.  As far as “shaking things up”, I’d definitely say that The Dark Knight totally shook the status quo of what could be accomplished through the use of characters created in comic books. Although The Avengers is a great superhero movie, I think The Dark Knight is just a great MOVIE, regardless of genre or source material. I was sitting in a diner while those posters went onsale and had to use my mobile to try and get a copy…and failed! You jerk! The only Marvel poster I have that Mondo released were the Olly Moss Captain America set and the Tyler Stout Captain America, which I only got because I won a lottery he held. I’m jealous! Yah, I usually work all day so it is rare I get one. I literally missed the earlier Marvel posters by 5 minutes. I managed to get a Cabin in the Woods one as well. It’s funny, I almost told you my tips for trying to snag these prints, then realized that if you buy one, I can’t! The Cabin in the Woods came out at the same time as The Exorcist one did, and I got Exorcist in my cart, but when I got greedy trying for Cabin in the Woods, they both sold out. MY LIFE SUCKS!",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2023"," Unlike The X-Men, which arrived full formed in 2000, The Avengers is the comic book version of the supergroup, with stars in their own right coming together (not without some friction and ego-thumping) for a battle royale. So Marvel put together a long term plan, launching their stars in a series of solo films and building an entire universe of heroes and villains for the screen. They teased audiences with brief cross-overs and then, after years of setting it all up, brought together the team: Robert Downey’s cheeky, cocky Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth’s warrior prince Thor, Chris Evans’ earnest Captain America, and Mark Ruffalo taking over as Bruce Banner and The Hulk (the third actor in as many films), giving the character a haunted, embittered edge. To round out the team, the film expands the role of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a slinky superagent, from the second Iron Man film, and adds Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an archer marksman briefly seen in Thor.  Samuel Jackson presides over it all as Nick Fury. It could have been a disaster, with so many characters to juggle and personalities to respect while engaging in a big, noisy, apocalyptic battle with no less than gods and aliens. And it was a measured gamble to bring in Joss Whedon, a man with well-earned fan credentials and an affinity for this kind of genre storytelling, to write and direct. No question that he brings smarts and style and self-aware wit to his productions (Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV, Serenity on the big screen) but his audiences have been, shall we say, small and passionate. It was the perfect marriage of subject and sensibility. You wouldn’t accuse The Avengers of being good drama, but the sprawling, splashy spectacle and its much-much-much-larger-than-life heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen. Whedon loves his characters and enjoys tossing them together to watch the sparks of colliding egos fly. And he has a knack for keeping an eye on the stories and the characters in the mess of battle. But mostly, he embraces the elevated melodrama of the conceit—these superpowered beings are our answer to the Greek gods and heroes, and they were nothing if not unpredictable, mercurial, and vindictive—and then works his way back to the humanity under the costume. And it doesn’t hurt letting Downey off the leash to rile up the gathered egos. You get the sense that, sure, Whedon is having a blast visualizing the scope of a comic book battle with the millions of dollars of CGI at his command, but he’s having even more fun setting these lone wolves loose to sniff around and bark at each other before warily settling into a pack.

"Nov 20, 2022"," Developed in 1963 as Marvel’s answer to DC’s superhero team Justice League (featuring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, et al.), The Avengers supplies a comic tradition where numerous superheroes join forces against a common or superior enemy, but not without facing off against each other first. Naturally, superheroes have bold personalities; they’re champions of their particular realm—why shouldn’t they swell with pride about it? But when assembled, such personalities clash and infighting occurs, and our favorite heroes must inevitably learn to work as a team before they can tackle the colossal threat that brought them together. Another comic tradition is the “crossover,” where an overarching storyline unfurls in the pages of multiple issues and usually ends in a double-sized, chromium-covered, mega-book to conclude the storyline. The Avengers is the equivalent of this, but not without planting the seeds for future sequels and spin-offs. Marvel Studios started something wholly unprecedented in 2008 by laying the groundwork for this film in Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. Each individual entry contains tidbits pointing toward this larger film, and by maintaining a hands-on approach to their productions, they ensure each entry is strong enough as a stand-alone feature, but also a key component in a larger whole. As a result, there comes an expectation that The Avengers, being a culmination of several successful blockbusters, should be nothing short of epic. It should appeal to both fanboys and those unfamiliar with comics. Broadening the storylines established by the preceding films, it should give each character their due and yet not allow a single star to shine too brightly. It should be bigger, louder, smarter, more expensive, and ultimately more entertaining than the other films. So, does it succeed? Hell yes. With these requirements in mind, Marvel hired writer-director Joss Whedon to helm The Avengers. He’s a former comic author in the pages of X-Men; he’s garnered a cult following for his TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer; he directed one modestly successful film with Serenity, an offshoot of his show Firefly; and he’s also a resounding comic nerd and generally adored among fanboys. As such, he appreciates the material enough to know what comic fans expect from a film like this, because it’s what he would expect. More importantly, he understands how to make the material universal, adapting it in such a way that general audiences will be able to identify with the central characters without the need to know their off-screen backstory. What’s more, working with a reported budget of $220 million, Whedon has resolved to put every dollar toward wowing his audience with the most satisfying event movie to come out of Hollywood in recent memory. Working from an initial draft by Zak Penn (X-Men: The Last Stand), Whedon’s script picks up where 2011’s Thor and Captain America left off. Banished Asgardian mischief-maker Loki (Tom Hiddleston) forms an alliance with an alien race called the Chitauri (lizard things with biomechanical armor), promising them the Tesseract, an energy cube of unlimited power, if they lay waste to Earth so he may rule. Loki steals the MacGuffin from its current holders, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and his super-spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and hides it while the Chitauri plan their attack. At the same time, Fury relocates to his new HQ—a massive, cloaked flying aircraft carrier, a spectacular effect—and plans for the worst. To find the Tesseract and stop Loki, his agency brings together a proposed team of heroes, The Avengers. When the personalities gather, the film’s first half explores their squabbling and clash of egos, until finally, they band together for an exhausting second half in the battle against Loki and his alien army. Whedon’s storytelling is at its best as he balances screen time amid Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, portrayed by some very fine actors. Top-billed and center stage, Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark dons his Iron Man armor, carting his genius behind his snarky motormouth and signature narcissism. Another classic egocentric, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), travels from Asgard to confront his adopted brother Loki, spouting Shakespearian brogue along the way. Mark Ruffalo, who replaces Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, brings a soft-spoken nerviness and impressive nuance to his character. His alter-ego, The Hulk, was performed through motion capture and looks like Ruffalo; the effect is entirely convincing and occasionally brilliant. Displaced in an era not his own, Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans) brings a naïve but necessary idealism to the team to help unite them. Reprising her Iron Man 2 role, Scarlett Johansson represents the sole female member of the group as the former assassin Black Widow, but Whedon has gone to great lengths to make her stand out arguably more than any other. The newest member, seen briefly in Thor, is a bow-and-arrow sharpshooter named Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who seems somewhat underdeveloped next to the others. Save for the resident Captain, each character could be described as “Does not play well with others.” Obvious attention is placed on Marvel’s most successful hero and franchise fan-favorite Iron Man, but this is hardly a solo effort. Granted, the film’s climax takes place on Manhattan streets surrounding the newly erected Stark Tower, but Stark’s dramatic arc feels less significant than those of Banner or Black Widow. In The Incredible Hulk, Banner still struggled to control his green rages, but in the exciting finale, his counterpart becomes relatively self-aware—he becomes a hero instead of a monster. Seeing this side of Hulk may be more consumable for audiences, who can finally root for a character able to differentiate between good guys and bad guys. Ruffalo, an actor normally associated with indie dramas, admittedly outdoes Norton (and Eric Bana before him) when his character blossoms—enough for audiences to clamor for another solo Hulk feature with Ruffalo as the star. Likewise haunted, we learn much more about Johansson’s Black Widow and her blood-soaked past; her best scene is not only a film-best but provides the film’s most impressive acting: She interrogates Loki, who responds with jaw-droppingly violent and cruel threats, snarled with precision by Hiddleston. The look of terror on Johansson’s face is undeniable and then punctuated with a wonderful turnaround. With any comic book film, there are always mild-to-great disappointments in how the filmmakers have adapted characters from the page to the screen. Some are merely nitpicking on the part of fanboys; others are noticeable by anyone. For example, anyone could tell too many villains clogged up Spider-Man 3, whereas no one outside of a comic book shop cared how Galactus was rendered into a cloud-thing in Fantastic Four 2. Here, fanboys can delight in how much Whedon gets right. But in addition to not exploring Hawkeye enough, Whedon’s choice to provide our heroes with a high body count via anonymous Chitauri aliens (obscure Marvel characters, to be sure) is questionable. Granted, his story infuses elements of The Avengers issue #1 from 1963, in which Loki manipulates Hulk into a frenzy and, in turn, unites the Avengers, but in the last half, Whedon’s focus remains on Loki orchestrating a war of Chitauri pawns. Of course, this decision makes an effective storytelling device by allowing The Avengers’ first assembly to be about an ideal gathering of heroes more than the disposable villains. Still, the comic nerd in me wanted a more recognizable crowd of baddies for our heroes to clobber. (Fortunately, the Chitauri’s presence leads to a post-end-titles scene that will leave fans giddy.) However negligible a disappointment Whedon’s choice of alien race may be, he makes up for it in his arrangement of stunning battle sequences, superhero smackdowns, and most importantly a riotous sense of humor. Early on, Iron Man and Thor go head-to-head, followed by the two powerhouse characters, Thor and Hulk, throwing each other around (their conflict comes up again later on, unexpectedly, abruptly, and hilariously). Likewise, Stark’s quick-witted zingers and Cap’s dislocation in another century furnish no end of laughs in Whedon’s usual brand of smart, punchy dialogue. These conflicts and joking moments are mostly for comic effect, but they also illustrate how non-cohesive these characters seem when placed next to one another, and how they require wrangling to become a team. S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), a nice-guy character present in this ongoing franchise since Iron Man, serves as superhero glue. In a subplot both funny and tender, he’s star-struck by Captain America and wants only f0r the Captain to sign his vintage superhero trading card set. As Whedon injects copious amounts of humor into the proceedings, he plays with his characters’ dynamic and personal limitations in a self-aware style, but without risking the integrity of the characters themselves. Rather, he enhances them. When it’s all over, only one question remains: How will audiences react to solo stories for characters like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk in the future? A film as grandiose as The Avengers threatens to dwarf anything placed next to it. Won’t next year’s Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 seem underwhelming in comparison? Could Marvel have unwittingly undone their smaller franchises by making too good a film here? My hope is that as long as Marvel continues to distribute the kinds of quality superhero films we’ve come to expect since Iron Man, faithful audiences will return for the next building block not only in the individual stories but in anticipation of the inevitable sequel to this giant-sized crossover. Marvel should take care and make the best films they can in the coming years, as they risk turning the in-between movies into nothing more than “the next building block” to The Avengers 2. That said, you won’t likely find a more rousing, purely entertaining, popcorn-munching blockbuster this summer. No spectacle on par with this film has arrived in theaters since Avatar, and at a similarly long 142 minutes, the film breezes by. On these levels, and a plane of sheer superhero movie joy, The Avengers delivers in every respect. It’s not a flawless film (what film is?), but its modest flaws (mostly the quibbles of comic book aficionados) are washed away by its incomparable height of showmanship that has yet to be matched in this genre. While Christopher Nolan’s Batman films elevated the superhero film by achieving an unparalleled dramatic and artistic timbre, Marvel’s decidedly more comic-booky endeavors find their pinnacle in The Avengers. Just as it should, the film outdoes what have now become its five prequels. After four years’ worth of building piece by piece against mounting expectations, Marvel and Whedon have managed to satisfy the majority of fan expectations, and in some ways, even exceeded them.",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2022"," Marvel Studio’s “The Avengers” is the culmination of what may be the most ambitious project in film history. For those movie fans who have been living in a cave for the past several years, Marvel has been releasing several individual superhero movies that have all set the table for this huge event film. Two “Iron Man” pictures, “Captain America”, “Thor”, and “The Incredible Hulk” have all been linked together through brief reoccuring cameos and hidden after-credits scenes that refer to something called “The Avengers Initiative”. As any comic book geek could tell you, that’s a reference to the Marvel superhero team that first debuted in comics in 1963. On the surface, the idea for an Avengers film that’s directly tied into other individual superhero movies sounds great. On the flip side, even though the other films have been good, there are still plenty of areas where “The Avengers” could go off track. Well as a movie and comic book fan, I’m happy to say that “The Avengers” not only meets the challenges of it’s vision, but it’s an action packed adrenaline rush that offers some of the most fun I’ve had at the theater this year. To handle this rather large undertaking, Marvel placed the project in the hands of Joss Whedon. Whedon was a good choice mainly due to his variety of experience. He’s found success in television, film, and comic books and he uses his knowledge of each combined with Disney’s deep pockets to create a movie that would appeal to the fanboy and the casual moviegoer alike. One thing that helps Whedon is that the film doesn’t require your traditional origin story. While we do see the generation of the team, we know all of the characters from the previous Marvel movies so Whedon is able to dive right into the story. That being said, don’t mistake this for a deep, engaging story that will challenge the audience. But I’ll also say that anyone going into “The Avengers” for that has already missed the point. Throughout the other Marvel films, particularly “Captain America”, we learned about a cosmic energy source known as the cosmic cube. In “The Avengers”, S.H.E.I.L.D. head honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has a team of scientists led by physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) trying to harness the power of the cube, now known as the Tesseract. But suddenly the cube activates and opens a portal allowing the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to entire the facility and steal it. Knowing the immense threat associated with the Tesseract being in the wrong hands, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative. But getting such a diverse group of superheroes to cooperate and coexist proves to be a lot harder than expected. Fury starts by contacting Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). He sends her to India to find Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) while sending Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to Stark Tower to speak to Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). While the two are gone, he approaches Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and sends him on a mission to retrieve the Tesseract. Upon hearing of Loki’s involvement, the thunder god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) also entires the mix as does the marksman and assassin known as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Each of the heroes have their own baggage and their own personalities which often times clash to the point of dysfunction. But their disagreements give us some of the movie’s cooler and often times funnier moments. As you would expect the situation worsens and it’s up to the team to pull together or the world will be taken over starting with New York City. It’s a pretty cut-and-dry story but it really works because Whedon understand his characters and he knows what kind of movie he’s trying to make. His familiarity with the Marvel comic book universe is clearly seen throughout the picture but nowhere more than in his treatment of the characters. As a comic book fan, I was really impressed with how they all felt right and it’s clear that the source material played a big role in shaping the on-screen versions. But Whedon never falls into the trap of taking things too seriously. The movie is filled with laugh out loud funny moments that are cleverly used and they never feel cheap or forced. They mix perfectly with the razor-sharp dialogue and the jaw-dropping action sequences. But the fantastic action and special effects shouldn’t surprise anyone. Afterall, “The Avengers” is a superhero action picture and Whedon knows it. The action comes at a furious pace and I can see where some may view it as relentless. Personally, I was completely wrapped up in it. The movie sells the superhero action through some of the most spectacular visuals and editing that you’ll see. I was blown away. I can’t write a review of “The Avengers” without mentioning the incredible cast. One of the reasons the Marvel films and particularly “The Avengers” works so well is because of the amazing casting. Everyone is invested in their character and not one single performer phones it in. Downey, Jr. continues to be the perfect Tony Stark mainly due to his natural ability to use sarcasm and fire off funny quips without hesitation. Chris Evans, known more for his goofier roles,  is also quite good as the serious and straight-laced Captain America. I also really liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. He’s the third actor to take on the role and he nails it. Much like Downey, Jr., Hemsworth is the perfect Thor and he shares some of the film’s best scenes with Hulk. Renner and Johannson also handle their roles very well. But I have to give special time to the wonderful Tom Hiddleston. He’s a remarkably diverse actor and he shows it here. His Loki is mysterious, mischievous, and evil and Hiddleston slithers through his scenes stealing many of them. There are also nice smaller performances from Gregg, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cobie Smulders that are just icing on the cake. I can see where some people may not respond as positively as I did to “The Avengers”. The action is pretty much start-to-finish and if you’re not interested in the characters you’ll have a hard time embracing the story. There are also a few shortcuts taken with the story for the sake of convenience that could have been done a little better. For me, I have a connection to these characters through all my years of comic book reading and this film exceeded my expectations. But being a comic reader isn’t a prerequisite for enjoying this movie. If you’ve liked what Marvel has put out leading to it, you’re going to love “The Avengers”. Sure, it’s a loud, energetic summer popcorn flick, but it’s also a really good one. It’s honest and it never tries to be something it’s not. Featuring one of the better ensemble casts and some top-notch directing from Joss Whedon, “The Avengers” is a big budget blockbuster that actually deserves all the money it’s going to rake it. When’s the next showing? I’m ready to see it again. Yeah I didn’t respond to it as warmly as you have but that is most likely due to having never read a comic in my life.  On the other hand I also agree that you’ve got a great cast, an undeniably iconic bunch of characters and some impressive action so what’s not to like!?  A lot of fun but just not a five star film to me. I don’t give many 5 star ratings and I tried finding reasons not to give this one 5 stars. But I just couldn’t. I simple had too much fun. I was also incredibly impressed with Whedon’s ability to bring the other tie-in films to such a climax (which is what “The Avengers” is). Great review Keith! I just finished writing mine as well, it’ll be up tomorrow. I agree w/ your assessment, it’s definitely a fun movie and one that’d be fun to watch over and over again. Thanks a bunch Ruth! I’m anxious to read your take on the movie. I don’t give many 5 star ratings but this film really worked for me when considering it for exactly what it is. I’m having to wait until the weekend. Hoping to check it out either Friday or Saturday. WELL worth a second viewing on the big screen! Decided to drop the movie down to a 4 1/2 star film. It’s not that I came up with a substantial reason or that a serious flaw or gaping hole came to mind. But I began comparing it to the few other films I have given 5 stars to. I asked myself ” Between “The Avengers” and “______” which movie would I be more inclined to watch again first?” In almost every instant, it was the other 5 star film. I also considered that “The Avengers” really does require the viewing of the other lead-in films to get a grounded understanding of what the bigger picture is. For me that worked extremely well. I saw each lead-in film and I’m a big comic book fan. But how would it appeal to casual fans and how does it stand on it’s own? I still stand by every word of my review and for me personally it was an amazing experience to see these characters come to life before my eyes. And while what Marvel was able to accomplish is nothing short of amazing, I’m not sure if “The Avengers” is what should be called a 5-star all-time classic. A great movie no doubt, but maybe not a 5 star one. The film is an action film.. not a thinking film.. But great film anyway. Had fun watching it. The action however was too fast sometimes. I couldn’t catch up.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2022"," The words ""never before seen,"" ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and ""revolutionary"" get thrown around a great deal in the movie business.  Everything wants to be on that cutting edge ahead of everyone else.  Few movies deliver on those adjectives.  When that cabin door opens in 1939's The Wizard of Oz and everything sepia turns to color, a new world is opened, not just in the movie, but with movies themselves.  In 1995, when Pixar's Toy Story brought computers into animation, that was a ""game changer,"" another buzz label.  Just three years ago, Avatar's technical achievements in performance-capture technology and 3D filmmaking raised the bar and was something dreamed of, but never thought possible.  I may be picking out too tall of a pedestal, but there's an element of newly broken ground to the culmination that is The Avengers, from Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures. Where The Avengers breaks historic ground is in long-term planning and scope.  Many films in many years have had several years of tedious planning put into them, but not like this.  Plenty of film franchises have gone on to make connected sequels.  The Harry Potter series was built for that, but not like this.  Never before has a film attempted to merge this many individual entities.  Aside from classic horror showdowns like Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, nothing of the sort in terms of uniting characters has ever been attempted at this scale.  In my lifetime, the closest I've ever seen to a character being in more than one project was Michael Keaton's cocky federal agent Ray Nicolette appearing as a cameo in 1998's Out of Sight from Steven Soderbergh and as a supporting character in 1997's Jackie Brown from Quentin Tarantino.  Both films were based on Elmore Leonard novels, but that doesn't mean Jack Foley (George Clooney) and Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) were going to team-up and start a crime spree together down the road.  What The Avengers had in mind was bigger than that. Marvel Studios gained control of their own properties instead of farming them off to the highest bidder (i.e. Spider-Man is housed at Sony and the X-Men universe remains at 20th Century Fox).  Success allowed them to start bankrolling and selling their own movies without splitting with distributors like Paramount and Universal.  That clout increased when Walt Disney purchased all of Marvel Entertainment (movies, comics, and all) on New Year's Eve 2009.  They became their own creative control.  Few franchises can say that. Through uncompromising planning and genius forethought, Marvel shrewdly enacted a master blueprint of developing five individual origin films (2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, 2010's Iron Man 2, and last year's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) from four different directors that built off of one another, were inter-connected, and culminated to the common goal of this massive team-up we are witnessing with The Avengers.   Many studio chiefs (just ask Warner Brothers with their DC Comics library of Superman, Batman, and the like) have dreamed this, but none have tried it and none have succeeded until now.  The Avengers is exactly that: a dream come true.  No one thought it was possible, but Marvel stuck to their guns and the pay-off monumentally delivers.  In The Avengers, we learn very early on that the Cosmic Cube, a.k.a. the Terrasect, a source of endless power wielded and recovered from Captain America: The First Avenger, will be the object of our villain's affections.  That villain is Loki (the excellent Tom Hiddleston), the adopted brother of Thor and brief former king of Asgard, and he demolishes an underground S.H.I.E.L.D. base to take it away from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, with a full role instead of his usual cameos) and company.  He also gains mind control over Terrasect specialist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard from Thor) and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s sharp-shooting archery assassin Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner).  Fearing the Chitauri alien army that Loki has behind him, Fury decides to reactivate his rumored ""Avengers Initiative"" as a response team to Loki's global threat. Fury, the trusty agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), and Natasha ""Black Widow"" Rommanoff (Scarlett Johansson), begin to enlist and recuit the resurrected WWII hero Captain America (Chris Evans), the reclusive gamma scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, taking over for and improving on Edward Norton), and take a gamble working with Iron Man himself, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr., zinging the one-liners). When the God of Thunder, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), tracks Loki to Earth, he too sees that S.H.I.E.L.D. and he have a common enemy and goal, that being recovering their lost colleagues and Terrasect.  Thus, a team is formed, but one with many kinks and differences, which come to light and clash wonderfully as The Avengers plays out. While Robert Downey, Jr. is the headliner, each main character gets their time to shine in the center spotlight with not only ""wow"" moments of action bliss, but also meaty character-driven scenes.  Combined with extremely well-written, laugh-out-loud humor from Joss Whedon, the interactive experiences between these formerly separate personalities is outstanding.  Whedon, as a fellow fanboy on the inside and popular comic book writer on the outside, knew when and how to use and respect the epic moments that occur throughout the movie.  With all of that said, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk steals the show.  He instigates the best shock, awe, and leap-out-of-your-chair spots out of everyone on the team. With this nearly five-year, six-movie blueprint of building to The Avengers completed, it will be interesting to see where Marvel Studios goes with both Avengers sequels and new individual adventures from these now-iconic characters.  Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2 all have the green light.  After this film, I expect a renewed interest for more Hulk that may lead to that character getting a much-deserved sequel, hopefully with Ruffalo at the center.  As with any Marvel movie, stay after for the credits for TWO extra scenes.  One sets up the likely heavy on the horizon for The Avengers 2 and the other is for pure geeky enjoyment.  Once again, all of this scope in The Avengers constitutes nothing short of a movie-making miracle.  Go back a rewrite the definitions for ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and those other buzz words from the opening. The bar has officially been raised. LESSON #1: POWER CORRUPTS-- Simply put, power corrupts, especially if it's a mythical cube that could be a source of limitless energy for an entire planet. When something comes around looking stronger than you, you respond by raising your level of strength.  After that, you want a show of strength to prove that you're still on top. LESSON #2: THE MOTIVATION TO JOIN A TEAM OR A CAUSE-- While Nick Fury and the people from S.H.I.E.L.D. talk a good talk about the threat of alien war, each main character has their own reasons for being there, staying there, and fighting for this cause.  Motivation comes in many forms and many levels of strength.  You will see that going on here. LESSON #3: STEPPING UP WHEN NEEDED-- In order to get Lesson #2 to happen for the motivation to work, the decision must be made to commit and step up when it is necessary.  The decision-making step follows the stimulus of motivation.  Again, each one of the future Avengers steps up in a different way. LESSON #4: WORKING AS A TEAM-- Once you get a team assembled and motivated, they have to work together, not against each other to succeed.  On this team, each big-time player brings a different skill set of strengths and abilities that must be utilized properly and in the right moments in battle.  Kudos to Captain America and his natural leadership ability.",POSITIVE

"Feb 11, 2022"," Ever since the post-credit sequence in 2008’s Iron Man, fanboy audiences world-wide have eagerly awaited the assembling of The Avengers, Marvel’s answer to DC’s Justice League. The Avengers, made up of such heroes as Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, has always been a beloved comic book property for diehard Marvel fans. Under the watchful eye of S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury, The Avengers would team up to take on the villains in the Marvel canon while saving room for constant bickering among themselves. Ever since the moment Samuel L. Jackson’s Fury told Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark of the planned initiative to bring earth’s mightiest heroes together, Marvel Studios has introduced audiences to not just the carefree, narcissistic Iron Man. Edward Norton brought the Hulk to the screen (again) in ’08, but due to some contractual/creative differences, Norton’s satisfying take on the big green man marked his only outing as the beast. Stark returned to the screen in 2010’s love it-or-hate it Iron Man 2. Aussie Chris Hemsworth (best known at the time for a flash-shot performance in 09’s Star Trek) brought the proud, Shakespearean Thor to the big screen in 2011. In the same year, Chris Evans completed the pre-Avengers rally with Captain America’s origin. Through the thick and thin, these set-up movies have had their strengths and weaknesses. Everyone loves Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, but many complain the Iron Man movies lacked the scale necessary for superhero glory. Most have already forgotten about The Incredible Hulk (a shame, really. I find the film highly underrated.), and Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger were enjoyable introductions to the characters, no more and no less. When Joss Whedon took the reins of The Avengers, a mighty task was placed in his hands. Bringing together so many different variables for one of the most anticipated films in recent memory requires a level of skill that very few directors possess. The Avengers proves that you have to let the experts take on the big projects. In any other hands, The Avengers could have turned out to be a colossal train wreck. Honestly, hiring anyone else but a veteran of the source material would have been a huge mistake on Marvel’s behalf. So far, the studio has tapped directors that fit the content individual films perfectly. Whedon, a proven champion of geekdom, took on the task at hand and created a rare treat for fans of both the comic and film series. While watching The Avengers, you can’t help but see the level of complexity in the story. I can image that bringing five different storylines/dynamic characters together for a summer blockbuster event must have been exhausting, but Whedon made it look easy. His script masterfully pulls together the diverse members of this superhero team to take on a threat long established in the Marvel universe. The Tesseract is no stranger to viewers. This glowing cube of unlimited power came to light at the end of Thor when Nick Fury introduces Stellan Skarsgård’s kindly physicist to the object. Actually, Tony Stark’s dad Howard fished the relic out of the sea when searching for the then-lost-in-action Captain America. The events of Thor must have brought the cube back into the forefronts of the secretive S.H.I.E.L.D’s mindset. Entering into The Avengers, the so-said ‘Avengers Initiative’ is no more. Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark continues to further his weapons-free empire with establishing a new line of Stark Towers, large buildings than run on clean energy. Captain America himself, Steve Rogers, freshly defrosted after 70 years in ice, continues to establish life in the 21st century. Thor, as far as we know, is resting peacefully in his kingdom of Asgard. Thor’s devious brother, Loki, starts off the events of The Avengers with a bang. The cast out prince, a fan of what the Tesseract can do for both him and a few of his otherworldly friends, steals the artifact from S.H.I.E.LD’s headquarters while taking a few of its key members hostage under a mind-altering spell. Nick Fury, seeing this as an act of war, assembles the super-characters together to take on Loki and whatever the trickster god has up his sleeve. From this point on, The Avengers becomes a balancing act of epic proportions. Whedon manages to fit the booming ego of Tony Stark, the gung-ho, to-the-books Captain America, the no-nonsense Thor, the timid-yet-potentially dangerous Brue Banner, the expert archer Hawkeye and the super-spy Black Widow together in the same movie, while throwing in a massive alien army, a boatload of S.H.I.E.L.D agents and some inspired set pieces to boot. Downey Jr.’s Stark never misses a beat, and Evans’ straight-laced take on Captain has never been better. Hemsworth continues to prove why he’s the perfect fit for Thor, and Samuel L. Jackson expands his Nick Fury character into a true, unabashed leader. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow gains added depth from Whedon’s screenplay, and Johansson takes the character to a new level not yet previously established with her minimal presence in Iron Man 2. Tom Hiddleston continues to impress as the vile Loki, and Clark Gregg continues to bring the fun with his straight-faced Agent Coulson (or, to Stark’s girlfriend Pepper Potts, Phil). Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye adds to the fun, and newcomer Cobie Smulders holds her own as Maria Hill, Fury’s right-hand woman. I couldn’t help but become enamored with Mark Ruffalo’s take on Bruce Banner. Both he and Whedon capture the character in a way that manages to honor the comic roots while bringing a fresh take to both Bruce and ‘the other guy.’ While Whedon takes Hulk to smash-happy nirvana in the film’s latter sequences, Ruffalo’s quasi-sarcastic portrayal of Banner had me hooked. Whedon gave him the words, but Ruffalo brought the power. His scenes with Downey Jr. create instant gratification. The action sequences in this film rise above anything else in Marvel’s long lineage of theatrical releases. We’ve seen plenty of the New York assault in the promotional material, but one striking section of the film has gone largely unspoiled, and for good reason. Whedon orchestrates the mayhem with sheer amazement, allowing for the characters to shine rather than fade into the scenery – a bane in Michael Bay’s Transformers series. While the film rests heavily on scientific jargon to lead the plot during the first half, Whedon pushes the gas in the last hour-and-a-half-or-so to create one eye-popping, hair-raising scene after the other. Thankfully, the film never forgets to add in a laugh here and there. Whether it’s one of Tony Stark’s wise quips or the realization of a pop culture reference on Cap’s behalf, The Avengers remains constantly funny without ever sacrificing the seriousness of the scale. From now on, superhero movies in the Marvel universe will look to The Avengers as a shining beacon of what these films can aspire to be. If you get the right talent in the driver’s seat to lead the endeavor, amazing benefits can be reaped. Joss Whedon deserves a big pat on the back for what he did with The Avengers. The story works, the acting is superb, the humor is on key and the action sequences are breath-taking.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2021"," EnlargePeter OpaskarArs Technica turns 21 at the end of this year, but film coverage on site can't exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet. Quietly, we've been reviewing movies on the Internet for 11 years now—a baker's dozen years if reviews of 3D experiences count—starting with this Max Payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism. But beginning in 2014, we made film a regular topic on site. And these days we annually bounce from SXSW to Fantastic Fest with plenty of regional film events in between. Now, this ain't Variety, and we do not write about everything (though we have covered Beauty and The Beast and The Jungle Book somehow). But Ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section. We failed at Vulcan salutes with Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds. We caught the premiere of a Academy Award-nominated movie at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Somehow, we even helped save a Star Wars-adjacent movie from obscurity (earning an IMDb credit and inspiring a full-length remake in the process).

So with the end of the decade rapidly approaching, we felt it was OK to indulge our film list-making impulses. This is not necessarily a Best Films of the decade list—undeniably great things like Lady Bird, Moonlight, The Master, Bridesmaids, et al. are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science, technology, and genre fare. It is not a list of the Most Important films, either, as this decade of streaming's rise, female directors taking the reins, continued globalization of cinema, and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinema-centric press. But the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the Orbital HQ years later, and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward. It's probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry, audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema, too. It turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama (though we all underrated First Man, folks). If you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may have been the in-theater experience of the decade. The vastness of space has never been more vivid, even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists. The Matt Damon-led The Martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting, continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science. No one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016, but Arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense, gripping sci-fi story. And Hidden Figures puts the familiar period-piece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate. Add any number of other fine space movies to this lot—Interstellar, Ad Astra, etc.—but this quartet revived a cinematic subset Ars will always have a fondness for. The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes. By no means did it start here (the Nolan Batman trilogy began in the 2000s, as did the MCU with Iron Man in 2008), but it became an expanded universe, cinematic event these last 10 years. The first Avengers hit in 2012, and box offices haven't looked back since. Picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible. Your preferences of memorable Spider-Man (Into the Spider-Verse), Iron-Man (Iron Man 2), Captain America (Winter Soldier), or other regulation superhero flicks (Ragnarok ever-so-slightly over the original Deadpool?) may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward. The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular (Avengers: End Game over the original Guardians by a hair). But the caped crusades we'll remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree. Black Panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity. Logan took a hero long familiar to film-goers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a Western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process. And while Wonder Woman may be the most straightforward super-hero-y of the three, it showed a female-led comic book conquest was worth doing, especially when it leveraged well-executed period-piece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry. For the future of the then-beleaguered DC Comics entertainment arm, Wonder Woman also proved everything didn't have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience (all the fun being had in HBO's Watchmen seems to indicate DC took the hint). And, OK, it's not a traditional superhero movie, but we couldn't make an of-the-decade film list and exclude Mad Max: Fury Road entirely. Like more traditional caped-crusader flicks, this is an existing IP with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original. It starts with a very super villain-y evil plot (our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the bad-team War Boys; another hero has to help a group of women known as the Five Wives escape forced procreations). The film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character. Finally, perhaps most like the trio above, this newest Mad Max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar post-apocalyptic world. Max Rockatansky may be back (invigorated by Tom Hardy), but the star of the show is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the post-apocalyptic female hero sci-fi action fans deserve.",POSITIVE
"Jun 24, 2021"," The Avengers is the biggest success Marvel, Disney, and the entire comic book movie industry has ever seen. Directed by Joss Whedon of Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame, The Avengers was the (first) end result of the shared universe experiment that Marvel Studios was attempting. This finally brought Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and more all together for a true celebratory fireworks display. If this worked, it would change the landscape of film forever. The Avengers would go on to not just be Marvel Studio’s biggest hit, but it would become the third highest-grossing film of all time, only behind James Cameron’s Avatar and Titanic. It is the textbook example of a comic book movie, the gold standard to strive for, and a validation of comic book storytelling as an art form. It was a truly monumental success. How was this achieved? The choice for Joss Whedon to direct was perfect. Whedon is a master at directing an ensemble cast, to the point where it’s basically what he’s known for. The exciting part of The Avengers is seeing all of these different characters together and interacting onscreen, and Whedon’s penchant for being able to juggle multiple characters and their stories, in addition to his trademark witty dialogue, ensured that every Avenger got their time to shine, and their own arcs to go through. It’s an impressive feat for a movie of this scale. The Avengers also proved to be accessible to general audiences, even those who had never seen a single Marvel film beforehand. You don’t necessarily need to have seen any of the previous films to understand what’s happening in The Avengers, every character’s introduction at the beginning of the film tells you all you need to know about them. Another smart choice the film makes is that it keeps the plot simple and streamlined. The Avengers needs to overcome their differences and work together to stop Loki and his alien army. That’s really it, and the film never deviates from it. Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner is leaps and bounds better than Edward Norton’s. Ruffalo’s Banner is cautious and he’s someone who fears The Hulk not because of any danger to himself, but because he knows innocent people will be hurt. His face reads deep emotional pain and sadness over the life he was robbed of, but he also has a strange sense of humor about his situation. At this point in his life, Bruce has given up trying to rid himself of The Hulk and instead has a sort of good natured-ness about his condition, understanding that it’s something he simply has to try and live with. He also still tries to do some good in the world, even in hiding. We see that he’s become a local doctor in the country he’s hiding out in. Ruffalo somehow balances levity and charisma, which Norton’s Banner never had, with even more emotional depth than Norton’s Banner ever had. He brings real subtlety to what is arguably Marvel’s least subtle character. And he accomplishes all of this in one single scene: His introduction and conversation with Natasha. And sparks were flying between those two in that scene and throughout the whole film; I resent the argument that their romance in Age of Ultron “came out of nowhere”, but we’ll save that discussion for another time. The Hulk himself finally became a character to cheer for. This marked the first time he was truly successful onscreen, because he’s just so much fun in it. The iconic “I’m always angry” scene is still the greatest Hulk transformation to date, and his delighted grin at Cap’s orders to simply “smash” shows us that he’s having a good time, so we do too. The visuals of Hulk are acceptable in his solo film, but The Avengers is the first time he doesn’t just look good, but looks great. I’m sure having some Disney money helped the motion capture technology this time around. The Avengers is also the first time we see Hulk use his powers for something other than destruction. His leap and catch to save Tony from his free fall received just as many cheers and applause in the theater as the legendary shot of all the heroes circled together. Not only does The Avengers stand on its own without a hitch, but the events of the film would go on to directly affect all future films, with ideas brought up in The Avengers coming back for our heroes to deal with. Tony Stark faces the first situation that he truly can’t have any sort of control over. It’s a situation he can barely even comprehend. The concept of aliens and gods is completely foreign to Tony; a threat he never even considered to be a possibility until now. And in the climactic battle, in his first truly heroic, selfless act, he almost loses his life. This all would go on to haunt him throughout the rest of the MCU, and it is the biggest influence on his behavior and decisions moving forward. Steve Rogers is fresh out of his frozen slumber and trying to understand his place in the modern world. What does Captain America represent to the current climate, if anything? “Aren’t the stars and stripes a little old-fashioned?” he asks
Coulson. Steve serves the purpose of the everyman in this film. He isn’t just new to aliens, he’s new to everything, to the very world that the film takes place in. He starts off with the idea of “We have orders. We should follow them.” But Tony’s rebellious and untrusting nature, paired with Bruce’s own suspicions, are enough to send Steve on his own investigation into the very people he works for. What he finds is that S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction, even basing these weapons off the inventions of Hydra and their use of the Tesseract. It’s a direct betrayal to what Steve thinks S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for, and it reminds him that the world, even seventy years in the future, with all of its social and technological progress, is never as black and white as it may appear. He, along with Natasha and Clint, defy their orders as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., steal a Quinjet, and take off to fight in the Battle of New York. While he does continue to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., his trust in them is broken and he knows them to be flawed. This loss of trust in the government he devoted his life to serve follows him throughout the rest of his time in the MCU. Natasha proves to be more than just a capable fighter, she is first and foremost a spy, and a master at mental manipulation. From the interrogation in her introduction to her ability to outsmart the literal God of Mischief himself into giving away his plan, Black Widow is really given her due here. Her time working for the KGB and even S.H.I.E.L.D. means that she has blood on her hands and crimes to make up for. “I’ve got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.” Natasha chooses to try and make the really heroic decisions, to protect and fight for a better world, to make up for the mistakes of her past and hopefully clear her conscious. Clint Barton, after being brainwashed by Loki, wants to make up for the people he killed while doing Loki’s bidding, and maybe even get a little revenge. Clint is also just a really good guy who always does the right thing, similar to Steve Rogers. Is Hawkeye wasted in this film? A bit, yes. Having him be mind-controlled for most of the runtime does prevent us from getting to know the man, but it does show us how capable Hawkeye is as an adversary. He takes down an entire helicarrier and brings S.H.I.E.L.D. practically to its knees, almost single-handedly. So while we may have not gotten much of his character, we do get to see skills on full display. He also gets some of the best action beats in the Battle of New York. Thor comes to Earth to stop Loki, but also wants to save him. Thor still holds out hope that his brother can be redeemed and come home. He never fights him with the intention of killing him, and during every altercation he pleads with Loki to stop his conquest, to realize that he has the power to put an end to it and do the right thing. Thor tragically realizes that his brother may simply be too far gone, and beyond saving. Loki murders Coulson in front of him, and then proceeds to try and kill Thor without hesitation. In order to save the planet, he has to steel himself and be prepared to kill his own brother if it comes to it. It’s a test not just for his dedication to being Earth’s protector, but for his worthiness to lead and take the throne of his own planet. Speaking of the God of Mischief, Loki became the real breakout of The Avengers, creating a massive fanbase and adoration for the villain. How was this accomplished? In an email sent to Joss Whedon, Tom Hiddleston, an actor who one hundred percent understands and dedicates himself to the character, sums everything up about why Loki works so well as the antagonist for the Avengers. “It’s high operatic villainy alongside detached throwaway tongue-in-cheek; plus the “real menace” and his closely guarded suitcase of pain. It’s grand and epic and majestic and poetic and lyrical and wicked and rich and badass. Throughout you continue to put Loki on some kind of pedestal of regal significance and then consistently tear him down. He gets battered, punched, blasted, side-swiped, roared at, sent tumbling on his back, and every time he gets back up smiling, wickedly, never for a second losing his eloquence, style, wit, self-aggrandizement or grandeur, and you never send him up or deny him his true intelligence. That he loves to make an entrance, that he has a taste for the grand gesture, the big speech, the spectacle.” Loki earns his right to be the ultimate baddie that no Avenger can beat on their own; a Saturday morning cartoon, mustache-twirling villain, while at the same time a genuinely menacing, incredibly intelligent, manipulative mastermind. He repeatedly outwits our heroes, and in doing so forces them to overcome their differences and work together to finally defeat him. His ability to bring the Avengers to their lowest point is what eventually leads to his own downfall. Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson ends up being the secret weapon of the film. Coulson is the consistent string that ties together all of the films prior, even more than Nick Fury. He has a personal relationship with Natasha, Clint, Tony and Pepper, Thor, and, in a genius move, is revealed to be the biggest Captain America fanboy. It adds a new level of innocence to the character and Whedon knows how to make him lovable, giving him the light comedic moments in the first half of the film. Coulson is the representation of all the comic book fans who are sitting in the theater eager to finally see their heroes come together on the big screen. He’s the biggest advocator for the Avengers Initiative and believes in every single one of them and their ability to save the world. “We need you.” he tells Tony in Iron Man 2, in the first time he drops his tough government persona and reveals his true, genuinely good-hearted nature. It’s why his death at the hands of Loki works. Coulson’s murder is the loss of innocence, the first true death of a recurring character in the MCU. Coulson never gets to see his dream of the Avengers together come to fruition, if anything he only witnesses the opposite. Yet with his dying breath he understands what his death might be able to accomplish. “This was never gonna work if they didn’t have something to…” Coulson’s death serves as the catalyst that finally brings The Avengers together, and it specifically spurs Tony and Steve into action. Tony, who was initially cautious around Coulson, learns to trust and respect him because he learns that Pepper does. His death wakes him up to the fact that his selfishness and uncooperativeness has consequences when the stakes are this high, and innocent people’s lives are at stake. Steve learns what Captain America means, or should mean, to the people of the modern world, and what he needs to do to accomplish that. “With everything that’s about to happen, people might just need a little old-fashioned.” Coulson tells him. All of this leads us to the grand finale, the fireworks display, the celebration of all of the work and dedication that Marvel Studios put together in this new idea of a shared movie universe. The Battle of New York works not just purely as spectacle, though it certainly is that, but as character-driven action. An action sequence that is earned, that makes all of the build up throughout the previous films worth it. The Avengers, finally assembled, working together to stop the biggest threat the world has ever faced. Emphasis is put on not just taking down aliens, but on saving and protecting the people they’re fighting for. This role primarily goes to our heart and soul, Captain America, who makes containment of the alien army the number one priority, choosing to stay on the ground and defend a single choke point, saving and getting as many civilians to safety as he can. The Avengers remains one of the only superhero universes where the films remember that they need to show us the heroes actually saving people, not just fighting. The Battle of New York remains one of the greatest action sequences to ever be put onscreen, and it has yet to be topped in the MCU (though Infinity War is looking into giving it a run for its money). It works on every level, and is absolutely thrilling to watch no matter how many times you’ve seen it. The Avengers was an event. It was something that everyone had to go see and witness. The idea of multiple characters from several different movies appearing all together in one big extravaganza was completely new and exciting. It’s something that no one has able to successfully replicate since. Look at Sony’s Amazing Spider-Man universe (scrapped after only two films), Universal’s Dark Universe (dead before it even began, only one film in) and, of course, DC’s ill-fated Justice League universe (in disarray after two films and who’s grand team-up film ended up being their lowest-grossing out of all of them). Why was The Avengers successful where others weren’t? Marvel’s secret is the immense amount of planning and forethought they put into their universe, and above all, their dedication and time that they commit to all of their characters. It’s why I’ve spent this entire essay primarily talking about each one of them. The awesome spectacle is nothing if I don’t care about who’s involved. Marvel’s devotion to the Avengers team and the time spent with each of them is what makes it all work. It’s what makes the grand display of an hour long action scene worth it and thrilling. Even though The Avengers was dropped down to fifth place after the 2015 nostalgia trip that was Jurassic World and The Force Awakens, it remains a benchmark of entertainment and popular culture. Marvel Studios knew that this was make it or break it time. They delivered, and the world has never been the same since. Connections to the MCU: The Battle of New York and the public emergence of the Avengers is the biggest impacting moment of the entire MCU, and the aftermath of it all would go on to affect not just the films but the television shows as well. Every show set in the MCU, minus Agent Carter, takes place post-Avengers. Spider-Man: Homecoming deals with people getting their hands on leftover alien technology, Tony gets some serious PTSD from the battle, Loki’s deeds carry on into the Thor sequels. S.H.I.E.L.D. secretly planning to make weapons from the energy of the Tesseract, the World Security Council attempting to nuke New York City, and Fury’s little white lie surrounding Coulson’s death, all serve to show the darker underbelly of the organization, an idea that would come back in the biggest way possible in The Winter Soldier. A member of that council would go on to become a major antagonist in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and of course, Coulson would return to spearhead that very show. We are also given our first glimpse at the ultimate MCU villain, Thanos. He gives Loki the scepter and the army to steal the Tesseract and conquer Earth for him. Loki’s failure and loss of not one, but two Infinity Stones does not bode well for his fate when he runs into Thanos again in Infinity War.

"Apr 22, 2021"," There are several moments during Joss Whedon’s ecstatically awaited Avengers Assemble – the Marvel franchise mash-up promised since the Samuel L. Jackson-starring post-credits sting of 2008’s Iron Man – that you’re certain you’re watching, quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. This sensation doesn’t last too long, obviously (you’ll probably come to your senses during a post-film-wee moment of clarity) but, considering the extent to which the film pulls out all the stops in its relentless desire to simply entertain you as much as possible, is seems cruel and churlish not to hyperbolise just a little.  Whedon, of course, is currently enjoying success at the moment with the magnificently ape-shit The Cabin in the Woods, yet Avengers Assemble marks the ex-Buffy helmer’s first stint as director since 2005’s Serenity, the big-screen version of his so-brilliant-it-was-disastrously-unpopular TV series Firefly. That evidence of this directing hiatus isn’t present in Avengers Assemble is something of an understatement: Whedon has not only managed to tie together the disparate strands of the brands Marvel wanted to unite, he’s done so in a film which is bombastic, hilarious, confidently and – in places – exquisitely directed. Most importantly of all, it’s hard to recall another film released in recent years that is simply this much fun, from beginning to unapologetically preposterous end. Of course, in order to get our heroes together in the first place we need an enemy worthy of their attention. Step up Tom Hiddlestone’s charismatic and deliciously evil Loki, last seen on the business end of a harsh bollocking in Thor, who teams up with a reassuringly nasty race of indiscriminate aliens to enslave the Earth (hey look, no one said it was The Wire). Whedon then wastes little time before re-acquainting us with those we’re here to see: Samuel L Jackson’s super-spy Nick Fury, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, stepping into the perpetually-torn shoes of Bruce Banner), Thor (Chris Helmsworth), as well as newcomers Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlet Johansen). Most of the bit-players from each character’s solo efforts also get a look in, and it’s a real treat for those who’ve managed to see each of the separate hero’s films that have led to this one. Whedon doesn’t exclude those that haven’t, though – enough back-story is given for each to bring the audience up to speed, so if you haven’t seen The Hulk or Thor then don’t worry, you won’t have any trouble keeping up. Goodies, baddies, McGuffin, that’s all you need to know – the deeper layers are there for those who want them. And, when the ensemble is brought together, Avengers Assemble truly begins to shine.  Wedon’s shtick, if it’s not unfair to call it such, is sassy, witty scripts, and he’s on career-best, zinging form here. Downey Jnr is effortlessly droll, while no shortage of surprise laughs come from the unlikelier members of the group who, for the most part, each get their own golden chucklesome script nuggets. You just get the sense that everyone involved is having a rollocking good time, and this permeates into you through some form of chummy, good-natured osmosis. It’s only Renner’s Hawkeye that feels a little underused; this is, admittedly, for plot reasons which won’t divulge, but we may have to wait for the mooted Hawkeye spin-off to give him the cuss-quipping screen time he deserves. When the excrement hits the propeller, which is frequently does, Whedon also orchestrates the vast action scenes with aplomb and joyous flair. Michael Bay, the leading purveyor of epic, mindless action, could learn a thing or two here: these scenes are thrilling and refreshing in their clarity, largely eschewing the shaky-cam and quick-cut histrionics that hinder so many films of this scale. Sure, there’s little in the way of genuine threat, but in giving an audience what it wants (seeing these heroes team up to lay the smack well and truly down) Avengers Assemble delivers, and then some, and then a bit more. Then it nips out for a fag, comes back, and delivers again. The only real complaints are inherent to the plot itself, which is fairly standard, maniacal overlord fare. It’s serviceable and, certainly, never dull, but these are plot points that have been pounded into flat patties by countless films that have come before, and the sense that story had to be kept light in order to give screen time to the re-establishment of the characters pervades. The film’s also cheesier than a Wotsit fondue on occasion, but – crucially – it’s always aware of it, and we’re all in on the joke, whether you’re a Stella-guzzling comic-phobe or pale, seasoned uber-geek. Also, by way of minor gripe, Captain America is shit. Just saying. 
Captain America’s shitness aside, Avengers Assemble somehow manages to be much more than the sum of its parts, making it the best time you’ll have a the cinema this week, and probably for a good few weeks to come. Like a beautiful superhero’s game of soggy biscuit, only everybody wins and no one wants to cry afterwards. A mega-budget action extravaganza that succeeds on just about every level, and it’s one you should certainly go and see as soon as possible. ",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2021"," Otherwise known as “The Avengers” everywhere else in the world, Avengers Assemble sees the first “Marvel Team Up” film that nobody was quite sure if it would work… until it cracked a billion at the box office! While Iron Man obviously kicked the MCU off, it was this film that sold both fans and studios on the idea that a shared universe of visual media could not only be pulled off, but if done right can be pretty damn lucrative, and trust me: this was done right! So let’s take a look at the first Avengers film, shall we? When Thor’s evil brother Loki gains access to the unlimited power of the energy cube called the Tesseract, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., initiates a superhero recruitment effort to defeat the unprecedented threat to Earth. Joining Fury’s “Avengers” are Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. The Avengers succeeds due to two reasons: a fantastic cast and some really great and exciting action scenes (sadly the director of which has turned out to not be a very unpleasant man, but ah well… not going hold that against the cast and crew of the film…) Robert Downey Jr. is still the focus of a lot of the attention as Tony Stark / Iron Man but thankfully that is entirely in his character, and he’s great at it! Chris Evans’ Captain America, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner / Hulk do all get plenty of screen time though, and their various interactions are great: Cap and Stark arguing due to completely different philosophies on life, Thor getting rubbed the wrong way due to his lack of knowledge on Earthly affairs, and Stark trying to poke and prod Banner out of curiosity and eventually to motivate him to not be afraid of his power. This was Ruffalo’s first appearance in the role and he nails it, both funny and vulnerable, a really good take on the character. Then there’s Tom Hiddleston as Loki, once again perfectly nailing the snide and sarcastic villain role, and again his scenes with the Avengers themselves are all so well written and enjoyable. The crazy thing about this ensemble is that there are many other cast members to mention! Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is… well, Samuel L. Jackson, but that plays well in the role he has and he has the kind of presence to be the man who pulls all these people together. Scarlett Johansson is back as Black Widow, which given she is the only female member of the main cast shows how far the MCU has come on that from in the last decade, and she does a good job as “bad-ass secret agent”, her interaction with Banner / Hulk are fun as well. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye is good but sadly he does spend a lot of the film as a mind controlled zombie, but hey-ho, and finally we get more of Clark Gregg as SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson and Stellan Skarsgard back as Erik Selvig to continue the cliffhanger from Thor. It also features Cobie Smulders as high ranking SHIELD member Maria Hill, though beyond an exciting chase at the start of the film her role is limited. Speaking of the start of the film: here’s a quick sum up of the plot! Loki takes the tesseract, mind-controls a bunch of people (including Hawkeye), causes some trouble as he gathers equipment to open a portal and let some alien allies invade, and then gets caught by a combination of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. I still love a moment where Thor and Loki are arguing on a cliff and Thor is tackled away mid-sentence by Iron Man (who at this point doesn’t know if he’s friend or foe) and Loki just acts like he was waiting for the rest of the conversation to happen. After a fun mini-battle everyone joins up on Nick Fury’s helicarrier where Bruce Banner and Black Widow are also based and soon it comes under attack by the people who are under Loki’s influence. Banner Hulks up, Thor is outsmarted and thrown to the Earth and Agent Coulson is killed (… for now, if you count Agents of SHIELD…) Coulson’s death becomes the catalyst to force the team to work together, which is good because Loki successful opens up a portal above New York and lets a whole army of Chitauri warriors invade. Otherwise the only other complaint you could have is if you don’t like this kind of super hero, quippy and action-y film, but in that case… why are you watching it?",POSITIVE
"Dec 1, 2020"," o how does one pose a threat to a demigod, a supersoldier, a man in an indestructible metal suit, and a hulking green juggernaut? Well, it can’t really be done. But with a surplus of loud explosions, massive battles, and limitless CG effects, the right amount of adventure to appease fans of such monumental clashes between good and evil can be feigned. “The Avengers” keeps the concepts simple enough, but piles on so much mayhem it can become wearisome to those not previously invested in its subjects and willing to readily believe in the delirious events transpiring on screen. Viewers not cheering by the time the gang of superheroes takes down a giant mechanical space worm probably knew a long time ago this movie wasn’t for them. As Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the agents of the secret military agency S.H.I.E.L.D. attempt to harness the power of the extraterrestrial energy source known as the Tesseract, the villainous exiled demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth to steal it. Along with the cube, Loki brainwashes and kidnaps assassin Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) to aid in his devious plot to conquer all of humanity. To combat this new threat, Fury reinstitutes his scrapped “Avengers” initiative and sets about gathering together the world’s greatest heroes – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The posing, evil grimacing to denote villainy, and arsenal of one-liners are at an all-time high in “The Avengers,” which works to assemble a group of superheroes that constantly compete for screen time, one-upmanship, and the last laugh. The humor is actually overdone, poking fun at all of the characters and situations to the point that audiences will probably question which absurdities they should be taking seriously. And that’s detrimental in a film overflowing with fantastical silliness, both visually and from dialogue. It’s bad enough that despite gods and alien worlds, the extremely advanced technology is still unbelievable – and that jargon like gamma signature, thermonuclear, quantum, fusion, and cognitive recalibration sound so ludicrously forced for the sake of convincing viewers that the Avengers’ instruments are beyond general comprehension. Although it’s not quite a sequel, it still only feels appropriate to measure it up to films like “Transformers 3,” “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,” “Iron Man 2,” “Superman Returns,” and the like. It’s not as mind-numbingly nonsensical as a few of the aforementioned titles, but it doesn’t look or feel original, and the abundance of special effects and overwhelming destruction create nonstop spectacle without substance. Never once is there any real peril; this is made upsettingly apparent with the inclusion of non-superheroes Black Widow and Hawkeye, who are just too drastically inferior to go up against global catastrophes initiated by intergalactic alien wargods. With a complete lack of definition for the various powers exhibited by the antagonists and protagonists alike, their massive demolition of Manhattan and battling one another for the title of “toughest superhero” means very little. They might as well all be invincible. No villain is formidable enough and no force threatening enough for these cartoonish CG-inundated extravagances to be sympathetic.

"Jun 11, 2020"," Film critics haven't been mincing words about The Avengers. From Hollywood Life and The Washington Times to the Dekalb County Times-Journal, pundits of the silver screen are not only praising Joss Whedon's take on the band of Marvel icons, but referring to his motion picture as the greatest superhero film ever made. While I don't quite agree with this superlative assessment, it hits very close to the truth.  A brief retrospective of recent cinematic history is necessary to fully understand why. The last dozen years have been something of a Golden Age in comic book movies. Ever since the success of Bryan Singer's X-Men in the summer of 2000, cineplexes have been bursting at the seams with narratives inspired by or ripped straight from the pulpy pages of graphic novels. Lucrative blockbusters like Spider-Man, Spider-Man 3, and The Dark Knight were the highest grossing films in their respective years of release (2002, 2007, and 2008), while especially acclaimed entries like Iron Man and The Dark Knight have netted prestigious Oscar nominations and spots on critical top ten lists. In the midst of this deluge, two categories have emerged. First there are the traditional superhero stories, characterized by the familiar tropes of likeable good guys, memorable baddies, and unapologetically melodramatic three-act story archs (the Spider-Man and Iron Man series are perhaps the most popular in this group). Alongside those have been the more existential pieces, defined by their topicality, thematic depth, and attempts to transcend normative genre strictures (more famous examples include Unbreakable, The Dark Knight, and Watchmen). Saying that The Avengers falls into the first category, though true, does it a bit of an injustice. While no single aspect of it stands out as unusually superb, every element that needs to fall into place does so beautifully. As these types of movies rise or fall based largely on the merits of the characters, it certainly helps that The Avengers has quite a range of compelling figures in its arsenal. Leading the pack of heroes are a pair of dueling archetypes (metaphorically and literally): Iron Man/Tony Stark, a blithely egomaniacal playboy and renaissance man, and Captain America/Steve Rogers, whose Boy Scoutish persona almost comes across like Marvel Comic's answer to DC's Superman. They are accompanied by the mild-mannered Dr. Bruce Banner, who when roused to anger transforms into the terrifying green behemoth known as the Hulk; Thor, the Norse god of thunder; Black Widow, a Russian superspy; and Hawkeye, a master archer and ""World's Greatest Marksman."" This eclectic crew is led by Nick Fury, director of a government military agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D that is responsible for assembling the titular Avengers to deal with crises once they become global in scale. Each of these characters is perfectly cast, from Robert Downey Jr. as the inimitably sharp-tongued Stark to Samuel L. Jackson as the sullen but gravitas-laden Fury. The standout here is almost certainly Mark Ruffalo as Banner, whose depiction of a man deftly controlling the tempest of his own emotions is memorable in its stirring poignance. Tying all of them together is a plot in which the heroes search for a MacGuffin known as the Tesseract that must be kept out of the hands of Loki, the Norse god of mischief and brother to Thor who aspires to use that device to (of course) rule the world. While the story itself is not particularly original, it is utilized to its fullest potential, keeping the narrative running at a smooth clip and causing its two-and-a-half hour running time to fly right by. All of this is spiced up by Whedon's distinctively intelligent and engaging writing style. From witty lines (Tony Stark introducing himself to Bruce Banner: ""Dr. Banner, your work is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."") to unexpected moments of physical comedy (such as a scene in which one character receives a surprising but richly deserved humiliating beating), the screenplay proves to be almost as much of a character as any of the protagonists themselves, adding levity to prevent the story from being bogged down in its own sturm und drang while maintaining the proper dramatic perspective throughout the proceedings. This isn't to say that The Avengers is without its weaknesses. While Loki is an adequately detestable villain, he hardly compares to comicdom's more legendary celluloid foes (Alfred Molina's Doctor Octavius, Heath Ledger's The Joker), and the story's intelligence is more surface than substantive, causing it to lack the thoughtfulness of The Dark Knight or philosophical layering of Watchmen. Nevertheless, The Avengers stands out as a practically perfect popcorn flick, thoroughly entertaining even the most disillusioned moviegoers (of which I am one) from the opening frame to the second post-credits scene (which I highly recommend audience members stick around to see). When it comes to the traditional type of superhero movie, it's hard to do any better.",POSITIVE

"Feb 14, 2020"," For the past few years, every product of the Marvel Comics film portfolio has been building to this. Captain America’s big screen debut was subtitled prominently as ‘The First Avenger’, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), has been popping up in post-credits scenes for years. Looking to emulate the structure and crossovers of their comics, Avengers Assemble brings together the separate franchises of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the newly recast Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), as well as previous supporting characters. Does Avengers Assemble deliver, or collapse under the burden? It’s not without its flaws, but Joss Whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film, the best Marvel-based one to date, and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots. The film opens with Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. at a facility attempting to harness an immense source of power, the Tesseract. Everything is promptly and rudely interrupted by Loki (Tom Hiddlestone), the villainous brother last seen on the big screen having a bit of a siblings tiff with his brother Thor. Making off with the Tesseract, the situation quickly spirals out of the control of us conventional mortals, and Fury looks to assemble the title ensemble in order to save Earth, or at the very least ‘avenge it’ as Downey’s Stark puts it. The tone of the film has been pitched extremely well by writer/director Whedon, who isn’t afraid to have the film’s comic roots shine through. There are often what appear to be cheese-on-toast moments in the dialogue, but fortunately the film earns itself enough good will to allow this to sit nicely within the tonal framework. In addition, the fantasy elements of the likes of Thor have been married very well with the more ‘realistic’ tech-based world of Iron Man. Even if this wasn’t the case, the verbal ripostes between the various heroes, all with their own issues and egos, often sparkles with the sort of irreverent humour and wit one would expect from Joss Whedon. As good as Christopher Nolan’s take on DC Comics’ Batman has been, this Marvel ensemble is an entirely different and more light-hearted beast. Although everyone is on generally good thespian form, especially Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki, the film predictably strains a little under the weight of four established franchises. In the end, to set everyone up for the 3rd act requires a plot development that is dependent on a certain amount of familiarity with previous Marvel films, and could feel a little forced. Additionally, new or previously peripheral characters such as Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have little time to develop as more than action fodder or eye candy. Having said this, it’s wrong to suggest it actively detracts from the film – but it is nonetheless disappointing given how Avengers Assemble exceeds elsewhere. With these minor criticisms in mind, it’s impressive that the majority of the film could work either as the distillation of the separate Marvel franchises or an introduction for the uninitiated. Certain sequences and references will feel more at home and appreciated by those who have seen the solo efforts, but the fast-paced and engaging plot keeps things bouncing along – just at the point the film could lose steam, the pace and action picks up for a truly superb closing battle. It is particularly admirable that Avengers Assemble is clearly the best big-screen depiction of the Incredible Hulk – a character that has arguably defeated a talented director in Ang Lee and (in a separate pseudo-reboot) an excellent actor in Edward Norton. Mark Ruffalo’s affable turn as the witty but uneasy Banner is underscored by edge-of-the-seat tension over his alter-ego’s eventual appearance (one close shave in his lab is especially well handled by Whedon). When the inevitable eventually happens, much improved special effects and an excellent fight sequence result in a terrific impact. Avengers Assemble is an excellent piece of blockbuster entertainment. Much has been made of the fact that blockbusters don’t need to be a brainless Michael Bay effort in order to attract an audience. Whilst ‘brainless’ is a pejorative that shouldn’t be applied to Whedon’s cornucopia of superheroes, the film certainly doesn’t aspire to PhDs in Psychology or Philosophy either. There is a lightness and wit to the character portraits presented. Whilst this means there maybe isn’t the same obvious thematic depth to the film (although there are broad strokes painted about the moral and immoral uses of technology) this is not something that it needs, or wants, to aspire to. When the characters themselves are drawn with enough depth, humour and self-awareness, and action scenes are choreographed engagingly the result is every bit as good. There are legs in the old-fashioned blockbuster yet. The superhero film doesn’t need to be a gritty reboot in order to feel fresh. With the phenomenal rise of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films, the Marvel stable had to deliver something excellent but genuinely different in Avengers Assemble and with Joss Whedon behind the camera they have done so. Thanks to the excellent combination of humour, characters, action and intensity Avengers Assemble is the best Marvel film yet.",POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020"," “Marvel’s The Avengers” is a comic book lover’s ultimate fantasy: witnessing several favorite superheroes together, fighting evil and of course, all while saving mankind from destruction. Yes, it’s a superhero ‘all-star’ meet up, of sorts, starring Robert Downy Jr. as Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. All, thankfully, sharing equal screen time in a first rate, comical, non-stop action packed film with a bit of ‘Transformers’ scattered throughout. The former film franchises of four heroes provided their introduction to cinema fans who may not have been familiar with the comic books, thus delivering an extra punch – familiarity with their personas. Many know the Hulk from the 1978 TV series and other major films starring Eric Bana and Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk. I’m pleased to reveal that ‘Avengers’ take on the Hulk is my favorite so far; he’s the biggest Hulk yet, and overshadows all in size, scope and strength. Even though Black Widow and Hawkeye are less known, director and co/writer Joss Whedon (a self professed comic book fan) does a fine job of developing each. Whedon’s writing credits are impressive, “Toy Story,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Cabin in the Woods,” to name a few. His direction here is pitch perfect, as each superhero’s personality is developed not only through actions but also smart dialogue, something generally lacking in action films. The glib comedic tone is consistent throughout, never appearing silly or contrived. We believe all that is happening – these super heroes are essentially part of the world’s landscape. Even though we know they aren’t real, in this film they emphatically are, as so much care and detail have gone into their credibility. A grandiose storyline is deep-seated in humanity that’s ‘super cool’ and ‘super fun’ for action fans and the archetypal comic book fan. ‘Avengers’ covers both and, unquestionably, delivers. The balancing act of the characters and their distinctive personas is certainly a dubious feat here, requiring much perception and forethought to pull off. The premise centers on six super heroes who are fetched by S.H. I. E.L.D.’s director, Nick Fury, played convincingly by an eye-patched, Samuel L. Jackson. Fury gathers the heroes because Thor’s evil brother, the whiny god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who suffers from a ‘dad liked you best’ complex, has compremised the powerful cosmic cube, the Tesseract. Loki’s digs are the interstellar world of Asgard, making his only access to earth through a space wormhole. Frankly, the reason for the ‘all-star superhero’ meet-up doesn’t really matter so much; the interactions between the heroes themselves are at the heart of this tale. Comically, when the superheroes are assembled, they check each other out through dialogue and exhibiting their physical attributes. The match-up creates very silly scenes of who can out-do the other. Downey’s Iron Man states out of the gate: “I’m Iron Man and, no offense, but apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed and I don’t play well with others.” The banter and eye-popping special effects are what makes this film tick. All I can say is, “Hold on to your popcorn as you’re in for a rip-roaring, roller coaster of a ride in this spectacle that’s perfect for ages ten and above.” The film’s rating of PG-13 is due to the violence and somewhat frightening situations, which parents can ascertain for their own youngsters. Cast: Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts).",POSITIVE
"Dec 15, 2019"," (Welcome to Road to Endgame, where we revisit all 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ask, ""How did we get here?"" In this edition: The Avengers changed studio filmmaking, though not before ticking off The Pentagon.)The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. Few films before or since have resulted in such widespread global celebration, something even the film's third sequel, Avengers: Endgame, may or may not match. Only time will tell, but time has been kind to Marvel's first culmination, despite the series overall fabric favouring entertainment over meaning in the realm of political outlook.The film changed the way movies were made and watched, affecting everything from industry goals to the mainstream visibility of fandom and ""nerd culture."" Its lasting legacy isn't just the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe, which drops its twenty-second entry into theatres soon – its impact can also be felt in almost every other studio's failed shared-universes. It stands to reason that Marvel was ahead of the creative curve even before its purchase by Disney in 2009. Kevin Feige & co. have been doing it right before anyone else was doing it at all.While this plan understandably seemed in doubt during its buildup, Marvel Studios marked its arrival with unprecedented financial success, crystalizing on-screen during one specific moment... You know the one. You remember seeing the Avengers assemble for first time, as the camera circles around them and Alan Silvestri's musical theme reaches its crescendo. You may even remember cheering or applauding.The film was shot in a narrower (""taller"") aspect ratio — 1.85:1, compared to the other films' 2.39 and 2.35 — to accommodate the eight-foot-tall Hulk in group shots where in the team occupied the entire frame. Run a quick search on YouTube, and you're likely to find dozens of videos capturing live audience reactions to this climactic scene, from all over the globe and in more languages than you knew the film was even dubbed into.What's more, this now-iconic shot is sandwiched between two other major moments, each of which hits similar highs in quick succession. On one side, the Hulk's ""I'm always angry"" and his transformation before punching an enormous Leviathan. On the other, Captain America's order of ""Hulk? Smash!"" after which the Hulk lets loose on alien invaders. It was clear from this one-two-three punch, and the ensuing rapturous response, that the Marvel party wasn't going to stop.What's sometimes forgotten, however, is that this sequence arrives nearly two hours into the film.The Avengers is one of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character. The whole film is built around this rousing sequence, answering the looming question asked by both the film, and by the audience: after a six-year buildup, can these disparate elements come together to become greater than the sum of their parts? The answer was a resounding ""Yes,"" and what followed was Marvel's victory lap, an explosive payoff to an entire movie's worth of character dynamics and interwoven themes (a feat that was replicated in Avengers: Age of Ultron). The Avengers is also the first Marvel movie that takes place on an Earth significantly different from our own. The settings in prior entries felt distinctly familiar, from caves to factories to tiny towns. Here, the pretense that Marvel's superheroes exist in a ""realistic"" universe was finally done away with. The world of The Avengers is, unequivocally, the future of the series' fantasy World War II, where Nazi factions used an Infinity Stone to build weapons of mass destruction (Unfortunately, this through-line also results in its own complications, since the mal-formed politics of Captain America: The First Avenger carry over as well).In prior films, superheroes were unique elements in otherwise normal surroundings. In The Avengers, nearly an hour of the film takes place on an floating, invisible aircraft carrier transporting magically-powered weapons, the same weapons Captain America once tried to get out of the hands of H.Y.D.R.A. (Red Skull's Diet Nazis). This is a world where some far-off, unseen villain in space grants Loki mystical objects — we now know all about Thanos' plan — and it's a world where shadowy international councils have become necessary, now that monsters roam the streets and Gods fly through the skies.However, the film isn't as far removed from ""real world"" concerns as this setting suggests. If anything, The Avengers is about fantasy clashing with reality to see which one wins out. Late into the film's final act, after the Avengers have nearly fallen to alien invaders, the World Council makes an enormous decision. It chooses to sacrifice millions of lives in order to save billions, sending a nuclear warhead straight for New York. It's the kind of dark turn you'd expect from a story like Watchmen, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1986 comic classic that transplanted superheroes into a supposedly ""realistic"" setting. But the major difference between Watchmen and The Avengers — and thus, the difference in their outcomes — is the function of their characters.Watchmen sees our worst selves — violent, egomaniacal, detached — being granted untold powers. The fantasy of The Avengers however, isn't just that superheroes exist in concept, but rather, that these specific kinds of people exist. People like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who are willing to put everything on the line, going above-and-beyond to save everyone they can.The dilemma Captain America faced during World War II becomes a dilemma for all the Avengers to overcome. No matter the scenario, they aren't willing to trade lives. Not in this film, not in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and not in Avengers: Infinity War. While this unwillingness to compromise is put to the test in future films, it's presented in The Avengers as a bright alternative to the darkest parts of our reality, where men in the shadows order airstrikes without care for collateral damage, all for ""the greater good.""In depicting U.S. fighter planes being ordered to attack Manhattan, the film not only aligns The World Council's methods with that of H.Y.D.R.A. in Captain America: The First Avenger, but with the spectre of global terrorism in a post-9/11 word. A bold conflation, at least on the surface, though one muddled by the fact that this film, like Iron Man and Iron Man 2 before it (and Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel since), sought U.S. military funding.The Avengers was almost government propaganda, and it still retains some of this DNA. Marvel films like Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel were made with U.S. military assistance, and thus, with military-approved scripts, making them government propaganda. The Avengers however, was actually turned down during its production, because The Pentagon couldn't reconcile the idea of the U.S. military answering to a higher authority. Granted, the production was lent Humvees and other ground equipment regardless (the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets in the film were digitally rendered) so the conundrum here vis-à-vis The Avengers' place as propaganda is noteworthy.On one hand, the production most certainly set out to appease the powers that be. The World Council, a fictional consortium of international leaders, embodied authoritarian overreach despite American military equipment being employed to bomb American citizens. America itself is never really framed with any military outlook, let alone one that could be held accountable.On the other, one might argue that The Avengers is able to side-step the propaganda issue given that it eschews real-world militarism, unlike its Earth-bound predecessors. The fighter jet sent to bomb Manhattan, while representative of U.S. military equipment, is ordered by an organization whose reach supersedes America's (the council members aren't given national designations until later in the series), so it's enough of a fantasy that the propaganda question doesn't really matter.It's a double-edged sword, narratively speaking. The reluctance to contextualize America's place in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy turned the Pentagon off subsidizing the film; the U.S. military could not, given its relative absence in the story, be presented as heroic. And yet The World Council, a fictitious entity whose only real-world counterpart is the distinctly non-militaristic United Nations, is presented as villainous, without ever framing America's place in its ranks, despite S.H.I.E.L.D. being coded American through-and-through. In effect, the U.S. military can't be presented as having questionable motives either.At best, this incidental political apathy is an upgrade from prior entries like Iron Man, in which U.S. military occupation is the status-quo, but its ill-effects originate elsewhere. At worst, it's the series' continued failure to say anything of consequence, hinting at statements about power without ever daring to actually make them. The state of this world is two-fold, torn between reality and fantasy, and the Avengers must overcome this discrepancy in order to save the day. In other words, in order to make the film entertaining.On one hand, suited men with obscured faces order airstrikes to be carried out with familiar, grey military machinery, piloted by anonymous soldiers. On the other, our larger-than-life heroes, with all their strengths and smarts and colourful garb, have been locked out of the biggest scientific advancements of the 21st century. The Tesseract is a source of unlimited energy. In World War II, H.Y.D.R.A. used it to make weapons. In 2012, S.H.I.E.L.D. uses it for the same purpose, rather than bringing minds like Bruce Banner and Tony Stark on board to further their work in medicine and clean energy.""War isn't won by sentiment,"" the World Council tells Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who responds: ""No. It's won by soldiers"" before recruiting Steve Rogers. This exchange echoes Captain America: The First Avenger, wherein Col. Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) tells Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tuccy) that war isn't won by kindness, but by guts, before recruiting Rogers' more malleable peer, Private Gilmore Hodge (Lex Shrapnel). In this moment in The Avengers, all Fury seems to want is someone who'll follow orders. Rogers is told the Allies won World War II, but he knows something is amiss: ""They didn't say what we lost.""What was lost, it would seem, was conscience. S.H.I.E.L.D., now divorced from America in the narrative, recycles H.Y.D.R.A.'s plans. The U.S. government employing Nazi tactics would have made for a more challenging story (and a realistic one, given America's hiring of Nazi personnel after World War II, something Captain America: The Winter Soldier even touches on), though one can hardly blame four-quadrant entertainment for stepping into the realm of fantasy. However, despite the continued separation of H.Y.D.R.A. from Nazi ideology, this setup functions well enough from a character standpoint, especially in how it creates conflict between two of its leads. Fury & co. are working on bigger, more destructive devices than the ones dropped on Japan. Upon discovering these secret weapons, Steve ""We have orders, we should follow them"" Rogers decides he can no longer follow blindly. While questioning his own commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers also questions Tony Stark's commitment to the mission. Stark is a man who tries to think his way out of every situation, claiming he'd ""cut the wire"" rather than laying down on it for anyone else, the way Rogers would, and has in the past.Stark, at this point in the series, thinks mostly of himself. He builds monuments unto his own image, touching the skies with buildings bearing his name. In fact, he only figures out Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) plan once he has his narcissism reflected back to him by the murderous demigod, who plants his flag on Stark's skyscraper for all the world to see.While Steve Rogers' arc in this film forms a bridge between entries (The Winter Soldier builds on his newfound skepticism), The Avengers concludes a major part of Tony Stark's story, in which he finally attempts to fight for something greater than himself. It also sets into motion the next phase of his life, in which he fails, repeatedly, to figure out the path to doing so. Instead, Stark creates newer, bigger problems in the process, escalations that Rogers must eventually deal with.Despite the tensions between them, the two men also become linked by their experiences in a way few that other characters are. Stark's major turn in The Avengers involves flying through a wormhole. It's rather traumatic, something Iron Man 3 eventually tackles head on. In flying a weapon of mass destruction away from New York, Stark takes the same ""one-way trip"" Rogers was forced to decades earlier: a willing suicide mission, as he tries to contact the woman he loves (Stark survives, albeit barely).Rogers and Stark butting heads over loyalties is fun to watch, but the film's most enjoyable element, ironically, happens to be the character who mentions trying to kill himself while being cursed with the strength to survive: The Incredible Hulk. Something The Avengers understood about the Hulk, which neither of his prior solo outings managed to capture, is that he's fun. It seems so simple in retrospect: a big green monster smashing disposable villains is perfect popcorn entertainment. Both moments on either side of the Avengers assembling are Hulk-centric action beats, and regardless of whether the ""I'm always angry"" line fits his narrative, it became instantly iconic because of what followed.Is Bruce Banner always angry? Mark Ruffalo certainly brings a nervous energy to him, but his actual anger is never the focus of his story. It's unfortunate that no Marvel film has explored such a fundamental part of the character, but what we get in The Avengers is an arguably superior version of his arc in The Incredible Hulk, a story in which Banner, at least nominally, learns to embrace the monster within.Dr. Banner resents the Hulk. It prevents him from living a normal life, a regret he expresses to Natasha Romanoff while rocking an empty crib (a thread that continues in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Banner tries to steer clear of anything that might turn him mean and green. It's been a year since his last incident, so having his isolation intruded upon understandably upsets him. Tony Stark is fascinated by Banner, but the doctor believes no good can come of the Hulk, despite Stark's insistence on him having a higher purpose.When Banner first transforms in the film, it's out of his control. His face, mid-transition, is stamped with fear — specifically, the fear of what he might do to Romanoff. After this, the Hulk is presented much as he was in his The Incredible Hulk: in shadow, like a monster waiting to wreak havoc. He even chases Romanoff while knocking down walls, recalling the first appearance of Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger in Iron Man as he chases Pepper Potts.This Hulk ought to be a villain. He's trapped in a cage of Banner's making, and letting him out unwillingly has disastrous consequences. Letting him out intentionally, however, is a different story. It's Banner embracing everything he is on the inside, ""always angry"" or not. He uses this emotional momentum to take down a space serpent, before leaping up the side of a building and smacking aliens into walls. Banner doesn't just embrace the monster's anger; his smile before he leaps to cause more mayhem shows just how much he enjoys being the Hulk. By giving in to his baser instincts, the mayhem becomes fun for audiences too.By the end, the Hulk even saves Tony Stark from falling to his death. It's a moment that builds directly upon Banner's story, and it's the first time we see the Hulk use his powers for something other than destruction. A higher purpose indeed. At one end of the spectrum we have Thor and Loki, figures of myth and legend who have the powers of Gods. At the other, we have Hawkeye/Clint Barton and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, assassins who use guns and arrows. The latter duo ought to have no place within a cosmic sci-fi film. In fact, they replace superpowered heroes The Wasp and Ant-Man from the original Avengers comics. Yet it's this very dynamic, the contrast in the genres to which they belong, that makes all four characters — Thor, Loki, Hawkeye and Widow — feel narratively vital.They represent the extremes within which this world operates. The Asgardian princes embody the operatic grandeur of a story of armoured aliens and magical kingdoms. Barton and Romanoff however, ground the film in a human perspective, reflecting the real-world effects of super-powered battles.By this point in the series, Thor and Loki's arcs are, admittedly, at a standstill. Their story here, much like Captain America's story, is connective tissue between entries. Their main function however, is fleshing out what this mish-mash setting feels like, and their interactions with ""realistic"" elements like Hawkeye and Widow help dramatize this world's fabric.A spy working from the shadows, Romanoff is one of the team's most surprising members. She fights shoulder to shoulder with the Avengers, not only to escape her bloody past, but to atone for it. She's also a foil to Hawkeye, who's hasn't yet had to contend with the kind of guilt Romanoff lives with. If anything, Barton's conscience is clear, having rescued Romanoff when he was sent to kill her, but more recent events have forced him (literally, via Loki's mind control) to take innocent lives.""Don't do that to yourself,"" Romanoff tells Barton, when he asks how many people he's killed. Romanoff is familiar with the emotional consequences of being a killer — another element carried over into Avengers: Age of Ultron — her very reason for joining the Avengers. Neither Black Widow nor Hawkeye take narrative precedence by any means, but they flesh out the human stakes of this conflict in a way that endangering abstract billions no longer does at this point in blockbuster history.Some say these characters are wasted in the film; I disagree, and not just because they get their own stellar action beats. Thor, after a solo entry in which he faces up to his warmongering (at least in theory), finally accepts that Asgardians may not be much better than humans. He likens his brother, and thus himself, to mystical creatures that destroy everything in their path, a perspective that plays a vital role in the Avengers' sequel.Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye, much like Bruce Banner, see themselves as monsters with destructive capabilities. That's four out of the six Avengers, people who according to Loki ""lie and kill in the service of liars and killers."" He's not wrong, which is exactly why the camera circling around the team in their moment of heroism works as well as it does.It's the beginning of the Avengers becoming more than their pasts. 
In fighting the alien invasion, the Avengers are also out to prove they can be more than what they appear to be. More than a group of squabbling misfits in close proximity — something Loki sought to take full advantage of with his intentional capture — and more than just hired guns in service of two-faced regimes. It's after they're torn apart on the Helicarrier that they have to work towards being more, hesitating to lift their hammers and bows and shields, before doing what needs to be done.They need to prove they're more than just an archer forced to kill against his will, an assassin with red in her ledger, a monster who puts people in danger, an unruly brute with a hammer, a soldier following orders and a man who fights for himself. It's that shot of the Avengers assembling that tells us these characters may, in fact, be able to work together and become something more. Not long after, an unbroken, fluid take moving across New York City proves it definitively, a shot in which we see the Avengers working in tandem to take down the invading forces.The Avengers don't kill Loki, as he claims they're wont to do. Instead, they prove him wrong by capturing him again, despite this leading to their downfall earlier in the film. It's an old-fashioned notion, but as Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) puts it, ""People might just need a little old-fashioned.""The Avengers were brought together to transcend barriers of culture and language. The film's closing moments feature a montage of worldwide reactions to their antics; some are critical of the Avengers' role in society, while others celebrate these modern icons and their awe-inspiring spectacle.

"Dec 10, 2019","Overall, Marvel's Avengers Assemble is fun, funny and downright entertaining. Joss Whedon did good.",POSITIVE
"Nov 8, 2019"," [xrr rating=1.75/5]My biggest fear going into The Avengers, the supposed culmination of the barrage of Marvel Universe comic book movies that have been bombarding us the past few summers, was that it would be a Frankenstein-pastiche of characters fighting for screen time and therefore reducing each superhero’s part into a mere cameo. While that preemptive fear was allayed by generous screen time for Iron Man, Captain America and company, writers Joss Whedon (who also directed) and Zak Penn have transgressed in a way I couldn’t have imagined before I witnessed it with my own eyes: they made The Avengers very, very boring. It is immaterial whether or not I read comics because as a film, The Avengers filled me with ennui, not a good sensation for a popcorn movie loaded with explosions, creatures from another dimension and a green behemoth determined to smash everything in sight. Sure, The Avengers accomplishes everything you would expect in a comics movie with the added spicy pizzazz of a Whedon script. But shouldn’t a movie that costs millions to make reach for the stars rather than be merely serviceable? That’s a huge letdown. Whedon and Penn decide to devote much of their script to the growing pains associated with the formation of the Avengers, wringing schmaltz from an age-old golden rule of team work. Egos clash, muscles ripple, rivals bristle but eventually the Avengers figure out that working together rather than against one another is the key. Pretty fucking stupid when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a cadre of inter-planetary goons are threatening to destroy the Earth. But hey, it gives Whedon an opportunity to drum up superhero on superhero fighting porn as Thor fights the Hulk and Iron Man fights Thor and Nick Fury fights Hawkeye. It’s the most expensive version of Marvel Vs. Capcom ever produced but even less exciting than watching your little brother play on your crappy 12” television. So what’s my problem? There is absolutely nothing at stake here. The Avengers picks up the threads from a handful of prior films and tries to create a reason to bring all these superhero together in one place (besides make a shit-ton of money for Marvel and Disney). We all know that Whedon is supremely talented when the sky’s the limit. Hell, look at The Cabin in the Woods or Serenity to see what the man can do when his imagination runs amuck. But with The Avengers he is hamstrung and leaves us with a story that lacks not only gravitas but no human element whatsoever. Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne (often) succeed in their filmic incarnations because there is something tragic and human in their narrative arcs. In this rancid amalgam we get nothing but explosions and long, boring passages filled with sermonizing and stale dialogue that makes the most recent Star Wars trilogy read like eloquent theater. So what is the gossamer of a story about? Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles the Avengers after the banished Loki steals the Tesseract, a glowing cube of energy that will allow him to open a portal and destroy the Earth. So Fury calls in Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the thawed-out Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, stepping in for Edward Norton) to join the fight against the banished Asgardian and his minions. While the action sequences are dull, the film’s extended sections where Whedon tries to explain each and every backstory without pandering to the demographic too much feels interminable. Whedon must walk a tightrope of not saying too much (and thus alienating the fan boys) and saying too little (wiping out the folks who don’t know the difference between Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner). Also, I hate to say it but Loki really isn’t a very interesting villain. With all of these factors working against him, Whedon turned out reams of dialogue that not only feels flat but sucks the living joy out of a picture that should be about thrilling its audience. However, I think the problem is inherent in the format. Can comic books really successfully translate into a film, especially one that packs in a lot of characters? Sure, you can count the good ones (Burton’s Batman, Nolan’s Dark Knight films, the second Spider-Man feature) but often times comic book movies are lifeless or downright silly. That is because comic book writers can suspend the drama and stretch it out over multiple issues, creating a story arc that can be both exciting and resonant. Think of the stories by Chris Claremont and Peter David and how they take multiple issues to sustain. In a movie like The Avengers, you have to cram everything into two hours, removing any sort of true peril to the characters or any real reason to care. It would have taken balls to end with a frozen Han Solo moment. But it didn’t. While researching for this article I found evidence of sequels to Thor, Captain America and Iron Man all in the works. Maybe there is one thing these films have in common with the comics industry. They keep going and going, no matter how shitty the story. As long as someone keeps paying for it, you can rest assured we will see superhero films during the summer. And if that doesn’t work, they will reboot the idea two years later.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 11, 2019"," The new CIA-rehab thriller, as a genre, is anticonspiracy. Unlike the domestic spy thriller of the 1970s, today’s CIA apologist thriller does not reveal how official truth is an illusion, an elaborate cover-up constructed to hide abuses of power. Instead, the newer, sunnier CIA thriller shows how failure in the intelligence community is merely the result of human error. Overthrowing the democratically elected Mosaddegh government in Iran in 1953, for instance, and installing a corrupt puppet government headed by an absolute ruler, is something that could have happened to anyone. Years later there’s a little blowback. Sadly, someone from the Agency has to pick up the pieces. Ben Affleck’s Argo shows that even movies that don’t exist are more fun, and possibly more real, than the struggle of a nation. Argo is more like a 1970s heist movie than a paranoid espionage film. If it were a Robert Redford ’70s movie, it would be The Hot Rock, not Three Days of the Condor. Disguising themselves as a film crew allows the cast of Argo to put one over on Iranians who are by turns wily and childish. Confronted by cartoon storyboards for the fake movie (supposedly drawn by Jack Kirby, they look more like the placemats in a Big Boy restaurant), Iranian guards react with delight when one member of the fake crew makes whooshing sounds and jet-plane hand motions. Since this is the exact post–Star Wars position American filmgoers have been put in for decades—in fact beginning around the same time as the Iranian hostage crisis—it’s a little unnerving to find Iranian soldiers standing in for the American audience like that. Argo puts into practice the cinema-meets-military theories of Paul Virilio in an unpredictable way. We see the CIA as a creator of fantasy here, but that’s all to the good: American lives are saved, no one gets hurt. Our enemies are fooled, not killed. The desire to believe in the movies, Affleck tells us, is universal. Happy endings depend on the success of the ruse, even when the ruse has geopolitical implications. Argo is a much better film than the previous two Affleck directed, and his performance in it is low-key and self-effacing. The entire cast is good, including Clea DuVall in black glasses and black hair, here at least doing something worthy of her talent, and Adrienne Barbeau, wandering through the Hollywood script-reading scene as a cheeseball actress and producer’s ex-wife. It’s noteworthy that the selection and reading of a film script plays such an important role in Argo, even if the whole point is that the script is derivative and lousy. That’s another comment on the era in which Argo takes place. The existence of Argo, which could not have been made back then because its story was classified by the CIA, is more proof that that era is over, historical. Part of the fascination in watching Argo is wondering whether this caper could work today. The friendlier, humanized CIA of the Carter Era this film asks us to trust relies on fake mustaches, not enhanced interrogation techniques. All Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty asks us to believe in is the brute presentation of facts. Whether or not the film is a torture film is therefore, the film implies, beside the point. Torture happened, the film says, and here’s how. So of course Zero Dark Thirty is a torture film, but we are expected to understand that now we are beyond the moral question of whether torture is right or wrong. The CIA got various kinds of information from torturing various people. Regardless of whether that information was good or bad, information is power. You sift, you put the pieces together, just like the Iranian schoolchildren in Argo put photographs back together from documents the US Embassy shredded in Tehran. Eventually you get a clear picture and if you’re lucky human error doesn’t enter into it and you are allowed to act on what you’ve learned and kill the guy you need to kill. The film is in three parts. Part One: Torture. Part Two: Intelligence. Part Three: Execution. Each is a separate film that struggles between being quality television and something more cinematic, defined by Jessica Chastain’s film-hero poker face and go-it-alone refusal to succumb to backstory, or do anything but work, grimly, at her job. Chastain’s Maya, we later learned from news stories about the film, is a composite character meant to represent the hard work done by many women in the CIA in its effort to find and kill bin Laden. At the same time, she stands for every American woman today, who can succeed if she works day and night, if she stares into her computer for as long as it takes, if she makes the mean face but doesn’t complain when her boss doesn’t understand she’s right, and is willing to relocate. Bigelow wrote a piece for the Los Angeles Times in which she explained that when it comes to torture in Zero Dark Thirty, “depiction is not endorsement.” But as always in the movies, the problem is not in the what but the how. How torture is depicted is more important than that it is depicted. Since Bigelow used to work for Semiotext(e) back in the day, maybe some French film criticism will come in handy here. In 1961, Jacques Rivette, writing on the 1959 Gillo Pontecorvo film Kapò, which is about the inmates of a concentration camp, singled out one shot that ended on the hand of a character played by Emmanuelle Riva (Emmanuelle Riva who stars in Amour) as she died on an electrified barbed-wire fence. To Rivette, the preciosity of this shot was contemptible. Earlier in the piece, Rivette noted that this mixture of easy “realism” and spectacle was inherently immoral, because “that which [the filmmaker] dares present as ‘reality’ is physically tolerable for the viewer . . . but ultimately not intolerable. . . . At the same time everyone unknowingly becomes accustomed to the horror, which little by little is accepted by morality, and will quickly become part of the mental landscape of modern man; who, the next time, will be able to be surprised or irritated at that which will in effect have ceased to be shocking?” (The translation is David Phelps’s and Jeremi Szaniawski’s.) This is the exact effect of the torture in Zero Dark Thirty. In 1983 Kathryn Bigelow played a feminist revolutionary working for a newspaper in Lizzie Borden’s film Born in Flames, which imagines a socialist America and ends with a bombing at the World Trade Center. Questions of depiction come down to whose side you are on. If that seems too simple, it is no simpler than saying that “depiction is not endorsement,” an evasive notion that lets any film director off the hook entirely, every time. After the “firsthand account” of torture in Zero Dark Thirty, it is hard not to conclude that Bigelow, like Maya, is working for the Man. James Bond has always been the Man, that is the whole point of James Bond movies. Skyfall is a movie for a confused era, a digital, data-driven era, where killing is done by remote control. At first the film seems to admit it no longer makes sense to keep Bond on the payroll in this new world. The film starts with a radical move: Bond is shot and killed by another agent who happens to be a black woman (Naomie Harris). The story of Skyfall is the story of this character. First she kills Bond. Later she seduces him but is thrown over for an Asian temptress. She comes back at the end as the new Miss Moneypenny, Bond’s boss’s secretary, whose role is to lust after Bond but never get him, an underling he constantly teases. She wears a tight dress and sits in an office looking at Bond with big eyes while admitting she wasn’t really cut out for fieldwork in the first place—she accidentally shot him, after all! So much for empowerment. The theme of Skyfall is that the world must remain safe for white Englishmen to run around shooting people who aren’t white and English. The film ends in Scotland, the ancestral home of Bond and the emotional heart of the upper-class Great Britain Orwell identified in “Such, Such Were the Joys,” a domain of shotgun blasts and heritage-brand hunting togs, where large stags still wander, imperiously and symbolically, like they did in The Queen, with Helen Mirren, in 2006. It is here that the film’s one good moment emerges, as Daniel Craig’s Bond and Javier Bardem’s pan-ethnic (but paradoxically ultra-pale) villain chase each other across the moors until Bardem, exasperated, needles him: “Do you see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond? All this jumping and fighting, it’s exhausting.” Recruited into the secret agent game by Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., American superheroes in The Avengers fight to protect New York from total destruction. It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it. This apocalypse comes in the form not of climate change, the real menace to New York we witnessed firsthand in 2012, but in the form of mechanized aliens who must be stand-ins for our new enemies, the Chinese, because when they attack it looks like the sky is shitting endless orders of steamed whole fish. Tom Hooper directs every scene and composes every shot in this bloated, reactionary musical as if he were trying to express a new idea every time any actor moves a fraction of an inch. At the same time, this version of Les Misérables depends on absolute familiarity with the songs from the stage musical to produce the tears that are its reason for existing. Hugh Jackman’s performance eventually moves even the uninitiated to cry, not because he is so moving—often he sounds like Walter Brennan singing “Old Rivers”—but because he had to endure so much just so two insufferable teenagers could get married. Hooper’s approach to revolution in the streets is to telegraph how doomed it is from the start, but also to show that it is completely justified—every character in the film is so exploited that he or she is a clear argument for immediate radical change. This sickly paradox puts the viewer on the side of getting the inevitable over with. Long before a little boy (Daniel Huttlestone), the mascot of the revolution, is killed by soldiers, his status as the most annoying Cockney urchin in the history of cinema made me want to see Russell Crowe’s Javert beat him to death with Leonardo DiCaprio’s hammer from Django Unchained. Daniel Day-Lewis’s animatronic performance in Spielberg’s film underscores how Abraham Lincoln is like E.T., appearing among human beings to make things right before going back to the mysterious place he came from. He is also the perfect contemporary dad, reading to his little son about bugs while Congress debates the Thirteenth Amendment. Lincoln performed the important function of getting Americans to think about the terrible legacy of slavery in this country, and to reevaluate the influence of the South on national affairs. It is a political movie in every way, and has a science-fiction aspect: it posits white people as alien oppressors. White people are so white in Lincoln, which photographs them as grayish and pale under a winter sun, that sometimes it testifies to the lack of tanning salons in Washington DC in 1865. Day-Lewis’s pronunciation of the word righteous as “right-ee-ous” left an indelible mark on me, and it is no doubt historically accurate. But as someone from a small town near Hartford, I resent the film for claiming that the abolitionist Congressional representatives from Connecticut voted against the amendment to end slavery. That bothered me when I saw the film, but I never bothered to check whether it was true, and when Maureen Dowd wrote in her Times column that it wasn’t, and that Tony Kushner dismissed his mistake by equating it to showing Lincoln wearing blue socks instead of green socks, I became doubly annoyed, because now I was in the position of defending a state I’d be happy never to see again and admitting I’d learned something from Maureen Dowd. There’s another thing Kushner left out of his screenplay that would have been good to include. When Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, a Native American colonel on Grant’s staff named Ely S. Parker was there, too. Parker, who is played in Lincoln by Asa-Luke Twocrow, drafted and wrote by hand the terms of surrender delivered to Lee, and in the film we see him on the porch with Grant as Lee approaches. This is not in the film, but when Lee saw Parker, he thought he was black, and made some remark to that effect, which he had to apologize for when told Parker was a Seneca Indian. “Well,” said Lee. “I am glad to see one real American here.” Parker responded by pointing out,  “We are all Americans, sir.” Not including this great moment implies that there was something Spielberg and Kushner thought was too corny for this film. Django Unchained is not so much the evil twin of the saintly Lincoln as its nasty, more clever kid brother, fighting the favorite for recognition, acting out. If I prefer it to Lincoln it’s because I prefer the Tarantinian project, flaws and all, to Steven Spielberg’s entire career. Lincoln may be the culmination of the Spielberg–Lucas reimagining of the American cinema as family entertainment, a transcendent work beyond the blockbuster form that reimagines the official national myth of an official national father for current and future generations. Tarantino is more interested in a pre-consolidated cinema that predates Spielberg, in which national myths were put to use in tawdry, violent, and grandiloquent ways, and myth was open to interpretation by genre filmmakers outside the US. So however Tarantino has failed the actual history of slavery in the United States, the way he has opened it up for discussion strikes me as far more remarkable than the storybook of Spielberg’s Lincoln, which closes with a thump and sends us off to bed. People forget how sick, not anemic but twisted and ugly, the cinema had become before Spielberg and Lucas made movie theaters safe for families again. Tarantino looks to the minor glories of that era, which were amoral and provocative and not designed to last forever on any storage medium other than film. Maybe if you were never dragged by an adult to see an end-of-Hollywood/end-of-America movie like Hustle, with Burt Reynolds and Catherine Deneuve, you can’t truly understand how warped it was. That film came out in 1975, the same year as Mandingo, a repellent, brutal film about slavery that is a touchstone for Tarantino. Spaghetti westerns questioned the underpinnings of civilization. They examined sick societies through the eyes of tight-lipped, one-dimensional antiheroes surrounded by manic, cruel, and jaded characters who played terminal games of cat-and-mouse and growled dubbed insults at each other. The tense dinner scene at the Candyland plantation in Django Unchained captures their tone. When Christoph Waltz, as Dr. King Schultz, demands that the harpist sitting behind him stop playing Beethoven, Tarantino shows us the hypocritical European elegance spaghetti westerns layered underneath their operatic gunfights. That scene, the one at the beginning with Schultz holding his lantern looking for an honest man, and the blood on the cotton, are as original as moments in Leone or Corbucci. Certain liberal-minded film critics judged Beasts of the Southern Wild harshly, were outraged by it, describing it as racist, shamelessly manipulative, and like advertising. That, putting it mildly, is a stretch. The film is such a convincing, fully realized, and overpowering achievement that begrudging its popular and artistic success is feckless. The film understands an America that is divorced from social services and beset by environmental collapse, but understands those things at the level of fable. It’s not a documentary of Katrina and Louisiana any more than The Wizard of Oz was a documentary of the Dust Bowl and Kansas, and expecting it to reflect the exact political reality of its time, or any kind of progressive politics, is like hating The Wizard of Oz because it’s not propaganda for the New Deal. Quvenzhané Wallis is Beasts’ Judy Garland, and her narration is as emotional and devastating as Garland singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Her hopes for the future and for the people in her community are no different from Garland’s at the end of The Wizard of Oz. That’s not a crime, and she’s not running for office. Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock convinces us that he is not Anthony Hopkins without convincing us that the lumpy man he is playing is Alfred Hitchcock. His portrayal lacks the sly charm of Hitchcock’s TV introductions and seems overly interested in telling us Hitchcock was sad and weird. It does succeed in reminding us that there was a time when film directors had different body types, weren’t all at least six-foot-three, didn’t go to the gym, and didn’t all wear sweaters with zippers. Hitchcock also does two other noteworthy disservices to the master. One is that it eliminates his daughter from his marriage to Alma Reville (Helen Mirren). Since Patricia Hitchcock has an acting part in Psycho, which this film details the making of, that is a pointed omission designed to further question Hitchcock’s marriage. The second is that every time Hitchcock takes a drink—and this film has him drinking wine and scotch frequently, including on the set—the soundtrack accompanies his imbibing with impolite slurping sounds. Hopkins’s prosthetic lips seem wine-stained throughout. I’ve read a few Hitchcock biographies, some of which impugn him mightily, but I don’t recall reading this fastidious man was a slurper. This low-key but agitated antiauthoritarian film often comes off like a buddy movie about two very different men who like to get together to drink paint thinner and antifreeze. The Master is puzzling at all times, ignoring our desire to decipher it as it’s unspooling (if you saw it on film). It creates a weird mood, as if in a dream The Shining got mixed in with Altman’s Popeye. It keeps verging on the horrible and the cartoonish without quite getting to either. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance successfully combines Marlon Brando with Moe Howard, while Philip Seymour Hoffman looks on, occasionally getting irritated but indulging him all the same. Amy Adams, as Hoffman’s Lady Macbeth-ish wife, puts the brakes on the Phoenix–Hoffman relationship by masturbating Hoffman in front of a bathroom sink and uttering threatening, nonexplanatory lines like, “This is something you do for a billion years or not at all.” When Hoffman sings the entirety of the song “Slow Boat to China” to Phoenix, it’s clear the film is ending and that Phoenix will now be free of his demons, but why “Slow Boat to China”? Because Phoenix was in the navy in World War II? Because they met on Hoffman’s boat? Because the intense, repetitive, ad hoc, and perhaps meaningless process Hoffman has put Phoenix through has “melted his heart of stone”? Flight is an excellent, hard-hitting, sleazy movie about an alcoholic airline pilot (Denzel Washington, really great here) who, hungover and right after surreptitiously downing three vodka nips, crash-lands a malfunctioning plane during a storm, saving everyone onboard except the flight attendant (Nadine Velazquez) he’d spent the night with. It is so good, except for the syrupy last ten minutes, that it is hard to believe Robert Zemeckis, who directed it, has spent the last twenty-five or so years since he made Back to the Future directing the things he’s directed. Flight contains many riveting scenes, but one, with Washington alone in a hotel room the night before he faces a hearing about the crash, is especially riveting, and does not sell out the film. Its climax comes on a shot of a nip bottle, the kind he drank on the plane, sitting on top of a mini-fridge, one of 2012’s best shots, so to speak. I went to the Sunday matinee of Life of Pi, in 3D, at the Regal Union Square Stadium 14 and paid my $18.50 to get in. Since it was Sunday morning I had stopped on the way and bought a large coffee to drink while I watched the movie. As I approached the escalator to get to the floor where the movie was playing, a ticket taker stopped me and told me I could not go in with coffee. If I wanted to see the movie, I would have to finish it before I went in or throw it out. I asked why. He said it was the theater’s policy. I suggested that since the cineplex was almost empty because it was eleven in the morning, he might just look the other way if I brought the coffee in. No way, he said, they watch me on cameras. So I went back downstairs and got my money back. Sorry, Ang Lee. That coffee was more important to me that morning than seeing a movie in 3D. Instead of seeing it, I walked over to the Strand, which is nearby, and looked at the discount books out front while I drank the coffee. I picked one up and opened it randomly, where I read something that seemed related to Life of Pi because the movie has a tiger in it. Reading it also had the virtue of being free and allowing me to drink the coffee while I read it: “Rapt/I dwell in this thorn and my claw alights/On the sweet breasts of poverty and crime.”Momentarily I considered stealing the book because it mentioned crime and I wanted to get back at the world for the movie theater’s absurd policy. I bought it, though, and that and the coffee together cost more than ten dollars less than seeing Life of Pi. Making a film featuring the music of Benjamin Britten and a biblical flood so you will get the chance to see a 12-year-old girl dancing in her underwear is a perfect example of going the long way around the barn. And the barn is the perfect color. The Impossible is too one- or two-note to succeed as a prestige film. It lacks subtext or metaphor, or any subtlety at all, and deals with climate change head on. It is a horror film about Western tourists, directed by a horror director (Juan Antonio Bayona), without any of the genre trappings of a horror film. Note one, the first half of the film, is the tsunami that struck countries on the Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea, including Thailand, where the film takes place at a pricey resort, in 2004. Note two is the aftermath of the tsunami, during which a family searches for one another across a vast, devastated landscape. Bayona’s staging of the tsunami without (seemingly without) digital effects is relentless, convincing, terrifying, non-stupid, and without Hollywood wonder. The second half features Naomi Watts, the mother, in a hospital bed, mostly unable to move, mostly unattended, and slowly dying. The film has a message: Welcome to the vacation of the future. Fans of Jacques Rivette, Carlos Saura, Robert Altman, and Alan Rudolph will appreciate Geraldine Chaplin’s out-of-nowhere appearance in The Impossible as an elegant older woman, also cast adrift by the tsunami, who briefly and somewhat enigmatically shows up to speak to one of the two lost sons. The Impossible is a more trenchant and realistic film about the future of English people in foreign countries than Skyfall. The two films should play as a double feature. The fate of African Americans in the South, the CIA, great floods, and immobilized bodies: these were the themes that got films nominated for Oscars in 2012. Michael Haneke’s crossover hit, Amour, begins with the corpse of Emmanuelle Riva, decomposing on her bed and surrounded by flowers. Through Riva, the star of Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, one of the French films from 1959 that changed everything, Haneke freezes the European art film in history, immobilizes it, while delivering a poignant film about aging and dying that will please a mainstream audience. Somehow this comes off as typical Hanekian perversity and slightly annoying “last modernist” pretentiousness. Jean-Louis Trintignant, who has worked with almost every great or even interesting European director, from Rohmer, Chabrol, and Truffaut to Kieślowski, Corbucci, and Costa-Gavras, ends the film, and with it, Haneke implies, a whole world of film, a whole era. He does it in a way that will ensure viewers unfamiliar with Haneke understand he didn’t make Amour for the Hallmark Channel. I was prepared to feel awkward while watching The Sessions, a noble film about a poet (John Hawkes) immobilized by polio who hires a sex therapist (Helen Hunt) to guide him through the first sexual encounters of his life. I was not prepared for the combination of Helen Hunt nude plus a Boston accent. The fact that the poet’s first name is Mark added to my discomfort. “Mock, Mock, it’s time to get stotted. Mock, we should stot.” It was the first time sex in a movie made me want to cover my ears. This shrill movie, which features lots of yelling, reinvents the screwball comedy for a post-collapse America by thoroughly deglamorizing its genre. Set in a lower-middle-class Philadelphia suburb, it is a Philadelphia Story in which the female lead (Jennifer Lawrence) dresses only in black, and the male lead (Bradley Cooper), no Cary Grant, works out in a garbage bag. The craziness of screwball is literalized in Silver Linings Playbook. Both characters are, to varying degrees, mentally ill, on meds, or in therapy. The story contains standard rom-com elements, but David O. Russell and cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi shoot the film in a self-consciously gritty, shaky, and underlit way that deflects any resemblance to, say, Friends with Benefits. Silver Linings Playbook is difficult to like, and too long, with a climactic dance scene that is filmically botched, which is fine with the movie because according to the plot it did not have to be good to succeed. The chatty, exasperating qualities of Cooper’s pathology, which Russell understood so well in The Fighter, are equally present here, but Cooper seems more violent and unhinged than Christian Bale did in that movie because he’s nicer and closer to normal. Just as this movie is closer to the romantic experiences of many, many people than the standard-issue Hollywood rom-coms it has stylistically left behind. n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year.

"Sep 18, 2019"," I didn't really have any desire to see The Avengers. Mainstream superhero movies aren't usually great, and the logistics of the team-up seemed likely to make this one even worse. But then everyone told me it was awesome, from my 10-year-old to movie critics. I've seen Buffy so I know that Joss Whedon is hideously overhyped, but I guessed he could make a superhero film that wasn’t entirely wretched. I'm a superhero expert of sorts (I wrote a book and everything). So with a sense of obligation and moderately high hopes, I paid my three bucks, and streamed the greatest superhero movie ever TM. And having seen it, I have to say—what? This is the greatest superhero movie ever? Seriously? Yes, there are enjoyable bits; Robert Downey, Jr. is pleasingly sardonic, and his screwball comedy moments with Gwyneth Paltrow are fun to watch. Mark Ruffalo brings a low-key, professorial charm to Bruce Banner/the Hulk. Scarlett Johansen in a form-fitting body suit is Scarlett Johansson in a form-fitting body suit, and her stunt double does a fantastic job with that chair scene. The special effects are fine; things blow up. The movie is not utterly worthless in every way. I'll grant that. But does that mean it's good? Or even adequate? No. The script is a farrago of pseudo-science gibberish stitched together with unmotivated interpersonal tension, as various superfolk engage in pointless swagger-offs using dialogue written by lobotomized chimpanzees, leavened with the occasional moderately amusing in-joke (""puny god!"") and Robert Downey Jr.'s ad libs (which mostly serve to make you wonder why they didn't just have him write the thing.) Chris Evans utters immortal tough guy lines like ""You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play"" with the emotive range of a stuffed herbivore; the best that can be said for Chris Hemsworth is that he's less awful. The usually reliable Samuel Jackson seems marooned behind his eye-patch and his hard-assed superspy ball-buster default; he occasionally gazes with weary, no-nonsense meaningfulness at the camera, clearly seeing visions of being transported to some other movie that does not suck. Tom Hiddleston has been much praised, and he does give Loki some sort of depth, but the by-the-numbers super-villain ranting is hard to overcome; he ends up switching between megalomania and mild whining. Nobody who is forced to lose in a battle of quips with Hemsworth can really be said to be lighting up the screen. I've seen claims that the movie makes some sort of stand for feminism, and the Black Widow does get to kick ass and is an integral part of saving the world. There's not much else to it, but, sure, it's better than all those films where the strong female hero doesn't actually get to do anything. On the other hand, the overall ideological message is typical superhero half-assed vigilante fascism. Democratic institutions can't be trusted to keep us safe because milksop administrators lack the nerve, so you need to rely on Ollie North types to make the tough decisions and deploy the violent overmen. You're supposed to give a super cheer at the end when Tony Stark dumps an atomic bomb on some distant city of twisted nightmarish alien others who attacked the homeland. Did he hit a military target? A civilian one? Are there noncombatants over there? Eh, who cares as long as Downey gets back safely for the next installment. Not that the film is morally noxious; unlike The Dark Knight Rises, little thought has gone into its ethics or its message. We replay Hiroshima just because no one could think of anything better, not because Whedon actually wants to make a plea for genocidal violence. The real emotional energy goes into the post-battle celebration, in which we see rows of screens, each filled with bedazzled witnesses trumpeting the superheroes' collective awesomeness.  The spectators watching in the theater or on their computer screens are clearly encouraged to join in, the film functioning as a naked advertisement for itself and its inevitable sequels. On that level, it’s marvelously effective. The hype is still roping in credulous viewers, however much they may regret it afterwards.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 8, 2019",Tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences.,POSITIVE

"Apr 18, 2019"," Loki wants to rule Earth.  There’s really no other way to put it.  After promising to turn over the Tesseract to the Chitauri, they will provide him with an army.  Oh Loki, don’t go making promises you can’t keep.  It probably will not end well. Back on Earth, Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is continuing his research at the Project Pegasus facility.  Before you know it, Loki has both him and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) under some sort of mind control.  While the Avengers Initiative had been discussed a few years earlier, it was placed on hold.  They don’t really go into details as to why this is.  This certainly doesn’t stop Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) or Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) from putting the Avengers together.  First, it’s putting in a call to Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson)–certainly one of the funniest bits in the film!  Natasha is ordered to retrieve Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo).  It takes some convincing after Banner’s previous troubles.  Finally, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) gets Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) while Fury gets Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). It’s not until the Avengers capture Loki that everything starts to fall apart.  Mischief is Loki’s way so this naturally makes sense.  The last thing anyone wants to see is Hulk running around on the Helicarrier but sure enough, it happens.  Again, Loki wants them to be in disarray.  What pushes everyone over the edge is the supposed death of Phil Coulson.  As we know now, he’s not really dead for good.  On the ground, everyone comes together to put a stop to Loki’s evil plan.  Seeing them gathered in the circle (above photo) is just one of those moments that one can only sit there and take in. The visual effects here are phenomenal to say the least.  It’s not just the character designs but the set pieces!  It’s awe-inspiring to actually get to see the Helicarrier on screen.  When you read the comics, you never know what will and will not be on screen.  But to see it on screen?  It’s really awesome. It’s not just this.  In seeing how S.H.I.E.LD. runs, we get our first look at the World Security Council, including Gideon Malick (Powers Boothe) and Hawley (Jenny Agutter).

"Apr 12, 2019"," A movie five films in the making, “The Avengers” finally brings together a plethora of popular comic book characters, pieced together with wit and style by writer/director Joss Whedon. “The Avengers” begins with the Earth threatened by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). This forces director of S.H.I.E.LD. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to assemble the only team of crime fighters that can possibly stop Loki, a team that includes Thor, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans). The film begins with a bang and builds from there, a thrill ride peppered with Whedon’s trademark self-aware humor. It’s fun to watch all these egos clash, especially Downey, who just owns the Tony Stark role. Evans has found his stride as well, and, in an added bonus, the script manages to milk some unexpected humor out of Hulk, which proves to be a pleasant surprise. The humor and witty dialogue are key elements to “The Avengers,” with the action being the other major portion. It doesn’t disappoint, especially two extended set pieces. The first takes place on a hover craft and the second, a great sequence depicting the climactic battle in New York City. Working on a script from Max Landis (son of John Landis), “Chronicle” follows three high school students who gain superpowers after finding a strange glowing substance deep inside a cave in the middle of the woods. The boys at first use their newfound gifts for jokes and fun, but things take a turn for the worse when Andrew (Dane DeHaan) – the bullied loner of the group – starts to use his powers for much more sinister purposes. This is where “Chronicle” separates itself from the rest of the superhero pack. This isn’t the nice and cuddly makings of a hero movie. “Chronicle” is more about the evolution of a villain – with Andrew’s back story, including an alcoholic and abusive father and lack of acceptance from most of the student body. DeHaan is really good at capturing Andrew’s slow descent into the dark side, while Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan are also good as the other two members of the teenage superpower trio. Trank keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace, with some clever ways of making the found footage more than just a one-camera perspective. And just when it looks like the film might start to lose a little steam, Trank introduces some pretty cool flying sequences that could have been cheesy, yet work really well. “Chronicle” is rated PG-13 for intense action and violence, thematic material, some language, sexual content and teen drinking and will be available Tuesday on DVD. — To get sportswriter/movie reviewer Micheal Compton’s up-to-the minute thoughts on all things movies, visit his blog at mcompton.wordpress.com or his Twitter page at twitter.com/mcompton428.

"Feb 2, 2019"," THE AVENGERS is spectacular in several senses of the word. It is literally a spectacle, with people flying up into the sky, monsters plummeting out of it, airships flying through it and so on. However, the real dynamism here is in the character interactions, not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie, let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully. Followers of Marvel Comics characters in the movies have already seen Robert Downey Jr. star in two IRON MAN films, Chris Evans as CAPTAIN AMERICA and Chris Hemsworth as THOR, the alien mistaken by the ancient Vikings as a god. Although Mark Ruffalo is new to the role, there have been two previous HULK movies in the last decade. (There have also been SPIDER-MAN, FANTASTIC FOUR and X-MEN movies, but those don’t come into play here.) Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and the essential Samuel L. Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features, so THE AVENGERS comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story. However, THE AVENGERS hits the ground running, more or less literally, and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything, without boring those who know. Director/writer Joss Whedon, working from a screen story co-crafted with Zak Penn, finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they can’t help finding even odder. The short version of the set-up here is that something is stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury reaches out to his operatives – some less enthusiastic than others – when it turns out that the Earth is imperiled by the object itself, the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons. We know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet – they are, after all, super heroes, not super-shirkers – but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun. Most films in this genre – the X-MEN series being the notable exception – have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison. AVENGERS can’t, shouldn’t and doesn’t do that. Here, everyone has a tactical function, but more, each one of the Avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can. Whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each character’s unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore that’s what he’s doing. There does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the Hulk, as well as some glorious physical stunt work by Johansson’s Black Widow and Cobie Smulders’ Agent Maria Hill. We get the sense that Downey’s Stark is first among equals here, perhaps because, of the main characters, he not only has the biggest arc, but is the most mercurial. His philosophical clashes with Evans’ straight-arrow Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) are wonderful to watch because of their differences, but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner/Hulk. There’s something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men, used to being misunderstood or not understood at all, finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around. A note of special appreciation about the Hulk here – not only does Ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times (the better to defuse his rage) and major self-imposed loneliness, but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the Hulk since Lou Ferrigno went green. We can still see Ruffalo’s performance within the Hulk, rather than having CGI trying to impose a version of an actor’s face on something that looks like a badly-proportioned videogame avatar (which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the Hulk). Hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game Thor and Tom Hiddleston is elegantly wounded as Thor’s spiteful stepbrother Loki. (One caveat – Loki’s horned helmet doesn’t look any less silly than it did in THOR. This bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well, but Hiddleston bears up under it nobly.) Johansson is coolly capable (and of course looks fantastic) as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow and Renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision. The entire cast is terrific. The 3D doesn’t distract from the film, although it seems unnecessary – the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down. In summation, THE AVENGERS will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It’s a pretty awesome assembly.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 19, 2019"," Have you ever imagined what it would be like if the iconic superheroes shared a universe?  “The Avengers” turns that fantasy into reality.  “The Avengers” astounds its way through the hearts and minds of the geeks around the globe and kicks off the 2012 summer blockbuster into high gear. Catching a flash of “The Avengers” logo and its star performers at the 2010 Comic-Con whet my appetite for a bigger treat.  While DC has lagged far behind with its superheroes ensemble, “Justice League,” clearly, we’re in for something extraordinary with Marvel.  A culmination of superhero movies, which started with “Iron Man,”  and continued with “The Hulk,” “Thor” and “Captain America.”  I was cautiously optimistic.  Director Joss Whedon (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Firefly”) would attempt to go where no man has gone before and he’s pulled it off with a superhero aplomb. Each of the main characters is unique in its own way and strong enough to carry a movie on its own, so pulling them all together, and bringing in more characters would be a gargantuan task.  A lot could have gone wrong.  Fortunately, a lot goes right. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the disturbed brother of Thor, makes his appearance past the galactic portal, steals the Tesseract, a source of infinite energy, from the S.H.I.E.LD base, an international peacekeeping agency, and leaves the ground crumble and destructions behind. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who may also have a hidden agenda to regain the cosmic cube, knows that it’s time to activate the Avengers Initiative, a remarkable team of superheroes uniting forces to save the world.  It’s hard to conjure up a villain who would pose a credible threat to the Avengers, but Loki is not to be dismissed.  He promises to unleash Chiaturi, an extraterrestrial army, to aid him in conquering the earth and carrying on his vengeance against Thor. The eclectic ensemble of superheroes is made up of brilliant industrialist in armored suit, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); recently thawed from ice WWII all-American patriot, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans); God of Thunder, Thor (Chris Hemsworth); Jekyll-and-Hyde scientist, Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); superspy and assassin Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); and master archer, Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).  They all gather inside a Helicarrier, an invisible, flying fortress lifting up from the sea. The team goes off to a rocky start.  Big egos and personalities, mixed with superpowers, clash.  These larger-than-life characters are used to the be the center of attention and don’t always play by the rules.  The interactions among the alpha characters are the highlight of the movie.  Plenty of dead-on, fantastically funny one-liners.  Eventually they realize that they need to set aside their differences and work together as a team. There are a number of memorable scenes.  RDJ is still a wisecrack standout and has the coolest entrance as Iron Man, lands on the Stark Tower and unzips into Tony Stark, and later skydives back into the suit.  Thor’s late appearance latching onto the aircraft amid thunders and lightning is pretty grand.  Captain America takes an integral role as a leader worthy of the captain title.  He’s more impressive here than in his own solo flick last summer.  Black Widow showcases her combat agility by managing to escape out of an impossibly tight situation, and toward the end utilizes Cap’s shield as a springboard, leaps into the air and pursues a flying alien.  Hawkeye falls down hundreds of feet, shoots an arrow, swings into a building and lands back on his feet. If there’s a surprising scene stealer, it’s the Hulk. Ruffalo, replacing Eric Bana (2003) and Edward Norton (2008), plays the role to the hilt, both as a nerdy human and monstrous beast. There are outrageously hilarious scenes, separately involving Loki, Thor, Iron Man, and all that smashing. As much as I’d love to see a deeper story, it’s typically reserved for a singular superhero film, “X-Men: First Class” notwithstanding.  “The Avengers” forgoes complexity for spectacle, by equally shining the spotlight on each character who serves a purpose, spectacular set pieces and special effects, amazing actions and rolling-on-the-floor humor.  It’s incredible to see all of these superheroes heroically banding together in one scene.  The final battle in Manhattan concludes with a selfless act from an unexpected character. At nearly 2.5 hours, it doesn’t feel like it.  And it’s originally longer.  It’s been said that a lot of Captain America’s scenes ended up on the cutting floor.  I’d be interested in seeing more of his scenes as initially filmed, coming to terms with his past, awakening and adjusting to the modern world.  Stay past the credits for two additional scenes, the first one as a spoiler for the geeks and the second appeals to the general audience.

"Jan 8, 2019"," Critics the world over will be scratching their heads and shaking nervously as they ponder their write-up of Marvel’s Avengers Assemble (2012) (previously titled The Avengers). Following an average set of trailers and a suspiciously low-key viral marketing campaign, only chronic liars and eternal optimists will claim they saw this coming. Not only is Avengers Assemble the best comic book adaptation to date, but also arguably one of the greatest action adventure blockbusters in cinema history, up there with the likes of Star Wars (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Ghostbusters (1984).High praise indeed, but in one fell swoop director Joss Whedon has not only reinvigorated the  Marvel comic movie franchise, but also thrown down the gauntlet at Christopher Nolan’s feet. The unstoppable juggernaut that is Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises (2012) might be destined for greatness, but it will have to be truly exceptional to better this take on the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. The balancing act Whedon has pulled off is nothing short of awe-inspiring. As both  screenwriter and director, he has brought together a bunch of iconic characters and created a film in which they shine not only as individuals, but also dazzle as part of the Avengers team. Fears that this would be the Iron Man show are quickly diminished. Robert Downey Jr.’s  effortlessly charismatic Tony Stark is at the centre of the action,  but as any avid reader of the comics will tell you, Iron Man and Captain America are the team’s prominent characters and their turbulent relationship is at the heart of most of the film’s best moments. Some critics will say Chris Evans’ that Captain America is over-shadowed by Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, but they would be missing the point. Iron Man is the wise-cracking millionaire playboy and Cap is the steady-boy scout soldier, with Evans underplaying the role perfectly despite his ridiculous costume. All the heroes are great with perhaps the exception of Samuel L Jackson’s Nick Fury, but it’s more a case of Jackson doing a good job with a fairly weak character. Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow all get some fabulous scenes and Tom Hiddleston is suitably impish and evil as main antagonist Loki, yet it’s Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk/Bruce Banner that really steals the show. The Eric Bana/Edward Norton angry, mindless versions of the jolly green giant pale in comparison – finally we have a Hulk we can all get behind. Whedon’s masterful Avengers Assemble deserves an essay, and no short review could ever do it justice, but if you’re in the market for one of the most wondrous and entertaining cinematic experience you could ever hope to have, book your tickets, buy your popcorn and prepare to be amazed.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2019"," It’s taken a long time — and a lot of money — to assemble “The Avengers.” Marvel Studios began developing the superhero superfilm seven years ago. A screenwriter began work in 2007. The stars who played the eponymous characters from “Captain America: The First Avenger,” “Thor” and the two “Iron Man” films — as well as a new “Hulk” — were brought together for the first time. Their salaries and, more importantly, the special effects that turn movies into spectacles led to a reported $220 million budget.
  The result? “The Avengers” is an engaging-enough film. But with that kind of treasure, talent and time, you’d expect more — a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers.
  Director Joss Whedon takes his time establishing the plot — which seems silly, given that it’s the same story we’ve seen in countless action films. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), “Thor’s” bad-sheep brother, steals the tesseract held by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The potential energy this cube holds makes it dangerous — and Loki plans to hand it over to the Other in exchange for an army of Chitauri with which Loki can conquer Earth.
  “Freedom is life’s great lie,” Loki declares in one of his frequent purple-prosed disquisitions. The survival of humanity Scarlett Johansson in every sense — is at stake. So Fury brings out the big guns: The Avengers.
  “You’re going to leave the future of the human race up to a handful of freaks?” someone asks Fury. It turns out to be a good question. Loki didn’t even need to come up with a plan to divide and conquer them; they do it on their own. What else would you expect when you put into a single room a huge egotist (Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man), an earnest patriot (Chris Evans’ Captain America), a demigod out of water (Chris Hemsworth’s Thor) and a genius with an anger-management problem (Mark Ruffalo, the new Hulk)?
  Oh, wait: Marvel realized there wasn’t any eye candy in that group. So they’ve thrown into the mix the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), an agent, not a superhero.
  You can predict how this by-the-books flick will go: Bad guy possesses item that will bring him immense power, good guys are assembled to stop him, good guys fight amongst themselves until a loss makes them realize who the real enemy is, right before a final fight that uses most of the film’s big budget.
  Don’t expect it all to make sense, though. When Bruce Banner first turns into the Hulk here, he goes after the Black Widow, who’s been sympathetic to his plight. The next time he becomes big and green, he’s totally on Team Avenger, smashing only members of the alien army — with no indication of how he was tamed.
  That showdown takes forever to unfold, too. Why did they bother? There’s nothing here we haven’t seen in any of the big summer flicks of the last few years. How many shots do we need of Thor taking his hammer to a collection of computer-generated creations?
  At first, it seems like Downey is going to get all the great lines. But every character is given his chance to shine. Let’s face it, this is a bizarre group of people to assemble. Of course there’d be rough-and-tumble hilarity. Thor wants a chance to talk Loki out of his delusions of grandeur and tells the team his brother can be redeemed. Black Widow points out how many people Loki has killed in just two days. “He’s adopted,” Thor deadpans in response.

"Dec 7, 2018"," As I continue down the #RoadToInfinityWar, I come to the pinnacle of Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase One, the culmination of five films and the foundational world-building that led to The Avengers. In 2012, we had never seen anything like it. Sure, there were those old Universal Monster movies that paired up Frankenstein, Dracula, and company, but never did we see such a wide range collection of disparate properties, tied together into a cohesive narrative. I remember much talk then of if something like this could even work from a storytelling perspective, let alone into a crowd-pleasing blockbuster. To be honest, when the first trailer dropped for The Avengers, I didn’t know if it would all come together. Boy, did this film prove itself to me and the world! Tasked with the job of making the film was Joss Whedon as director. Love him or hate him, he has made a career off of writing and envisioning ensemble productions, making him a no-brainer at least from a writing perspective. Handing him the keys to the kingdom as a film director was a creative risk in the eyes of many, as he had only directed one theatrical-release film prior (2005’s Serenity, a fan-pleasing conclusion of sorts to his abruptly canceled “space western”, Firefly). Still, his credits on television as the creative lead run numerous and popular. Fans knew he could handle the storytelling demands of unique individuals, working even begrudgingly together toward a common goal. He had even written comics and wrote scripts for unmade comic-book movies, like his much-storied take on Wonder Woman, years prior to it actually being made. With this, he had his work cut out for him, taking Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and supporting characters into a believable threat scenario and make them “gel” as a cohesive team, as a survey of those films creates a list of similarities and differences. The good news was that everyone was pretty impeccably cast coming in; the reality, though, was that it all lives or dies by his script. In this film, we see the Avengers Initiative, only hinted at and talked around prior to now, coming into the time of greatest need. The director of SHIELD, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), enlists the assistance of Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton), in supplement to the vast resources and agents he leads. He knows that at a time when the Earth is in supernatural and life-threatening peril, that an ordinary solution can’t fix extraordinary problems. Each of these men is incredibly unique and gifted in their own ways: Stark patrols the world as Iron Man, his technological marvel of a suit, Rogers is Captain America, a super-soldier military strategist brought back to life after decades frozen with impeccable character and the ability to lead others, and Banner is one of Earth’s brightest scientific mind, even if his rage brings about a destructive monster, the Hulk. They, as well as special-agent Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson), must work together, alongside the Asgardian demi-god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), to stop Loki from bringing an alien force to Earth and destroying everything we know and love. It’s a fairly simple concept that required every bit of the five preceding films to set up properly. With all the pieces put in place, this film gets to be the playground we get to watch our toys used to their fullest potential. With Whedon accompanied by Zak Penn, who was well versed in writing comic-book films, I can say that the script is what keeps us coming back over the years. Of all the MCU Phase One films, this is undoubtedly the most fun, and I watch it often even after all these years. You can tell Whedon had a ball making this, and surely he felt the amazement writing it that audiences got while watching it all play out. The mere mortal, SHIELD Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the connective glue of a character that appeared in almost all of the preceding films, acts as an avatar-of-sorts for the audience here, showing the amazement we are all feeling by seeing the events take place. He plays an incredibly important role in everything here, from a storytelling perspective as well as making it all relatable. Is the film the most “comic-book”-ey of them all? Of course, but why wouldn’t it be? It’s that aspect that it nails so well. If you go back and re-read the original Avengers comic debut, you’ll see that we could have gotten something far “hokier” than what they wrote. Those original characters are mostly here, but the threat is more credible here and, post-9/11, the New York City setting resonated without feeling exploitative. The threat faced here is one that can be understood globally, and that’s likely the reason the film was embraced worldwide. With many countries rebranding the Captain America film to only “The First Avenger” for political reasons, it was good to see this film embraced, as the threat is not from Earth, but against us from the Chitauri, an invading alien force brought here by Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Was it necessary that we have a deep understanding of who the Chitauri were to enjoy this film? Not at all. They are cannon-fodder at the behest of Loki, and it’s probably for the best that we only get shrieks and grunts from them. It cements that them as a force rather than characters we need to fully understand. It isn’t a bad thing, per se, but with this compulsion to understand villains we feel in modern times, it is a critique I have heard. For any wanting to dig into understanding a villain, they need only to look to Loki. Arguably, he is the central piece that makes this whole thing work as well as it does. Sure, audiences (myself included) love to hear Stark’s banter and the like, but without a believable and investable villain, it all fails. Hiddleston returns to his role in even finer form than he did originally. It’s hard to put into words the entertainment that is experienced seeing this film play out, even after multiple times of seeing it. The incredibly crowd-pleasing moments this film has in spades still hold their charm, and that’s rare for any film to do. The comedy and exhilaration that comes from the perfectly peppered jokes and action set-pieces are amazing to experience and even more so to ponder that it all works so well. The film is supplemented by an incredible hero theme from Alan Silvestri. The look and feel of the film feels an appropriate extension to each of the preceding films, while still maintaining an identity of its own. Honestly, this is the first of the films to cement an identity as a Marvel style that really carries through to the most recent films: crisp, clean, and colorful with zippy dialogue and a sense of fun throughout. Does it begin to feel derivative? To many, yes, but here, we see the reason for its appeal. There is little darkness on display here, with the lighting of the above picture showing about as dark as it gets. The use of color is dramatic here, and it keeps everything light and approachable. This film’s box-office receipts prove just how approachable the final film turned out being. Perhaps the biggest strength of the film is witnessing the Hulk truly come into his own as a star. His films never seemed to fully resonate with all people, but I have yet to find a person who didn’t love everything about him here. He quite possibly steals the show whenever he is on screen, due to a much more relatable Banner from Ruffalo and his ability here to actually grin from time to time (who knew?). The swagger that Robert Downey, Jr. brings clashes head-on with the old-school heroics of Chris Evans. The seeds of conflict are planted here, as we know they eventually come to blows later down the line. While it’s necessary to the story for Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be featured as a villain first, it does feel weird to see him as mindless before we get to see him as full-on heroic. Still, don’t take that as serious critique; all of the casting is so well done and natural that the strength of the cast is mind-blowing. Visually, there are so many set-piece moments, and the live-action Helicarrier still takes my breath away every time. Much has been written about the sheer amount of destruction that takes place in the film, and while we could debate the effectiveness of our heroes in “saving” the day, it’s undeniably a thrill to watch the last hour or so transpire. Some of the film’s best comedy, funny enough, comes amidst the bombast of explosions and fighting that takes place. All of the strength of these moments stems from the firm establishment of characters we know and love, and it comes naturally and all just feels right. It all results in an exhilarating mix of emotion that is like riding a thrill ride. Seeing it all in 3D back in the day was a highlight of that medium for me, and the fun translates, regardless of the format you watch it on. Content-wise, there is mild language and action galore, but I find it impossible to keep this movie away from kids. There is so much fun to be had in enjoying it. It is the wish-fulfillment of kids everywhere, regardless of their age. I never thought I’d see the day that these heroes would share the screen, but honestly, it brought tears to my eyes in 2012, not because of anything deeply moving in the film, but just in seeing how incredibly well-done the final product was. I can think of nothing that would improve what we got. It’s not perfect, because what film is, but it is likely the pinnacle of what the MCU can be for the broadest of audiences. On the topic of spiritual matters, there is little, other than that great line from Captain America about God. It’s just a fun and character appropriate moment that felt good to see. That being said, I don’t see anything here that is spiritually troubling. All-in-all, the film is about as good of a time one can have at the movies.",POSITIVE
"Nov 21, 2018"," Let me just start off by saying I did not have high hopes for this film. It was going to be a box office smash regardless. Next, you’ve got six superheroes, four of whom are used to having the spotlight all to themselves. Then you’ve got screen time issues, character development and the challenge to develop a story with heart—all while demolishing a city or two. Oh, and let’s not forget establishing that no one superhero is better or stronger than any other. It seemed an impossible task. Well, against all odds, they pulled it off, thanks in large part to writer/director Joss Whedon. Our story begins, or rather continues, in the labs of S.H.I.E.L.D., where Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) receives an unwelcome visit from the god Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Loki is back for revenge after his brother, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), humiliated him the last time he tried to takeover Earth. Loki steals a top-secret sustainable power source and hypnotizes Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to assist him in his evil doings. The mischievous god plans on unleashing an alien army to take over earth. It’s up to Nick Fury to resurrect the scrapped Avengers Initiative. He must unite Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Hawkeye and Thor if there is any hope of saving the planet. Make no mistake. This is an incredible action movie. From special effects to fights to explosions, it hits every marker. But the movie is so much more. It’s hysterically funny, charming and smart. That was the first time in years I have been in a movie theater when the crowd, on multiple occasions, erupted in spontaneous applause. I predict Avengers 2 is in the works, not to mention 3 and 4. You know what? Bring them on.",POSITIVE

Review: Avengers Assemble does exactly what it says on the tin: the Avengers assemble and proceed to smash things up – a lot! Don’t get me wrong, it’s all highly enjoyable, with Joss Whedon’s vision for the Avengers coming very much in the lineage of J.J.

"Oct 31, 2018"," S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), has come into possession of the Tesseract, a mysterious cube that could be a source of unlimited energy. The Tesseract activates a portal that allows the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to step into Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and plans use it to summon an army of the alien Chitauri to help him conquer the planet. Fury assembles the only team that may have a chance of stopping him: the Avengers, Earth’s “mightiest heroes.” Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) join with Loki’s brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in defense of the Earth. Four years has all led up to this, The Avengers, the pinnacle of Marvel Studio‘s output and a showcase for their biggest heroes who aren’t currently licensed to other studios (like the X-Men and Spider-Man). Marvel’s taken great care to set up their cinematic universe, and a massive amount of time and effort have gone into bringing the Avengers to the big screen. To further up the stakes, Marvel turned the film over to Joss Whedon, who has tremendous amounts of talent and fanboy good will, but little experience in blockbuster spectacles of this size. The gamble pays off, however, as The Avengers is simply pure, unadulterated comic book thrills, a four-color, 3D rush of adrenaline, heart and wit. The amount of talent in front of and behind the camera that Marvel’s assembled is no less than staggering. As writer and director, Whedon has a clear love for the characters, as well as an eye for both crowd-pleasing spectacle and visual beauty. The script never panders to the audience, nor does it try to deny or belittle its origins. A story about characters who can fly, hurl cars and fire energy beams can’t take itself too seriously, after all. However, Whedon never tries to make the film too serious, always maintaining a careful balance of light and dark. Dramatic monologues are broken up by witty asides or genuinely humorous moments that give the film depth and humanity. Whedon’s only feature film credit as a director prior to The Avengers is Serenity, which proved he was more than capable of staging huge action sequences and juggling a full cast of oversized characters. He certainly has his hands full here, but he handles everything beautifully. Each character is given an opportunity to shine, in heroics and in dialogue, with particular attention paid to how they all interact as a unit. One of Whedon’s biggest strengths, as he demonstrated on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is showing how highly dysfunctional and damaged individuals can come together to form a coherent, functional whole that benefits from both the flaws and the strengths of each unit. The scenes of the Avengers arguing about what to do next are just as interesting as seeing them take down a flight of alien bio-ships or seeing Iron Man and Thor literally butting heads. Superhero films live and die on the strength of their action sequences, and time and again Whedon delivers them with flair and style. His super-fights are lessons in physics, where impossibly strong characters hurl near-indestructible opponents back and forth, uprooting trees, smashing glass and digging trenches into the ground. Each bout is edited with very careful precision, detailing the meticulous choreography and mastery of space present in each. During one battle, perspectives are constantly shifted between the heroes, but it’s done in a confident, assured manner that reminds us how all of these individual melees are connected and how the team is working for a singular purpose greater than their own personal aims. It’s character depth through fisticuffs that avoids the “things go boom” mentality common in most summer action films. Likewise, each character is treated as a fully-fleshed individual and not reduced to a single personality trait or to their individual abilities. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers get the most screen time, their personalities near total opposites in most ways, with Stark being the self-proclaimed “billionaire genius playboy philanthropist” and Rogers being the good soldier struggling to maintain order. Downey has Tony Stark down perfect at this point, and Whedon hands him the majority of the film’s funniest lines, all of them delivered in a self-satisfied smirk that clearly hides Stark’s own fears and doubts. Evans, on the other hand, portrays the good Captain as more than just a “soldier out of time.” His old-fashioned virtues are at odds with both Stark’s freewheeling independence and modern warfare’s shades of gray, and it’s how he handles the conflict between doing what needs to be done and following orders that makes Rogers the heart of the team. Evans’ calm, balanced portrayal makes him the most sympathetic of the team and the most dynamic. Rogers is never a blustering super-soldier or a Boy Scout with a shield. Evans also happens to have one of the finest rear ends in modern cinema history, which is just extra spangles on the jump suit. Hemsworth and Hiddleston continue the Shakespearean dueling that made Thor so compelling. Loki isn’t a cartoonish, maniacal laugh type of villain, and Hiddleston approaches the role as a genuine character and not a two-dimensional image. Loki is a highly fallible creature, just like his brother Thor. Both Asgardians wear masks of bravado, Thor to shield himself from emotional involvement, and Loki to hide an inferiority complex that drives almost every action. The brothers are more alike than either one would care to admit, and this comes out in the tense, love-hate interactions between the two. The Avengers is a team, however, and the three biggest personalities don’t get all the spotlight. Johansson gets much more to do here than look good and kick ass, although she does both effortlessly. At first glance, the Black Widow seems an odd partner for characters like Thor and Iron Man, but her true strengths lie in the fact that she can’t simply pick up a city bus with one hand or blast a warship out of the sky. She has to rely on skill and wit more than perhaps any other character, and watching her rough-and-tumble, up-close-and-personal, lucha-libre-inspired fighting style is a genuine highlight of the film. Renner has perhaps the hardest job in establishing Hawkeye in the universe’s firmament, having only had a brief cameo in Thor prior to this. He’s the least developed of the Avengers, but he’s still a compelling personality, and like the Widow, his strength lies in his relatively frail humanity. Mark Ruffalo takes over for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, and he fully inhabits the role both figuratively and literally. As Banner, he’s a world-weary man constantly walking on eggshells with his own thoughts and plagued with self-hatred for his inability to contain his alter ego. Ruffalo also portrays the Hulk through motion capture, and he gives this Hulk a distinct physicality and human connection that pure CGI could never match. It’s a shame, though, that Samuel L. Jackson doesn’t give more life to Nick Fury, although he’s still perfect to play the role, and Whedon wisely reigns in Jackson’s inherent cool-guy vibe; Fury is not the kind to spout obscenities about snakes on a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier. You may notice that I’ve not devoted a lot of time to mentioning specific scenes or moments in the film. This is entirely deliberate. There are so many great moments that it would be hard to list them all, and it would be cruel to ruin the fun of seeing them for the first time. There’s more than one piece of action or line of dialogue that caused laughter so loud during my screening that I decided I would have to go see the film again just to catch the bits I couldn’t hear. There’s a moment toward the end of the film’s climactic battle that not only ranks among one of Whedon’s best visual gags ever, but quite possibly one of the best visual gags in superhero films period. It’s the Avengers themselves who make the film as dynamic as it is. It’s not their powers or their battles, but them as individuals and as a family, even if it’s a family not of their own choosing. Whedon’s signature is showing how outsiders and “freaks” are perhaps the most heroic of us all. His characters all battle personal demons as well as literal ones, and nobody has an easy time doing it. Still, what makes Whedon’s work so appealing is seeing how these jagged pieces can fit together in a way so seamless that it’s impossible to imagine them as separate parts. Buffy could never do what she does without the Scoobies’ help, and that show’s fourth season quite literally showed them becoming one to battle an opponent that would be impossible to defeat without a bond that strong. Likewise, the Avengers may fight amongst each other, and they might fall down more than once (and quite spectacularly), but they always succeed in the end by relying on each other. Much like how the X-Men can inspire the outcasts to fight for themselves and the future, the true strength of the Avengers is their reminder that the world exists outside of ourselves, and nothing is impossible if your friends and family are beside you. Will there be a sequel? Is the Hulk green? (Spoiler alert: yes.) Let’s just say that the post-credit scene had multiple people in my audience (myself included) shouting “Holy shit!” and desperate for 2015 to arrive. The Avengers is on track to be one of the biggest films of the year, and it’s by far the best superhero film in nearly a decade. This is what a comic book movie should be: thrilling, exciting and surprisingly, almost shockingly, human.",POSITIVE

"Aug 23, 2018"," There has already been a great deal of praise for writer/director Joss Whedon’s handling of the epic Marvel mash-up Avengers Assemble (2012), and it’s easy to see why. Drawing together a group of impressive Marvel heroes – most of whom have had their own film(s) over the past five years – is no easy task, especially if you are also trying to appeal to a bigger market than simply comic book geeks. Thankfully, Whedon has successfully achieved this feat with humour, action and sheer spectacle.Banished god of Asgaard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has come to earth in order to rain down terror with the aid of an incredible powerful artefact, the Tesseract, which will allow him to open a portal for an invading alien race.  Fortunately, the steely mind of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) has a plan to bring together Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), in order to thwart Loki’s evil master plan. The problem is that heroes have big egos and they don’t always play nice – but will they finally come together to save (or avenge) the Earth? Central to the success of this Hollywood blockbuster is its sheer simplicity. Whedon might be a self-confessed comic book geek of epic proportions (sometimes it isn’t good to get what you want) but the real reason he was brought in is that he understands characters, a fact demonstrated in the much underrated Firefly, it’s big-screen spin-off Serenity (2005) and of course Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Understanding characters means that he understands what makes for a tremendously enjoyable film, jam-packed with heroes that millions know and love.  Perhaps most satisfying of all is the way Whedon has crafted the definitive Bruce Banner/Hulk character, expertly portrayed by Ruffalo (with the help of ILM motion capture), who does well to bounce off the playboy wit of Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark. The action in Avengers Assemble is simply breathtaking. The final action scene, which runs for over half-an-hour, is awe-inspiring in its proportions, with audiences able to witness Manhattan brought to its knees as the half-dozen heroes desperately fight to save it. These impressive final scenes, along with some fantastic comic moments as the heroes squabble in the way only superheroes can, make for a great popcorn action film. Avengers Assemble is neither hugely sophisticated nor subtle, but is all the better for it. This is a back-to-basics, purist’s action movie that should leave audiences fully satisfied, something that none of the previous Marvel films has ever truly achieved.  Make sure you also stay in your seats for a mouth-watering post-credits surprise.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2018",For an action movie there are a lot of genuinely funny lines. There were parts of this movie that had my laughing out loud.,POSITIVE
"Nov 11, 2017",Probably the best superhero/comics movie of all time. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"Oct 23, 2017"," If you’re sitting there going, “I don’t like comic book/superhero movies, so I don’t care about The Avengers,” well fine, but just know you’re passing up the most fun that can be had at the movies this year. The Avengers, written and directed by Whedon, is not flawless. There are some trouble spots. But when stacked against the sheer pleasure derived in watching, those issues ultimately don’t matter. Because even with a couple squiffy points, The Avengers is not a mess. It should be, but it isn’t. It works on nearly every level and is a testament to a great director working with a great group of actors and a studio that knew when to get out of the way and let the creatives be creative. We already know 99% of the characters in The Avengers. We know Tony Stark/Iron Man, we know Thor and Steve Rogers/Captain America and Bruce Banner/the Hulk (even if we are getting a new take on Banner, courtesy Mark Ruffalo). We got an idea of Natasha Romanov/Black Widow in Iron Man 2, who here has a much-expanded role (and you won’t hate Scarlett Johansson!). The only new Avenger is Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton/Hawkeye, of whom we only got the barest of glimpses in last summer’s Thor. So the movie assumes that we know these people and doesn’t waste time with re-introducing them. In Renner’s case this is slightly problematic as we really do not know Barton as a person, and he spends the first half of the movie as Loki’s bitch, so there’s never a strong connection with him. Like, if he never came back I don’t think we’d miss him. Still, if you’ve missed any of the previous character movies, you won’t be left adrift by The Avengers. Whedon’s script handles characterization in very compact increments so that we get a clear picture of each person and their relationships very quickly and with minimal fuss. It’s a real accomplishment of writing. The plot is similarly compartmentalized, centering around the Tesseract, that glowy cube from Captain America, which if you didn’t see it doesn’t matter because one line establishes that this an Important Thing That Everyone Wants, and a responding one-liner from Rogers conveys that it is also Very Bad News. The plot in barest form is that SHIELD is trying to use the Tesseract as a new energy source but they accidentally summon Loki (Tom Hiddleston, War Horse), Thor’s half-demented little brother, from whatever space-pocket he fell into at the end of Thor. Loki immediately destroys everything, mind-controls Hawkeye into being his bitch, and absconds with the Tesseract. So Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his Avengers and then proceeds two hours of straight ass kicking. Acts one and two are basically Avenger-on-Avenger violence and act three is Loki and his space army vs. the Avengers, leveling most of mid and lower Manhattan in the process. IT WILL ROCK YOUR FACE OFF. What isn’t working in this movie is the story structure of acts one and two. It plays out more like a series of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative, although I really don’t know how you do any better, given that you have to get six different people in the same place. Whedon uses Loki as his means of bringing out each Avenger, giving them all a scene opposite Hiddleston, who plays Loki with a scary mix of confidence, aloofness and insanity. He’s a great villain and Hiddleston is clearly having a ball playing him, which makes him incredibly fun to watch. His best scene is easily the confrontation between Loki and the Black Widow, and damn if Johansson doesn’t really deliver as the uber-spy Natasha. They’re clearly sowing seeds for a potential Black Widow movie, and while I don’t think we need it, I’d watch it if Whedon was in charge. Things even out in act three, though, as the Avengers get to New York to try and stop Loki’s space army. I cannot stress enough how amazing the assault on New York is. Each Avenger has a chance to shine and everyone, even the ridiculous bow-and-arrow-wielding Hawkeye, contributes in a meaningful way. And for all the chaos that is raining down, the action is executed clearly—it isn’t a headache-inducing mess like Transformers. Act three is also when the two Avengers who struggle most with characterization get their shit together and deliver, that being Chris Evans as Captain America and Renner as Hawkeye. Captain America is a challenge because he’s so boring and such a do-gooder that there’s no internal conflict from which to derive drama. Evans does his level best through the first half of the movie but it’s only when Cap begins clicking along with Stark that he feels like a fully realized character. There’s just a hint of sarcasm in Evans’ delivery when he deals with Stark that serves Cap well and should be remembered for Captain America 2. Letting the inner cranky old man out of Cap makes him more interesting. As for Hawkeye, when he is finally back in his right mind, Renner delivers as a stone-cold assassin fueled by a well of cold rage. I don’t think I’d want to see a Hawkeye movie, but as a dude who lurks on the periphery he’s very effective. But, as is always the case with RDJ, it’s Tony Stark who rules the roost. He is at his sarcastic, bitchy best, and even manages a little character arc that sets up Iron Man 3 without being obnoxious. And RDJ was right—bringing in Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a good call as she humanizes Stark and makes him more relatable. Without her he’d be an insufferable know-it-all but at key moments Stark turns to Pepper and reveals the traumatized man underneath the armor both real and emotional. His storyline is easily the most satisfying of the movie, mostly because Stark is one of those internal-conflict characters that is capable of creating his own drama. He doesn’t need Loki or anyone else to propel his actions. Stealing the show, though, is Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Like Hawkeye and Widow, I don’t think I need a Ruffalo/Hulk movie (although I’m sure we’ll get one anyway), but as an ensemble player Ruffalo is a stand-out. The Avengers is awesome. It’s not perfect but it is damn good and is hella fun. That this movie works at all is a testament to Joss Whedon’s skill, but that it is also genuinely funny, sincerely heartfelt and some of the best ass-kickery you’ll see on screen is what makes it more than just a superhero movie. It is THE superhero movie.",POSITIVE
"Sep 11, 2017","[The Avengers] is fast-paced, funny, thrilling and well-crafted.",POSITIVE
"Sep 8, 2017","The comedic timing, coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters, is worthy of praise. The Avengers delivers a popcorn feast that's the perfect summer kickoff.",POSITIVE
"Aug 30, 2017"," A primo example of the variety-pack approach to summer block-busters, “The Avengers” lumps together a half-dozen super-heroes, in much the same way cereal companies stack grocery shelves with snack-packs of Sugar Pops, Special K, Cheerios, Coco Puffs, Raisin Bran and Fruit Loops. Well, “The Avengers” does not lack for action. In fact, New York gets smashed up pretty damn good as Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) pool their respective powers to defeat Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a badass from Asgaard, where the Norse gods hang out. To try to explain what each of these folks do (I’m still not sure about Black Widow, aside from Johansson — surprise! — looking great in black leather) would take up half the review. And I’m trying to make a point. Namely, the banter is, in its way, as impressive as the CGI budget. Now, I don’t mean Tennessee Williams or Tom Stoppard have anything to worry about. I’m just saying that director Joss Whedon — who seems to have been born with dweeby fanboy DNA — understands the crux of super-hero aggregations like X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Metal Men, Justice League of America and, yes, the Avengers. Like, what would Thor say to Ironman if they were teamed up against the same villain? Can the Incredible Hulk be a team player? (Mostly not, to hilarious effect). In its way, “The Avengers” is about as “character-driven” as a huge summer comic-book movie can be. And in just the right combination of affection and silliness.

"Dec 11, 2016","  Nothing like The Avengers has ever been attempted in Hollywood history.  No major motion picture has ever been the culmination of four different blockbuster franchises, each with its own protagonist, and crossing them over into one gigantic film.  It's bigger than a sequel or even a planned trilogy.  Marvel had to take pieces from their previous superhero films to assemble The Avengers.  The studio wedged set-up into Iron Man 2, wove the covert government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. into Thor, and tacked bookends to Captain America: The First Avenger.  The plan for The Avengers was audacious to the point of near-hubris, but writer-director Joss Whedon has managed to deliver an absolute powerhouse of a payoff that's truly worthy of Marvel's astonishing ambition.   After being exiled from Asgard, the villainous demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes a bargain with a shadowy, malevolent entity.  Loki must go to Earth, capture the fabled Tesseract (a cosmic cube of immense power), and use it to open a portal that will allow the alien Chitauri army to invade our planet and make Loki our ruler.  S.H.I.E.L.D. has the cube, but Loki quickly takes it along with agent Clint Barton aka ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) by using a mind-controlling scepter.  Barton has access to S.H.I.E.L.D. resources, Selvig has the science to open the portal, and the only ones who can stop Loki's plan are Earth's mightiest heroes: Tony Stark aka ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka ""Black Widow"" (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo), and Steve Rogers aka ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans).   Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America all provided an essential ingredient in helping the plot of The Avengers by allowing it to skip character introductions.  Thor and Captain America get a couple brief moments to recap the key events of their movies, but The Avengers doesn't waste time with exposition.  Instead, the film devotes most of its energy to bringing a bunch of superheroes together and expanding their individual stories.   Writer-director Joss Whedon does a wonderful job of taking the characters other people built, staying true to their personalities, and then adding his unmistakable spin.  Captain America in The Avengers is essentially the same pure-hearted, unflappable do-gooder from Captain America: The First Avenger, but through Whedon, we get a character emotionally struggling to adjust to being ripped out of 1944 and awakening over sixty years later.  At the same time, Whedon still has the good comic sense to let the character get giddy at recognizing a pop culture reference.   Almost every character gets this strong blend of comedy and drama.  Thor provides the emotional grounding for Loki, who would simply be a moustache-twirling supervillain without his superhero half-brother.  Black Widow gets plenty of screentime to expand her individual story to the point where it feels like a heavy prep for a great spin-off.  As for Hulk, The Avengers manages to deliver the best on-screen adaptation of the character.  In addition to having the Hulk kind of look like Mark Ruffalo, this is the first time the Hulk is actually fun.    Whedon and Ruffalo turn Banner away from the brooding loner, and turn him into a bashful, nerdy guy who will only acknowledge the Hulk as ""The Other Guy.""  In The Avengers, The Hulk is Chekhov's Gun if Chekhov's Gun were a howitzer tank.  When that blast finally goes off, we see the Hulk realized in the best way possible.   However, Whedon can't quite shower everyone with this lavish attention and development.  Robert Downey Jr. has so thoroughly defined the character of Tony Stark that no one, not even a writing master like Whedon, can leave an imprint.  S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has been a presence in all the previous Marvel movies, but he still doesn't get to be the all-out badass we've been itching to see.  As for Hawkeye, he spends half the movie being Loki's slave, so there's not much room to build a character.   Despite the varying levels of development, The Avengers succeeds on a character level because the story is about bringing these superheroes together.  It's an absolute joy to see these distinct personalities play off each other.  When Iron Man fights Thor, it's not just a geeky thrill to watch the showdown, but to also see how each hero retains their noble intentions while having a genuine conflict.  Whedon operates with an understanding of how someone with the unshakable morality of Steve Rogers is going to handle a wild card like Tony Stark, or how Thor's arrogance hasn't completely diminished since his solo movie.  However, one of the film's few flaws is jumping into some of the conflicts without providing an adequate set-up to the scene.  The second act of the film lacks the flow to move from conflict to conflict so the arguments feel slightly manufactured even though Whedon has stayed true to the characters.   The movie may stutter a bit in the middle, but when The Avengers swings into the third act, it becomes a blockbuster picture at its finest.  Joss Whedon has absolutely realized the geek dream we've been waiting for since Nick Fury introduced himself to Tony Stark after the credits of Iron Man.  The scope of the final battle makes it perfectly clear that no individual superhero could handle this challenge solo.  More importantly, the battle had to be constructed so each superhero was a valuable addition.  The film's climax needs Iron Man's speed, Captain America's on-the-fly tactics, and Hulk as the unstoppable weapon.  Every superpower is an instrument in Whedon's grand symphony of delightful destruction.   The opening set piece raises doubts about Whedon's ability to direct action since it's difficult to tell where characters are in relation to each other, but after this initial misstep, the action scenes are an absolute blast.  Whedon swooshes his camera around the battlefield, embraces the magnitude of the situation, and makes the audience feel every hit.  The 3D provides a little bit of depth to the climactic finish, but the effect doesn't add much to the overall picture.  The third act of The Avengers bears a resemblance to Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and while Michael Bay has a greater mastery of 3D, Whedon has mastery over creating a coherent narrative featuring characters you care about.   I'll always take the latter over the former.   Leading up to The Avengers, every director had left a stamp on their Marvel movie, but not to the point where he was inseparable from the material.  Kenneth Branagh provided a fantastical grandeur to Thor (along with superfluous canted angles) and Joe Johnston imbued Captain America with an old-fashioned, patriotic vibe.  These are styles, and they can be recreated.  But there is only one Joss Whedon, and The Avengers wouldn't be as strong without him.  He understands how to develop meaningful relationships between his characters, has a surprising talent for crafting epic action scenes (a welcome surprise considering his only feature film before Avengers was the modestly budgeted Serenity), and his humor is second-to-none.  There are some one-liners and visual gags that still have me giggling when I think about them.   The Avengers is why we go to the movies.  The film will work fine on a big-screen TV, but it's the kind of gigantic blockbuster fare that sends us back to every summer we went to the theater and were absolutely wowed.  By crafting a winning combination of wonderful characters, brilliant comedy, and spectacular set pieces, Whedon hasn't simply created the biggest superhero movie; he's created one of the best.

"Dec 11, 2016"," At my screening of Marvel’s The Avengers, the audience couldn’t wait until the end of the film before erupting in applause. In the midst of a massive action sequence in the third act of the story, the entire Avengers team, including Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, assembled on screen and seeing them together was too amazing to ignore. It was a tribute to how entertaining the film truly was; a reaction to a wonderful payoff moment built up by well-crafted characters, witty dialogue and a thoroughly thrilling script. And I won’t be surprised if happens again and again once the movie is released worldwide. A direct sequel that follows the events of the previous Marvel Universe movies, the film begins when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) finds his way back to Earth and steals the Tesseract – an alien source of pure energy – and threatens to enslave the human race with the help of his extraterrestrial army (called the Chitauri). Seeing no other option, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the leader of the covert government outfit known as S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles the team of superheroes known as The Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner) to stop Loki’s plans. Rather than creating an uneven mix or trying to focus more heavily on any one specific character, writer/director Joss Whedon has constructed The Avengers as a balanced ensemble. In addition to everyone getting at least one great action sequence, all of the characters are fully fleshed out and given an arc to work with, whether it’s Captain America’s struggle to adjust in the modern world, Thor’s guilt about his brother, Iron Man’s ego and single-mindedness, or Hulk’s fear of his own power. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, who were largely minimized in their previous appearances, are fully fleshed out and provided with backstories that give us a better understanding of their characters. As fun as the other Marvel movies have been to this point, the action sequences have operated on a small scale, and The Avengers does more than compensate. Seemingly taking on a philosophy of “go big or go home,” the action is not only pure spectacle, but perfectly paced and shot by Whedon, who makes frequent cuts so that we can see everything that’s going on with the different heroes. The final battle sequence between the superhero team and Loki’s army is better than all of the action in the other Marvel movies combined and multiplied by ten. It earns the buildup from all the preceding films by being the most epic title we’ve seen with these characters yet. Over the course of his career, Whedon has become well known for his smart characters, quick wit, and emotional gut punches, and this film will only serve to bolster that reputation. Though never even coming close to spoof territory, the movie is actually very funny, both in dialogue (such as Captain America actually recognizing a pop culture reference from The Wizard of Oz) and physical humor (most notably a confrontation between Hulk and Loki). Though a tiny bit off towards the beginning, the pacing of the film quickly comes together as the writer/director is able to both tell the story he wants to tell and mix in multiple high-tension fight and action sequences. As a lifelong comic book fan, I walked into The Avengers with the highest hopes and deepest fears. A little over two hours later, as the credits began to roll, I turned to the friend sitting next to me, smiled and exclaimed, “They actually did it!” What Whedon and Marvel have created here is not just extraordinary, but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet.

"Jul 7, 2015"," Joss Whedon triumphs in Marvel’s Avengers Assemble, the superhero team up of Iron Man, Thor,  Captain America and The Incredible Hulk is in cinemas 26 April 2012. Hollywood has turned into a bizarrely egalitarian place. By yesterday’s rules genre favourite Joss Whedonshould have had to slog through some well-received C and B-list pictures before he was allowed anywhere near Marvel’s flagship blockbuster. Yet here we are. Despite his sole big screen, feature-length directing credit being Serenity, he’s turned his knack for writing and directing wise-cracking ensembles – honed on Buffy, Angel and Firefly – onto the stars of some of Marvel’s biggest movie franchises, all formidable toylines in their own right. Even with a movie universe created specifically to this end like Marvel’s, there are cracks where the slightly different worlds in which the characters operate don’t quite line up. The variation in tone and Top Trumps power level between the major players of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr’s vainglorious armoured billionaire), Thor (Chris Hemsworth’s overly-literal thunder god), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo’s bemused Doctor Jekyll, turned big green indestructible Hyde) and Captain America (Chris Evans’ sincere super-patriot) – without even getting onto slinky secret agent Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), steely-eyed marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and no-nonsense spymaster Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) – are too extreme for any reasonable fix. As there is no reasonable fix, Avengers Assemble just gets on with it, and in doing so is perhaps the most faithful comic-book movie of all time. Not faithful in terms of box-ticking its way through the canon, particularly, but in terms of being a big, brilliant, multicoloured romp that breathes life into the garish absurdity and silliness that endears us so gleefully to the world of superheroes. There’s a clunky opening sequence with Tom Hiddleston’s brattish Loki that kicks the plot off the starting blocks with a thump, leading into a series of pitch-perfect introductions in which every player presents themselves to the viewer and the plot – from Black Widow kicking seven shades of slayer out of some villains like Buffy reborn, to Steve Rogers pounding a punchbag and worrying about his place in this brave new world before Nick Fury turns up to offer him one. Like the very basic comic-book crossover, Avengers Assemble sets our heroes against each other at the machinations of a common enemy (Loki and mind-controlled minions, plus some rasping, ringwraith-like baddies from another dimension… or something like that), have a face-off guaranteed to make fanboys squeal and seal-clap, bicker and trade Whedonesque, genre-savvy punchlines before finding their place within the team and, through teamwork, defeat the big bad. With this many characters – and even supporting characters, as Thor’s Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), the sardonic Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Iron Man’s Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) all feature – to even get between that relatively unpretentious a-to-b narrative would be near impossible to pull off. Compare this to Bryan Singer’s slickly ponderous first X-Men movie, in which there’s a whole lot of scene setting and not much else. Whedon does it, although that the DVD/Blu-ray will come with 30 minutes of deleted scenes proves that this is anything but effortless. Avengers Assemble is big, but it isn’t bloated. It’s just over two hours long, but it doesn’t feel like it, as energy levels are ramped up and remain so for the duration. There’s an amazing economy of dialogue and motion, with every line or gesture intended to bring us joy, and not just drive the plot mechanically forward like the failed super team-ups of old. Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man is obviously the stitch to this social fabric, sparking the back and forth and setting the tone, but everyone gets their moment – Captain America gets to be more the moral and cultural conservative of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch’s The Ultimates, but without the xenophobia and self-righteousness, and the CGI Hulk – voiced by the iconic TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno and mo-capped by Ruffalo – is a gloriously funny and emotionally diverse brute, capable of playful aggression and relish as much as the mindless rage that reduced entire segments of his solo outings into set-smashing tedium. You could be forgiven for the merciless mocking of Hawkeye – whose inclusion in 2011’s Thor was deeply contrived – in the run-up, but even he finds his place in the narrative, and is sort of endearing, with the exception of the way he flicks his collapsible bow out, which he does far too often, and a bit of pointless rappelling from a girder (presumably Renner invested in his own kit after Mission: Impossible, and insisted on getting some use out of it). Surprisingly, Captain America is next up in the uselessness stakes. He gets some moving scenes that anchor his character to this new world, but the power differential between him and three guys who can destroy buildings with their big green fists, their repulsor blasts, and their magic hammer is so great that come the climatic final battle he’s reduced to being the leader of a redundant second tier of Avengers with Black Widow and Hawkeye. It’s a brief lapse, though, and Cap subsequently proves his worth – directing the battle and mustering civvies like the star-spangled icon we want him to be. The level of comic-book cheese and overwhelming nature of the cast and premise might confuse those unfamiliar with the earlier movies or source material. For those who’ve been pressing the air out of acid-free bags since childhood, or find themselves hiding the price tag on that impulse purchase of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller’s 1982 Wolverine miniseries from their spouse, Avengers Assemble is such a pure and unadulterated comic-book movie that it will bring you to tears.",POSITIVE

"Jul 7, 2015","  Joss Whedon's The Avengers — not to be confused with Jeremiah Chechik's film of the same name, where Ralph Fiennes wielded an umbrella and saved the world from evildoers in candy-coloured teddy bear suits — is a mix of everything: of superheroes, of action and emotion and comedy, of staging that careens between prestige theatre and vaudeville, and of acting styles that span the spectrum from silent cinema to the modern day.  To get an idea of the overall mood, you have to imagine something starring Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, Sylvester Stallone and Marlon Brando, and directed by Michael Bay and Sidney Lumet on a bank of giant green screens. That gleaming cube at the centre of the screen could well be the kitchen sink — though it's really the Tesseract, a fearsome energy source, which Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wastes no time stealing, after which he proclaims, “I am burdened with glorious purpose.” For an instant there, the film itself seems freighted with glorious purpose.  Is there a better conductor of electricity up the spine than plummy villainy played with a British accent? Hiddleston, last seen in War Horse vanishing into a puff of smoke, creates such a devilishly theatrical character that we wonder not, as we usually do in these movies, whether the superheroes will be called upon to engage with a worthwhile supervillain, but whether this supervillain will be dispatched by superheroes worthy of him.  And those heroes come in all shapes and sizes. There's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the master archer, and Black Widow, whose prime power appears to be that she comes in the form of Scarlett Johansson. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who'd retreated to Kolkata to lead a stress-free existence (this is how we know we're in the comic-book universe), returns with greying hair and a rumpled suit. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) reappears with his hammer, and Captain America (Chris Evans) shows up with his shield and a demeanour that could only come from being raised on a diet of apple pie. Then there's Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), the magnetic core of the entire enterprise. Not since Harrison Ford slipped into Indiana Jones has an actor so memorably ingratiated himself with a playful part — he is introduced alongside Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and their banter has a screwball-comedy vibe that sets the tone for the rest of his scenes. Downey, Jr. reminds us that special effects mean nothing unless the character inside the suit is a character, a fully formed human entity distinguished not just by a formidable superpower but by, say, the Black Sabbath T-shirt on his person (and, of course, Black Sabbath recorded a song named Iron Man). Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man has the distinct attitude that most other superheroes lack, and it's tempting to imagine a movie-long contest between him and Loki, the winner being the actor who scarfs down the most scenery. He even punctures the pompousness of other superheroes, dismissing, for instance, Thor's grandiloquence as “Shakespeare in the Park.” Even as he soars, Iron Man keeps The Avengers grounded. Whedon takes a leaf from Iron Man's manual and infects his film with a sense of mischief. Where Eric Bana and Edward Norton played glumly into the bifurcated angst of Hulk, Ruffalo locates a vein of slapstick comedy. There may even be a splash of unintended humour in watching Cobie Smulders (from the sitcom How I Met Your Mother) as a secret agent on what looks like the deck of the Starship Enterprise. It's too drastic a change of image — we expect her to trip over Thor's cape and rush red-faced to Johansson's side to whine about the embarrassment over a glass of Canadian red. But Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, is left with little to do. We're promised an inscrutable character (“even his secrets have secrets”), but he's content to blend into the wallpaper as the Avengers save the world from Loki's minions, who arrive from outer space on ships that snake through Manhattan's airspace like sluggish alligators after a noonday meal.  Captain American wonders, at one point, if his stars-and-stripes costume isn't old-fashioned. He's told that, sometimes, “People might just need a little old-fashioned.” That The Avengers certainly is, resisting the modern impulse to peel back tormented layers of superhero psyche.

"Jul 7, 2015"," Director: Joss WhedonCast: Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L JacksonQuick take: Blockbuster of the yearIt’s that time of the year when air conditioning and pop corn assume a larger role in our lives. Come summer cometh the time for blockbusters. The Avengers is easily as epic in anticipation as Avatar was two years ago. And just like the James Cameron magnum opus this ensemble superhero saga packs a big mean punch on visuals and setup but is as thin as hot air in its story.Marvel superheroes have gained steam over the past few years. The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have all made successful movie debuts. The culmination of all their success is one big movie franchise and it’s called The Avengers. To a comic book geek that’s the equivalent of drinking from the Holy Grail. To an action movie buff that’s like Arnold Schwarzenegger teaming up with Sylvester Stallone. For everybody else it’s a chance to experience $200 million well spent. Whatever is your calling, fact is The Avengers is a film a large part of the movie going populace would want to watch. It has all the trappings of a feature that entertains. It’s got heroes by the dozen. It’s got a wealth of comic book wit and punchy one-liners. And most importantly 75 per cent of its runtime is big booming action.Why does the world need four superheroes and two heroes teaming up? Because the problem at hand is cataclysmic. Aliens are opening a portal and planning a hostile takeover and they are being led by a demi-God. That is the number one and only problem with this mammoth of a film. The core idea of the story is not very novel. What makes up for that is some fine dialogue. Apart from super powers, sexy girlfriends and other miscellaneous benefits, the other reason we loved superheroes in comic books was for their wonderful sense of humour and ability to charm with witty dialogue. The Avengers is a winner on the front. The writers also do well to weave in continuity as they compile parallel storylines from different superhero sagas.The first half of the film is all build up and you’ll find yourself either amused with the juvenile humour or clutching your fist in elation at the various comic world references. And then in the second half the film gets a big green vaccine of chaotic energy. The Hulk makes an angry entrance and throws the proceedings into a state of maddening frenzy. The relentless action mixed with some potent 3D makes for some jaw dropping viewing.  By the end you’d have enough endorphins kicking in your system to make you jump with joy. When the superhero dust settles you’d have long forgotten any subconscious need for story. The film will sweep you off into a world where you’d be wishing for muscles and a cape. That’s a win win situation. We tailor your experience and understand how you and other visitors use this website by using cookies and other technologies.

"Aug 24, 2014"," Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America come together for the greatest gathering of superheroes of all time. Or, rather, the greatest gathering since the  last X-Men movie. And with this many Marvel crimefighters on the same screen, it’s little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience – one that’ll please both fanboys and the public at large. Following on from last year’s Thor flick, the demi-god’s evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is now intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that’ll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), the head of the peacekeeping Shield who sets about uniting the world’s superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the arrow-slinging Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and  the catsuit-clad spy Black Widow  (Scarlett Johansson). Given how most of the characters have had their own movies over the past few years, Avengers avoids the usual superhero trap of spending too much time on back stories, instead throwing us straight into the action. That initiative involves bringing together a team of superheroes - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), as well as human heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who must find a way to work together to save the planet. The first two films impressed fans, which was pretty hard to do given that the mutant team are real cult favourites. The third X-Man film was less than impressive while X-Men Origins: Wolverine offered occasional entertainment. A new Wolverine film is set to film in Australia. Christopher Nolan’s re-boot of career of the caped crusader proved to be a massive hit, with sequel The Dark Knight proving even more popular (mainly thanks to Heath Ledger’s version of The Joker). His trilogy ends with The Dark Knight Rises, which opens this summer. I have a sneaking fondness for Tim Burton’s Batman – which controversially starred Michael Keaton in the role – though the less said about George Clooney’s stint of Batman the better. The first in the series (which started in 1978 and ran through the 1980s) starring Christopher Reeve showed that superhero films could be popular. They got less and less impressive as the years went on and the fourth Reeve outing was pretty awful. The 2006 reboot Superman Returns was a modest success, and Zac Snyder (who made 300 and alternative superhero movie Watchmen) is having another go at the concept, with Henry Cavill slipping on the tights for Man of Steel, which opens next year. A smart and clever bit of Disney animation that really get the super-hero mythology spot on as well as having a whole lot of fun along the way. Cult hero Spider-Man (aka mild-mannered photographer Peter Parker) arrived on the big screen in 2002 in the first of three fantastically popular films, though the character will be re-launched this year in The Amazing Spider-Man, starring Brit Andrew Garfield in the lead role. A wonderful bit of dark and dangerous superhero action, with Ron Perlman spot-on as the demonic superhero Hellboy, who has appeared in two films directed by Guillermo del Toro. Other strong contenders might include Iron Man, Blade, The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, The Crow, Darkman and even the wonderfully camp Swamp Thing. Likely bottom on any list, though, will be the likes of Green Lantern, Constantine and Daredevil…all of which failed to set fan-boy hearts racing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2014","This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 24, 2014"," AVENGERS Assemble is the long awaited big screen team-up of Marvel superheroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). AVENGERS Assemble is the long awaited big screen team-up of Marvel superheroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Our heroes are brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) when the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army threaten to bring about the end of the entire human race. Since the first Iron Man movie in 2008 this is what Marvel Studios have been building towards and I’m delighted to report that this film has been more than worth the wait. Buffy the Vampire Slayer director Joss Whedon is the brave man to take on this colossal project and the creative visionary strikes a perfect balance between action, storytelling and tugging at various emotions. Downey Jr. is hilarious but also shows his heart when the going gets tough, Evans’ Captain impressively takes charge of the team, third big screen Hulk Ruffalo is the best yet, and the charismatic Hemsworth picks up where he left off in Thor. Johansson is as good as she’s been in a long while and Hiddleston’s villain is deliciously chilling, particularly in a verbal assault of Black Widow. Whedon’s action sequences are first rate. It’s hard to pick out a highlight as there are so many; Loki’s early attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. The assault on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The nearly half-hour long Manhattan set finale. Hulk v Thor!! Nice extra touches include classical music playing over Loki’s strike on a high society ball in Stuttgart and Whedon’s swooping camera during the climactic battle showcasing every Avenger in action, one after the other. The film is quite action-heavy, and the climax a bit Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but we’ve had the build-up in previous individual character movies. If you haven’t seen those films then you might struggle to follow certain story elements but, let’s face it, why wouldn't you have treated yourself to watching them? (sorry, that may just be my comic book head being all presumptuous). Whedon also wrote the story in collaboration with Zak Penn and fantastical it may be, but they never lose sight of the threat posed (lots of use of the word “war”). Is Avengers Assemble the best comic book film ever? That’s a tough call but it’s certainly the most exciting, and a true epic moment in cinematic history. The comic book movie has definitely reached dizzying new heights and nothing can possibly... wait, hang on, The Dark Knight Rises is out on July 20.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2014"," That's why ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is so immensely satisfying. We want our heroes to be smart, quick-witted and saying interesting things. We want them to be courageous and confident and complicated, a balance of internal conflict and external bravado. We want to see them test the limits of their extraordinary abilities and save the world in spite of their flaws. Whedon, a longtime reader and writer of comics, gets all this right. Giving him a $220 million budget and the freedom to direct and write (Zak Penn also gets story credit) this megablockbuster conglomeration of Marvel Comics superheroes was a wise move. Four of his heroes – Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk – were previously established by directors who generally know what they’re doing behind the camera, but only Whedon has truly demonstrated what tickles a legion of funnybook readers. Not that “Avengers” is for diehards only. Whedon’s ability to pen sharp dialogue, develop character and construct clear, consequential action sequences (including one doozy of a third-act battlemageddon) assures inclusivity. The cult of Whedonites who have for years worshiped his whip-smart TV work - “Buffy the Vampire Slayer, “Firefly,” etc. - will surely gloat that they expected cinematic greatness from the guy all along, given the opportunity and the right project. “Avengers” feels perfect for him. It’s a lively, vibrant, colorful and wildly entertaining piece of pop filmmaking. Yes, he brings the action hard, fast, heavy and often. But he manages to prove that an abundance of personalities on screen need not be the cluttered messes of “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” and “Batman” features past. Whedon gives each Avenger a convincing character convolution: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., ever the sparkplug) learns to set aside ego to work with a team. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a man lost in this era, a former World War II hero recently thawed from a block of Antarctic ice after decades of stasis. Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton from 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk”) constantly contends with his doozy of a Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome, and calls the big green beast inside him “the other guy.” Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is more compelling here than in his headlining feature, dealing with the guilt of unwittingly leading his power-hungry brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Earth. Loki, who’s dastardly and cackling and as arrogant as 1,000 housecats, warps to Earth from Asgard and steals the tesseract, an artifact that will facilitate the delivery of an alien army across the universe to conquer and/or destroy, like, everything. His plan dovetails with that of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who, as established in the preceding Marvel films, intends to bring together the aforementioned superdudes, hoping they’ll be greater than the sum of their parts. Fury is the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the world’s most powerful and covert collaboration of spies, headquartered on, of course, a flying, invisible aircraft carrier. Whatever. Plot contrivances matter not, as long as the Avengers assemble, right? Problem is, they’re a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a very big, green loose cannon. Complicating the dynamic are two skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agents: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a dead-eye archer who’s initially brain-zapped and made one of Loki’s drones. And Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), despite seeming puny in comparison to the laser guns and unbreakable shields and sacred hammers and raging ids of her teammates, is an espionage artist, as skilled at interrogation as she is at filling a tight outfit. But years of skullduggery and assassination mean she and Hawkeye have more blood on their hands than their brightly costumed compadres. Fury is the Whedon analog here – it’s a monumental task to bring many disparate elements together into a cohesive and functional whole, and that’s why “Avengers” feels like such a victory. Is it perfect? No. The first act finds Whedon struggling to find his tonal footing, and a couple of plot holes are, shall we say, hulking. But when revved up, the film is an exhilarating blend of comedy, thrills and wonderment to meet the demands and slake the desires of millions of fanboys. Of all the comic-book movies in the modern era, “Avengers” is the comic-bookiest. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Aug 24, 2014"," This bumper pack of superheroes from Marvel will be catnip to the nerd army of comic-book fans and a just-about-tolerable two and a half hours to the unconverted. Joss Whedon, fresh from The Cabin in the Woods, has a decent command of pace and an obvious relish for the possibilities of a pecking order among characters previously answerable to nothing but their own potency. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. Trouble starts when a glowing cube called the Tesseract is appropriated by god of misrule Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who with a poke from his magic spear brainwashes a crack marksman (Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist (Stellan Skarsgård) into his evil scheme of world domination. In response Nick Fury (Samuel L.Jackson), head of international peacekeeping, summons a few good supermen: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner aka The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Loki's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and, keeping the feminist end up, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Sorting out the backstories and getting all these guys into one room means that the first half of the film is pretty talky, though Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some smart one-liners and comebacks, most of them courtesy of Downey Jr, the flash, flip prankster of the bunch. It's when battle commences and the supertoys come out of the box that non-committed viewers might find their attention wandering. Immoveable objects can only encounter irresistible forces so many times before it becomes a bit routine. Hammer of Thor versus the bulk of Hulk? Who cares? Once the faceless alien hordes descend to earth it's even harder to feel involved, or to know precisely what's at stake: the way Manhattan gets tossed about like a salad makes you wonder if any part of it will be worth saving. Of course it's about one hundred times brighter than Transformers and Michael Bay's imbecilic spinoffs, and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip. But I didn't love it.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 24, 2014"," ""Unhappy the land that has no heroes!"" someone remarks to Bertolt Brecht's Galileo. ""No. Unhappy the land that needs heroes,"" Galileo replies. And if superheroes are multiples of the ordinary variety, the world as perceived by Hollywood is currently in as dire straits as it was during the great depression when the comic-strip masked avengers were first created. Joss Whedon, a major hero to Tinseltown's accountants, and Marvel Comics' movie division have come up with the wheeze of bringing together six of Marvel's superheroes (Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America and the lesser-known Hawkeye and Black Widow) to confront Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the evil trickster of Norse folklore. He's slipped through a crack in the universe and stolen the all-powerful Cosmic Cube. In the course of defeating his megalomaniac schemes, much of midtown Manhattan is destroyed along with several thousand people, though happily the Chrysler building survives. The special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative, and the film is unduly protracted. The superheroes and supervillain Loki get all the jokes, which pop out of their heads like bubbles in a comic strip. This leaves Stellan Skarsgård, the inventor of the Cosmic Cube and Samuel L Jackson, head of the international peacekeeping agency Shield, to do solemn and serious, which they deliver in a suitably straight-faced manner. Karl Marx could have been anticipating 9/11 and this movie when he said that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 2, 2013"," Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" joins the rarefied company of ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Superman 2,"" ""Iron Man"" and even Tim Burton's ""Batman"" as contenders for the title of Greatest Movie Ever Based on Comic Book Superheroes. Six superheroes, their one-eyed boss and a super villain vie for our attentions in ""The Avengers,"" and uber-director/writer Joss Whedon never allows them to pile up in a muddled mess. Here comes the first movie since Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to begin where many movies end, and to move with such alacrity that there's no time for restroom stops and concession counter visits. I caught ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (the proprietary title is to distinguish it from the 1998 British spy bomb ""The Avengers"" with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes) Monday in a packed house of franchise-friendly fans burbling with euphoric joy at every comic put-down and triumphant act, and those are legion in this movie. Remember that blue energy box found in the ocean at the end of last year's ""Captain America""? (Of course, you do. It's called the Tesseract.) Thor's megalomaniac half-brother god Loki (Tom Hiddleston, recalling too much of Alan Rickman's Euro-trash villain from ""Die Hard"") steals the Tesseract as part of his plan to lead an invasion of Earth to subjugate all humans. The story's real conflict involves S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) struggling to get six superheroes to work together and save Earth as part of his controversial ""Avengers Initiative."" These guys fight each other so often, we almost forget about Loki lurking around. They're a bunch of suspicious, infighting misfits ruled by ego, resentment and good, old-fashioned American individualism. Iron Man, aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is the sassiest Avenger, quick with an insult (he refers to Thor as ""Shakespeare in the park"") and proud that he ""doesn't play well with others."" Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, superb as a control freak) is a key member because of his experience with gamma rays - the same ones that turn him into the raging Hulk when agitated. Curvy Russian assassin Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, the single fem in the bunch), moves like a leopard, although she appears to be the only superhero here who, like Batman, has no discernible super powers. The sixth Avenger, the archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), has fallen under the control of Loki and his mystical spear. (This handy weapon works not only as a blade, but as a rocket-launcher, machine gun, truth serum and stylish personal accessory.) ""The Avengers"" jets along with a zippy 142-minute running time with Whedon in complete control of this impressive movie, a worthy payoff for Marvel fans who've patiently waited through mediocre films (""Thor,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" ""Hulk"") for a truly super superhero experience. Just as a diverse and divided American populace became a unified force following the assault on New York City more than a decade ago, the six Avengers likewise drop their petty differences when faced with a deadly attack against the Big Apple. That's why the movie's most emotional moment occurs not during the final battle, but just before, when the divided superheroes come together to fight for a cause more important than themselves.",POSITIVE

"Jun 30, 2013"," After a series of films that introduced many of the Marvel characters to moviegoers worldwide, search  the long-awaited blockbuster that brings the crew together is in theaters now. Featuring beloved comic book characters like Thor, check  Captain America, Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the new film brings the super-powered team together to battle Thor’s evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army. The movie begins where many of the other films end: with the individual heroes living their own separate lives but on the brink of coming together to form one unit. Fate and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jacskon), the director of a secret agency known as SHIELD, eventually bring this disparate team of do-gooders together. Thor’s evil brother Loki is planning to use a cube of energy for his diabolical plan for world nomination and Fury is eager to stop him. As the story’s menacing monster, Loki speaks like a super-villain in waiting. “I am burdened with glorious purpose,” he says followed by “Freedom is life’s greatest lie.” Fury knows that such a nemesis is more than just what one superhero can face so he recruits a team known as “The Avengers.” This alliance includes several characters who have previously been introduced in their own individual films. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Downey Jr.) are here along with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and newcomer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Also on the crew is The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) whose story was introduced in two previous films which featured different actors in the main role. There’s a lot to enjoy about this new film, including the invaluable input of Joss Whedon. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator directed The Avengers and the screenplay with the help of Zak Penn(X-Men: The Last Stand) . For fans of Whedon’s work—he’s the creator behind Angel, Firefly and others– his touch is evident throughout the story. From witty one-liners to the great climactic action sequence, viewers will recognize Whedon’s strengths throughout the film’s nearly two and a half hour running time. But The Avengers, despite its many positive attributes, never achieves greatness. Loki, for one, often feels like an unworthy opponent. This sour sibling simply seems to want revenge against his brother and despite some of his memorable never really stands out as a memorable opponent. He’s more fleshed-out here than he was in Thor but the character still leaves a bit to be desired despite a few great scenes showing him locked in capitivity. Admittedly, The Avengers never offers a great plot or a strong story. The cube of energy at the center of the fighting leaves a lot to the imagination. What it does offer though will appease fans of summer films. Many of the action scenes are great and the main characters—especially Iron Man—are fun to watch. Plus, there’s a sheer joy in seeing these Marvel characters join forces to defeat a bad guy. When the team stops destroying itself, they inevitably come together as one and the scene where they stand as one unit on the street almost gave me chills. That’s more than I can say for most summer blockbusters but I did expect more from The Avengers. Despite a noble and noteworthy effort, this film never fulfills all of its potential and never achieves the status that superhero classics like The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 have already achieved.",POSITIVE

"Jun 20, 2013"," A superhero movie for the Super PAC era, the Marvel Comics all-star revue, The Avengers, reminds us that there’s still strength in numbers, at least where the fortunes of the Walt Disney Company (which is distributing the film as part of a long-term deal with Marvel) are concerned. Even before opening in the U.S., The Avengers has already racked up an impressive $300 million—or roughly $30 million more than the beleaguered John Carter earned in its entire release—and far be it from me to begrudge this superhero smorgasbord its success. It also arrives on a tide of enormous fanboy expectation and enthusiasm, and the early reviews have suggested that the fans are indeed pleased. But is that the sound of genuine excitement or merely relief? Co-written and directed by Joss Whedon, the wunderkind behind TV’s Buffy: The Vampire Slayer and Firefly, The Avengers is a slickly entertaining package that manages to keep a lot of balls in the air—mini-sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, plus yet another reboot of The Incredible Hulk—with agility (if not exactly flair), occasional flashes of wit, and a modicum of charm. After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind. As Hulk-sized “tentpole” movies go—those that have all of Hollywood’s resources at their disposal and the fates of entire studios in their hands—you could certainly do worse. Maybe I’m just being overly nostalgic for the bygone days of summer movies past. Like the summers of 2008 and 2011, when the first Iron Man and Captain America pictures surprised with their genuine comic-book panache and—dare I say—lyricism. Though more modestly scaled than The Avengers, both were supremely enjoyable pop entertainments featuring a lot of old-fashioned movie craftsmanship (bold primary colors; action delineated into crisp, clean widescreen panels) courtesy of directors Jon Favreau and Joe Johnston—and, moreover, characters you could actually care about. The Marvel universe has always been rich in superheroes who remain decidedly flawed, vulnerable humans beneath the fancy get-ups and genetically enhanced musculature, and those movies managed to translate them to the screen along with a lot of high-tech wizardry and lo-fi genre love.  You didn’t have to be a comics fan per se to share in Tony Stark’s euphoria (and faint terror) as he tried to get the hang of his rocket-powered super suit for the first time, or to mourn with Steve Rogers over the death of his best friend. In The Avengers, the characters are the same, as are the actors playing them, but you don’t care about them as much because the movie itself doesn’t. It doesn’t reveal new layers to the characters or deepen our understanding of them in the way of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Superman II, and The Dark Knight. This time, it’s mostly all business. The tesseract—that all-powerful glowing cube last seen nearly winning WWII for the Nazis in Captain America—has resurfaced in present-day New York, where none other than Loki (the nefarious “frost giant” last seen falling into an interstellar abyss at the end of last summer’s execrable Thor) hopes to harness its energy to amass a drone army and open a portal between our world and his. Meanwhile, that suave superhero headhunter Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets about rounding up his elite troops and briefing them on their mission. Of the lot, only The Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) needs any real convincing, and it’s Ruffalo—stepping into the shoes vacated most recently by Edward Norton—who gives the The Avengers what personality it has. Perhaps because he’s new to the role, Ruffalo is the only actor in the film who’s allowed any significant scenes that don’t serve simply to keep the plot chugging along, and he makes the most of them to create an endearingly awkward Banner who seems perpetually uncomfortable in his own skin, whether white or green. The rest of the movie cries out for some quiet, character-building moments—or at least more crazy cameos on par with the great Polish auteur Jerzy Skolimowski as a Russian heavy who meets up with the wrong side of Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow. What, for example, does Captain America, who has recently awoken from a decades-long slumber, make of this whole big, crazy, mixed-up modern world? Television has always been hailed as a writer’s medium, driven by storytelling as opposed to visual grandeur, with the director on hand mainly to execute the writer’s wishes, never deviating too much from the established style of a successful series. Even in recent years, as television screens—and budgets—have grown larger, the writer has generally remained the master of this domain. And as audiences have found these series more consistently intelligent and entertaining than most of the movie studios’ commercial product, it’s no surprise that their creators—J.J. Abrams, Judd Apatow, Whedon—have been courted to write and direct movies. (Next up: David Chase.) This may ultimately prove to be a good thing, but for now it is bringing us a lot of movies that look and feel like big-screen television. (It was only with his third feature, last summer’s Super 8, that Abrams finally seemed fully in command of the new medium.) The Avengers is rife with scenes that can be deemed “spectacular”—not least the climactic superhero rumble on the streets of Midtown Manhattan, during which that aforementioned portal in the sky opens up and unleashes enormous winged serpents that look like the love children of the alien from Alien and the spaceship from Alien. Hell appears to have quite literally broken loose, and yet for all his technical skill as a director (or at least his skill in surrounding himself with top-tier artisans) Whedon never really thinks in terms of images—the visuals are secondary to the story, and since the story itself is subpar, you notice this all the more. The Avengers has the polished, professional, but completely flat, anonymous look of a mid-Eighties James Bond picture. Throughout, I couldn’t stop wondering what an inspired creative force like Brad Bird might have done with this material. Then I remembered that he’d already done it: it’s called The Incredibles. In one of those stranger-than-fiction tales from the Hollywood front lines, the legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray once wrote a script for Columbia Pictures entitled The Alien, about a gentle extraterrestrial who strikes up a friendship with a  young boy in a rural Bengali village after his spaceship crashes there. Although the film was never produced, Ray himself saw more than a few lipstick traces of his scenario in Steven Spielberg’s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (a movie that began life as a Columbia production), though he declined to press any formal charges. There are no aliens in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, only Indians, but judging from the reaction of a cadre of British pensioners newly arrived in Jaipur, there isn’t much difference. An Avengers for the Cocoon generation, this postcolonial, culture-clash burlesque stars Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and assorted other acting treasures of the Realm as the latest tenants of the titular B&B, a family-run resort whose reality turns out to be considerably less than the sum of its carefully photoshopped parts. They include Dame Judi as a widow forced to sell her London apartment to pay off her husband’s debts, a couple (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) whose daughter invested their retirement nest egg in an Internet start-up that never started up, an old playboy (Ronald Pickup) looking for one more fling, and a retired High Court judge (Tom Wilkinson) searching for the India he knew as a young man. “Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses?” Dench asks in one of her character’s narrated diary entries. Well, definitely not in the eyes of screenwriter Ol Parker (adapting Deborah Moggach’s novel These Foolish Things) and director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love). Their India is a nonstop barrage of blaring sitar music, screeching horns, chattering street urchins, blinding sunlight, and enveloping dust—to say nothing of the obligatory spotty plumbing and electricity, and stomach-churning cuisine. At the center of it all is none other than the Slumdog Millionaire himself, Dev Patel, shucking and jiving his way through a truly embarrassing performance as the hotel’s harried, quixotic proprietor (who comes complete with a domineering mother and an unwanted arranged marriage). By the time the resident racist spinster (Smith) makes friends with an untouchable servant girl, I felt certain that the esteemed Mr. Ray was spinning in his grave. Like a lot of movies that pitch themselves to supposedly “underserved” audiences—blacks, women, the elderly—The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel traffics in the very hoary stereotypes it ostensibly sets out to debunk. It’s a movie about finding purpose in life, late in life, that makes its point by first subjecting its characters to the most reductive grumpy-old-men/women shenanigans. These characters aren’t just old—they’re defined by their age, imprisoned by it, seemingly unable to talk or think about anything else. And yet the actors on screen are themselves vibrant evidence that life doesn’t end at 60, 70, or even 80. They—and India—deserve better.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 8, 2013"," Yesterday was a red-letter day in my mailbox. Next to an invite from American Express and a copy of Leslie Feinberg's Drag King Dreams (ordered from swapabook.com) lay a Netflix red-and-white envelope that I quickly ripped open. Inside: The Avengers DVD that I had forgotten I'd requested. Eureka! My evening had unexpectedly become free an hour before, and here was a cinematic event I had missed out on. What true joy! From what I had heard, on this 4-1/2-inch silver platter was imprinted the Super Heroes event of the decade. Well, at least the best one not helmed by Christopher Nolan. After all, it had a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, beating out Fellini's Amacord by two points and Pasolini's Teorema by six. I immediately elevatored upstairs, then prepared a major salad and a huge Teeccino. Settling in front of my 24-inch MAC along with my edibles, I inserted the disc, and mentally prepared myself to be transported by Marvel Marvelousness to a realm where good conquers bad, where there are copious amounts of inventive destruction, and where the visuals will employ the latest developments in special effects wizardry. All will be laced together by an unbridled intelligence, witty dialogue, and some sort of underlying philosophy that will set ten-year-old viewers on the path to becoming forty-year-old peacemongers. For example, John F. Kennedy's ""Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind."" Well, after five minutes of irksome ads for Marvel goodies, the feature began. . .with a limp. Over some ominous music by Alan Silvestri, The Other (Alexis Denisof) announces, like a Darth-Vader wannabe, ""The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world, a human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri, will follow. A world will be his. The universe, yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"" Not forewarned, I had no notion that The Avengers was ""the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"" and I, or any viewer, really should have viewed the previous five to be up to snuff, plus read a few dozen of the comics on which they were based. But I was up to snuff, having seen all previous entries and, most importantly Thor (2011), to which The Avengers is basically a sequel -- and I was still discombobulated. You see, in Thor, Prince Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the ""brother"" of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), discovers he is adopted, a revelation that aggravates him to no end and causes the young man to commit patricide. Then when he doesn't become king of Asgard, ""apoplectic""would really best describe his demeanor, especially after his sibling defeats him in an epic battle. To prevent this from occurring, Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor, and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will have to join forces under the leadership of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and coordinator of the ""Avenger Initiative."" Of course, we all know there will be a happy ending, but why does getting there have to be so generic? There's nothing basically new in The Avengers, nothing that hasn't been done much better elsewhere. Take the early car chase scenes where the villains are escaping with the Tesseract. If you want to see thrilling highway escapades, check out the Terminator series or any Jason Bourne offering. ""Is this not simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."" Angela Merkel might start bristling when she views this scene, but have no fear, gnadige Frau, Neo-Nazi supervillains have nothing on Captain America and Iron Man, and German honor is revenged. But one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs after Thor grabs Loki out of a plane from the clutches of our heroes. Iron Man immediately pursues, and Captain America gets ready, but is warned by Black Widow to be cautious. Ah, monotheism versus paganism. Can they exist side by side? Clearly, Thor is a god, which proves Cap'n America wrong. Or can we have an existence where both gods and a God rule side by side? Metaphysics aside, is The Avengers a great film or just one more pea in the comic-book-industry pod? And why have Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger all seemed so slight to me when I've watched them over the past year on my computer? Quite possibly these ""event"" pictures need a huge screen and a pounding sound system to convince viewers of their worth. After all, the folks at Marvel would hardly deny that these movies are basically products created to sell more Marvel products. But some films work really quite well on a screen of diminished proportions including last year's Arbitrage with Richard Gere and even the more visual Moonrise Kingdom. They hold the viewer because there is more meat to chew on their bones. Even Dustin's Hoffman's Quartet, which could use a tiny bit more bite, warms the cockles of one's heart because the grand foursome of Maggie Smith, Tom Courtney, Billy Connoly, and Pauline Collins let loose from beginning to end with their well-seasoned actors' chops. And a masterpiece such as Chantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles works sublimely on even an iPhone. All of which comes down the fact that with in the next few weeks, I'm purchasing my first really humongous flat screen TV. I'm going to be prepared for Iron Man III. ",POSITIVE

"Oct 2, 2012","  Marvel's The Avengers is not just a film - it's a cinematic event. The culmination of half a decade of movie-making, five different films introducing us to characters, stories and worlds of Marvel's shared movie universe - not to mention, the life-long hopes of fanboys and fangirls all over the world, who have been dreaming to see their favorite superheroes onscreen together long before Marvel Studios began making it a reality.   Now that the Avengers is here, the question is: Does writer/director Joss Whedon (Serenity) deliver a film that lives up to fans' massive expectations and functions as a great summer blockbuster for causal moviegoers?   We are thrust right into the story at the point where the respective lead-in films - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America - left off, by learning just what has befallen Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) after his plunge into the abyss at the end of Thor. We find Loki holed up in a strange netherworld (or ""realm""), hosted by a dark and mysterious ""ally"" who promises him re-entry to Earth and an alien army in exchange for securing the ""Tesseract"" (the cosmic cube seen in Captain America) from the humans who have claimed it (i.e., the covert peacekeeping organization, S.H.I.E.L.D.). Armed with a new weapon that can fire energy and brainwash unwilling subjects, Loki heads for Earth.    The only thing standing in the trickster god's way? S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the various superheroes included in his ""Avengers Initiative."" Fury manages to gather Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and super spies Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Through otherworldly machinations, even Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is able to return to Earth, charged with capturing his sibling and the Tesseract for return to Asgard.   But Loki isn't called ""the god of mischief"" for nothing. Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sewing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet - or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?   The Avengers is very much a Joss Whedon product - and is much better off for being so. If you're not familiar with the geek-centric writer/filmmaker, he was the mind behind the '90s Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, the short-lived (but much-loved) sci-fi show Firefly, its movie spinoff, Serenity, famous Internet musicals (Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) and even some acclaimed comic book series (Astonishing X-Men).   Whedon was chosen to head this project primarily for his love of comic book culture and its characters. Speaking as a comic book fan, it's clear from watching Avengers that Whedon is in tune with every single one of the superheroes (and villains) in Marvel's stables, and knows how to arrange those personalities into a well-balanced ensemble - like a perfectly assembled puzzle (no pun). He also accomplishes the impressive feat of tying all of the plot-threads of the solo films together into a (semi-)coherent story, while briefly acknowledging various dangling threads (whereabouts of certain supporting characters, etc.) without allowing them to strangle this team-based story.   Through those various solo films we've gotten to know smarmy Tony Stark, old-fashioned idealist Captain America, arrogant Thor, sultry Black Widow and the uncontrollable Hulk.  Avengers takes things a step further by showing us how these characters are growing and evolving - and better yet, growing and evolving because of their interactions with one another.   For all of the impressive action (more on that later), the best moments in Avengers are arguably the slower, character-driven scenes. Whedon's penchant for snappy dialogue is on full display, and it's a great experience to see, (for example) Tony Stark and Dr. Banner talking in high-science dialect no one else in the room understands - or debating the value of the traumas that made them both into tragic heroes. Small touches, but moments that feel true, interesting, and rewarding in a way that few people (fan or non-fan) will likely expect.   Equally unexpected (but just as rewarding) is the humor in the film. We get the usual smattering of one-liners and overly-dramatic monologues and dialogue that can only come from a comic book - but there is also sharp wit and total self-awareness woven into Whedon's script. Avengers strikes a tonal balance similar to that of Iron Man - i.e., light and fun for the most part, understatedly serious in the heavy moments (and Avengers does have some heavy moments, rest assured).   The best humor comes out of well-timed tongue-in-cheek winks  - i.e., how strong certain characters are, how these characters behave, the context in which we find them (ex: Cap and Thor being fish-out-of-water types in the modern world), acknowledgement of how the 'real world' is juxtaposed to the concept of superheroes - and other great insights that work as sly winks to comic book fans and generally fun moments for casual viewers to enjoy in between action sequences.   Speaking of action: Avengers has some pretty impressive sequences - especially the climatic final battle against Loki's invading army, which is definitely the best ""boss battle"" that has been featured in any Marvel movie since Incredible Hulk. Those worried about Marvel's track record for underwhelming climaxes need not: by the time the battle is won, you will have been exhausted by the combination of iconic comic book imagery (The Avengers Assembled or working together in battle) and impressive big-screen eye-candy. The film has about four big set pieces (it's still somewhat rigid and obvious in its structuring), but all of them deliver the goods and keep the movie exciting from start to finish.   As far as characters go, Avengers is the best rendering of Marvel superheroes on the big screen since RDJ let his charisma carry Iron Man to success. What's surprising about the film is who ends up standing out the most: Black Widow and Hulk are the characters best served by Avengers, and audiences will almost certainly walk away with greater appreciation for both. (Johansson even gets a few chances to mock her detractors.) Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark schtick is as entertaining as ever (if not overly familiar by now) and he handles the difficult task of keeping things fun whenever they threaten to get too serious or comic book silly; without that cog in the machine (no pun), Avengers wouldn't function nearly as well. Captain America and Thor are given moments to shine, but their presence is much more reserved and understated in this film - though we do finally get to see the power that makes Thor worthy of being called a god.   Supporting players like Nick Fury and his assistants Agent Coulson (Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) are just that: support. Jackson and Gregg are well-experienced with making the most out of a little in these Marvel films, but Smulders is mostly just window dressing. Hawkeye (Renner) is the one member of the actual Avengers team who is somewhat underserved - though that is something of a necessary evil, given how he factors into the story. As a villain, Tom Hiddleston makes Loki even more compelling than he was in Thor, this time infusing him with psychotic rage hidden behind a veneer of charm, smooth words and dimpled smiles (think Hannibal Lector with super villain aspirations). Of course, as a physical threat Loki isn't that intimidating - hence the endless leagues of indistinguishable aliens who are thrown into the third act for The Avengers to beat on.   Now for the downsides (because there are a few): the story is very flimsy and predictable in terms of its overarching plot, and the big ""reveals"" in the film are likely to confuse those who haven't read a ton of comic books (NOTE: there are two extra scenes during and after the credits - make sure to stay for both). For all the satisfying action, Avengers demonstrates that Whedon still has something to learn about space and angles when it comes to movie direction. A lot of the sequences still have a very ""TV"" feel to them - and on the whole, Avengers plays like several episodes of a very well-built TV series, rather than a feature film that has truly ""cinematic"" moments in it. There are a few, but only a few.   However, the few drawbacks and criticisms aren't enough to stop The Avengers from delivering a fun and satisfying time at the movies. Whedon leaves the characters in some great places for their upcoming second (or third) round of solo adventures - with the door to the larger Marvel movie universe left wide open for some interesting (and risky) developments down the road. I'm sure fans will be debating those points all along the way.   The Avengers is now playing in theaters everywhere. It is Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, and a mild drug reference.

"Sep 27, 2012"," When it comes to superheroes, cinema spent several decades playing catch-up to the boundless imaginations of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the other legends of the comic book universe. The film studios could buy up the rights to all the characters and storylines that they wanted but technology often let them down. What could be inked on the page by the artists at Marvel and DC could not always be matched on the movie screen. However good the resulting film turned out to be (and there were a few winners) it would normally entail some poor actor looking faintly ridiculous in a costume whilst hanging from wires or lying on their belly in front of a back projection. The leaps and bounds in computer technology changed all that and has meant regular raids on the comic book back catalogue over the last fifteen years or so. Caped crusaders of all forms became increasingly important weapons in Hollywood’s summer arsenal. If you were to continue this analogy, then The Avengers is a WMD of a movie. From an FX perspective, this ultimate hero team-up represents some of the best work done by WETA since they breathed life into Middle Earth at the turn of the twenty-first century. The effects in The Avengers are simply astounding. This is not just a case of believing that a man can fly but that he can don a suit of mechanical armour whilst plummeting from the top of a skyscraper or level a forest with one blow of a mighty hammer. All this magic is rendered so real that even the hardened cynics out there would find it hard not to be impressed. The Avenger had little choice but to be great. The build-up to it has been immense since the release of the first Iron Man in 2008. Since then, each of the core Avengers has stepped up to the plate with The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America each taking their turn. Their eponymous adventures all had varying degrees of merit but for audience members who risked the withering looks of cinema staff by staying behind to watch the post-credit teasers, there was a hint of things to come. The Avengers is not strictly a sequel but having had the back stories of several characters already established allows director Joss Whedon to plough straight into the action. Believe me; we are talking about some serious action. Barely ten minutes into the film and the headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D – the military organisation run by monocular bad-ass Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) – is obliterated by the power of a device called the Tesseract. This is the cosmic cube which cropped up in both Thor and Captain America. Depending on which side of the good guy/bad guy divide you happen to be on, the Tesseract either represents a new source of sustainable energy or a key to unlocking a door to the other end of the universe and letting in alien nasties. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the grinning wicked brother of Thor, falls firmly in the latter camp. He plans to use the Tesseract to take over the world with the assistance of an extra-terrestrial army. With Loki on the rise, it is time for Fury to roll out the Avengers Initiative and bring together the greatest heroes on Earth (subject to contractual obligations) in order to save the human race. “How desperate are you?” enquires Loki of his opponent. “You have made me very desperate,” growls Fury in response. The talent roster is impressive. There is the Norse God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), wartime poster boy Captain America (Chris Evans), human shaped shrapnel Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) aka The Incredible Hulk. But that’s not all, they are joined by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who does not really have any super powers other than looking amazing in a LBD. She can kick butt with the best of them though and plays a pivotal part in saving the day. There is also the super slick bowman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who makes for another great character. This is a mission movie without the need for a training montage as the team members are already match fit. What they do need to learn though is how to get along with each other after initial meetings result in a clash of enormous egos as well as fists. In an act of fidelity to the source material, the Avengers do not just fight the enemy, they also battle each other. The dust-up between Iron Man and Thor is especially impressive. Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark (the man within the iron) takes particular pleasure in needling his fellow heroes and only really clicks with like-minded technical whizz Banner. The placid, mumbling doctor who normally looks like he has slept in late, or perhaps that is just Mark Ruffalo, is the big green elephant in the room. Wind him up just that bit too much and you might unleash the Hulk, and then you have real problems. The generally strong cast helps to install human hearts in the supernatural bodies. These are tough guys but they also experience guilt, grief and even fear. Admittedly, Downey Jr. gets to steal the show a bit as the smart-talking Stark but each actor does well with what they are given. Thor is a trickier role to make believable thanks to his “Shakespeare in the park” dialogue but this allows the opportunity for some fish out of water humour. The real danger of the film, that there would not be enough room for each character to make an impact, is happily avoided. Plus, there are welcome returns for Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark’s long suffering lady friend and Clark Gregg as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson. Look out too for nice cameos from a couple of older but familiar faces from other fantasy classics. The race to find the Tesseract is the chord on which to hang some superb action set-pieces, including an attack on S.H.I.E.L.D’s flying fortress and a climatic showdown on and above the streets of Manhattan. This gloriously destructive mayhem, in which our heroes seem severely outgunned by a legion of terrors from outer space, is deftly handled by Whedon and is hugely exciting stuff. The smirk on the Hulk’s face when he is finally given permission to “smash” is a moment to savour. Needless to say he does not have to be told twice. The Avengers also has some very funny moments, several playing on the slightly absurd predicament of being a super being on an ordinary planet. Yet, though everyone here is clearly having a lot of fun, the film never stoops to cheap mockery or camp silliness thanks to an overall respect for spirit of the original comics. If you are a committed hater of all things comic book then this film may do nothing to change your mind. If you like comics then you will no doubt love this, unless you are one of those types who arrive at a film with a detailed check list of expectations and consider any deviation to be a crime against the genre. Anyone else, even if you have never read a comic in your life, should really enjoy The Avengers. The film certainly sets a challenge for The Dark Knight Rises later this year, although that will be much more down and dirty of course. The big question now is what the Avengers could possibly do for an encore? There is a suggestion mid-way through the credits of who their next opponent might be but in the meantime, The Avengers is terrific stuff and should be seen by anyone who loves a good time at the movies.",POSITIVE

The first issue that the Avengers must address is the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who reprises his role of “Thor” and whom you may recognize from “War Horse”), the jealous adopted brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth, straight from “The Cabin in the Woods” and from his first portrayal of “Thor”). Loki breaks into SHIELD headquarters to steal the Tesseract, a hub of extreme power, and he also takes with him Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) can’t stop Loki by himself, so he calls in the troops: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, the successor to the role after Edward Norton in the 2008 movie and Eric Bana in the woefully underseen “Hulk” from 2003) and of course Thor. But Loki has a major trick up his sleeve, and it makes Loki himself look puny in comparison to the destruction that is to follow. Iron Man and Thor don’t exactly hit it off. Most of the crew members are just plain leery of Banner, whose Hulk persona is dangerous and unpredictable. Captain America continues to try to find his place in contemporary times. And egos continue to clash. The action is pulse-pounding, and all the more so if you see it in 3D. This is the stuff for which well-developed 3D is made: In-your-face movement and amazing battles. And there are two “extra” scenes, one during the early credit roll and another at the very, very end that’s a nod to something Iron Man says earlier in the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jun 22, 2012"," And if Dr Bruce Banner can come out of self-imposed exile to join Marvel's THE AVENGERS, than I really ought to be able to review some movies again. Let's go. After roughly four years of movie-length commercials for The Avengers (formerly known as: Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger) ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" have finally assembled. To fans of the superhero genre, this probably feels like an impossible dream realized. To non-fans of the superhero genre this might play like the perfect time for a showstopping climax -take a bow and give mere mortals some movies again! The latter group should brace themselves. This particular blockbuster is lively enough to greenlight an even bigger movie family of men (and hopefully some women) in tights. MORE AFTER THE JUMP... Marvel wisely handed the reigns over to writer/director Joss Whedon who is still best known for creating one of the greatest TV shows of all time (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and who has only directed one previous feature (Serenity). Though I'm a big Whedon believer, the opening moments worried me.  The film starts with a brief but dull outerspace prologue designed to tell us that the Earth will soon be threatened (Duh! The superheroes have to protect the world from something). Without context this unfortunately brings Green Lantern's information overload opening to mind though it's happily the last completely useless scene in the film. Once Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals the glowing cube of power known as the Tesseract from Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) at S.H.I.E.L.D., the story is jolted to life. (Loki also steals Jeremy Renner but who wouldn't?) I don't want to spoil any plot details but let's just say that Joss Whedon is basically the world's greatest fanfic writer. He finds numerous clever ways to pit the superheroes against one another throughout the course of the action even though they're on the same side. Hero vs. Hero has always been a staple, however convoluted in the details, of both comic book narratives and fan fiction but we rarely get to see it onscreen. Like most modern blockbusters that supersize themselves The Avengers, at 142 minutes long, has its duller patches. The heroes spend an awful lot of time on minor bickering and self doubt on an invisible floating ship that doesn't have quite enough character to sustain a third of the movie. Loki's outsourced alien army is also depressingly personality-free and derivative but that's a minor quibble as there's plenty of big personas around waiting for their turn to shine. The Avengers' multiple character introductions aren't as gracefully swift as Serenity's remarkable opening scene, but Whedon's dependable talent for finding the humor and fissures and alliances within group dynamics is put to fine use. Somehow they made an Avengers movie without any of Earth's Mightiest Egos demanding the spotlight. Even the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), merely extraneous eye candy in Iron Man 2, is used about as well as you could possibly hope for. Whedon's bravest gambit in the storytelling might be the way he handles The Hulk (Eric Bana Ed Norton Mark Ruffalo). He pins much anticipatory weight on the where and the when and the how quickly Bruce Banner might Hulk out, confidently assuming the audience will beg for it, ignoring the fact that Hulk has a reputation for boring them on the big screen. Mark Ruffalo's wonderfully mellow screen vibe makes for a nice bit of counterintuitive casting yet you still believe him when he says he's angry all the time. Whedon and Ruffalo (through motion-capture acting) make the Hulk so entertaining, in fact, that he gets the single biggest laugh in the movie. It's a blink and you'll miss it comic beat in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem. Though The Avengers never reaches the pop iconography heights of Spider-Man 2 (my choice for Best Superhero Film) and it doesn't even attempt the majestic gravitas of The Dark Knight (most people's choice for Best Superhero Film) preferring to keep it light and quippy, its final act is so big and crazy and super-powered that you leave on a true high. I'm still thinking of its most eye-popping moments: Thor's hammer meeting Captain America's shield; Iron Man's unusually vertiginous costume change; A billion dollar complex sinking into the earth; Loki's sorcery and Tom Hiddleston's equally magic acting; The Hulk sliding down skyscrapers; Chris Evans' ass in sweatpants. That sound you hear exiting the theater is not just the aftershocks of multiple geek orgasms, but the crying jags of Warner Bros executives. They famously gave Joss Whedon the boot on the still languishing Wonder Woman movie. Damn, but she would have lassoed the world anew with Whedon guiding her.  Grade: B/B+Oscar Hopeful?: Given the cold shoulder the Academy gave Hulk, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America (0 nominations between the four of them) I'd say it's unlikely even in the craft categories. Unless they like the team as much as the Iron Man movies in which case, they've got an outside shot at Visual Effects and Sound categories. I basically agree with all of this. It was nice for all the heroes to have such distinguished personality traits without making them seeming flat. And it really does amaze me how much more stuff Scarlett had to work with here, really does redeem her just standing around looking hot in Iron Man 2. Totally agree with so much of this. The first hour kind of drags in places, but I guess that's to be expected when you're waiting for the big scenes. Really enjoyed Ruffalo but I always do. But why was Evans covered in so much make-up? He looked so waxy you could practically mistake his entire performance as a CGI effect. I felt bad for Johansson. Everyone has magic powers except her and Renner, but at least Renner gets that cool bow. She just gets what, a little gun? Lame. Omg, how did I never hear this Wonder Woman thing? Joss Whedon doing that would be fantastic! Buffy is amazing, spectacular, legendary, etc., so I'm sure he'd do great with another female hero. Thank you for articulating my feelings on the opening scene with Loki and the aliens; It really did remind me of Green Lantern. Anyway, I gave the movie a B+ also. It's not on the level of Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight or X2 (My favorite Superhero Movie) but it's good fun and the Best Marvel Studio Film yet. I haven't seen Thor or Captain America or The Hulk or Iron Man, but I'm interested in watching this one for some reason. To I have to watch those first or can I go in without watching them and still 'get it'/enjoy it? You used to be an observant reviewer.Portraying Bruce Banner as (in)capable of controlling what's inside him and The Hulk as an ugly gorilla is a ""gambit"" indeed.Thor is certainly not demanding the spotlight. Robbed of the moods and shades he showed in his own film, he basically only shows up for fighting. And you don't even dare to mention the desaster that Hawkeye was: zombified, played by a baby-faced midget, and armed with a bow that's apparently coming from kmart.Worst of all though was the man you call ""threatening and magical"". Loki is barely recognizable as the comparatively complex character from Thor. By abandoning Loki's more complicated character traits, Whedon has flattened him into the stereotype power-seeking Hollywood sociopath with supernatural powers. And to make matters even worse, Joss foists way too many oafish moments on Loki and therefore undermines the threat that the character is (not?) supposed to be.You don't spoil any plot details by saying that ""Whedon is basically the world's greatest fanfic writer"". In fact, he has a peculiar tendency to reduce major plot points to simple throwaway lines. And I guess we have different takes on Thor which I think is a much weaker film than this... though obviously with the entire movie to flesh it out it does have a slightly more complex  brother vs brother psychology. Alex -- i don't think you need to have seen the other ones. You'll miss a few things but they were basically commercials for this one. Man, this movie was awesome. I can understand to a certain extent some of the reasons why people dont think its that good. But since I have been a comic book fan since 1981, this is a moment I have dreamed of for decades. And I think The Avengers got it right. Everything you could want in an entertaining movie busting with visuals, action, dialogue, humor,...could go on and on. I for one didnt think it was too long. Say when you compared to the length of freaking Transformers 3 which was like 2 hours and 40 minutes..overkill. Avengers is right on the mark. Can't wait for the sequel. Great write-up Nathaniel! Enjoyed reading this. LOVED the movie. This is what I want from my popcorn films - humor, action, fun, very few times I want to cringe. Whedon is finally being noticed on a huge scale. This is definitely a fluff film - The Dark Knight and X2 are doing something entirely different. Comparing them would be like comparing a tasty main course to cotton candy, and honestly, why not have both? B+ suggests a near-masterpiece. But now it's a B/B+.You even said ""bravest"" gambit, and I don't know if people don't like the Hulk in general. Both recent Hulk movies have ardent supporters. Actually, I thought that the casting of a new and well-respected actor as Banner was a natural advantage for Whedon; one that he totally ruined by making it all about Banner's inability to control the transformation and the way he behaves as the Hulk, only to finally turn things upside down with ""I'm always angry"" (or whatever it was. I can't remember all those throwaway lines). I don't have distaste for Renner but for Renner's desperate desire to become an action star. He simply does not look it.But I admit that The Avengers promoted Thor from a movie I could live with to a movie I kinda like. The scale of these epic Marvel movies always seem kind of pathetic to me: Loki marshals an interdimensional force barely big enough to destroy 5th Avenue. Ho hum. People, if you're not going to give Spidey a cameo just stay out of Manhattan. Nevertheless, the superstar enable animates the snappy dialog, Marvel-ous plot contrivances and animation into a solid A blockbuster.  However, given Whedon's penchant for strong women characters, The Black Widow intro and backstory was a letdownt; instead of Johansen delivering an Oscar-trite monologue, they should have just left her mysterious and kick-ass (e.g. Ruffalo's Hulk) and it would have been a better film. Having now seen Renner's five biggest hits, I still don't get it. He's being groomed for Cruise, Damon and Wahlberg caliber assignments, but at his best he seems like a barely memorable supporting character. Case in point: Hawkeye. Willy and Vern -- it's interesting to me that willy thinks B+ means ""near masterpiece"" while Vern thinks B means ""middling"" while I think B and B+ mean solid to quite good and C is middling. Grading is such a werid practice with art and always has been. I usually adjust back and forth with grades between one small step. Only rarely does something jump or plummet a lot in grading. I agree with you Nat, it was a solid spandex-buster. But when I started thinking about why it wasn't masterful I figured it needed a bit more umph in the character and plot development-- plus all the baggage Willy trots out. Or, better yet, for me to suddenly be 20 years younger. Vern: Well the comic's great. Can't give the movie anything close to an A, though. Too hermetically sealed and Malin Akerman is TERRIBLE. Overall B-. It's better than 300, but that's not a high compliment. Next superhero film I'm looking forward, aside from the two in this year's crop, is Edgar Wright's Ant-Man film. I remember the idea was to make a film about the Ant-Men (Hank Pym and Scott Lang). I'm unsure yet whether he'll try to incorporate Eric O'Grady as well, but I'd hope so, considering we've waited this long. I thought the movie was very enjoyable, I liked it. The audience I saw it with seemed to like it a lot too, there was a lot of laughing and clapping and applause at the end of the movie.  You definitely don't need to see the previous movies to get anything that's going on in this one, though you may have a better understanding of the Loki/Thor relationship if you see Thor, and what the deal is with Tony Stark if you see Iron Man. I haven't seen Iron Man 2 or Captain America myself, and while there was clearly a background to Captain America that I wasn't up on, I didn't need that background to get the gist of what was going on with him in The Avengers. I haven't seen The Avengers yet because I was unable to get to the movies this weekend. I will see it, but I'm not happy about it. I'm sure it's good, and I liked the Iron Man movies, Thor, and Captain America,and really applaud the choice of directors and cast for all of them, but the law of diminishing returns with all these superhero movies has been in full effect, and it's not necessarily due to their quality. It's overload. I just can't work up the excitement for these movies anymore, because it's just constant. It feels like there isn't a month that goes by without a new superhero/comic book/franchise movie coming out. Sigh. I'll see it. I'm sure I'll like it. I'm sure I'll forget about it the next day. I don't really care about all that. I just wish I could feel the excitement that everyone else seems to feeling about it. Another thing: did anyone else notice that, despite the budget and impressive effects, random things here and there looked cheap? I'm think specifically of Loki's kind of ridiculous dual-horned costume and even during the final Manhattan battle the close-ups of the streets and stores looked strangely cheap and cheesy. Very articulate review Nathaniel; both gushing in joy and knowledgeable of the movies handful of flaws. Agree with you on Spidey 2 as the reigning king of superheroes still, a fact that seemingly everyone tends to forget. I've seen all the movies and each one lasted better than the other especially The Hulk Films. Seen the Avengers 5 times already and it never gets old in my opinion. The storyline was good but yet it had great one-liners especially from RDJ and Mark Ruffalo brought a new light to being Dr. Banner but with all seriousness, It's not the greatest Visual Effects movie but if it doesn't get nominated on at least the costumes than the acedemy should be ashamed, if they could nominate Avatar than The Avengers should have a shot at it. I think that this movie was super awesome for the most part, but like someone said it did kinda drag in some places. I just wonder if it will be better than the New Batman movie. I made a comparison between the two in this article I've written, and would like you to check it out. Let me know your thoughts. Thank you.",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2012"," Caution: The following review was written by a moviegoer who has been suffering from superhero-movie fatigue since X-Men 3 back in 2006. You have been warned. Don’t worry — I get it. My review of The Avengers won’t make a dollar’s difference in the box office results. The best stunt you’ll see now that the film has opened is its rocket-blast rush toward breaking all records and busting all blocks. It’s faster than Iron Man in a hurry. And I’m not going to bother with a detailed plot summary. About a thousand plot summaries are being posted today, and you are welcome to read as many as you like. Besides, the cards in the superhero deck are so easy to shuffle, you could have told pretty much the same story with a completely different cast of characters. (No doubt, we will see the same movie with different characters soon.) So why bother with particulars? Suffice it to say: There’s a magic cube, and it’s a portal, and there’s a bunch of nasty aliens on the other side. What can save the world. God? Love? No… a bunch of guys who, once they’re done fighting each other, will join forces and demonstrate that they’re better at violence than the villains. In the name of goodness and America and old-fashioned something-or-other. I’m also not inclined to spend more than a few lines considering the themes of the movie. Why bother? It would be like writing an essay on the nutrition you will glean from a box of Oreo cookies, or telling the crowd at a monster-truck-and-tractor pull that the guys behind the wheels are patriots who really love their families, and that 10% of the profits will go to charity. How inspiring! And besides, if you’re really interested in what The Avengers selects from the five or six basic flavors of comic book superhero movie themes, what honorable notions it pins like accessories to its flamboyant costumes, I can point you to plenty of reviews like that. Those reviews will applaud the movie’s simplistic stories of undisciplined egomaniacs who humble themselves to become a team; who get over themselves and put aside their differences for the greater good; who risk their lives to save others; who overcome fear and set aside grudges, etc. It’s like a cage-fighting tournament for peace. It will serve up sermon-illustrations for man-centric pastors across the country for the next several months. But it would feel like a waste of time to rationalize my enjoyment of what is, essentially, a two-and-a-half-hour demolition derby. Let’s face it: While The Avengers gives good lip service to such American virtues as democracy, teamwork, courage, and sacrifice, ultimately it exists to fulfill the fantasies of adolescents — adolescents of all ages. For every admirable alliance established between temperamental champions, several city blocks will be destroyed. Don’t worry, the movie won’t stop to shed any tears over human casualties (unless we happen to lose a member of the team — this is a Joss Whedon film, after all) or consider the consequences of urban devastation. Everything has been carefully calculated to restore the fun we used to have watching terrorists destroy skyscrapers before we were taught what such a thing really costs. Bored of movies in which a superhero, seemingly outmatched by a supervillain, manages to come through like Rocky and The Karate Kid in the end, saving the world with violence that the movie has carefully prepared us to embrace as justified and reasonable? Well… boy do I have the movie for you. The Avengers brings not one, not two, but a crowd of superheroes together. And, before they’re drawn into war with their Supervillain of the Month, they have to fight each other so we can see their powers going off like fireworks on the Fourth of July. Once we’re convinced that they’re all pretty much equally invincible, and we’re feeling exhausted from the time and energy spent in such collisions, then we can watch them coordinate their efforts against a madman who is clearly in over his head. And we’re right back in the thick of the melee we came to see: an exquisitely complicated and violent ballet that will save the world from a familiar mayhem made of aliens and guns and sharp pointy things and lasers and fast flying vehicles and big nasty teeth. But, believe it or not, it is not my intention to condemn the affair. I enjoy a good superhero movie the way I enjoy a bowl of ice cream, and this is a six-scoop sundae covered in toppings. I’m just here to point out that it’s not a particularly healthy form of entertainment, it is calculated to give us what we want rather than what we need; and it’s full of artificial ingredients. To put it another way: It’s basically history’s most expensive Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. And it so focused on fulfilling adolescent fanboy fantasies that it makes X-Men: First Class seem like Shakespeare in the Park. Still, while I may be 41, I’m also 14. I’ve always enjoyed ice cream sundaes just as I’ve always been thrilled by blockbuster Fourth of July fireworks shows. Since the movie isn’t so much a work of storytelling as it’s a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts — punches peppered with punchlines — here it comes: A movie review made of comic-book style exclamations from my inner 14-year-old, which should easily fit into dialogue balloons. I’ve even put quotation marks around a bunch of outbursts for your convenience. And I’ve included exclamation points, since no movie has ever made them so necessary. Like I said, you can find a few nuggets of meaning in the melee. But I’m more concerned about what moviegoers will learn from entertainment like this, as opposed to what we might hope they learn. Read the comments section for any Avengers review that dares to point out the movie’s weaknesses, and you’ll see that hordes of devoted Marvel fans will Hulk-out at the slightest provocation. (Even Samuel Jackson is throwing fuel on the outrage: “#Avengers fans, NY Times critic AO Scott needs a new job! Let’s help him find one! One he can ACTUALLY do!”) The target audience for this movie is wired to react with thoughtless rage, spectacular violence, and barely any evidence of the restraint that Bruce Banner would do anything to regain. And why not? They’ve just been cheering for a movie that treats the Hulk’s temper tantrums as if they’re a religious experience. Hulk thrills audiences by unleashing relentless destruction, and makes us look forward to moments when his curse is at its worst. And his superfriends are a bunch of overly aggressive egomaniacs who, like five-year-olds, act like it’s some kind of Herculean feat to quiet down and cooperate on a task. Isn’t it fair to say that what these heroes might yearn to be, what they might learn to be, gets drowned out in the thrills of the supremely impressive violent spectacles that they’re assigned to provide for our pleasure? So, with all of that in mind: Yes, I enjoyed these fireworks. I enjoyed this super sundae. But now I have an ice cream headache, and I think I’ll stick to salads for a while. For better or worse, The Avengers is the biggest, funniest, most relentlessly entertaining superhero movie so far. Only God can save us now.",POSITIVE
"Jun 13, 2012"," Review
The era of the Fanboy-as-Director has produced some of the finest genre pieces in recent memory. For years, it took stylists like Tim Burton to wring anything remotely watchable out of comic book adventures, but today you just have to point one of a handful of hip helmers at any property they love and you’ll end up with a film that is as satisfying as you could have imagined. The Avengers is the perfect example of this. A culmination of four years of setup and bravado, The Avengers has an above-average pedigree of precursor films setting up this ultimate teaming of some of Marvel’s most acclaimed stars. Beginning in 2008, an ambitious studio decided to take a new approach to setting up its blockbuster franchise by taking the parts of the future-planned Avengers and turning them into individual features. X-Men took the opposite approach to mixed effect by spinning off an origin film for its popular Wolverine character. Marvel and Disney started out with Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr and proceeded to The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton, Thor with Chris Hemsworth and Captain America with Chris Evans (who’d already made a name for himself in the genre by playing the goofoff playboy in the Fantastic Four films). Bringing these four characters together with Mark Ruffalo replacing Norton as Bruce Banner and his alter-ego Hulk, the idea was that getting setup and origins out of the way would make for a more interesting and action-packed film. That’s almost what they got. Director Joss Whedon who made a name for himself on television with his highly popular, long-running genre series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, would have seemed like an odd choice to rein in the monstrous responsibilities of big screen spectacle if he hadn’t already proven his capabilities with Serenity six years ago. Serenity, based on his popular, but short-season cancelled Fox series Firefly displayed a cool sense of perspective in his feature film adaptation. Serenity was witty, fresh and energetic, showing he was more than capable of balancing performance, plot and action without relegating any of them to the periphery. Whedon didn’t rest on his laurels with The Avengers. Sure, he had five films (Iron Man 2 included) to establish his characters for him, but knowing who they were wasn’t enough. Whedon’s film introduces the interpersonal dynamics these four headstrong superheroes engender, devoting as much time to getting the characters in focus and working together as it does exploring the winding plot of Thor’s brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has hatched on behalf of a conquest-minded alien species, with rulership of Earth as his reward. Whedon has seen from the failures of a number of other films, most notably the servicable, but forgettable Green Lantern, that focusing on a galactic mob-like villain without a focus for the audience’s ire creates problems on the viewer-engagement front. With Loki as the front-and-center threat, you have a chance to jeer the most visible threat while having a larger mass of enemies on the doorstep. Opting to drop Norton for Ruffalo was an unusual choice, but Hulk’s uneasiness at his own powers and his inability to control them, comes through crystal clear with Ruffalo behind them. He may not have the badboy charm Norton could bring to the role, but with Downey Jr. more than cornering that market, having a meeker, more respectable Bruce Banner helped leverage the film’s cast into a more cohesive and believable group. Downey Jr., Hemsworth and Evans carry over the same appeal they generated in their first (and in Downey Jr.’s case second) outings that their performances seem almost stagnant, but work rather well wholly within the framework of this unified film. Our primary quartet isn’t alone, several prominent actors fill out the large ensemble in roles that are frequently pivotal and no less important to the film. Foremost of these is Scarlett Johansson who plays the interrogation master Black Widow. She was first introduced to the franchise in Iron Man 2 and, to an extent was far more interesting in that film. But being the sole woman in the cast forces her to stand more effectively against her male counterparts and when it comes to physical chutzpah, she is more than their equal. Yet, from a performance perspective, some of her scenes come off a bit flat. That’s not to say that she doesn’t mostly nail the performance, but she is certainly one of the more inferior elements to the film. Not more so than Jeremy Renner who plays eagle-eyed archer Hawkeye. Most of his scenes seem mired in his dual-natured role in the film. Renner is a very talented thespian, so seeing the end result here is disheartening. This may largely be attributed to Hawkeye being only tangentialy introduced in Thor where he had no backstory or creative development. The same goes for Johansson’s Black Widow. Had either character being highlighted more significantly or in their own films, we might be talking in more detail about where they succeeded or went wrong, but as mostly-periphery characters, it’s all supposition that they would have otherwise been better. That leaves two characters who didn’t get much development in prior films, but have been featured more frequently in the lead-up films. The most frequently seen of these is Samuel L. Jackson who, as Nick Fury, has been present in each film, even if only in the bumper at the end of the film, giving him a unique development strategy. His personality was well defined by the time of The Avengers, though a background story is still forthcoming (the film on Nick Fury is still in development, but has been for a number of years, which may mean it never gets made). Jackson hasn’t changed a bit since his first appearance as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the U.S.’s leading protection authority. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s agents, Phil Colson (Clark Gregg), is the other character. Showing up in both Iron Man films and Thor, Gregg has been one of the true emotional centers of the franchise. His is the kind of character that sews the entire quilt together. And as The Avengers plays out, we come to know just how integral he is to the film and to the franchise and this is thanks to Gregg’s natural charm and wit. He may not have the history nor the paycheck of his co-stars, but he is the MVP of the production. The Avengers will no doubt appeal to the fanboys who have made the previous films varying degrees of successful, but it’s how it plays to non-fans of the franchise that will be most central to its success. As of the writing of this review, the film has already passed the $400 million mark in the U.S., a number once thought reserved only for wide-appeal films and franchises. After all, even The Lord of the Rings films and Harry Potter films never managed to reach that number. Is it a broad appeal or are there other factors at work here? The film’s success is equal parts both. Without knowing much about these characters, it’s not hard to relate to them for even when they don their spandex and battle armor, they remain humanistic characters evincing frailty and emotion we frequently explore and understand in ourselves. Superheroes represent that dynamic in all of us, wanting to leap beyond our terrestrial bodies to save the world. We desire to live vicariously through these adventurers in hopes that we will learn more about ourselves and our ability to accept those who are different than we are. While the film is bound to be compared financially to The Dark Knight, the more fantastic elements of The Avengers make that comparison a tad tenuous. Christopher Nolan’s film is far more rooted in the realistic nature of humanity, after all, its protagonist is physically and emotionally human. With The Avengers, there is a superhumanity to the characters that make its success all the more interesting. Both are heavily driven by comic book fans, but there’s a measure of non-fan, general public in those mixtures that explains a good deal of both films’ successes. In the end, the quality of the entertainment and the writing is what makes The Avengers and even The Dark Knight successes. They may be mass appeal movies on the level of Transformers, but they have bucketsful of the qualities that have prevented Michael Bay’s films and their ilk monumental successes. They are heartfelt, richly written character pieces with boatloads of action and adventure in support instead of as foreground distraction. Do you think this movie has a chance of getting the Best Picture nomination nod at the Academy Awards? In my opinion it should, just wanted to hear what you have to say about it. I doubt it. The Dark Knight Rises is far more likely to land in the Best Picture race than The Avengers and Academy voters aren’t likely to make room for two “comic book” movies in their Top 6 to 10.",POSITIVE

"May 31, 2012"," The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, screenplay by Whedon and Zak Penn, based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby; Dark Shadows, directed by Tim Burton, screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith, based on the television series by Dan Curtis. Since its release in the US in early May The Avengers has brought in nearly $500 million at the domestic box office, setting a record for the speed with which that mark was reached. Worldwide the movie has exceeded the $1.2 billion mark. Joss Whedon’s effort, based on the Marvel Comics original, is one of Hollywood’s biggest spectacles to date (at a cost of $220,000,000). It involves a group of superheroes, The Avengers, combining to help save the earth—Manhattan in particular—from an alien supervillain, his demonic agent and an army of mechanized gargoyles. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of the global “peace-keeping” agency S.H.I.E.L.D., is charged with retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source and potential weapon of mass destruction that has opened a portal to outer space. It has been taken by the Asgardian demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a Lucifer-like figure, on behalf of his alien overlord in order to subjugate the human race. Fury gathers his superhero squadron that eventually includes Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.); Captain America (Chris Evans); The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); Thor (Chris Hemsworth); Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). “If we can’t protect the world, we’ll avenge it,” becomes their motto. Marvel Comics’ rise to prominence had a certain association with the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. Marvel prided itself on presenting the characters’ complexities and even serious failings, in opposition to the more stolid, one-dimensional Superman and Batman of DC Comics. Thus each Avenger in Whedon’s film has his or her individual dilemma. The Black Widow wants to make up for past misdeeds; Thor has to settle accounts with his fallen, evil brother, Loki; after being encased in ice for decades, Captain America wonders whether there is a place in the 21st century for him and his old-fashioned patriotic gung-ho; Iron Man Tony Stark needs to prove that he is more than a selfish billionaire playboy; Dr. Bruce Banner, who when angry becomes The Hulk, is ministering to the poor in India when we first meet him, an undertaking he reluctantly abandons for the planet-saving mission. And so on. None of this character development, however, goes beyond a few introductory lines of dialogue or bits of action. The audience quickly learns what to expect from each and every character, even taking into account the plot’s inevitable twists and turns. The Avengers also have their internal conflicts as a group. The revelation that Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. were developing their own weapons of mass destruction creates divisions. The team members also differ and bicker over what strategy to pursue against Loki. Moreover, one of their number, Hawkeye, initially falls under the sway of Loki and threatens to help enslave the planet. Will the Avengers come together in the end, with all their strengths and weaknesses, to save humanity? The film, primarily a series of individual and large-scale combats, is a spectacle of contemporary film technology and special effects. One impossible feat follows rapidly on another, separated by interludes of largely clichéd dialogue, pieces of plot exposition and rather labored attempts at humor. One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience. The filmmakers make certain that the viewer has as little time or space as possible for reflection and critical thought. The story and characters flow inevitably toward an all-out war with Loki and the aliens as the only alternative to the destruction of the human race. The creatures with whom the superheroes do battle are the embodiment of pure unreasoning evil. Negotiations are out of the question and if Loki engages in conversation it is only for the purpose of manipulating one Avenger or another, or malignantly stalling for time. The movie’s final segments are saturated with 9/11 imagery—firefighters and policemen to the rescue of wounded and soot-covered civilians, followed by collective mourning. Captain America, a World War II veteran, brings “a little old-fashioned stars and stripes” to the party and tycoon Tony Stark demonstrates that the top one-hundredth of one percent can be a force for good. Whedon’s film omits the fact that Stark Industries is a weapons manufacturer and Stark’s past nemeses have included Arabs and Persians arranged in West-versus-East combat. In the wake of 9/11 and the proclamation of the “war on terror,” and in the midst of a relentless drive to war with Iran, what is the overall message and impact here? There is no reason to impute to the filmmakers deliberately retrograde political motives, but have they thought at all about the implications of their work? The Avengers does contain an elegant, seductive performance by Hiddleston (The Deep Blue Sea), a very talented performer, and a few comic, though increasingly stale quips from Downey. Unquestionably, Whedon is more gifted than some of the other blockbuster directors. As foolish as it often is, the story in The Avengers has a certain coherence and many of the effects are eye-catching marvels. Those who maintain that the population gets “what it wants” self-servingly forget that audiences have no say in the production of the mass entertainment inflicted on them. Giant conglomerates make all those decisions, and work at every point within the framework of their financial and ideological interests. The resurgence of superhero films in particular is the result of various factors and really deserves its own special study. Economic, social and artistic issues come together here. If it could, presumably each Hollywood studio would make one or two colossal films a year that would earn billions. Intriguing human stories and artistic presentations of life are inconveniences for studio executives, which they dispense with as much as possible in an effort to get to the business of emptying their customers’ pockets. As numerous commentators have pointed out, film adaptations of comic books have the advantage of built-in popular familiarity and bases of support. In addition, a successful adaptation may generate a vast amount of cash in terms of product tie-ins (clothing, games, fast food restaurant items, toys) and so forth for the fortunate entertainment giant in question. Taking no chances, the filmmakers have made sure that The Avengers is star-packed, and in numerous cases (Johansson, Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Jackson and even Gwyneth Paltrow in a small part, Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders) the performers have a genuine following or popular appeal. Again, a number of critics have pointed to the manner in which superhero films dress up American reality, brutal American imperialist reality in particular. A 2008 article, for example, at the Cleveland Indy Media Center, opines that “[t]hese superheroes have been harnessed in support of our dying imperial project, promising a renaissance through which our superior strength, and unrivaled human wisdom, are finally and fully unveiled for the world’s adoration and humble acquiescence.” Along these lines, a blog by Tom Hiddleston on the Guardian web site is highly suggestive. “[S]uperhero films,” he writes, “offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.” We have no desire to pick on Hiddleston, as noted, an excellent actor. In any event, one suspects that the comment reflects the thinking of the filmmakers and sections of the film industry, insofar as they care to articulate their thoughts. However, this is a terribly wrongheaded conception. How can significant truths be explored through comic book-based films, cartoons, childish dreams? If someone thinks about this for an instant, surely it must produce misgivings. The very nature of the form operates against, although it does not make impossible, the working through of the intensely complicated problems of modern life in a mass society. Why is it not possible to present an accurate picture of the world and its complexities without legends, superheroes and superheroines? This genre is not working through any serious issues in an honest way. It mythologizes in dishonest ways. Moreover, Hiddleston makes no reference to the social and class issues. But The Avengers, so to speak, does. Its view of humanity—at a time when wide layers of the population are beginning to return to the global political arena—is that of a helpless, faceless horde. Clearly, film industry executives in general and the political-media establishment have a less than selfless interest in skewing social reality and diverting people’s attention from it. Decades ago, superhero movies and television shows were tongue-in-cheek. Today’s films present their comic book characters with a high degree of self-seriousness. They have a different tone and mood than their cartoonish ancestors. Even though it has a certain playfulness, and allows all sorts of physical mauling to go on, The Avengers still treats its characters with undue reverence. The rise to prominence of the superhero comic book trend in film, putting aside for the moment the question of its artistic value, has an objective significance. It coincides with the global economic decline of the US and the deteriorating social conditions of the population. Unwilling and intellectually too impoverished to look reality in the face, Hollywood increasingly resorts to “solving” America’s and the world’s problems through simplistic fantasy. It makes up for the military fiascos and social disasters it can’t and won’t represent by inventing cartoonish successes and triumphs that should convince no one. Such films, insofar as they have a major impact, which is questionable, tend to reinforce and exacerbate the wishful thinking and illusions of a somewhat stunned population that has not yet for the most part consciously grasped the real causes of its predicament. “And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth’s mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born—to fight the foes no single hero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then—for now, the Avengers Assemble!”—from the prologue to the Marvel comic book. Based on the gothic television soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971, Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows is an erratic movie without core or conviction. Although the film is not as poor as Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) or Alice in Wonderful (2010), Burton is largely going through the motions here as well. Almost entirely lost are the humanism and sympathy that made Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Ed Wood (1994) endearing. Dark Shadows relies heavily on the talents of Johnny Depp, as well as a soundtrack of familiar 1970s songs, to cover over the identity crisis of its lackluster screenplay. Confusion about whether it’s a comedy-horror, or horror-drama with a bit of comedy, produces a few casualties, among whom Michelle Pfeiffer is the most prominent. Depp plays Barnabas Collins, born in Liverpool in the 18th century, whose family moved to New England and became rich in the fishing industry. A jilted lover and witch, Angelique (Eva Green), turns him into a vampire and buries him. In 1972, his coffin is uncovered by a group of construction workers and Barnabas is set free. The film’s quasi-comedy stems from Barnabas’s encounter with the 1970s, including a discussion about the Vietnam War with a vanload of hippies, who soon after become the victims of his bloodlust (not amusing). While Burton can resurrect Barnabas, no amount of dark Burton-type visuals can resurrect the cheesy but enjoyable original Barnabas (Jonathan Frid who died in April) and the silly television series.",NEGATIVE

It seems odd to call a film whose central hook is the invention of the vibrator ""cute,"" but director Tanya Wexler has pulled off that seemingly impossible feat in this Victorian-era comedy.  Of course, there is a fair amount of bawdy humor in Jonah Lisa Dyer and Stephen Dyer's screenplay, most especially as a young doctor (Hugh Dancy) manually administers ""treatment"" to his female patients for the commonly diagnosed ailment of the title.  But before Dancy comes (bad pun intended) to a more convenient, mechanically-powered remedy, Wexler wryly gives context to its invention, namely the perception and status of women in 1880s England, mainly through the words of Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, the outspoken and social activist daughter of Dancy's boss (Jonathan Pryce).  Gyllenhaal is saddled with the weaker elements of the script, namely a heavy handed subplot about helping the poor, but she and Dancy are electric together, enlivening a rote romantic triangle element between the two of them and her more proper sister (Felicity Jones).  The sweetness blends with the naughtier bits (yes, bad pun again intended), which are certainly saucy but never crude and sleazy--in a sly sense reflecting the film's argument that female pleasure is perfectly healthy and natural.

With hordes of aliens wreaking havoc in New York City, dare I say its big climax is, on isolated face value, a bit on the routine side, regardless of just how large scale the explosions and property damage are.  That all said, what elevates that big finish and the film as a whole is the one area co-writer/director Whedon completely, unquestionably nails: characterization.  In such a gigantic ensemble piece of such iconic figures--especially for their first assembly--this is a critical element easy to undervalue, and had it been handled the slightest bit incorrectly, would have been more disastrous to the film than any problems with the action.  Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn are careful to keep the kaleidoscope of personalities consistent and recognizable: from glib, cocky shellhead (Robert Downey Jr.); square in both jaw and virtue Cap (Chris Evans); and the high and mighty Asgardian god of thunder (Chris Hemsworth); to the no-nonsense figure bringing them together, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); the ever-crafty Big Bad they unite to bring down, god of mischief Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and even down the line to the SHIELD agent that's skulked around the fringes in most of these films, Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg).  But beyond reinforcing the more clearly established figures, Whedon and Penn are allowed room to add some needed heft to superspy Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, now much more comfortably settled in the role) and heretofore barely seen archer extraordinaire Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)--though in the latter case, he still comes off as a bit of a placeholder.  Whedon's biggest triumph comes with the Hulk, whose third big screen incarnation proves to be the charm, with he and Mark Ruffalo striking the right balance between the dark humor and genuine angst of Dr. Bruce Banner's unique situation, not to mention the smashing (bad wordplay intended) badassery of his gigantic green alter ego.  The individual players so carefully and efficiently drawn, Whedon then has fun playing around with them as they all at various junctures butt heads literally and figuratively--and his clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience, whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp, witty dialogue.
So by the time the climax hits, it hardly matters that the big otherworldly threat is unmemorably anonymous nor that it is the umpteenth action movie finale centered around a metropolis being reduced to rubble every which way.  A bravura single shot where Whedon pans from beloved character to beloved character as they individually do their part in putting up a united front against the literally Earth-shattering invaders sums up both why the viewer does actually care, which then makes this long-aborning screen assembly such an exhilarating blast of entertainment.

"May 24, 2012"," The world as we know it faces grave danger. An external force from a distant galaxy is poised to plunge through a mysterious space portal and attack the Earth and all who dwell upon it. There’s hope, but also a problem. To save the world, a group of bickering superheroes must put aside their differences long enough to fight a common enemy. That’s pretty much all there is to the story of Marvel’s The Avengers, but an outline of the plot doesn’t say enough about what director Joss Whedon has accomplished with the first mega-movie of summer. To me, it seems as if Whedon hasn’t so much directed a movie as he has organized a teeming and often entertaining cinema onslaught.  The Avengers boasts a large cast, a galaxy of terrific special effects, some particularly well used 3-D and enough explosive action to stock an entire summer’s worth of movies. All of this should come as good news to the millions who’ve been waiting for the much-hped movie that unites a variety of Marvel superheroes: Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and  Thor (Chris Hemsworth). This quartet of heroic overachievers receives support from Black Widow, a.k.a. Natalia Romanov (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). All of these characters are brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D., the secret agency that’s run by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). So what exactly happens? Well, a lot of noise and clamor as Thor’s evil half brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) opens a portal that will allow an invading army to conquer the Earth. Fiercely played by Hiddleston, Loki embodies every known political evil: He believes that humans must be — in his words — “freed from freedom.” If humans crave subjugation, Loki’s just the man for the job. Movies such as The Avengers really are elaborate collections of set pieces that have been carefully designed to raise pulse rates. If we’re lucky — as we are here — the action will be assembled with witty flourish. In an early scene, Black Widow dispatches a team of vicious Russian interrogators while tied to a chair. In another high point, The Hulk throws Loki around like a rag doll. The Hulk and Thor bump heads. Iron Man and Thor trade blows. Each superhero’s personality emerges as Whedon zooms through the movie’s 2 1/2-hour length. Captain America’s super-sheld, to cite one example, is matched by his super-sincerity. Downey, an established master of ironic detachment, throws around one-liners as Tony Stark before donning the Iron Man suit that allows him to fly and stave off attackers. Credit Whedon for injecting humor into proceedings. When The Hulk springs into action, he’s motivated  with a single and bluntly effective word that, in different circumstances, might be worthy of a Mel Brooks’ parody: “Smash!” If you thought that in a post 9/11 world, you’d never see another movie that ravaged the Manhattan skyline, think again. The movie’s lengthy finale — a more intelligent and imaginative version of the kind of action we’ve seen in the Transformers movies — takes a major bite out of the Big Apple. Look, I know The Avengers is a comic-book fantasy and I know Manhattan hasn’t escaped other movie attacks, but I still have trouble watching New York being destroyed. Call me a wimp if it makes you feel better, but that’s how I see it. There are moments when the superheroes are together in the S.H.I.E.L.D. control room when the pace flags, and Avengers could mark Jackson’s least interesting performance ever. Until now, I’ve never seen him look as if he needed a wake-up call. Of all the superheroes, Iron Man and the Hulk struck me as the most fun, but there obviously are more from which to choose. Enough. I enjoyed The Avengers, but I left the theater entirely unaffected by it. I think that’s because I’m still a bit put off by the idea that this much money and effort has been funneled into comic-book escapism that provides the expected thrills but doesn’t give us much to chew on.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2012"," Based on the short-lived Fox series, Serenity follows the ragtag crew of a dilapidated spacecraft as they attempt to evade the advances of a tenacious assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) out to abduct one of their own (Summer Glau's River Tam). The simplicity of the premise is initially at odds with filmmaker Joss Whedon's almost astonishingly cluttered sensibilities, as the writer/director has suffused the proceedings with a myriad of (mostly needless) subplots that effectively wreak havoc on the movie's momentum - with the less-than-engrossing atmosphere compounded by an emphasis on underwhelming action sequences (ie Whedon's overuse of shaky camerawork drains such moments of their impact). It is, as such, not surprisingly to note that the tremendously affable protagonists are, to a certain degree, lost in the shuffle, with Whedon's plot-heavy modus operandi resulting in a pervasively distressing lack of the smaller, character-based moments that were both prevalent and a highlight on the show. There's subsequently little doubt that one's ongoing efforts at embracing the busy narrative tend to fall flat, although, to be fair, Whedon  sporadically perks up one's dwindling interest by stressing the jocular banter between the film's heroes - with the watchable vibe heightened by the inclusion of a few admittedly striking sequences (eg Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds delivers a stirring speech to get his crew moving). Serenity's status as a middling sci-fi thriller persists right up until the truth about the series' villains, the bloodthirsty Reavers, is revealed, after which point the movie's problems become (relatively) moot and the viewer is propelled right through to the entertainingly action-packed finale. The end result is a decent adaptation that's clearly been designed to appeal solely to hardcore fans of the show, with Whedon's narrow focus ensuring that neophytes (and even casual viewers) will find all-too-little here worth embracing. The  result of several films worth of buildup, Marvel's The Avengers follows a number of larger-than-life heroes, including Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers/Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson's 	Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, as they reluctantly combine forces after a vicious supervillain (Tom Hiddleston's Loki) launches an attack against Earth. There's little doubt that Marvel's The Avengers establishes itself as a fairly underwhelming endeavor right from the get-go, as filmmaker Joss Whedon kicks things off with an overlong and surprisingly tedious Loki-centric prologue - with this stretch's failure due mostly to Hiddleston's hopeless inability to transform his character into a palpably fearsome figure (ie Loki is just bland, for the most part). The film's subsequent transformation into a disappointingly conventional, let's-assemble-a-ragtag-team sort of blockbuster doesn't help matters, with the less-than-engrossing atmosphere compounded by an incongruously sluggish pace and a pervasive lack of standout sequences (ie there's plenty of action here, certainly, but very little of it is actually thrilling or exciting). It's ultimately clear that Marvel's The Avengers fares best in its quieter, comparatively subdued moments, as Whedon generally does an effective job of eliciting strong performances from the admittedly eclectic cast - with, for example, the heart-to-heart between Tony Stark and Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner standing out as a rare respite from the otherwise erratic and overblown midsection. (It's likewise impossible not to get a kick out of an appreciative yet entirely head-scratching cameo by Harry Dean Stanton.) By the time the  utterly routine (and decidedly endless) finale rolls around, Marvel's The Avengers has unquestionably squandered the potential of  its premise and its cast - which is a shame, obviously, given the plethora of talented folks on both sides of the camera. It hardly seems possible but Avengers: Age of Ultron fares worse than its relentlessly mediocre predecessor, as the movie suffers from a pervasively lifeless, artificial vibe that's compounded by an almost total lack of compelling characters and a proliferation of hopelessly generic action sequences. The  narrative, which follows the Avengers as they battle a deadly new threat called Ultron (James Spader), progresses at an almost glacial pace and possess few (if any) sequences designed to pique one's non-existent interest, with filmmaker Joss Whedon's pervasively wrongheaded sensibilities in evidence right from the word go. (The movie does, after all, kick off with a bland battle that feels like it'd be more at home within a video game, with the various battles that follow falling into exactly the same category.) Far more problematic is Whedon's ongoing failure to provide even a single engaging character-based moment, as Avengers: Age of Ultron is, for the most part, far more concerned with its often unintelligible storyline than with developing its characters or finding compelling things for them to do. (There is, for example, an ongoing romantic subplot involving Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner and Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff that couldn't possibly be less interesting.) The sole bright spot within the proceedings is Spader's sardonic turn as the title villain, as the actor delivers a sharp, charismatic vocal performance that stands in sharp contrast to the banal efforts of his many costars (ie the entirety of the movie's central cast phones in their work to a degree that's astonishing). By the time the movie finally lumbers to its typically over-the-top, meaningless finale, Avengers: Age of Ultron firmly confirms its place as the nadir of the Marvel cinematic universe - which is no small feat, certainly, given that the studio's output has been almost uniformly terrible.

"May 22, 2012"," One of the biggest questions for this summer movie season was would arguably the most ambitious blockbuster project actually deliver? After all, Marvel Studios invested four years and five films into setting up “Marvel’s The Avengers.” After seeing it twice, I was tempted to simply write stop what you’re doing and go see it right now. No, seriously. Go right now. But in case you needed more convincing, here goes. Courtesy Walt Disney Pictures[From left] Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)My inner 36-year-old (whose take on this was oddly similar to my inner 6-year-old) could hardly stop smiling watching Marvel Comics’ icons join forces in unquestionably the best superhero comic book movie so far. Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” is one of my favorite films, but it all seems like it could actually happen. “The Avengers” brings that larger than life feel of a comic book with a limitless budget, restrained only by its creator’s imagination and he’s got quite the imagination.  Where should I begin to rave? Director/Screenwriter (and part-time comic book writer) Joss Whedon’s love for comics is apparent right from the start with an opening act that would be the climax in many action films and carries through to one of the more spectacular final battle scenes you’re likely to see for years to come. “The Avengers” marks his second full-length movie (after the charming and fun “Serenity”) but he was absolutely the best choice for such a massive project. He takes all the special elements of classic Avengers comics —the fun mix of personalities used to working alone uniting as a team — and brings that to the big screen. Seeing World War II super soldier Captain America (Chris Evans), armor-clad Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), god of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner’s unstoppable alter ego, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), super-spy Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and dead-eye marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) finally come together as a team will make grown men and young children alike giddy. Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn pick up threads from the last two lead-ins — “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger.” After fleeing his home world of Asgard, Loki (the brilliant Tom Hiddleston who seems to have a ball playing the big baddie), seeks payback against his heroic brother Thor. This time, he aligns with an alien army who pledge their aid in overthrowing Earth if he helps them seize the Terrasect, the renewable energy source Captain America originally encountered in World War II that’s currently in possession of secret spy unit SHIELD. SHIELD head honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his agents quickly find themselves overmatched when Loki comes for the Terrasect. Clearly outmatched, Fury calls in his superhero pals, who find it hard to be super friends. Iron Man’s brash attitude grates at the straight-laced Captain America and Thor wants to return Loki home to receive Asgardian justice.  After several brawls between the would-be teammates — a staple of early Avenger comics — the group realizes the only way they can stop Loki is by coming together as a team. Whedon deftly navigates handling screen time for the characters, giving each ample screen time and their own “highlight moments,” so Thor or Cap fans won’t have to worry about Iron Man getting all the best lines and scenes. The action scenes are “take your breath away” amazing that look ripped from the pages of a comic book. Not so shockingly, Downey Jr. is awesome as usual, but he doesn’t overshadow his co-stars. Clark Gregg reprises his fan-favorite role as Fury’s right-hand man, Agent Coulson, and other supporting characters from the lead-ins also turn up in welcome cameos. The biggest surprise was Whedon’s take on Hulk, who has some of the most crowd-pleasing scenes in the film, and has been handled better in this team-up outing than any of his solo movies. “Avengers” delivers big time with everything longtime fans and newcomers alike could possibly want in a summer blockbuster that definitely surpasses the hype. And as usual, make sure to stick through the credits for two scenes that will more than whet your appetite for a sequel, which cannot possibly come soon enough for me. Your review pretty much nails my feelings about this one.  I’ve been an Avengers fan since I was 6, too… and, for at least a couple of hours, I felt like that kid again.  Great movie, and great review! Puny god  is an instant clsasic.I have to watch the movie again, to hear the parts that were laughed over in a full theater.  That would be my only complaint. Not quite enough reaction time for the laughter to die back down. Epic! But the first Avengers movie should dltniifeey have Henry Pym and Janet Van Dyne, after all it was Janet who gave the team its name, and Henry with his ants who first defeated Loki, as far as I can recall. Anyway I’m really looking forward to watch this movie; I think that it’s going to be awesome!And I’m sorry to disagree with you Alain, but I don’t think that the choice of Samuel Jackson to play Nick Fury is dltniifeey perfect, mainly because Nick is white in the comics. It’s not being racist at all (before anyone accuses me of racism), it’s just a matter of coherence. I also wouldn’t like to see a blond man playing the Black Panther. For me the best casting choice is Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark. Thor2, SubMariner, DareDevil, CptAmerica2, Dr Strange, Silver Surfer, or maybe Howard the Duck.There’s not much left from my childhood in the 70s that hasn’t been made into a movie yet.",POSITIVE

"May 17, 2012"," Joss Whedon is hereby released from the probation imposed upon him after The Cabin in the Woods. I said he would have to be extra good from now on. Mission accomplished—with The Avengers, “extra good” hardly covers it. The Avengers is tremendous fun, taking the comic-book movie as far as it’s possible to get from the brooding solemnity that weighs down Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies, and makes them such a murky, joyless trudge. The Avengers is almost as long as The Dark Knight, but it feels an hour-and-a-half shorter. The Avengers of Marvel Comics have had several changes of personnel since they first appeared in print in 1963. For the current movie’s purposes, they consist of (in no particular order): Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the self-described “billionaire genius playboy philanthropist” who also owns a flying suit of armor with self-contained weapons systems; Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Norse god and prince of the realm of Asgard; Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), the beneficiary of a World War II experiment in prowess enhancement, recently freed from more than 70 years of suspended animation in Arctic ice; and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), a brilliant scientist whose accidental exposure to gamma rays resulted in his transformation at angry moments into the Incredible Hulk. In addition to these, the team includes two members with no superpowers but with mortal skills developed to the highest degree: Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a superspy and martial-arts expert; and Clint Barton a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the world’s greatest archer. Rounding out the group are their handler, one-eyed Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and his assistants Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). The Avengers revolves around what Alfred Hitchcock once called the “MacGuffin”—the thing everybody wants that moves the story along. Here the MacGuffin is the Tesseract, a source of infinite energy and unknown potential stolen from Thor’s father, Odin, king of Asgard. As the movie opens, it’s in the hands of Fury’s agency, SHIELD (Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage, Law-Enforcement Division), for study. But it’s immediately stolen by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor’s exiled adoptive brother, who intends to turn the Tesseract over to a warmongering alien race called the Chitauri. In return for this, they promise to make him supreme ruler of Earth. In the process, Loki subjects Hawkeye and scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to mind control, making them accomplices in his nefarious plans. The plot of The Avengers is almost more trouble to recount than it’s worth. It’s enough to know that it’s all about regaining the Tesseract, thwarting Loki’s plans for world conquest and repelling the invasion of the Chitauri. And it gives Whedon—directing his own rewrite of Zak Penn’s script—all the hooks he needs to hang a slam-bang CGI-action-packed adventure on. If there’s a flaw in Whedon’s execution—and I almost hesitate to mention it—it’s the post-production addition of 3-D; the process adds little to the fun and forces us to watch the movie’s dimmed image through those uncomfortable glasses. But never mind that. Let’s concentrate on what The Avengers does right, like the unexpected, inspired casting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and (through the miracle of motion-capture technology) the Hulk. Talk about a third-time charm: After a disastrous start with poor Eric Bana and a moderate improvement with Edward Norton, Marvel and Whedon have finally found the actor perfectly suited to portray Bruce Banner’s tortured tightrope walk of introverted genius and desperate anger management. (Another nice touch: Lou Ferrigno supplies the Hulk’s voice.) The Hulk also provides the movie’s greatest and most hilarious moment, a surprise confrontation between Hulk and Loki that has to be seen to be (sort of) believed. At the inevitable triumphant conclusion, as the Avengers disband and go their separate ways. Nick Fury promises that they’ll be back someday, when they are most needed. You saw it 15 years ago. You know how it’s going to end. Here are 5 reasons why you should see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet splash in the Atlantic Ocean again.",POSITIVE

"May 16, 2012"," This is Jeff Bayer, and I don't update this site very often. If you'd like to listen to my current movie podcast you can find it at MovieBS.com. WHO'S IT FOR? Do you love blockbusters, but consistently feel a little let down by the spectacle of it all? See this one, I think it will fulfill that void. Fun. Pure blockbuster fun. That's what Whedon, Downey Jr., Ruffalo and the rest of this cast and crew give you with The Avengers. It's amazing that this film even exists. I mean, think of the films that led up to it — Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and Thor. If any of those films had been a bomb, this one would have been in serious jeopardy. What's incredible is The Avengers manages to be more fun than anyone of those movies. With The Avengers there is power in numbers. They keep the story pretty simple, as they should with so many moving parts. Loki (Thor's brother) is back. There's a cube with unlimited power, he wants it, and to take control of Earth. Loki loves to talk about humans being desperate to serve. It's a nice concept to think about, just like The Matrix talks about humans being an infection. But what am I talking about Loki for? We have to get this superhero gang together. Each actor is giving the chance to play with and off the others. For superhero geeks, there's more fodder for the statement ""My superhero could beat up your superhero."" There's moments of Iron Man vs. Thor, the Hulk vs. Black Widow and plenty of others I won't bother teasing here. I'll be honest, I wasn't blown away with the beginning. It seemed to spend a little too much time with Loki, Black Widow and conversations (instead of explosions). Luckily, Whedon knows what he is doing. In one of my favorite scenes, Loki explains to Black Widow just how evil and deranged he is. It gives this character weight I didn't feel in the film Thor, but it also showcases how capable our heroes are with manipulating him. Soon after the slow beginning, we have nothing but amazing set pieces, giving you all of the action you can hope for. Even though the final battle throughout the city of New York looks like something straight out of a Michael Bay movie, there is a difference and it lies within our connection with these characters along with some great one-liners. Optimus Prime is good, and that's it. Tony Stark is good, snarky, and self-obsessed. That makes Iron Man's battle more enjoyable to watch. Two characters steal the show for me. Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson is a fantastic uniting force. He's central to the plot of having all of these individuals setting aside their egos, while trying to work together. He's also a voice for all of the fanboys out there. The other big winner here is Ruffalo. He fits as Bruce Banner, but much more importantly Whedon removed a lot of the moodiness of this character. Part of the problem with the Hulk has been that the audience wants to see him smash, but whoever plays Bruce Banner is forced to dislike his inner-demon. The Hulk is fun this time around. I don't know if that would be possible if Ruffalo gets his own feature-length film, but as a side-character it's perfect. While the running-time of this film is almost two and a half hours, I wanted more. Whedon is now a part of two of my favorite films of 2012. The Cabin in the Woods plays within the horror genre wonderfully. The Avengers is able to take a huge cast of characters, and make it incredibly fun. I can't wait to see if Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Captain America 2 will be able to keep this universe going, or if they'll feel tiny in comparison. Whatever the case, The Avengers starts the summer blockbuster season off with an incredibly fun ride.",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2012","Whedon manages all these disparate threads confidently, his script a model of self-control and restraint that's far from typical for the genre.",POSITIVE

"May 12, 2012"," After the most expensive trailer of all time ‒ five feature-length action films costing in the neighborhood of $200 million a throw — “The Avengers,” aka The Main Event, is pretty much what you’d expect ‒ noisy, overlong, wall-to-wall CG effects and arcane superhero lore meant to elicit knowing guffaws from the panting target audience (young, male, comic-book savvy). In this installment, Marvel’s Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) join forces at the behest of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson under eye patch) to battle Thor’s evil half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Strike Team Delta, as this confluence of superheroes is dubbed, is eventually joined by quick-draw archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) … after a knock on the noggin that brings him back from the dark side. Since he was sent packing in last year’s “Thor,” Loki has been looking for payback. Fury and his brain trust, led by Prof. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), inadvertently provide the means, a power cube that opens a doorway to space. Yes, it’s all fairly formulaic, but on a Wow! scale never before contemplated, much less experienced. Two by two, the superheroes square off to test one another’s mettle. And then all hell breaks loose as Loki unleashes his Asgardian army, which includes sled-like gizmos and giant metallic serpents. Will Team Delta be enough to save downtown Manhattan and the Stark Tower? Or will WMDs be necessary? Don’t fret, even as it plies all-out mayhem, this epic comic-book adventure preaches nuclear brinkmanship. Message: Maul now, bomb later. Appropriately, the biggest laughs come compliments of the Big Green Guy, who, after two of his own movies, finally lives up to his name. “Enough! I am a god!” Loki reminds the brawny bad boy. Without so much as a “Huh?” Hulk wipes the floor with the Nordic troublemaker-turned-ragdoll.",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2012"," After trying to unlock the secrets of the Tesseract (first introduced in Captain America, The First Avenger), the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (aka SHIELD) receives a visitor: Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who in typical arch-villain fashion promptly steals the Tesseract for his nefarious plans of global domination. The top guy in charge of SHIELD, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), then begins assembling a dream team of super heroes to counter the threat, including Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) aka Black Widow, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) aka Captain America, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) aka the Hulk, and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) aka Iron Man. As the film progresses, they also recruit Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Clint “Hawkeye” Barton (Jeremy Renner) to the cause, but before they can battle Loki and an army of alien invaders, they’ll have to figure out how to stop fighting among themselves first… and we get to watch. Joss Whedon understands. Whether you’re a comics fan from back in the day or new to the superhero party once Robert Downey Jr. suited up, writer and director Whedon knows not only what makes an ensemble film of heroes work but also what we want to see. He already knew what it took Michael Bay three Transformers movies to figure out: give the good guys a reason to fight and let them get to it in the most entertaining way possible. Mix well with a little witty banter and clever character moments to keep the exposition moving along so there’s a good reason for all the violence, and all the production problems solve themselves. Even at its most heroic, the characters still feel very human and relatable, right down to the last frame after the end of the credits. Mr. Whedon was reportedly given advice from Iron Man director Jon Favreau that “the machine will not let you fail” since teams of fantasy filmmaking experts would do or create whatever was needed to make his vision of the film work (and does it ever). Oh, and there’s a helicarrier! Woo hoo! Naysayers for this critic-proof spectacle really don’t have much of a leg to stand on here. Sure, you’ll get more enjoyment out of the movie if you know who these people are, but you don’t have to be a Marvel comics fan or even a comic book fan to “get” it. After ensemble shows like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Angel,” “Firefly,” and “Dollhouse,” Joss Whedon knows how to juggle characters and squeeze the most character out of a small scene or even a few words. In addition, the film effortlessly flows from one action piece to another, taking just enough time between money shots to set up the next treat. At no time do you get the impression that anyone is standing around waiting to say a line; in fact, most of the time, our poor heroes are terribly overwhelmed, creating a genuine feeling that, for all their super powers and experience, they’ve been set up to lose, and yet they keep fighting because no one else can. It’s all in there, every reason a great comic or popular comic book character exists, and Whedon makes it look easy. While the entire cast is exemplary and perfectly cast for their roles, a few standouts are due for mention. After two recent previous attempts to bring the Hulk to life onscreen, Mark Ruffalo’s portrayal of Joss Whedon’s take on the character finally brings the big green guy out we’ve all been waiting to see. After playing second banana to Nick Fury in Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson gets a meaty part to go with her black jumpsuit and adds another strong female character to the Whedonverse stables. Finally, there’s the man who can be credited for bringing the Avengers together, SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who’s only super power is doing his job and never taking no for an answer. The ending is also the perfect setup for all the planned and announced sequels for future Marvel comics movies while suggesting the villain for another Avengers film (who didn’t see that one coming?), but the real question many fans have is this: when are we going to get a Mark Ruffalo/Hulk film?",POSITIVE
"May 12, 2012","I have a feeling that this will be a comfort film for myself and many other film geeks for years to come, just like the Indiana Jones or Star Wars movies.",POSITIVE
"May 11, 2012"," This is it, kids–the moment you’ve been waiting for. You’ve endured two
Iron Man movies (one great, one not so), one middling
Thor flick, a pretty entertaining
Captain America, and two forgettable
Hulk outings, all to get to the whiz-bang superhero spectacular Marvel Comics has been promising you for years. There were plenty
of fears going in: Could geek guru
Joss Whedon successfully make the leap from TV
and one cult sci-fi flick to a mega-million-dollar summer tentpole?
Could personalities
this big exist in one movie without stomping all over one
another? Could the merely talented but not super-powered Hawkeye
and Black Widow merit their inclusion in the gang? Could ANYONE
finally get the Hulk right?
 The answers are yes, yes (though not without stomping,
but the verbal and physical infighting of the heroes is one of the
movie’s great pleasures), most definitely, and absolutely,
emphatically yes. Whedon delivers a thoroughly entertaining compilation
of the best of these heroes while never hiding either his giddy
love for the characters or the wry wit that has formed the
bedrock of his career. There are minor quibbles to be had, but
overall, this is exactly the
Avengers that hardcore comic fans and casual viewers should have hoped for. And once you see
Mark Ruffalo‘s nuanced take on Bruce Banner
and the Hulk, you may even find yourself looking forward to someone
making another inevitable
attempt at a Hulk movie that actually works. One programming
note: If you see the movie in 3D, go for the IMAX version, but
really, the 3D adds nothing, and you’ll be perfectly fine
opting for a 2D screening.
 For a less pyrotechnic option–at least, I’m assuming Dames
Judi Dench and Maggie Smith won’t develop
super powers and blow up the titular hotel by the end of the
movie–there’s this light British comedy about
a group of retirees heading to India to live out their days in
what promises to be a less expensive, more exotic locale than
Britain can offer. Of course, advertisements can be misleading,
and the group arrives at an Exotic Marigold Hotel that is
perhaps undeserving of the “best” modifier. Gentle hilarity, it
is assumed, ensues. Helmed by
Shakespeare in Love director
John Madden, the feel-good film has already had an excellent showing overseas, and has received praise from critics.
 
Andrew Dosunmu‘s debut feature tells the story
of an African immigrant getting by, but just barely, in his new home of
New York City. The
film premiered at Sundance last year, where it took some knocks
for a predictable storyline: Boy with big dreams comes to
the big city, gets involved with the wrong element, and falls
in love with the wrong girl; personal turmoil follows. But those
who did praise it generally felt the film’s weaknesses were far
outweighed by its stunning and poetic visual beauty, as well
as by its attempt to show the rarely addressed experience of
African immigrants in America.
 
Yilmaz Güney was one of the biggest stars of
Turkish cinema in the late ’50s and early ’60s, and he used that fame to
build a career as
a writer and director, with a little novel writing on the side.
However, that phase of his career was short-lived, as he ended
up spending most of the last decade of his life in prison, for
radical political action (sometimes violent) that also found
its way into his films. The Freer and the Goethe-Institut are
partnering for this eight-film retrospective of Güney’s work,
which starts on Sunday with a double feature of
The Hungry Wolves (about a grizzled bandit attempting to elude capture and protect his family) and
The Poor (a film about convicts that reflected his own experiences in prison) at the Freer, and continues on Wednesday at Goethe-Institut
with
The Herd (about a Kurdish family that must drive their flock of sheep in order to survive).
 With a career that was often overshadowed by his better-known, but not dissimilar, contemporary
George Méliès,
Segundo de Chomón was among the most
imaginative filmmakers of the early silent era, also making films
concerned with using special effects
and illusions to make the impossible possible onscreen. The
Spanish director and innovator made more than 300 shorts himself,
and helped provide special effects for some of the most
enduring silent features, such as
Cabiria and Abel Gance’s landmark 1927
Napoleon. The films in the collection at the National Gallery, accompanied by a live orchestra, are tied together by a “once upon
a time” folk-tale theme.
  Sydney Pollack, fresh off his breakthrough with
They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, and legendary tough-guy screenwriter
John Milius (writer of
Apocalypse Now, a number of
Dirty Harry movies, and the indelible “Indianapolis” monologue from
Jaws). Loosely based on the story of a real mountain
man who lived in the Montana territory in the mid-19th century, the film
stars Redford as the title character, a rugged loner and
trapper surviving on his own in the punishing terrain of the northern
Rockies. A big hit at the time, it seems to get remembered
slightly less regularly than many of Redford’s other big films
during this period, but this release, the first time the film
has appeared on Blu-ray, should serve as an excellent introduction
for audiences who may never have seen it.

"May 10, 2012"," The Avengers will surely rank among the best superhero movies, if not summer blockbusters, of all time. Unlike some recent franchises, this one offers comprehensible action sequences, good laughs that don't rely on crude humor, and a treatment that's true to the beloved source material. While big on Marvel mythology and action, it's relatively short on complexity. The headquarters of SHIELD—the U.S. government's high-tech law enforcement division—is infiltrated by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the evil Norse god of mischief and half-brother to Thor, god of thunder. Brainwashing some agents and scientists to assist him, Loki steals the Tesseract, a glowing cube of unlimited energy and ultimate power. Worse, he has made a pact with an alien race to open a portal with the Tesseract and enslave humankind. On the brink of war, SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) enacts a desperate plan: to call upon Earth's mightiest heroes to battle its mightiest villains. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)—perhaps you've heard of them? Along with SHIELD agents Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), they're humanity's last hope. In short, it's your basic superheroes-saving-the-planet story. But getting there is the challenge. These characters are used to playing solo. Egos clash. Each has personal baggage. Stan Lee's Marvel characters have endured because they're ordinary people with extraordinary powers—larger than life superheroes still grounded by their humanity, wrestling with everyday flaws and emotions. Director and co-writer Joss Whedon (Serenity, TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer) shares this trait in his work. He understands characters are key, so much of this film is spent on the heroes getting to know each other and understanding their roles. This leads to some tension, arguing, fighting, and it's a blast to see Iron Man go toe-to-toe with Thor, escalating their battle until clearer heads prevail. A film like this shouldn't work, because when characters battle for screen time, more typically yields less. But that actually plays to the plot, allowing the personalities to play off each other, ultimately making the cast stronger; we're never bored watching any single character. It also helps that The Avengers isn't saddled with origin stories. We already know who these characters are, freeing them up to explore new directions. It makes for a rare movie that is greater than the sum of its parts. The biggest surprise is the level of wit and humor—but that's typical Whedon. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, Downey gets his usual quips, but he doesn't run away with the film. Thor and Captain America have some good bits, and the introduction to Black Widow in the middle of a Russian espionage mission is pure Whedon in twists and timing. But Hulk steals the show a few times, causing audiences to cheer—and Marvel to sign a long-term picture deal with Ruffalo. The climax includes some 30 minutes of non-stop action that ranks up there with the giddy highs of Star Wars. It recalls the massive city battle from Transformers 3, and then renders that film a noisy wreck by comparison with all of its thrills and spectacle. Whedon must have been living a childhood dream here, playing with these toys onscreen. There are flaws. The movie starts slowly, despite the opening action. Some of the material is a bit corny and derivative. Sometimes the story feels like it's stalling for the finale. And it's questionable whether one can fully enjoy the film without having seen the other Marvel movies up to now. (They can, but not as much as fans of the comics and/or the previous five solo hero films.) Like Star Wars and other summer blockbusters before it, The Avengers seems destined to inspire a generation of young moviegoers, to remain a surefire crowd-pleaser for years, and a benchmark for the genre. It will be tough for Marvel to top this one—either with sequels for the individual characters or together as a team. But it'll sure be fun to watch them try. The Avengers is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, and a mild drug reference. There's lots of slam-bam superhero action with minimal bloodshed. There are a few stabbings, including one by impalement by a spear. Many alien invaders are killed by all manner of powers and weapons, but their deaths are cartoonish. To break into a vault, Loki uses a menacing piece of alien technology on someone's eye for a retinal scan. The Hulk's first appearance (in the shadows) could be monstrous enough to scare young children, though the green giant may become a kids' favorite by film's end. The drug reference is very brief. There are about half a dozen mild profanities. It's worth noting that Captain America makes passing reference to ""only one God.""",POSITIVE

"May 9, 2012"," Well, here we are at last. Years of movies with tag scenes promising the arrival of an Avengers movie have finally delivered on that promise—and this is it. Was it worth the wait or the build-up? That depends on your level of interest in this sort of thing, I suppose. Despite the inane gush of Those Who Object to Being Called “Fanboys,” this is not the greatest movie ever made, nor does it reinvent cinema. That said, however, it’s a solid entertainment and much better than I’d expected from the maestro of midcult, Joss Whedon. Oh, sure he places the film firmly in the realm of his usual sitcom sensibility, and the gags become transparent in their structure once you get into the rhythm of the movie, but this is probably the best possible approach for a movie like this. The sheer volume of characters calls for a kind of cinematic shorthand—and that’s what it gets. The film’s story is about as substantial as all the tissue wadding in a box concealing a small treasure at its center. What else could it be? All that matters, of course, is that the film has a problem—meaning the Earth has a problem—which calls for amassing a large array of superheroes (and a couple of borderline cases) to save our hash. That, naturally, is why Nick Fury (the irreplaceable Samuel L. Jackson) has been assembling all these folks as part of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division) all this time. The issue this round is the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston—the second best thing in the movie) is preparing the way for an invasion of creatures from another dimension that will leave him (he thinks) ruler of a subjugated Earth. As an excuse for cramming one movie with Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), it’s as good as any other. Just think of it as the Contadina Tomato Paste of film—or Grand Hotel in tights—and don’t ask too many questions. The whole thing banks—wisely—on its cast. Especially helpful here is the importation of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, a character never really nailed in any previous incarnation—and here represented by an actor of considerably greater charm and innate sympathy than any of his predecessors. But in the end, it’s the ensemble nature of the playing—something that gets off to a deliberately rocky start—that finally makes the story work.  It’s not a flawless mix. There’s no way to make Captain America all that interesting—especially when you put him up against Iron Man. The film does build its most subversive joke around the Captain, giving Fury’s right-hand man, Coulson (Clark Gregg), a kind of fanboy crush (with subtext aplenty) on him. And that, in turn, becomes a serious plot point, but Cap is still pretty much a stiff. Also, Whedon apparently couldn’t figure out what to do with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), so she’s essentially written out of the body of the movie. But more of it works—in its own way—than doesn’t. And it has the benefit of never taking itself too seriously or straining to be “important.” The film’s biggest problem—and some will consider this in the nature of a spoiler, so you might want to skip the rest of this paragraph—is that its big finale ends up being most awfully like last year’s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. It’s certainly better done here, but the similarities are inescapable. This might well be completely coincidental, which only points up a central issue with the genre’s limitations and the fact that all such movies have to hit certain key scenes—notably a big final battle that more often than not outstays its welcome for anyone who tires of endless property damage. It doesn’t sink The Avengers, but it does diminish it. Take it for what it is—big, splashy, largely transitory entertainment.

Thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion. It’s not a flawless mix. There’s no way to make Captain America all that interesting — especially when you put him up against Iron Man. Thankfully I enjoyed Black Widow’s treatment here. Of the returning characters she stood to gain the most since she wasn’t given much to do in Iron Man 2. Johansson handled the material she was given quite well, I thought. I believed her character -which actually becomes key and provides more fun in certain scenes. And yeah, Ruffalo was a great addition. He has an a sort of natural world-weariness about him that lends itself nicely to Bruce Banner’s emotionally repressed, troubled genius persona. Bear in mind, it’s a passing friendliness in the sense that I pretty much guarantee you, I’ll never see it again. Thinking about it — and exempting 1930s-40s serials and movies sent to me by studios at the end of the year — I realize I have actually bought only Batman and Batman Returns (more for Tim Burton films than anything else), X2, and The Spirit. I don’t know that that’s likely to change any time soon. Ha, yes well the Burton Batmans are the only superhero movies I own as well, and basically for the same reason. (Super doesn’t count, right?). And then there’s Sin City and A History of Violence if we’re talking about comic-book/graphic novel adaptations.  The Spirit was one of the worst things I’ve tried to sit through in recent memory.  On three occasions I tried to slug through it, but failed. Heh, well then I probably come down somewhere in the middle when it comes to the Nolan/Bale Batman series. Excited though that The Spirit now strikes me as a polarizing film with a couple credible supporters in its corner rather than a universally dismissed film. I’ll be checking it out soon. You can add Justin to the supporters of The Spirit. As for the Nolan Batmoose pictures…well, we can all go to the mat over that when the last one comes out. I look forward to how Xandadon’t assesses the film.  From what I can glean from reading reviews and comments people made about the film when it was released, there seems to be no middle ground.  One either likes it or intensely dislikes it. I know one person whose only real problem with the film is that he doesn’t like the Octopus’s cloned henchman. So I guess he’s sorta in the middle. A lot of the anger (I don’t expect this is an issue for you) is that it pokes fun at the whole idea of taking this stuff seriously. That was seen as attacking the new-found “respectability” of the comic book movie. Oh, I have no anger at all, and I’m okay with poking fun at most anything.  For me it was more pedestrian…I didn’t care for the lead character, found it somewhat confusing and worst of all, boring.  I expected more after Sin City. I’m not; my comic hero days ended not long after most Marvel characters were introduced, when I began to graduate to magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland.  I’m still a horror movie fan, though.

Same with my old comic book collection, but I imagine many wish the same thing. It received the first standing ovation I’ve seen outside a festival in YEARS.

I enjoyed it, but it will not be a cultural milestone in my life.  For younger people it looks like it is, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  Seeing their reactions was as fun as the movie. I’m glad I missed that. That kind of overkill reaction to a movie I liked well enough, but will never see a second time would have merely annoyed me. My screening had a guy triumphantly throw both arms up and shout, “Yes!  That was awesome!” at the two funniest Hulk parts…but he remained seated. It would have been nice if Jeremy Renner had been given a little more to do.  Ruffalo got his due, but when you have two “what are these guys doing in a superhero movie” actors, you should get the most out of them both. I’m glad I missed that.

Ruffalo got his due, but when you have two “what are these guys doing in a superhero movie” actors, you should get the most out of them both. A point I have discussed with a few folks recently.  I haven’t seen the movie yet (plan to on Sunday though), but immediately wondered what an archer (regardless of how good) and a female martial-arts practicing, gun-toting assassin were doing with people with either super-human powers or technology that effectively gave them same.  Especially when they are fighting otherworldly bad guys with awesome power. Exactly.  The archer skills are pretty remarkable and there’s also some gadgetry involved, but not on the level of Iron Man.  I think you’ll find that the less extraordinary a character, the less they’re given to do.  That includes Samuel L. Jackson, too. Two points there — he really hasn’t any significant box office draw, and, face it, his character in the film isn’t very exciting — and more, perhaps, isn’t one of the bigger Marvel charcters. After the new BOURNE film, he almost certainly will.  Also, not that Renner was its primary draw, but the latest MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE may have outgrossed Ruffalo’s entire resume. I’m more lamenting that an actor of Renner’s caliber was given such a bland character.  I’ve only seen him in four other films, but he made a strong impression in each. It comes down to what Dionysis and I said: the less super a hero, the less interesting they are, and the less material they’re given.  Whedon generally does a good job of playing superhero socialism and the more remarkable characters shine in what are all supporting roles. The more human Avengers don’t really need to be in the film, but since they were included, a few more good lines or brief heroic moments could have helped. I don’t particularly want to defend the film, but by its very nature, it’s overstuffed with characters. They aren’t all gonna be showcased — unless you want to add two more hours, which I’m not in favor of. When Marvel produced “Avengers Ultimates”, the graphic novel series on which this franchise is visually based, they specifically re-engineered the Nick Fury personae to be SLJ (as opposed to the square-jawed, crew-cut/saltpepper white due, probably an amalgram of Stan Lee) because he was still riding the wave produced by his over-the-top performances in “Pulp Fiction”, etc. I WANT TO LOVE Jackson, but ever since “S.W.A.T.”, I have noticed a perceptible reduction in the energy of his performances, especially in his cameos in the pre-“Avengers” Marvel adaptations, essentially phoning them in.  I have the same criticism of Powers Booth, who I LOVED in the 80s, but who was an absolute joke in “Tombstone”. Also Tommy Lee Jones could lately stand some stimulation. Or, maybe the old lions need to step aside and let some young bloods into the arena. After the new BOURNE film, he almost certainly will. Also, not that Renner was its primary draw, but the latest MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE may have outgrossed Ruffalo’s entire resume. The more human Avengers don’t really need to be in the film, but since they were included, a few more good lines or brief heroic moments could have helped. I saw “Avengers” Sunday. SLJ had just the right balance of “shut yo mouth” cool and “I’m in charge here” gravitas. Powers Booth was OK for just sitting behind a desk on a viewscreen. I still maintain that both are showing thier age and that action films need to draft some new, younger talent. The question was asked of the relevance of non-superhuman( techno- or organically) characters. Simple. Both Black Widow and Hawkeye were in the original comics and “Ultimates”, so their exclusion would have been noticable to comic fans. I thought ScarJo and Renner were excellent picks. The exploding arrow in Loki’s face showed that in the comic universe, even a mortal can stand up to a demi-god if he is a fast thinker. I do think the Cap role should have focused more on his role as a leader and strategic thimker as the “Ultimates” comics did. Iron Man was a much less stable, MUCH more flawed follower in the comics. Maybe Robert Downey’s current high standing would prevent him from deferring to Chris Evans. I’m a huge, HUGE fan of Marvel Comics, so The Avengers was a big deal for me and it didn’t disappoint in the slightest. Finally, we have a comic book movie that’s not afraid to BE a comic book movie, with all the over-the-top action, ludicrous plotting, colorful costumes, etc. that comics have and, for the most part, no one thinks this is a bad thing. If the same exact movie had been released ten years ago, it would have been relentlessly bashed for its unapologetic goofiness but today, just about everyone agrees that it’s awesome. We’ve come a long way. The Avengers may not have reinvented cinema, but it absolutely has reinvented the superhero movie genre and opened the door for more films like it and I can’t wait to see what filmmakers come up with next. If Warner Bros were smart, they’d begin setting up their own onscreen DC Universe and the upcoming Superman film seems like a perfect opportunity. Here’s hoping. Very entertaining flick; I would give it maybe a half-star more than Ken, and unlike him, I would (and will) watch it again, although not anytime soon.  I expect the DVD will have additional footage (I know, making it longer).  I’d say that having recently re-watched all of the previous Avenger character films (both Hulks, both Iron Man films, Captain America, Thor) I felt this was the best of them all.  I agree there were too many characters (much like there were too many villians in Spiderman 3), but I still had a good time.  And while I had lamented having yet a third actor play Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was the best of the bunch IMO. I think they’ve been banned by law from making another movie. If the law hasn’t been enacted, I strongly suspect the money lost on that last fiasco precludes further funding. I finally saw Tim & Eric’s Billion Dollar Movie. Wow. I need a shower. But I still believe they have a nugget of genius in them. The funny thing I notice about the reviews is that people who don’t like the movie call it (and T&E’s other work) “intentionally bad”, and it merely fails at being funny in it’s ‘intentional badness’. I disagree – I think they are doing a great job reflecting the badness of our mainstream culture, and it makes us uncomfortable. Back to the Avengers, my take is that it’s a nearly perfect adaptation of the spirit of the source material. I didn’t have any problems with it to speak of. It may be the best superhero movie yet made in terms of actually being faithful to the source material. Nolan’s Batman films — and even Burton’s, for that matter — aren’t so much about Batman as they are about reinterpreting the idea of the character through the director’s vision and worldview. Here, however, we have Marvel’s view of the characters, not Whedon’s. Cap is Cap, not some revisionist take on American politics. Hulk is Hulk, not some Ang Lee experiment in daddy issues and CGI. Even Renner’s Hawkeye and Johansson’s Black Widow are played exactly as you’d expect them to be shown in the comics. For me, this is vital. From a fan’s perspective — and I’m a casual fan at best these days, not having bought a comic in years — the movie got the most important thing right: We want to see the Marvel universe treated like these characters are valid in their own rights. Whedon actually gets them. He’s playing in that universe, but he’s not trying to change it or the people in it to suit his whims. That’s always been my problem with comic adaptations: Burton’s Batman isn’t the Batman from the comics. His Penguin CERTAINLY isn’t the Penguin from the comics. The films he made are valid as artistic expression, sure, but I’ve always thought it was a dick move to get people who LOVE these characters all excited — and to grasp and grab for their money — and then not actually delivering on what they thought they were buying. If you went to see a movie about Groucho Marx, and it was played by a blond guy with a Southern accent who smacks of Truman Capote and only did comedy because he had self-esteem issues after he was abused by his mother, and only puts on the greasepaint mustache as an ironic statement about his masculine identity, with no allusion or mention of his brothers, you’d probably feel ripped off. That’s exactly what it’s like to watch most comic book movies. It’s not Groucho, it’s just a guy who looks like Groucho enough to trick me into buying a ticket. The Avengers didn’t do that. It’s not a great film in the sense of it having a lasting artistic message or having a deeper meaning. But neither is the source material great art. It is, however, very much an Avengers story, and it’s one of the very few times I’ve seen a superhero movie and felt like it was made by people who actually get what superheroes are in general, and who these characters are in particular. I think you hit the nail on the head with this piece, and I completely agree.  I had to chuckle a bit at this line…”some Ang Lee experiment in daddy issues and CGI.”  That revision to the Hulk story and the silly looking CGI effects kept me from liking that movie at all. Much as I enjoyed this film and prefer Mark Ruffalo in the role (which has more to do with casting than anything), I’d say that this Hulk can be fairly assessed as “some Joss Whedon sitcom writing and CGI.” That the CGI is better here has more to do with advances in CGI and the fact that we’ve become so used to the slightly cartoony look.  Agreed. But I highly doubt Tim Burton is a director who would know what to do with a Groucho Marx movie. He’s almost certainly the wrong guy to make that movie, although — because it’s Burton — the results would at least be interesting. A small difference is that there is a defined Groucho Marx. Batman has been played by Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Christian Bale. And he’s changed numerous times in print in between 1939 and now. There’s a definitive Groucho, but not a definitive Batman. Much as I enjoyed this film and prefer Mark Ruffalo in the role (which has more to do with casting than anything), I’d say that this Hulk can be fairly assessed as “some Joss Whedon sitcom writing and CGI.” There’s more to it than that. Whedon’s script actually presents Banner and the Hulk as they are in the comics. To do that, he has to know who those characters actually are. It’s not just as simple as Banner is a nerd and the Hulk is a green rage monster. There have been nearly 50 years of people telling stories about this character — he’s as familiar and known as Luke Skywalker or James Bond — and while you can play with what that means to a certain extent, people know instantly if he’s not being played right. These aren’t characters invented for a film. They’re characters that have survived half-a-century for a reason. All Whedon had to do was not get in the way of that. I’m not saying it’s brilliant scriptwriting to have the Hulk call Loki a “Puny god,” but that is TOTALLY a Hulk thing to say. He got the character, and he got Banner. It may sound easy to sum this character up, but this is the first time in three movies where anyone has gotten the character right from a comic-fan perspective. Ang Lee had a whole film to tell that story, and failed largely because it wasn’t actually about the Banner/Hulk other than as a metaphor. It wasn’t Bruce Banner and it wasn’t the Hulk. Whedon had not even a fourth of a movie and got it right, because Banner is very obviously the Banner from the comics, and the creature on the screen is actually the Hulk the fans know and love. This whole turn of argument reminds me of the guy who went ballistic because the posters for Dumb and Dumberer didn’t make it clear that Jim Carrey “and that other guy” weren’t in the film. Or the old lady who was cheesed because the 2005 Honeymooners didn’t have Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in it. Of course, they can, but…there’s a lot more at work than that. Put simply, no movie made the amount of money this latest has based on the whims of comic book purists. There may be a lot of them, sure, but there aren’t enough to generate these figures. True. But from a fan’s perspective — again, the people who care enough about this guy to read story after story of him hitting people and moping about his dead parents — all they’re looking for is someone who gets the fundamentals of the character right. And there ARE fundamentals. It’s never going to be a nuanced or complex as an actual person — never definitive — but getting the basics isn’t hard as long as you understand the character. Nolan gets MUCH more right than he does wrong with Batman, for instance. I have my problems with some parts of his films, but I do feel like he’s trying to tell me a Batman story. I don’t feel like he’s using the character to tell me another story he couldn’t get funded otherwise. It’s not about the purists. There are A LOT of things that actual purists would quibble with — the Nick Fury of the Avengers is white, Thor has no Donald Blake origin story, Captain America doesn’t have super strength, the aliens aren’t called Skrulls for licensing reasons in the Fantastic Four franchise — and I’m sure they’re bitching about it one some message board now. But I’d argue that it did make this amount of money because it was made for people who actually like superheroes. It was clearly made by people who like these characters, and who understand them. Sure, there was a HUGE marketing push and several films and all kinds of money spent on this thing, but all of that worked because these same stories and characters have been working for 50 years in other media. That’s why Disney bought them in the first place. And when you make a fun movie about characters people like, with actors playing them who seem to get the idea of what they’re playing, and a story that doesn’t actively insult you for liking this kind of thing, I think it’s awesome that makes a lot of money. See, to me, you can stop right there. It’s the real answer. That the movie is good is almost gravy. People loved this movie before they ever saw it.  Actually, no, I don’t. I think he’s far more interested in being deep dish and important. I think he’s in the throes of making the world’s most pompous comic book movies. You keep forgetting that pre-Burton no one had ever made a “serious” film about Batman. It was the first movie to even address the dead parent issue and the first to treat the material as being suitable for anyone over 12. But it kept a balance between that weightier aspect and being fun. The character(s) worked for Burton because they fall — at least roughly — into the outsider realm, and because they evidenced obsessions that were incomprehensible to anyone but themselves. And remember, the first film was hugely successful — at one point it was the highest grossing film ever — and it was seen (often more than once) by people who normally wouldn’t go to this kind of film. Yes, that was partly PR at work. (Just imagine what it coulda been with the internet and half-a-billion invested in movies leading up to it!) It’s also worth remembering that Burton’s follow-up — a more personal film in every respect, but still recognizably a Batman picture, regardless of how you feel about the Penguin — was also a huge moneymaker. Its sin was that it was pitched at kids — right down to its Happy Meal toys — and it scared the crap out of them. Or at least it scared the crap out of their parents. (Now, I can imagine being 8 or 9 and being terrified by the first attack on Gotham City, but I’m thinking in terms of an 8 or 9-year-old in early 1960s terms. I doubt it had the same impact on the 1992 version.) This is where Warner Bros. steps in and hires Joel Schumacher and tells him they want a lighter toned take — something between Burton and Adam West. And we know where that led (though I think Schumacher gets a kinda bum rap because he gave the studio what the asked for). Now, I’d say that the Burton films are more interesting to me as Burton films, but I’m much more interested in Burton than I am in Batman, so that’s no surprise. But they at least are colorful and balance out as serious enough without being humorless. Nolan’s films are drab, grey and cheerless. I said it when Batman Begins came out — the only person in the movie that seemed to get the idea that this is outre and ought to be a little fun was Cillian Murphy. Thing is, I don’t dislike Nolan per se. I think The Prestige is brilliant and Inception is very, very good. But I don’t like his Batman films — no matter how well made they are — because they’re simply no fun. Even the generally serious X Men movies — the two from Singer — achieve a balance, if only through Magneto’s campiness. Now, this, is where The Avengers scores — as do three of the movies that lead up to it — by remembering to be fun. This will probably fall on deaf ears, but I’d really suggest people not use the “reply” button, and stick to the regular old practice of quoting and adding a comment. It’s not that I personally prefer it (though I do), but once this falls off the main page and goes into the archived reviews, that placement is gone. For example, if you go and look at this review in the archive, it appears that Edwin has agreed to my screed on the Burton Batman movies and not the endorsements of Black Snake Moan. (Yet another classic side-effect of the New Coke site.) “This will probably fall on deaf ears, but I’d really suggest people not use the “reply” button, and stick to the regular old practice of quoting and adding a comment.” (Now, I can imagine being 8 or 9 and being terrified by the first attack on Gotham City, but I’m thinking in terms of an 8 or 9-year-old in early 1960s terms. I doubt it had the same impact on the 1992 version.) I can chime in on this.  I was five years old. It was in Wyoming.  I had all the McDonald’ toys in hand (Batman characters in cars.) And I can remember the movie viewing experience quite vividly. The first attack on Gotham City I thought was great.  The creation of Catwoman (with all the cats licking her ‘dead’ body) FREAKED me out.  When the Penguin bites of Christopher Walken’s nose, I was REALLY FREAKED out, and dug my face into my mothers arm.  I remember being very sad much later when the penguins drug off the Penguins dead body.  And then lit up when Catwoman was still alive. Anyway, “The Avengers.” No real complaints. I expected to hate it, and instead, had a good time.  I’d see it again, and I doubt any other super hero movie this year is going to top it.  A pleasant surprise. You are correct.  Details like that get fuzzy and tend to blend as you grow up, and I admit I really haven’t seen “Batman Returns” all the way through since I was five.  Just bits and pieces. I  probably  have some childhood scarring because of that movie, and I haven’t realized it until now. I think the basic difference between Shanghai Steve and me is simply, I’m more interested in movies than comics, and he’s more interested in comics. Well, hell, if he’s interested in comics at all, he’s more interested than I am, come to think of it. Alright, so I get where you’re coming from that there is this trend that the genre needs a massive battle at the end.  We’ve seen so much of these now, that what’s meant to be exciting can grow boring, as if you’re watching a big budget video game on the big screen.  And it all feels overly long. All I can say is it worked for me.  I liked how it was constructed, and I liked how every character had their bit to shine (though Hulk and Iron Man clearly steal the show.) I found everything to be easy to follow (it’d be a different story if it was shaky cam hell) and balanced enough that it isn’t a constantly obnoxious BLAM BLAM BLAM for 40 minutes.  Plus *SPOILER SPOILERS SPOILERS* when Iron Man makes what he thinks is his last call to Ms. Potts and she doesn’t answer, I found to be quite poignant.  I knew he was gonna make it in the end, but I liked how that was handled. I’ll be vastly surprised. Certainly the reworking of A Night at the Opera — Brain Donors I think it was called — didn’t make a dent. Alright, so I get where you’re coming from that there is this trend that the genre needs a massive battle at the end. We’ve seen so much of these now, that what’s meant to be exciting can grow boring, as if you’re watching a big budget video game on the big screen. And it all feels overly long. Exactly, and while this was better done, that’s still what it is. In fact, it’s very close to the ending of a movie from last year. My problems with a lot of the Marvel movies is when we get to the last stretch in the movie, it either feels like it goes on too long (my slight gripe with “X-Men 2”, and you could make that argument here) or it ends up being REALLY weak (ugh, “Iron Man” I look at you.) No questions that the first Iron Man ending is pretty awful. But the big battle thing threatens to become about on par with Tarzan yodelling for the elephants. Nolan’s Batman films — and even Burton’s, for that matter — aren’t so much about Batman as they are about reinterpreting the idea of the character through the director’s vision and worldview. Whether is be the Bill Dozier television show, the Bruce Timm animated series (my personal favourite), the BBC radio serials, the Schumacher/Goldsman pictures of Chris Nolan’s recent films, they all present a rich white guy who goes around beating up criminals dressed as a bat because his parents got murdered by a mugger when he was a kid. I happen to like the animated series more than most, which chimes with the Denny O’Neill/Steve Englehart take on Batman as basically Philip Marlowe in a cape. Dark and noirish, but still fun, unpretentious and genuinely thrilling. As much as I dislike BATMAN AND ROBIN, I can’t really look at it and say ‘That’s not Batman’, because it kind of is. It’s not a dissimilar approach to the character than the comics of the 1950s. It doesn’t float my boat, but I think battering around films based on comics for lack of faithfulness is a little misguided anyway. These characters have been around for over half a century in a lot of cases. They pretty much have to be filtered through the unifying sensibility of a director and screenwriter for the film to have any semblance of coherency or a point of view. I wouldn’t expect Tim Burton’s Batman film to be anything other than Tim Burton’s interpretation of who Batman is, as realised by Sam Hamm, Michael Keaton et al.  I don’t think THE AVENGERS is anything less than Joss Whedon’s interpretation of who these characters are, they just happen to chime with interpretations you like from the comics.  a rich white guy who goes around beating up criminals dressed as a bat because his parents got murdered by a mugger when he was a kid. The serials, by the way, eschew the dead parents trauma and I don’t recall it from the TV show, though it’s a very long time since I saw that — and I bailed before the end of the run as a kid. The serials, by the way, eschew the dead parents trauma and I don’t recall it from the TV show, though it’s a very long time since I saw that — and I bailed before the end of the run as a kid. I don’t think it sounds dumb. It sounds childish, but that’s one of the parts of the character I’ve always found interesting – a large part of his emotional development stopped when his parents got murdered and he’s spent his life living up a promise he made when he was eight years old.

It sounds childish, but that’s one of the parts of the character I’ve always found interesting – a large part of his emotional development stopped when his parents got murdered and he’s spent his life living up a promise he made when he was eight years old. Being a fan does not mean I necessarily take all the films seriously or am blind to their manifest absurdity. Can I honestly take a guy in tights dressed up like a bat as a crime fighter with any degree of seriousness? No. I think you are giving Joss Whedon WAY TOO MUCH credit for “interpreting” these characters. Read the Marvel “Avengers:Ultimates” series of graphic novels. With very little exception, this movie was created from the comic as if it were a production storyboard (that was where Nick Fury became Sam Jackson), albeit compressing the overall storyline from two large volumes into one chapter. If anyone should be credited with “interpretation”, it should be Marvel’s writers. Whedon just cut-and-pasted from the medium of paper to celluloid. There’s only ONE television show I own on DVD in its entirety, and that’s it right there. I don’t think anyone will improve upon that Batman or that Gotham City no matter what kind of talent or money is thrown at it. Are you saying the snappy patter dialogue is in those comics? Really, that’s where most of the film’s characterizations come from. That said, the style of Downey’s wisecracks was defined two films ago anyway. 
There’s only ONE television show I own on DVD in its entirety, and that’s it right there. I don’t think anyone will improve upon that Batman or that Gotham City no matter what kind of talent or money is thrown at it. The great thing about characters with this much elasticity and history is that their can be innumerable interpretations over time in various media. Hopefully, we’ll all find the one interpretation of our favourite characters that just ticks all the boxes for us. Take Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. I doubt anyone’s going to top Clive Merrison and Michael Williams in the roles as written by Bert Coules, but I’ll still get excited about new versions, including this upcoming CBS thing with Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu. “Are you saying the snappy patter dialogue is in those comics? Really, that’s where most of the film’s characterizations come from. That said, the style of Downey’s wisecracks was defined two films ago anyway.” In fact, yes, the dialogue in the “Avengers: Ultimates” comics were just as dapper as in the movie. When the alien commander demanded his surrender, Captain America replied ‘the “A” on my uniform does not stand for “France”!’ The exception was the Iron Man/Tony Stark character which was NOT drawn as RDJr. or given his acerbic wit. The character in the comic, was an alcoholic wreck of a man whose fear and self-loathing required frequent ass-kickings from Nick “Sam Jackson” Fury and a much more strategic and aggressive Cap in order to function in the team.  It was unfortunate that while RBJr rose to the occasion of bringing a BETTER Stark/Iron Man to the big screen, Chris Evans could not do the dame for Cap. SLJ was about what you would expect if you read the comic and then saw the movie. Neither contribution would I attribute to Whedon, he was simply a credible composer to a crop of pretty good self-starting artists. I’d say that’s a sizable contribution — unless you think Downey just made up his lines and character. Now, that said, Whedon had the two previous Iron Man pictures to draw on. And he’s ridiculous — even if he’s really just a throwback to the old hooded killer, and he’s a lot less ludicrous than the original version (The Bat from 1926). Of course, it’s also just a contrivance to keep us from knowing who the master criminal is. And…he isn’t wearing tights. I think Downey did contribute a lot to the Stark character, as did director Jon Favreau, so that after the first two movies, the character’s wisacre wit was well-established for Joss Whedon to run with. I saw little in Avengers to suggest Whedon had anything NEW to add. Between the comic (ahem, graphic novel) and the precursers, Whedon’s creative work was essentially done for him (except for Cap, for whom I think he COULD and SHOULD have borrowed more from the comic. All three were wealthy vigilantes combating crime (or political oppresion) while wearing masks, operating out of lairs, and pretending to be harmless, shallow fops in public. I think Downey did contribute a lot to the Stark character, as did director Jon Favreau, so that after the first two movies, the character’s wisacre wit was well-established for Joss Whedon to run with. As an auteurist, it pains me to note that neither Downey, nor Favreau wrote those films. Now, I’m sure that they were written for Downey and with him in mind, and I imagine that Favreau had some input. At the same time, Whedon — and Clapton knows I am not a Whedonite — did write The Avengers, which does give him some credit here. Yes, he wrote in an already defined style. But this wasn’t the issue — the issue was whether or not it was all there in the comics. All three were wealthy vigilantes combating crime (or political oppresion) while wearing masks, operating out of lairs, and pretending to be harmless, shallow fops in public. I’m not sure about the Pimpernel, but Zorro was a very strong and direct influence on Bob Kane when he created Batman, especially the Doug Fairbanks film version. As far as I recall, he essentially created the character by taking Zorro and giving him a costume inspired by The Bat Whispers and an old Da Vinci sketch of a flying machine design. Actually, Downey and Favreau rewrote a lot of the Stark character together while in preproduction on the first film, and Downey rewrote a lot of his dialogue in the second. Nope, still sitting there on the same browser I left open when I left for work -despite the fact that I hit “send” twice… Hmmm. Guess I’ll try pasting it into a new browser and see if I can get it to go. I look forward to how Xandadon’t assesses the film. From what I can glean from reading reviews and comments people made about the film when it was released, there seems to be no middle ground. One either likes it or intensely dislikes it. Well I finally caught up with The Spirit and I stand happily in line with those few who liked it. Hard to say what my feelings about it would’ve been upon its release -I suspect not as positive. I do think that the latest influx of underwhelming or completely tone-deaf comic-book movies made The Spirit all the more refreshing in comparison. What really attracted me to the film was its confidence in style. And whether the film-makers were paying homage to classic film noir iconography or in cases where they were just going for straight camp I found it all a heck of a lot of fun. I had a dopey smile on my face just about the entire time. And I really enjoyed the various and often ridiculous set-ups and locations that we encounter Octopus.  For me, I think it’s less that than the pompous nature of comic book movies that take themselves too seriously that makes me like it. “I smell dental…and Nazis.” There is much to be said, I think, for Sam Jackson in an SS uniform. The whole idea of mastermind criminal who literally plays dress-up strikes me as inspired.",POSITIVE
"May 8, 2012"," The recently formed Marvel Studios has successfully developed a risky new approach, churning out individual superhero films that kickstart their own series of sequels and act as prequels for a separate omnibus superhero series (Marvel has come a long way from their economically disastrous and aesthetically embarrassing forays into movie-making in the 1980s and early ’90s, which resulted in duds like the George Lucas-produced Howard the Duck, a forgettable low-budget Captain America starring Matt Salinger, and a junky Roger Corman-produced Fantastic Four). The potential ramifications are mind-boggling for individual viewers and exhilarating for shareholders, as each new film can work double or triple duty, spinning off sequels while contributing to other interlocking franchises, thus creating a potentially infinite cinematic universe of superheroics. Whether this represents a new depth of multi-modal storytelling or the greatest corporate coup in modern cinema is yet to be decided. It all started when Samuel L. Jackson appeared in a brief scene as Nick Fury after the end credits of Iron Man (2008), and every Marvel Studios film since then—The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)—has been tailored to fit into a larger, pre-planned schematic, the culmination of which is The Avengers. It brings all of the superheroes together in a $220-million, nearly two-and-a-half-hour behemoth of a movie, the underlying concept being that bigger is always better and more is always, well, more. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, creator of the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Angel, The Avengers works well enough on its own as sound and fury, but any real enjoyment from the film will come only to those who have spent time with the characters in the earlier films, which serves the broader corporate interests in compelling viewers to consume the whole package, rather than just individual components. It’s the industry’s new version of block-booking, the old studio practice of forcing exhibitors to lease pre-packaged sets of films rather than choosing them individually, except now it’s aimed at viewers. Viewing pleasure in The Avengers lies in the simultaneously competing and compatible personalities and skill sets of the various characters, who together form a kind of “freak show” team of superheroes of the mutant, supernatural, and self-made varieties. Thus, some of the film’s best scenes involve the characters engaged in interpersonal squabbling, rather than CGI-fueled pyrotechnics. The best scene, in fact, takes place aboard a giant flying aircraft carrier where the disparate members of the team are assembled together for the first time and find that they don’t get along so well. Billionaire industrialist/playboy/witty quip maestro Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who encases himself in a sophisticated metal suit as Iron Man, immediately hits it off with Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, following in the moody footsteps of Eric Bana and Edward Norton), a physicist whose exposure to gamma radiation causes him to morph into the green-skinned behemoth Hulk when angered, if only because they speak the same scientific language. It is for the very opposite reason that Stark clashes so vividly with Steve Rogers, otherwise known as the super-soldier Captain America, who has recently been unthawed after seven decades and still thinks in terms of World War II-era patriotism and homespun values and therefore cannot fathom Stark’s modern cynicism and grand-standing egocentrism (not to mention sarcastic sense of humor). Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Norse demigod whose younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is the villain de jour whose world-threatening antics require the Avengers to band together, is always at one remove because he is the only nonhuman in the group. And then there’s Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), whose “red in the ledger” background is left ill-defined, thus offering no real challenge to her primary role as fetish object, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an expert archer whose character is even more ill-defined and spends the first half of the film under Loki’s control. There is plenty of mayhem to go around, although interestingly the first half of the movie focuses primarily on the Avengers fighting each other before they finally pull together as a team. Thus, Iron Man goes head-to-head with Thor before their fight is broken up by Captain America, the Hulk goes after Black Widow, and Black Widow must fight Hawkeye to get him to snap out of his Loki-induced evil servitude. Once they figure out they should all be fighting on the same team, they focus their attention on saving the world from Loki’s plan, which involves using that glowing blue cube we saw in Captain America to open a wormhole to another realm that allows the Chitauri, an army of villainous fiends who look like Orcs redesigned by H.R. Giger, to invade lower Manhattan, which is (of course) mostly destroyed in the ensuing battle (a humorous coda to the battle finds a New York senator railing against the Avengers and how they need to be held accountable for all the property damage inflicted). Whedon handles the large-scale stuff with ample aplomb and enough visual coherence to make it exciting rather than simply headache-inducing, but at times the film threatens to overwhelm itself with too many characters, too many battles, and too much at stake at any given moment. That is, of course, par for the course in a movie with such grand physical aspirations, and at its best it maintains an impressive juggling act in keeping all the characters simultaneously at the forefront without allowing any one to completely take over (although Downey Jr. does his best, given that his character is the most clearly defined and interesting). Unfortunately, it fails to create much depth, even of the comic book variety. I couldn’t help but wish for some socio-political gravitas in the vein of Bryan Singer’s X2 (2003) or Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008), or even the psychological and aesthetic daring of Ang Lee’s much maligned Hulk (2003), but The Avengers remains stubbornly literal in virtually every regard. Given the boffo box office of its first weekend, there is no doubt that The Avengers 2 is already in the planning, and the only question is how Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Captain America 2, and whatever title they derive for the third Hulk movie will play into it. While the film certainly suffers from gigantism, it is a self-inflicted malady, and for fans of the series it is like manna from heaven. On the other hand, those who are even a little bit suspicious of any corporate-fueled multi-media franchise this gargantuan are likely pondering if it is the movies that have finally taken over comic books or vice-versa.

"May 8, 2012"," Too often, a superhero film is an exercise in missing the point. This can have as much to do with a failure in basic, dramatic execution as it does with the oft-challenging prospect of translating gaudy costumes, monstrous forms and wildly diverse powers from printed page (and fan imagination) to the Big Screen. That’s why for every Batman Begins there’s a Batman Oh-God-Make-It-Stop, for every X-Men 2 and Spiderman 2, there’s, alas, an X-Men: The Last Stand and Spiderman 3. Granted, at least for the studios behind the Marvel titles, there hasn’t been much reason to sweat missing the point. Of the 21 or so films, all but four have grossed more than double their budgets, with only Elektra “just” breaking even and Punisher: War Zone posting a clear loss. Obviously, there’s plenty of money to be made whether or not one “gets it.” Fortunately for both casual movie-goer and comic book aficionado alike, Joss Whedon gets it. As a result, The Avengers not only stands out as one of the best efforts in the modern era of “super” movies, it also represents the most complete manifestation of the superhero team aesthetic yet seen on film. (Apologies to the X-Men films—and as far as I’m concerned, the Fantastic Four films owe me an apology.) To be fair, Whedon had plenty of help, both from long-term studio strategy (there’s a rarely heard kudo for you) and cast. Regardless of what one thinks of the single-hero titles that preceded it, Marvel Studios’ steady roll-out of Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America movies, allows the The Avengers to be blessedly unburdened by the crippling “origin-itis” that afflicts so many initial efforts in the genre. They’ve also given time for the principals to establish their take on some of Marvel’s most iconic characters. For Chris Evans (Captain America) and Chris Hemsworth (Thor), this has meant mainly reaching a “works in that role” consensus. For the Hulk, it’s allowed valuable tweaking of the CGI technology that brings him so smashingly to life. (And in The Avengers, Hulk smash. Hulk smash sooooo good!) But it’s with Robert Downey Jr.’s quip-happy Iron Man that the approach has borne the most fruit. Unlike Thor and Captain America, whose actors stay well within the personality profiles proscribed by their characters, Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark is pretty far removed from Marvel’s often morose, dependably self-destructive industrialist. And honestly, it’s a welcome change. Downey Jr. may be the ideal delivery system for Whedon’s signature banter—a banter that permeates and propels the plot of the two-hour film along just as effectively as the set action pieces. Though a time-honored component of most hero ensemble pieces (regardless of medium), such clashes are too often tedious and forced, a hackneyed means of fleshing out a second act. That’s not the case in The Avengers. Thanks in large part to the Downey Jr.-powered snark-generating machine, the friction between the heroes actually makes sense. While Whedon smartly recognizes how key Downey Jr.’s Stark is to the story, he also allows most all of his cast, heroes and villain, ample opportunities to shine, both in dialogue and action. (Hawkeye and Nick Fury, not so much.) It can’t be overstated how crucial such balance is to a team film. As Loki, Hiddleston may be the best-cast arch-villain since Ian McKellen’s Magneto. (This bodes well for the “shared universe” Marvel Studios is building. Just as in its comic books, Marvel needs its villains to emit suitable levels of dastardliness. Let’s just hope there are enough British stage and screen actors to supply its needs.) The rest of the principals—particularly Hemsworth, Evans and Ruffalo—inhabit their characters so seamlessly, the viewer can just move straight to the wonder and fun of it all. But The Avengers’s impending blockbusting will not just be the result of stellar casting. Throughout the film, Whedon allows much of the action to proceed at superhero pace—“placing” the camera for best vantage rather than over-indulging in bullet-time and other tricks. When he does slow things down—such as when Thor lands the first hammer-to-yo’-face blow on Hulk—there’s an obvious dramatic advantage gained. (It helps that three of the Avengers—Thor, Hulk and Iron Man—are basically invulnerable battle machines.) This is as groundbreaking as any box office numbers, no matter how high they climb. Finally. A director who understands that one doesn’t shoot each and every use of a super power, or the clash between them, as some rare event the camera must slobber over in slow-motion. And finally, a director who gets the point instead of misses it—and a studio that is smart enough to hand him the reins.",POSITIVE

"May 8, 2012"," If you are a Marvel fan, then “The Avengers” will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director, Joss Whedon, all your favorite characters are here, as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree. You get Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.); Steve Rogers, or Captain America (Chris Evans); Natasha Romanoff, or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); Bruce Banner, or the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), whose real name is Thor. None of the weirdos from “X-Men” make the grade, nor do half-pints like Ghost Rider or the Silver Surfer, though I think that Whedon missed a trick: for old times’ sake, why not zip back to the first Marvel movie and wheel out Howard the Duck? If you are not a Marvel fan, on the other hand, then watching “The Avengers” will feel like being mugged by a gang of rowdy sociopaths with high muscle tone. Absolutely no quarter is given to the ill-informed; the first scene is set in an undesignated patch of outer space, where some masked moaner yaks on in a rich and threatening baritone. I couldn’t understand a word until he asked, “The humans—what can they do but burn?” If he is referring to our cooking skills, this is grossly unfair, for we can also poach, broil, gently simmer, and steam en papillote. The speech, however, will make complete sense to those familiar with last year’s “Thor,” whose villain, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is revived for the new film. Loki is a tall, well-spoken megalomaniac who bears a magic spear, although, for anyone who enjoyed Hiddleston’s spry and convincing turn in “Midnight in Paris,” the world would appear to be at the mercy of F. Scott Fitzgerald with a monkey wrench. And it always is the world. One of the failings of Marvel—as of other franchises, like the “Superman” series—is the vulgarity that comes of thinking big. As a rule, be wary of any guy who dwells upon the fate of mankind, unless he can prove that he was born in Bethlehem. Superheroes who claim to be on the side of the entire planet are no more to be trusted than the baddies who seek to trash it, nor is the aesthetic timbre of the movies in which they both appear. I remember the joy of reading David Thomson’s entry on Howard Hawks, in “A Biographical Dictionary of Film”; the principle underlying Hawks’s work, Thomson argued, was that “Men are more expressive rolling a cigarette than saving the world,” and his adage rings true far beyond “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” or “The Big Sleep.” All movies thrive on the rustle of private detail—on pleasures and pains that last as long as a smoke—and there has been nothing more peculiar, in recent years, than watching one Marvel epic after the next, then sifting through the rubble of gigantism in search of dramatic life. If it smolders in “The Avengers,” that is owing to Downey and Ruffalo, two A-grade actors who are damned if they are going to be smothered by a two-hundred-million-dollar B movie. Downey realized, in “Iron Man,” that spectacular pap could be made piquant only if the central icon was a jerk—a narcissist with a roaring cash flow, rescuing not Earth from destruction but, way more important, his own soul from fidgety ennui. Ruffalo, at the other extreme, is all diffidence and glancing timidity; as Banner, he seems embarrassed by the prospect of his own wrath, and there is a wonderful closeup of the sad, apologetic glow in his eyes as he turns green. Banner begins the film as a practicing doctor (not just any doctor but, in line with Marvel’s overreach, a doctor in an Indian slum), and ends as we might have guessed, slinging humongous metal lizards around the canyons of Manhattan. The best way to treat “The Avengers” is as cinema’s answer to the supergroup. Stark and his buddies club together just as Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and the others did to form the Traveling Wilburys. Harrison wondered what it would be like to tour: “Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys?” Whedon leans toward the first option, and so, come the climax, they all do Wilburys: even as Thor tosses his mallet, Iron Man hurls energy pulses from his palms, while Captain America waves his slightly underwhelming shield, and, not to be left out, Black Widow repels invading aliens through the sheer force of her corsetry. This mania is what Marvel followers have hungered for, and it would be fruitless to deny their delight. As Loki says to a crowd of earthlings, “It is the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation.” We do, Master, we do. The hero of “Headhunters” is named Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), and his height is one metre sixty-eight—five feet six. He tells us so at the start of the film, and again at the end. What happens in between consists of his convoluted, bloodbathed attempt to stand tall. Given that his wife, Diana (Synnøve Macody Lund), whom he worships, towers over him, like a heron over a tit, you can vaguely understand his point of view. Roger is, unlikely though it sounds, Norwegian. He works in Oslo, at a high-end recruitment agency—hence, if only in part, the movie’s title. He moonlights as an art thief, typically booking a client into a crucial interview and then, at the appointed hour, slipping into the guy’s empty house and relieving him of a picture. Roger is aided by a contact at a security firm, Ove (Eivind Sander), who disables the alarm and takes his cut. The sight of Ove—seedy, balding, and distractible, with a Russian playmate in tow—is an early hint that “Headhunters” may run less than sweetly. Indeed, once the story barrels forward you sense that the game plan of the director, Morten Tyldum, is not just to pick up speed or tickle our nerves but to rebuke and, where possible, deface the calm, smile-lacquered gloss of corporate life. The stumble comes, as stumbles do, when a weak soul upgrades the reach of his ambition—specifically, when Roger, who is low on funds and needs a major heist, graduates from Munch prints to a Rubens oil painting. It is owned by Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who seems custom-made for the role of Roger’s nemesis: a former special-forces operative, the head of a tech company that specializes in tracking devices, and a handsome brute to boot. Worst of all, he meets Diana, who works at an art gallery, and takes her to bed. From here, the plot is a plunge—over the edge of a cliff, out of a hospital window, into a pit of ordure, and so forth. At one point, a snarling dog is speared on the back of a tractor: imagine a Carl Hiaasen novel shipped over from Florida to Norway. Clearly, there are streaks of farce in all this, as well as serious cracks in logic, and those who like their black comedy done to a crisp will happily feast on what Tyldum dishes up. (The tale is based on a thriller by Jo Nesbø.) My own taste for nastiness has, I admit, grown less tolerant with time, and, by a dour coincidence, I saw “Headhunters” on the first day of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik, the fanatic who murdered seventy-seven people last year, first in Oslo and then on the island of Utøya. The recitation of those events, as heard by the court, has proved unrelievedly bleak. Should the thought of them disturb one’s enjoyment of “Headhunters,” or do outrageous fictions owe nothing to intolerable fact? Either way, Norwegians had no qualms; whatever their collective trauma, they flocked to the movie when it opened in Norway, a month after Breivik’s crime. “Headhunters,” a gleeful exercise in overkill, became the second-most-successful film of the year.

 Since there's

		all on her lunch break from another film. That's a nice way to earn a 
		cool $10 million (I'm guessing). This is a movie 
		for people with short attention spans who like video games, so 3D makes 
		it better, although the 3D is not really noticeable until the end when 
		there are lots of flying aliens trying to kill New York. They fly at you 
		and away from you and you do get the 3D feel and that's kind of fun. While there is 
		speculation about whether or not there is intelligent life elsewhere in 
		the universe, Hollywood has clearly taken the position that most aliens 
		are either monsters or Neanderthals. It's hard to believe that these are 
		the people who have conquered space travel when we haven't. The things 
		fighting in this movie are some sort of mechanical-looking beings, but 
		they can apparently die because the superheroes kill them. The plot is that 
		a god, Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), comes to earth and 
		absconds with The Tesseract, some sort of state of the art electronic

		to be totally indestructible. But thematically that clearly won't work, 
		since he eventually has to be conquered or this is going to be a very 
		unsatisfying movie, so he is soon captured and imprisoned, a segue from 
		invulnerability to vulnerability so rapid it strains credulity to the 
		breaking point, although credulity is the least of this movie's 
		concerns. Then he gets out and imprisons his brother. I couldn't have 
		cared less. What ensues is 
		some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, but mostly what we get are special 
		effects and ludicrous fights. Let's face it, there are six superheroes

		resistant to injury. They can fall from great heights (thousands of 
		feet) and can still jump up to continue the fight. Only in Hollywood and 
		comic books.  Unlike good 
		action films, director Josh Whedon makes it too light-hearted and 
		comedic for there to be any tension at all. War of the Worlds 
		(1953 and 2005), for instance, had the same basic plot, but were not 
		comedies. Aliens wanted to kill everyone and if the good guys didn't 
		prevail everyone would be dead. There was tension in both films. Here, 
		it's like all the superheroes are trying out at the Improv to see who 
		can give the best one-liner, which kills any possibility of a tense 
		drama. Since it's not

"May 6, 2012"," The Avengers — or, as the onscreen title has it, Marvel’s The Avengers — is perhaps the most purely fun and frisky superhero movie since Christopher Reeve put on the red cape in 1978. (The Dark Knight was dazzlingly accomplished, but “fun” isn’t the first word I’d use to describe that brooding crime thriller.) Marvel Studios has been building towards this film for four years, starting with Iron Man in 2008 and continuing with The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), commander of the spy mega-agency S.H.I.E.L.D., has showed up portentously in all those movies, and here he assembles the aforementioned heroes, plus S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to do battle with an alien army commanded by Thor’s evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Got all that? Once the set-up is out of the way — and I’ve no idea how much of it will fly over the heads of viewers who missed the previous five films — The Avengers settles into a pleasantly lighthearted combat mode. The stakes are high, but writer-director Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) never met a quip he didn’t like, and his familiarity with decades of Marvel comics shakes out as a kidding, don’t-take-this-too-seriously approach to the characters, all of whom get to be tersely witty in the Whedon tradition. This is the best writing any of these heroes have enjoyed onscreen; there’s not much of what’s pejoratively called “comic-book dialogue,” and most of that is dispensed with at the start. After that, it’s regular people with superpowers or super-tech putting on their game faces and working as a team. For comics fans, it’s an undeniable thrill to see Captain America and Iron Man in the same frame. Additionally entertaining is seeing Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. in the same frame, rubbing each other’s nerves raw and ultimately arriving at a grudging mutual respect. Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner, who under duress turns into the rampaging green Hulk, is deceptively laid-back; it seems Banner has developed a bit more control over his transformations, but we still get plenty of crowd-pleasing footage of the Hulk leaping around and bashing the enemy. At its best, The Avengers is like one of those giant-sized Marvel Treasury Editions they used to issue in the ’70s, with the massive conflicts playing out in clean broad daylight. At some points the swooping camera shows you two or three epic fights going on at once; everyone gets his or her turn in the spotlight. Whedon, whose only previous film as director was Serenity, keeps the fun coming as if nothing at all were riding on it — not millions of dollars, not the hot expectations of fanboys. Whedon understands that this stuff is outlandish and ought not to be taken with monkish sobriety. Most of these heroes — including Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk — were co-created by legendary comics artist Jack Kirby (who also had a hand in Iron Man’s design). The Avengers does full honor to Kirby’s work, even if Marvel hasn’t; last year Kirby’s heirs were denied any of the billions that Kirby’s creations have generated for the company. Some people (rightly) incensed by the raw deal Kirby got have called for a boycott of The Avengers, and I do sympathize, though denying yourself the chance to see a Kirby-esque adventure writ large (and in 3D, though, as with the other 3D Marvel films, 2D is just as good) would be self-punitive and a drop in the bucket besides. Overall, this is as smooth and sprightly a franchise machine as we’re likely to get this summer; even at two hours and twenty-three minutes it goes like lightning. It’s brawny but punches fast, yet not so fast that we can’t see anything. Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye shoots arrows into his targets without even looking at them; Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow comes out the best under Whedon’s jurisdiction, gaining a sense of humor and a similar suave disregard of her own combat skills. The Avengers never overplays its hand (though the marketing machine sure has); everyone in it is smart, using strategy rather than brute force, though the force is certainly brutal when called for. If every superhero movie we’re about to get for the next decade were as loose-limbed yet tightly-wrought as this one, I’d have no cause for complaint; they won’t be, of course, but at least this one is.",POSITIVE
"May 6, 2012"," Joss Whedon (“Serenity” and the  Buffy the Vampire Slayer series on TV)directs and writes this cash cow blockbuster that’s specially made to order for those who can’t get enough from reading about comic-book superheros and need to see them on the big screen. It’s a lengthy, cynical, giddy, and at times a tedious and familiar save the world tale requiring the outcast superhero Avengers to fight the bad guys, an army of outer-space warriors, on the streets and skyline of downtown Manhattan in a large-scale climax battle. The story is by Mr. Whedon and Zak Penn. It’s filled with fanboy-wank, yet it has things that non-fans might also enjoy such as snappy banter, bigger-than-life CGI effects and thrill-ride escapist heroics. The red caped Thor’s (Chris Hemsworth) adopted  brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is the film’s villain. Loki craves god-like power and comes to Earth from the alien planet of Asgard armed with a bad rep as an asshole and a special spear and a magic helmet to get that power which will enable him to rule the world–that is, the Tesseract, a cosmic blue cube that’s the source of unlimited sustainable energy and is a portal to outer space. The invaluable cube was discovered on the ocean’s bottom and placed for safekeeping in the security-tight confines of the international peace-keeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D, where it’s stolen by Loki. The eye-patched director of the agency, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), a man of many devious secrets and shady motives, overrules his board of director bosses on how to get the Tesserat back, as he refuses to use nuclear force fearing it will do tremendous damage to the civilian population. Instead Fury calls on The Avengers, a group of spandex costumed freaks with unusual powers and strange life stories, to meet with him on his giant high-tech airship and plan the counter-attack. The Avengers called to action from places around the world are: wise guy playboy genius narcissistic billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); old-fashioned straight-laced not up to speed on techie things W.W. II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans); the all-powerful hammer-wielding Nordic god Thor (Chris Hemsworth); the red-headed covert agent strutting around in a  black bodysuit, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); the archer assassin Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner); and the always angry but repentant scientist Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Other prominent cast members include Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark’s assistant and girlfriend Pepper Potts; Stellan Skarsgard as the brainwashed by Loki energy expert, Professor Erik Selvig; Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Phil Colson and Maria Hill. The enormous hype for this superhero extravaganza doesn’t prevent the predictable action-pic from delivering the comic book goods and leaving the viewer with a great film experience. It provides a comic book friendly film that will surely please its geek fan base and reach out to a mass audience that can get off on the eye-popping 3D visuals, the charm of its characters and the fantasy action special effects. It aims to please with proven formulaic fare, taking no chances to disappoint its fan base. The result is not a particularly interesting film, but mass audiences like such simplistic hyper entertainment; especially, if the production values are high. Whedon and his creative team have done an excellent job bringing all these diverse superheroes together into a cohesive picture and they also make the already familiar still seem fresh. What’s more, the director gets a brilliant Hulk characterization from Ruffalo’s ability to channel his ordinary man inner rage into a force that transforms him into a deadly monster.",POSITIVE

		movie, Thor, and finally Captain America.  The films were generally 
		well-received and all were box-office hits.  This four-year trip led 
		audiences down a road that has culminated in the big screen version of 
		one of Marvels best-loved properties, The Avengers. Fury, 
		along with the earnest Agent Coulson and his best persuader, Agent 
		Natasha Romanov, cross the globe to gather the potentials from the 
		failed Avengers Initiative. From atop a hideously ugly skyscraper 
		bearing his name, Tony Starks interest is piqued because of the 
		scientific potential of the Tesseract.  In a barracks somewhere in New 
		York City, a mourning, lost Captain America can only punch and 
		obliterate sandbags as the resuscitated World War II hero remains a 
		hermit, trapped out of time.  Cap may be a Super Soldier, but the 
		operative word there is soldier, and after receiving his orders from 
		Fury, is still willing to do his duty. The 
		Avengers Initiative seems like a lost cause until the results of Lokis 
		imprisonment onboard S.H.I.E.L.D.s airborne fortress hits at the heart 
		of the men, causing them to face their own responsibilities and join 
		forces.  Just in time, too, because while hes been tied up, Lokis 
		brainwashed minions have created a machine that opens a dimensional 
		portal for the trickster gods new friends and their massive army to 
		conquer the Earth and announce their domination by destroying (Where 
		else?) New York City. All 
		that to say when making a movie about one of Marvel Comics greatest 
		super teams, he gets it.  Whedon knows what fans want from this movie because its exactly 
		what he wants and he does a good job delivering it. The other 
		outstanding performance is by Tom Hiddleston, once again taking up the 
		mantle, and indeed, one of the most fabulous hats in cinema history as 
		the green and gilt-laden Loki. Hiddleston perfectly balances Lokis wry 
		observations about the human race that amuses him so, with the simmering 
		pathos of an eternal misfit that cant accept help or forgiveness from 
		his loving brother.  With his flippy, greasy black hair, sallow 
		complexion, billowing cape and caustic wit delivered in the tones a 
		tragic Shakespearean hero; I predict Hiddleston is about become the 
		focus of many fans love for misanthropic quasi-villains, filling in the 
		huge gap left by Alan Rickman as the Harry Potter films Severus Snape. It 
		would be too much to expect a perfect film and though very good indeed, 
		The Avengers is not quite that, so here are the downsides.  The pacing: 
		Boy, this movie is long.  Granted, it covers a whole lot of ground to 
		bring together the stories of the various heroes and villains, but also 
		fills in the lesser-known Black Widow, who appeared in Iron Man 2 as a 
		third-string character, and super-marksman, Hawkeye, who had a cameo in 
		Thor.  In an attempt to make us feel something for the pair, a clumsy 
		backstory is inserted and referred to throughout, which literally put a 
		pause on the films momentum.  It seemed a waste to cast the excellent 
		Jeremy Renner as the archer and have him spend so much time mostly 
		playing Lokis brainwashed zombie. While I praised some of the hero moment dialogue earlier, Nick 
		Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson  veers on this side of eye-roll with 
		his constant fortune-cookie-like pronouncements that all begin to sound 
		like his big speech from Deep Blue Sea. 
		Trifles aside, The Avengers is quite the undertaking.  It takes a steady 
		hand and a real love for the characters, world and fandom to do it right 
		and happily all those things can be found in the direction of Joss 
		Whedon.  Riddled with the off-hand humour that marks a Whedon project, 
		The Avengers provides all the exciting action one could hope for with 
		all the faithful details for fans of the beloved comic.  The movie is 
		pure entertainment and fun and a great way to start the summer movie 
		season.",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," MARVELS THE AVENGERS is an audaciously ambitious film with a singularly Herculean task. It must take the disparate superheroes of previous films, their unique tones and styles, and mold them into a cohesive work. Its not unlike the plot of the film itself, which finds Shield, the super secret organization that keeps the Earth safe from things the populace would rather not know about, tasked with molding the superheroes into a cohesive team. Shield succeeds better than the film, but not by much. Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Angel fame, is tasked with the unenviable requisite of taking valuable screen time to introduce each character individually, and give the audience the story of how they are recruited for Shield. Fandom demands it, and Whedon, a fan boy himself, makes the interludes as puckish and to the point as he can, though things dont begin to really sparkle until Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man appears. Not that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is uninteresting, nor Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) wonderfully and abrasively nerdy when Natasha Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) arrives in the backwater into which he has disappeared to use her particular skill set to cajole him and the big guy the turns into when piqued back into action. Its just that Downey himself is so much larger than life. Add the Tony Stark narcissistic charisma and he is the center of attention even when standing in the background. The threat is Loki (a seductively evil Tom Hiddleston), Thors disgruntled trickster brother who plans on getting over his sibling rivalry by destroying the Earth. The McGuffin of the piece is the tesseract that holds unlimited power, and the twist is that as Loki steals it, he puts one of the Avengers, Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) under his spell. Whedon, in his infinite wisdom and solid sense of both character and fun, doesnt rely on just a premise, coupled with a considerable arsenal of whiz-bang special effects. Aside from the nod to the target audience with a shot of a technician killing time by playing a computer game on a system worth a gazillion dollars, he gives each character an arc, none more compelling than that of Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), newly thawed after a 70-year-long nap and still adapting to the modern world. The inability to catch pop references is a nice running joke, but its the gradual loss of his innocence as the behind-the-scenes machinations of Shield come to light. Once again Evans, in the thankless role of a solid, square-jawed square and made him not just sexy (who knew?), but actually deep. The same can be said of Johannson, with Black Widow the flip side of square coming to terms with her feelings for Hawkeye, and at the same time actually tricking an audience that is onto her wiles, and more than once, with Whedons insightful writing. The man understands strong women. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury, with all the Samuel L. Jackson flourishes necessary and expected of him, with Clark Gregg as his sidekick, Coulson, who delivers the most unexpectedly subtle performance in the film. The only fault in the film is a floppy middle act spent aboard the Quinjet flying fortress playing cat-and-mouse with Loki. Storywise, there is much territory to cover, to be sure, and even with some tidy use of exposition to fill in backstory for Black Widow and Hawkeye, iT feels as though they are getting short shrift in that department. MARVELS THE AVENGERS if the perfect popcorn movie that respects its audience, fan boy or not, though the former will be more excited than the latter to see the Stan Lee cameo. Excellent performances, thoughtful writing, and an overriding sense of exuberant fun with a super villain worthy of having so many superheroes on his godly tail, set a high bar for the inevitable sequel.",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," A devotee of the Marvel Comics Universe, writer-director Joss Whedon obviously approached his assignment on The Avengers with the proper degree of reverence. And it goes without saying that the nation's fanboys and fangirls are equally reverential as they line up to gaze in wonder at the first film of the 2012 summer movie season. Luckily, the characters on screen feel absolutely no need to exhibit a similar measure of respect and admiration: When billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), addresses Thor (Chris Hemsworth), he calls the Norse god with the flowing locks ""Point Break."" This hilarious reference to the 1991 Keanu-Swayze surfer flick — a film many youngsters might never have heard of, let alone seen — demonstrates that Whedon is in no way afraid to color outside the target-audience borders. The Avengers is, quite simply, a brainy and brawny blast for anyone who appreciates summer movies in general and superhero flicks in specificity. It's a culmination of numerous super-sagas that have been building toward this moment — 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, 2010's Iron Man 2, and last year's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger (2003's Hulk seems to have gotten lost in the wilderness) — and it manages to trump every last one of them. In this instance at least, too many cooks have not spoiled the broth, as Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn take care to insure that every character — even secondary ones like devoted government agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) — has his or her moment to shine. Directly stemming from plot points glimpsed in Thor and Captain America, this finds the God of Thunder's evil half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) conspiring to get his hands on the Tesseract, a cosmic cube that will grant him unlimited power. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), head of the law-enforcement outfit S.H.I.E.L.D., realizes that it's going to take more than one hero to prevent the subjugation of our planet's people, so he sets about getting in touch with all pertinent parties. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), still adjusting to a post-WWII life (full details can be found in his own flick), and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are quick to answer the call. Stark is more reluctant. And Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), hiding out in an Asian jungle, is extremely reluctant, since he feels it's best to keep his alter ego, the rampaging Hulk, far away from civilization. The only hero who can't answer the call to assemble is Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), as he's presently under the mental control of Loki. Admittedly, it takes time for Whedon and Penn to lay out the exposition — in fact, too much time, considering the Tesseract almost functions as a Hitchcockian MacGuffin, a plot device that holds dwindling interest for audience members. But once Whedon gets the film up to speed, he never looks back. The midsection is the best part, as the heroes spend more time battling each other than assessing the situation regarding Loki. It's putting it mildly to state that this is a veritable clash of the titans, with oversized personalities rubbing each other raw. Stark's cavalier attitude versus Rogers' lock-jawed stoicism provides most of the tension, but there's plenty of unease to go around. As expected, Downey provides the bulk of the humor while Evans and Hemsworth provide the bulk of the beef. Johansson, a bit shaky in Iron Man 2 (or maybe I was still incensed that Emily Blunt had to give up the role because she was still working on — for God's sake — Gulliver's Travels), nicely comes into her own here, providing some softer moments to go along with the expected athleticism. Yet the surprising scene-stealer is Ruffalo, who provides Bruce Banner with a stirring soulfulness that was missing in the portrayals by Eric Bana and, to a lesser extent, Edward Norton. What's more, this is the first film to absolutely nail the Hulk, who in 2003 laughably looked like a video blip version of Gumby and in 2008 seemed shellacked in green plastic. Because the technical team has employed motion-capture rather than straight-up CGI, the Hulk not only resembles Ruffalo in his facial features but believably moves through the surrounding environments, a testament to the superb visual effects. These effects really come to fruition during the final act, which is basically one massive battle on the streets of New York. Match up the mise-en-scenes here, where there's never any doubt of the spatial relationships as well as the simple dynamics of who's battling who, against the incoherent climax of last summer's depressing Transformers: Dark of the Moon. There's no comparison between the quality of filmmaking, and The Avengers shows that, at least for the time being, the summer blockbuster has returned with a vengeance.",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," Marvel's epic plan of assembling ""The Avengers"" (opened May 4 throughout San Diego) has finally paid off. This is how you make a summer superhero movie. I will confess up front that unlike my guest blogger Miguel Rodriguez I am not a comic book geek who has consumed all the volumes of Avengers lore leading up to this film. In fact, I haven't read any Marvel comics since elementary school but I have fond memories of doing so, and that's why I asked Rodriguez to write his review from the perspective of a fanboy. Now I'm here to tell you that even if you are not a fanboy who can identify the new super villain in the teaser treat at the end of the film you will still love this film. Marvel -- or someone -- smartly realized that the only way to ever assemble a superhero ensemble on film was to make sure all the entities and franchises were under one roof, in this case Marvel Studios. One of the main reasons you'll never see a Freddie vs. Jason vs. Ash film is because that would require a lot of studio cooperation (plus Bruce Campbell is too smart).  So Marvel had the vision or the business savvy to plan a series of films leading up to a mega-superhero blockbuster called ""The Avengers."" Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and continuing with ""Iron Man 2,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Captain America,"" Marvel has been building to this epic ensemble of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (newly added Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) all under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson). By getting all the origin stories out of the way in the lead up films, ""The Avengers"" could just get down to business and that's precisely what it does. ""The Avengers"" dovetails off of the two most recent films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America."" The villain, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), comes from ""Thor"" while the ""Captain America"" film brought in the final big name superhero. The job of bringing together all these superheroes, falls to Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, a secret espionage agency. When the earth is threatened by Loki and his alien henchmen, Fury assembles his team in the hopes that their super powers will be enough to save earth. The only problem is getting all the super egos to get along. Writer-director Joss Whedon has a huge fanboy and fangirl following from his highly successful TV shows ""Buffy,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Firefly."" But feature film success has been more elusive. He has worked as a writer on successful films like ""Toy Story"" but his one feature directorial gig, ""Serenity,"" made fans happy but failed at the box office. But with ""The Avengers"" (and to a lesser degree with ""The Cabin in the Woods"" that he wrote and produced) all that will change and rightfully so. ""The Avengers"" does everything right for a summer blockbuster. It's a perfect balance of humor and action, accessible fun and geeky insider jokes. The casting is spot on and the effects are integrated into the story rather than existing solely as eye candy. Plus Whedon is a master at ensemble casts and snappy banter. As an avid fan of ""Buffy,"" I was happy to see him carry over a lot of what made that TV show good onto the big screen for ""The Avengers."" First of all, Black Widow, even though she doesn't have the superpowers of her male co-horts, gets to do something and not just sit around and look pretty. She has a great introduction scene where she gets to display not only her mental prowess but her impressive gymnastic skills. As with ""Buffy,"" ""The Avengers"" proves that Whedon knows how to create female action characters that are smart, sexy, tough, and not whiny or window dressing. The other thing Whedon is so good at is balancing the outlandish with the mundane. Sure Buffy would kill vampires and demons and save the world but she still had to do homework. Similarly, these superheroes may be fighting to save the earth but they can also be petty and bickering. So while I would hesitate to say that Whedon keeps it real, he definitely keeps his superheroes human. But without ignoring the fact that they do have amazing superpowers, it's just that they don't make a big deal about it. Watching ""The Avengers"" made me feel like a kid again because I was pulled into a universe where I immediately believed that these characters could stop an alien spacecraft with a fist or jump off building. These are superheroes where you are really made to see that they have super powers and it's something to revel in. Whedon strikes just the just balance between flaunting the super powers and downplaying just how outlandish it all is. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" does what the best films of this genre do: create a fantasy world that you accept as totally real. And then provides a kick-ass good time as well. A good sense of scale also helps with the action scenes. On the surface, some of the action -- with alien creatures/vessels tearing through a major American city wreaking havoc -- look similar to scenes from the god awful ""Transformers"" films. But here's the difference: ""Transformers"" focused only on the epic scope of the action, on the immense robots ripping apart a city. It was simply big and noisy, and created no tension and engaged no emotions. ""The Avengers,"" on the other hand, conveys the epic scale of the battle as whale-like alien ships swim through New York City leaving destruction in their wake but it also takes the time to remind us of the human lives down on the ground. The Avengers are concerned with fighting the aliens but also with making sure that civilians are guided to safety. By doing this, Whedon engages our emotions and creates tension. It's harder for a superhero like Captain America to fight an enemy while he's also looking over his shoulder to try and protect people fleeing an office building. This changes up the scale as well as the pace in the action, and makes it so much more engaging and exciting. A sense of contrast also helps in terms of the characters. I always found Captain America a bit bland and tiringly patriotic. But his all-American attitude plays much better in contrast to Tony Stark's flippant arrogance. And Hulk's simple smash agenda plays nicely off of Black Widow's more subtle mind games. All in all it's a well-rounded team in which each members brings something different to the table, and Whedon makes that mix fun. I could quibble about the film's length, nearly 2 and a half hours. It could have used a little trimming but even at that run time, it never dragged or felt overly long, that's a credit to Whedon's script, pacing, and cast. Downey's Tony Stark is my favorite. Downey is just perfect as the snarky billionaire philanthropist who plays by his own rules because he literally can afford to. As I mentioned earlier, Downey's Stark is the perfect foil for Evans' Captain America. Evans may occasionally be the butt of a joke -- because he's a man out of time and doesn't always fit in -- but he never plays Steve Rogers or Captain America as jokey. Ruffalo is a nice new addition as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Thank god they dropped Edward Norton (who played Hulk in the 2008 film). Norton is definitely not an ensemble player and would not have fit in. Hulk may be CGI but he proves there is such a thing as well used CGI, and when he finally gets to smashing, it's well worth the wait. The rest of the superhero cast -- Hemsworth, Johansson and Renner -- are all solid as is Jackson as Fury (although I wish he had more to do than stand around). Middleston's Loki may not be the most exciting super villain but he serves the film well and Hiddleston masters an evil smirk. ""The Avengers"" (rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, and a mild drug reference) is pure superhero fun and sets the bar high for the superhero films still to come this year, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Thanks Joss Whedon and I hope this means we'll be seeing more of your work on the big screen. ",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," 
	When it comes to summer blockbusters it doesn't get any bigger than this. The years of teasing in post-credit scenes in previous superhero films finally comes to a head in The Avengers. Written and directed by Joss Whedon and featuring a plethora of stars, big budget special effects, amazing action and plenty of comedy and camaraderie, this movie is a fanboy's wet dream come true. 
	The story wastes no time in jumping right into the action. Its plot revolves around Loki, the evil Asgardian and brother of Thor, stealing the Tesseract (an all powerful energy source) from S.H.I.E.LD., which he intends to use to open a portal to another universe that will allow an invading army to reach earth and conquer it, installing him as King. Director Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles a misfit group of heroes to defeat Loki and bring back the Tesseract. 
	Writer Joss Whedon, who knows how to write and reference pop culture, fantasy/Sci-Fi better than anyone, doesn't spend much time on backstory. He knows who his audience is. You're expected to know about things like Tesseracts and S.H.I.E.LD.. If you're wondering where the rich guy got his cool red and yellow metal suit, then you might still be able to enjoy the action, but you're going to have a steeper learning curve when it comes to picking up on the whole story. 
	As you'd expect from one of the biggest blockbusters of all time, the special effects and the action are all top notch. The heroes battle Loki and each other in several spectacular scenes, building to a climax in a devastating battle in Manhattan around Grand Central Station. I actually spent the extra money to see this movie in 3D, even though I'm not a big fan of the technology. Despite being just a conversion job and not actually filmed in 3D, I enjoyed it and some of the special effects do have a little extra pop because of it. Although I hasten to add, I'm sure it would still be just as entertaining in 2D. 
	Although the action is amazing, it's the interaction of the superheroes where the movie really shines. The cast works well together and Whedon provides plenty of humor. Robert Downey Jr. is a scene stealer as the egotistical Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo, the only actor new to his superhero role, does a nice job as Bruce Banner and even gets to provide the face of the Hulk. During the climatic battle it is the Hulk who gets some of the biggest laughs in a couple of scenes. Chris Evans plays it straight as Captain America as does Chris Hemsworth as Thor, while Scarlett Johansson brings a much needed female touch to the proceedings.  
	I was reminded while watching this movie of a point Patrick has made on this site about how during the Silent era of movies it was rare for a movie to include more than one big name. So far, apart from the X-men, you could say the same thing about superhero movies. Some of my favorite comic books as a kid were always those that featured a group or a cross-over story. I remember they would sometimes tease a comic story out of Spider-man vs the Hulk that was supposed to decide who was more powerful, although they always seemed to end in a draw. There are several scenes like that here, with the Hulk battling Thor in one fight and Thor also taking on Captain America and Iron Man in another. 
	The movie does run long. It's nearly 2 and a half hours and of course if you want to see everything you have to stay right up until the end of the credits for two separate post-credit scenes. I was never bored, but the plot does meander a bit in the first 45 minutes or so and some tightening could probably have been done. Reportedly there's an additional 30 minutes of footage that will be included on the DVD, but then it's always easier to watch long movies at home where you have the power to pause. 
	This movie is what all blockbusters want to be. Not only is it big, loud and filled with eye candy, it's perfectly cast and even more importantly, it's well written! How many times have we seen movies like Transformers where it looks amazing, but the script feels like an afterthought? Whedon is a fine director, but it's his writing that benefits the movie most, particluarly his ability to insert comedy without reducing the tension. 
	Bring on those 30 extra minutes.  I wished The Avengers would never end.   Sure this movie is longer than your average film, but when it is this good we want it to last.  My one and only complaint about The Avengers is that is teases us with the relationship between Hawkeye and Black Widow.  It hints at a romance, and considering the two of their careers, the affair would be an exciting one.  I hope some of that extra footage covers their relationship. 
	As Scott wrote, The Hulk provides the film's biggest laughs during the huge final battle. The entire theater erupted with his surprise actions.  Scott also mentioned Tony Starks's snide comments such as, ""No hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.""  He says to Thor in reference to both their recent fight and a Patrick Swayze movie.  Although Stark is clearly the team comedian, each hero gets at least one funny line. 
	Of all the actors to play Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo is the best.  He plays it all as very mild mannered, yet with that glint in his eye, we know that he knows he is not fooling anyone.  His Jekyll and Hyde issue torments him as well as makes him a valuable commodity. 
	The Black Widow has an awesome introduction scene.  It demonstrates just how well she can interrogate someone.   Another interrogation scene later on reasserts her talents as well as reveals a bit of her darker side.   We have yet to learn her complete origin, but some details are given. 
	It is only Hawkeye, that gets the short stick here.  Other than he and Natasha making brief references to their past, we learn next to nothing about him.  When it comes to super powers, he is clearly the weakest in the bunch.  The movie even addresses this once when he runs out of arrows.  His relationship to Natasha as well as the other heroes leaves much to be explored.  Please Joss Whedon, make a Hawkeye/Black Widow movie, or better yet, just keep making more of The Avengers! 
	I too enjoyed this movie, although I don't think it needed to be any longer than it was. As my brothers said it has all the right ingredients for a tasty superhero stew. The script is clever, it features a diverse and memorable group of heroes, the cast is great, the effects are impressive and the action plentiful. Perhaps it could have been given a slightly tighter edit but overall I can't complain. 
	The interactions of the different heroes is certainly the highlight of the movie. After all isn't that the attraction of these superhero groups anyway? The Avengers has a nice mix of personality types. You have the old fashioned traditionalist (Captain America), the wisecracking rich playboy (Iron Man), the hottie foreign babe (Black Widow), the arrogant mythological god (Thor), the mild mannered scientist with the huge green alter ego that likes to smash things (Hulk), and the enigmatic guy with a bow and arrow (Hawkeye). 
	Add me to the chorus singling out Mark Ruffalo's performance as Bruce Banner. And the Hulk absolutely provides the biggest laughs, even if the movie does make you wait quite a while to see him. 
	As Eric wrote, each hero gets at least one funny line or an amusing moment. One of my favorites is when a character mentions flying monkeys and Steve Rogers is pleased to finally get a pop culture reference. The Wizard of Oz movie having come out in 1939 a few years before he was frozen in ice. The Black Widow's interrogation skills during her conversation with Loki are worth a chuckle as well. 
	The level of devastation that occurs to midtown Manhattan is gloriously over-the-top. The body count of dead civilians is high, that's for sure. I'll go so far as to call the big climactic battle the most entertaining, action-packed and humorous superhero group fight-scene ever. Each hero gets their chance to shine and they look super cool in that shot of them standing together in the middle of the battle torn street. 
	I'm not a huge fan of bloated, special effects driven, CGI'd to the hilt, explosion-and-crash-filled summer blockbusters. But popcorn movies don't get much better than The Avengers.",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," Although it takes a while to hit its stride, once it does Marvel's The Avengers is a razzle-dazzle, rip-roaring entertainment.
It introduces its various characters without much panache, then they bicker, and one begins to wonder if it's going to be all it's cracked up to be.
But count on The Hulk. Once he erupts, The Avengers soars across the screen with ferocity and style.
When the Hulk hulks, it instills The Avengers with stunning power. And the best moments of humor in The Avengers are created by the raging Hulk.
One might worry that the action might lapse into redundant footage like a Transformers' flick, but although action goes to the edge, it has more purpose and more individuality.
Albeit, it's a bit incongruous when The Avengers start worrying about ""civilians,"" given the pell-mell devastation The Avengers have furiously caused.
The dissolved Avengers Initiative is brought back together by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. They are reconnected to recover the blue-cubed Tesseract, the cosmic source of ""real power.""
They have to fight a war with alien invaders and the nefarious Loki (Tom Hiddleston).
The intrepid Avengers are Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).
Evans is the most bland, perhaps because his character is the most bland - not just old school, but bland old school. Downey is his patented self as Iron Man, given to quips, about half of which have some cleverness. Hemsworth and Renner do well as characters in near-constant motion.
Scarlett Johansson's name is ironic, since she plays a character who is trying to erase ""red"" from her record. She brings her combination of spirit and beauty to Black Widow.
Mark Ruffalo empathetically captures the soft-spoken Bruce Banner, who undergoes the earth-shaking transformation. Ruffalo and Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson bring a much-appreciated humanity to their key characters.
As Loki, Tom Hiddleston finally has discovered some gravitas, which he lacked in Thor (2011) and even as F. Scott Fitzgerald in Midnight in Paris (2011). Glowering and smirking, he makes a formidable villain.
The screenplay by director Joss Whedon (Zak Penn contributed to the story) has a few surprises and several allusions, but the dialogue is mostly generic.
Whedon knows that action in The Avengers is going to save the day and win the international box office, and he fires with deft velocity.
Loki doesn't take over the world.
Marvel has.",NEUTRAL
"May 5, 2012"," I   saw the best actors of my generation destroyed by B-movie superhero madness, slumming crummy costumed, dragging themselves through the digital streets of universe Marvel, looking for a super-size paycheck, empty-headed hipsters burning for the ancient mythic connection to the star-system dynamo in the machinery of the studios, who filthy rich and smirking sat up playing ""Guitar Hero"" in their Hollywood Hills McMansions, floating across their pools contemplating the next sequel, who bared their brains to their agent in El Lay and saw terrorist super-villains waiting to be terminated ...  Yes, I saw ""The Avengers,"" where a horde of fine actors — Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Jeremy Renner, Samuel L.

It's hardly Allen Ginsberg, is it. Ruffalo, speaking of how he inherited the role of monosyllabic green-skinned superhero The Hulk from his friend Edward Norton — who himself took over from Eric Bana — said, ""I look at it as my generation's 'Hamlet': We're all going to get a shot at it.""

"May 5, 2012"," The biggest surprise of Marvel’s long-awaited “The Avengers” project isn’t that it works spectacularly well, rather it’s that it works at all.  It was around five years ago that the first serious inroads were made with this ambitious plan to team up several separate superhero franchise characters into one big epic feature.  A risky gamble to be sure but an ambitious one that even us non-comic fanboys could get excited about, especially after the critical and commercial success of the first “Iron Man”. Yet that film’s disheartening sequel, though let down by numerous issues, was most crippled by its forced ‘Avengers’ tie-ins.  While not as undercut, both “Thor” and the “Captain America” similarly suffered from the awkward and uncomfortable insertion of ‘Avengers’ world building into their own respective franchise launchers – ultimately detracting from films that simply would have worked better as stand alones. This cultivation process may have been awkward and sometimes painful, but the fruits of that labor have proven unexpectedly ripe. “The Avengers” really is far greater than the sum of its parts – a rollicking sci-fi adventure epic with plenty of character, humour and heart that delivers on practically every front. Much of the credit must go to writer/director Joss Whedon whose signature is all over this work.  Through the likes of “Buffy,” “Angel” and “Firefly” we’ve been witness to his deft skill at balancing large character ensembles, emotionally resonant themes, gripping end of the world scenarios and plenty of self-deprecating character-based humour.  All of that is brought to the table here. Not only does Whedon have an innate understanding of both this material and its audience, but even by his standards there’s an unexpected amount of fearlessness on display – he takes chances with gags and character beats here even some master filmmakers wouldn’t dare, and most of them pay off handsomely. If there is a real surprise though it’s that ‘Avengers’ really marks his arrival as a tentpole director the same way the “Star Trek” reboot did for J.J. Abrams.  Both were acclaimed TV show runners with deft writing and small screen directing skills, yet their first onscreen forays (M:I-3, Serenity) were solid if indistinctive action films that lacked the originality and drive that usually made their work so distinct. With ‘Avengers’ though Whedon doesn’t have to worry about establishing backstory or budget restrictions, while his sense of pacing has been refined to a diamond sharp point.  Even at 142 minutes there’s really no fat that could be trimmed here aside from maybe a few scant random shots of destruction.  That’s mostly because he never forgets that the characters and their interactions come first and it’s the little human details that make us care. That is why the massive scenes of epic destruction here are so much more engaging and exciting than anything involving Shia LaBeouf and those CG cars.  It’s a proper group of distinct characters we care about working together as a team, each making full use of their own unique talents.  While Whedon’s approach lacks the luscious photography of some other tentpoles, he’s still able to get all of the film’s $200 million up on screen along with giving the film an impressive sense of scale without overdoing it. Tonally and story-wise it remains in step with the other Marvel movies, specifically the first “Iron Man”.  It never forgets that it is a big, brassy crowd-pleasing blockbuster and a comic book movie first and foremost.  This means it fully embraces its pulpy source material, never getting too serious but never crossing that line into high camp either.  It’s dramatic when necessary and laid back where possible so the plot is on the thin side and it’s not a particularly deep film (to say the least), even if it is often deeply satisfying. The cast is uniformly strong, every character not only getting their time to shine but each sharing distinctive moments and relationships with the other members of this ragtag group.  Even though it’s frankly about as well-balanced as it can be, some naturally stand out more than others and everyone will have their personal favourites. Robert Downey Jr.’s work here beats everything he did in “Iron Man 2” by a country mile – gone is that arrogant and irritating edge we saw last time and back is the warm fun cocky swagger of our first visit with Tony Stark.  Yes he steals his scenes, especially those with Gwyneth Paltrow and Mark Ruffalo whom he both shares such a great rapport with.  Yet he also knows when to step back and let others shine. Ruffalo’s the real gem here.  Not because of his acting skill, which has always been strong, but rather it seems Marvel has finally found the perfect wavelength for Hulk.  Gone is Eric Bana’s repressed meekish geek with daddy issues or Edward Norton’s jumpy, self-flagellating, lovelorn loner. Ruffalo’s charming relatable techie works because of his resigned acceptance of the beast within and healthy respect of its true nature, similarly the Hulk side is shown to be an unpredictable and impossibly destructive force albeit one with much more of a distinct personality than we’ve seen before. Similarly seeing great improvements on their previous outings are Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and Tom Hiddleston’s Loki.  Serving as mere eye candy in “Iron Man 2”, Johansson’s character gets far more exploration this time out while also reminding us of her surprising acting abilities – this is a career best for her, right up there with her “Lost in Translation” work.  Before this I had zero interest in her character, now though I am actually interested in seeing where her character could go. Hiddleston’s villainous turn in “Thor” was one of that film’s highlights, but his take here is even more delicious.  His motivations remain somewhat under explored and at a few points the scenery chewing could be dialled back a touch, but Hiddleston nails the performance.  Like in “Thor”, this could easily have been a quite flat character on the page, but he turns it into one with a lot brewing under the surface.  From the chilling interrogation scene with Black Widow to his interactions with Hemsworth and Downey, when he’s given the floor he really shines. Thor remains a bit flat and enigmatic in his scenes either on his own or with the SHIELD characters.  Yet when interacting with his fellow heroes the character’s distinctness really clicks – Chris Hemsworth giving us glimpses of that warmth and charm that made him a soap star here in Australia and then a movie star on the global stage.  There’s even a good sense of humour here that was missing from his take on the character in the “Thor” standalone, and the blond muscular giant handles his action scenes with aplomb. With such big personalities on offer it’s the more human characters that fade into the background.  Much like in his stand alone movie, Captain America remains frustratingly bland and one-note even if he has more to do here.  Though designed as an audience entry point into this crazy world, he ends up being something of a dead weight.  Kudos to Chris Evans for visibly working hard to do what he can with the character, but even Whedon struggles to make him interesting beyond acting as either a comic relief sounding board or a foil for Tony Stark. Similarly S.H.I.E.L.D. remains a indistinct and unremarkable organisation.  The flashy helicarrier, where pretty much all the second act is set, is impressively rendered but it is mostly populated by anonymous cyphers be it the oddly bland Cobie Smulders or the still underserved Samuel L. Jackson. Jeremy Renner’s work as Hawkeye pales compared to his “Mission Impossible” turn a few months back, mostly because Renner spends much of the film in a literal trance so there’s no time to give him any real development.  Of these relatively ‘normal’ characters it’s really Clark Gregg’s adorably geeky Agent Coulson who still generates warmth and humour.  “¨”The Avengers” is the opposite of other Marvel Studio movies in one way – its structural weaknesses.  Almost all of the earlier Marvel films got worse as they went along, whereas ‘Avengers’ starts with its most unsure foot forward and a surprisingly dull opening set piece.  However it gets better by the minute as these separate characters come together and start interacting with each other. There’s a lot of attention to detail here, including pay-offs of threads from the previous films.  It also throws in unexpected but welcome tangents such as the character suspicions of their employer’s motivations. That said some of the 45 minutes that Whedon has cut out has resulted in a few sketchy plot elements – the Chitauri aliens are fairly indistinct, their motivations glossed over, and Loki’s connection with them never given enough detail to properly justify it. Thor’s arrival strikes with an air of convenient timing, and some technobabble about the Tesseract macguffin (a cube that can open a wormhole) will make little sense to even hardcore sci-fi and comic geeks.  These are all nitpicks yes, but again it’s quite possible some of the sketchier elements of the plot were actually fleshed out and filmed but didn’t make the final cut.  As is there is certainly nothing in here that doesn’t feel either out of character or detractive to the unfolding action. I’m someone who isn’t much of a superhero comic fan (I simply don’t understand the whole DC vs. Marvel war) but I have enjoyed the Marvel Studios films so far to varying degrees.  It is certainly fair and easy to say though that this is the best of that bunch and a stellar example of blockbuster filmmaking – one of the best movies of this kind in months, perhaps years.  It certainly knows what kind of movie it is, what its fan base wants and where it should aim.  There may be weightier, deeper or richer films this year – but there probably won’t be any that are as much fun.",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2012"," Great review.
I’ve been looking on the site all day hoping to see your reaction to the move.
… and your review was almost as entertaining as the move :)
I definitely agree, brilliant parts of the movie, some just good, overall amazing. The review is similar to my thoughts. I felt the film got a little claustrophobic (and dare I say small) during some of the middle. But the final 1/3 is just wonderful.  I enjoyed Ruffalo’s Banner much more than I thought I would, but I felt the film didn’t capture the pathos of Hulk that the previous films were able to capture… but hey, they had much more time to spend on the big green guy. A great and very entertaining film review, like “The Avengers” i thoroughly enjoyed your film review, you guys are great. I’m glad you deicided to give this film 5 stars, i seen it last night and it absolutely deserves 5 stars without question or hesitation whatsoever. Thanks, Delfra.  I’m very hesitant to give out five stars because I don’t understand critics who give out “100%” or “perfect” scores left and right.  Sort of makes the highest rating meaningless.  Back when I was seeing 100+ films a year, I think the most five star ratings I gave out in a single year was to three films.  So.  I don’t just hand them to anybody. Great Review Widge!  The movie was fairly seamlessly woven together.  I will have to say Joss Whedon did a good job.  You could definitely see his style all over the film.  Especially the tool he used to pull the characters together.  I thank him and curse him for making us care about his characters.  I will say I absolutely loved the hulk bits throughout the movie and Ruffalo was great.",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012"," Given the complexity of what it set out to do, “The Avengers” is probably as good as anyone could have expected. I’m not referring to the logistics of working out the actors’ schedules or the cost of the special effects (which are not unprecedented), but to the narrative complications: “The Avengers” has to unite multiple characters who have wildly different pre-established personalities and backstories, come up with a plot line that gives each of them a reason to be involved, AND deliver a satisfying good-guys-vs-bad-guys superhero adventure. Oh, and what else? Most of these superheroes are meeting each other for the first time? So we have to address their conflicting attitudes and motives, and can’t start with them already functioning smoothly as a team? On top of everything else this has to be an origin story, too? That’s what I mean about “The Avengers” being about as good as an Avengers movie was ever going to be. Making something like this entertaining may sound like a no-brainer — you just gotta throw all those awesome heroes on the screen at the same time! — but doing it right is more complicated than that (as you know if you saw “The Expendables”). What they’ve come up with here has some clunky patches as things are being established, and the story is thin, standard fare. But when it works, it works exceptionally well. And it mostly works. Things kick off at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters when an otherworldly power source called the Tesseract is activated, opening a space portal through which malevolent Norse demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) can travel to Earth. After using his magic space-scepter to brainwash a few S.H.I.E.L.D. team members into supporting him — including expert marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) — Loki makes off with the Tesseract. Whatever he wants with it, it can’t be good. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the one-eyed leader of the S.H.I.E.L.D. initiative, gets to work. Lethal spy and assassin Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), aka Black Widow, is sent to recruit Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), the brilliant scientist who turns into the Hulk when he’s angry. It seems that gamma radiation factors into Loki’s plans, and nobody knows more about the potential of gamma radiation than Bruce Banner. Billionaire playboy and smart guy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), also known as Iron Man, is recruited by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to check out the research left by Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), frozen during World War II but now thawed and a little upset at finding himself 70 years in the future, goes after Loki. Naturally, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) shows up too, since Loki is his brother and a known troublemaker. The rest of the plot unfolds in the customary fashion, with the Avengers making progress in stopping Loki, suffering setbacks, learning more about what he’s after, and ultimately having a battle that wrecks several blocks of a major city (spoiler: it’s New York). The story, credited to genre veteran Zak Penn (“The Incredible Hulk,” “X-Men: The Last Stand”) and director Joss Whedon, doesn’t offer much originality; it replays the usual comic-book formula and just changes the names. But the screenplay, which is attributed only to Whedon, more than compensates for the story’s averageness with consistently witty dialogue and a stream of terrific moments. Steve Rogers is an old-fashioned soldier, a loyal patriot and the epitome of a team player. He literally once jumped on a grenade to save his platoon — something the narcissistic and volatile Tony Stark would never do. Stark is also involved in the manufacture of weapons technology, which runs counter to Rogers’ mindset. “You may not be a threat,” he says to Stark in one heated moment, “but stop pretending you’re a hero.” Stark has plenty of sarcastic things to say to a Boy Scout like Rogers, as well as to Thor, whose courtly language and attire invite mockery. Bruce Banner, constantly struggling not to become “the other guy,” can bond with Stark over mathematical and scientific matters. I also love the detail of Agent Coulson being a gushing Captain America fanboy. In short, while the characters themselves are flights of fancy, the way they interact with each other — and themselves, in battling their own weaknesses — makes sense. To me, that’s the movie’s greatest achievement. Putting Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye in a room together is one thing. Portraying what happens next in a way that’s believable given what we already know about those characters is another. (Black Widow and Hawkeye don’t get as much focus as the others, but they have enough screen time and juicy character moments to register.) Loki is a typical rule-the-world villain, but Hiddleston plays him with sneering, dastardly charm. Mark Ruffalo might be the best of the modern Banners. The action scenes are appropriately thrilling, shot and edited coherently and with gusto. Each Avenger’s individual strengths are used for the benefit of the team; it doesn’t feel like anyone has been wedged into the film merely out of obligation. I didn’t feel any emotional heft, but that’s been the pattern of these recent Marvel films, hasn’t it? Glossy, bang-pow comic-book fun, without much sentiment. I miss the affecting sensitivity of the first two “Spider-Man” films, but “The Avengers” doesn’t have room (or time) to explore anybody’s personal depths. If it has a flaw, that’s it, and I was mostly having too good a time to notice.",POSITIVE
"May 4, 2012"," Listen to Kevin’s radio review…




Do you really need me to tell you that “The Avengers” is a whole roast of awesome wrapped up in bacony awesomeness? Probably not. The earth-shattering overseas box office, insane fanboy buzz and near-unanimous pre-screening buzz should tell you that.  Or not. In fact, don’t watch the trailers. Go into this movie as cold as you can, so the action set pieces and tongue-in-cheek humor can hit you for the first time during the film itself. You’ll thank yourself later.  “The Avengers” is the culmination of five previous films: “Iron Man,” “The Incredible Hulk,” “Iron Man 2,” “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger.” Bringing these four title superheroes together along with the Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), “The Avengers” follows the team trying to stop the disgraced Asgard Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from waging an intergalactic war on Earth.  That’s a good thing, by the way, and not a criticism. It’s exactly the kind of story that makes comic books awesome pop culture mythology. It’s a big enough problem that all the characters have something to do, and no one is the lead. This isn’t “Iron Man and the rest” or “Captain America and his sidekicks.” This is a true ensemble piece in which everyone is important.  I was a DC boy growing up. I just couldn’t afford the time (and more importantly, the money) to keep up with two different universes. In the end, Superman and Batman beat out Spider-Man and the X-Men. Not being an expert in the Marvel superhero mythology pre-disposed me to not be so critical of Marvel movies: I didn’t know the original stories so well.  This is why I actually enjoyed “X-Men: The Last Stand” (because I had never read the Dark Phoenix saga) as well as the “Fantastic Four” films (because all I knew of Doctor Doom was that he had a metal mask, and changing his origin was okay by me). In fact, I even preferred the biological web slingers in Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man” series because it just made sense to me, instead of knowing that Peter Parker’s own version of Kryptonite was him running out of web fluid.  In this sense, the last five years has been an interesting journey for me because I found the pre-Avengers films to be a huge step up in quality and consistency from the rocky road that proceeded it. Most will agree that both the “X-Men” and “Spider-Man” series were for the most part good, but there were bizarre diversions, like “Daredevil,” “Ghost Rider” and the odious and nonsensical “Hulk” by Ang Lee.  Even as someone who never read the Marvel books, I recognized something different in the five Marvel Studios films, beginning with “Iron Man.” The studio wasn’t just handing out a single franchise – or a single film – to some random director who wants to put his sticky, artistic fingerprints all over it. There is oversight to this series. There is a connectedness to it. The great Marvel Studios experiment has worked, and I couldn’t be happier.  And this should really mean something coming from me because I have never been a fan of Joss Whedon’s work. I never got into “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” which also meant I never got into “Angel.” I flat-out hated “Firefly” and its subsequent feature film “Serenity.” In fact, the only thing of his that I’ve remotely liked has been “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog,” though I had some problems with that, too.  But I am familiar with Whedon, and it’s clear why he was perfect for this film. First, he’s a good writer. He’s script-doctored for years, and his television experience has taught him to work with other people’s characters. He’s also not only familiar with comic books, but he’s fiercely committed to them. He knows how they work, and he knows how to capture the spirit of the heroes and translate them to the big screen.  Marvel Studios set forth to do with this series was to adopt the formula that comic book publishers perfected years ago and apply it to movies. It’s really quite simple; it’s just something Hollywood has ignored for most of its existence. But “The Avengers” proves that it works. it proves it is possible to have a overall story arc that goes through seemingly independent films. As long as there’s a certain amount of oversight, which Marvel Studios has provided over the past four years, these films can support each other and work as chapters in a much longer story.  But back to the actual film. It’s good. It’s damn good. It’s two and a half hours of action and humor, all appropriately placed. The pacing is impressive for the size of the film. Each character has his or her own voice, often transplanted from their previous film, and it all fits together fine. Thor’s archaic cadence fits perfectly with Bruce Banner’s 21st century cynicism. Captain America’s 1940s idealism balances against Tony Stark’s fast-talking quips.  Whether you’re a fan of the earlier films, an avid comic book reader or just someone interested in a good, old fashioned action flick, “The Avengers” is a must-see. More over, I hope every executive, story editor, writer and development employee at Warner Bros. and DC Comics sees this movie so they can ask themselves why they can’t get their shit together and make a “Justice League” film that is just as good. After this movie, I can never stay not watching 1st day 1st show, any marvel hero movie. This was an awesome movie, while watching the movie I was full of joy.",POSITIVE

				We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. “The Avengers” will play like gangbusters at the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival this Saturday. This is less prediction than absolute certainty. A movie that yells at you and geeks out in equal measures, the Marvel-Paramount excursion marks the triumphant climax of a five-year effort to merge several tentpole movies into a single explosive whole. Directed by ultimate fanboy/genre auteur Joss Whedon within an inch of his life, it has the exemplary polish of a brilliant commercial achievement in the most literal sense: It plays like several mini-sequels strung together in a spectacularly fluid combination, as Marvel comics have for decades, illustrating convergence culture on a massive scale. 	Once Whedon goes through the motions of assembling his colorful team, a motley gang of action figures comprised of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye, his swirling camera can’t get enough of them, indulging in multiple Avengers glam shots that, yes, marvel at their sensational pop beauty. It’s a monumentally successful attempt to show off, the first genuine superhero crowdpleaser. 	It’s also undoubtedly too long and too loud. The snazzy display gets exhausting, and I have a hard time imagining anyone remembering it too clearly in 20 or 30 years. Despite the rush of the action, the technical splendor of “The Avengers” never feels particularly groundbreaking or distinctive. Singularly great visual gags involving the Hulk, and characteristically snarky one-liners from Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, carry the movie far better than the steady cascade of explosions.
	“The Avengers” is grand escapist fluff best appreciated in the context of its release as a major event movie. That makes its spot as the closing night film the Tribeca Film Festival an ideal venue. However, when “The Avengers” was first announced as Tribeca’s closing selection a few weeks back, I detected plenty of grousing from a lot of people who don’t ordinarily pay much attention to the film festival world at all. Why, they wondered, would an alleged haven for independently produced, artistically sound movies make room for this unapologetic example of blockbuster excess? 	In this case, the backlash is unfounded. Hardly anyone levels missives at Cannes for showing celebrity-studded franchise junk alongside the latest achievements by world class auteurs that usually dominate its main competition. That’s partly because Tribeca is an easier target, but critiquing its inclusion of a legitimately satisfying movie on its own terms misses the point. 	Each year, many of us struggle to understand Tribeca’s purpose. Its founders insist they have taken a generalist approach. That’s a challenging goal given its placement on the festival calendar between the behemoths of Sundance and Cannes, but if Tribeca only aims to showcase the range of cinema from around the world, then it should contain a certain amount of Hollywood product. And there’s simply no better example of the today’s studio system doing what it does best than “The Avengers.”Crucially, “The Avengers” arrives at the end of the festival but does not define it. With a program large enough to represent a vast range of international cinemas, the festival evades an issue facing the European festival circuit, where many large festivals must include a certain number of national films. At least on paper, Tribeca contains a very diverse program, even if the lineup has yet to garner significant respect within the industry. Yesterday’s awards ceremony illustrated that it’s largely not the new movies that dominate the festival. “War Witch,” Kim Nguyen’s intense, thoroughly engrossing African drama about a teen bride pursued by insurgents, premiered in February in Berlin, as did “Una Noche,” the acclaimed Cuban drama that nabbed Tribeca’s acting prizes. 	But that’s an issue pertaining to the quality of the lineup, not the special events, which usually generate more talk than any of the world premieres (nobody remembers that awful Cameron Crowe documentary about Elton John from last year’s opening night, but many fondly recall John’s lovely performance after the screening). “The Avengers” belongs at Tribeca because the festival’s strongest suit is its ability to throw a big bash, which is not a pithy achievement and could actually help more movies. “The Avengers” doesn’t need the help, but I’ll gladly play devil’s advocate on this one: If Tribeca can do this for “The Avengers,” it can do it for anyone. 	An experienced colleague from the festival world recently suggested to me that Tribeca may want to drop the “film festival” label altogether and embrace its existing strengths. Call a spade a spade — or maybe call it a “celebration of film.” No longer facing insurmountable expectations, Tribeca could effectively remove itself from a supremely competitive, premiere-oriented world in which every lineup is held hostage by the calendar. By those standards, “The Avengers” (which actually premiered last week in Los Angeles) doesn’t only fit in at Tribeca; it epitomizes one part of the festival that works as well as the commercial feat behind the movie’s existence.

"May 4, 2012"," Probably true, but did you really expect the avengers to be a piece of literature? Comic movies are for escapism. If you are looking for something to chew on, then you should watch ""The Lives of Others"". I loved your review. Every line of it. Well, except to poor defense of A. O. Scott. The reason he was panned wasn't because he didn't like the film. He wasn't the first critic to speak negatively of the film. Nor the second. Nor the 3rd. The reason was that he panned the film out of a pure prejudice for ""superhero"" movies. He has stated in other reviews as well as the one in question that he feels the ""genre"" has run it's course. It is the same kind of artistic snobbery that open-minded people always reject. No one reads a critic's review to be told that they have bad taste for even liking ""this kind of movie. ""I quote:""The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.""He wrote an entire article BEFORE Avengers was launched where he actually HOPED that the genre would decline. Prejudice has no place in film criticism. No only is that a lack of professionalism (he should avoid writing about the genre if he can't evaluate a film on its own merits), but it is also a betrayal of his own readers trust in his opinion to evaluate art objectively. The whole point of talking about ""genre"" is to talk about particular films in a context, in terms of bigger trends that inform the sensibility of a particular film. I happen to agree with Scott's observations about where the genre's gone, that it's succumbed to the mindlessness of a (commercially) successful formula. It's not even a surprise, this is just what happens with genres, especially expensive ones. ""The grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism"" Scott describes (very nicely, IMO) is the logical result of a commerical superhero genre because the genre is ultimately founded on spectacle. Even Mr. Humanick here has said that we might never see again the kind of verve and idiosyncrasy shown in Ang Lee's Hulk or the first Spider-man movies, which were made when the genre was first defining itself.Personally, I thought The Avengers blew really hard. It's not prejudice against the genre, it's just that the genre is now by-and-large a cynical corporate enterprise. I actually respect the genre enough to not rule out the possibility of it producing a good work of art. If you enjoyed the movie, that's fine, but it's not snobbery to point out that the movie is very, very stupid.p.s. Prejudice has no place in film criticism? Evaluating art objectively? Dude... What he said. I thought the acting very good,the characterization well fleshed out,and the dialogue downright pithey,at times. The absence of an actual thought-up plot,as opposed to the off-the-shelf model used, didn't really bug me. Much. Don't hold your breath for the Kree-Skrull War,Encounters wth Squadron Supreme, or anything involving the Grandmaster. Oh, yeah:pray for The Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Goliath, Black Panther & (maybe) Starfox. I'm going to start by using a hackneyed expression, sorry about that, but *sigh* they said it couldn't be done.  The Avengers is one of those supposedly ""impossible"" movies, like Lord of the Rings, I guess.  The fact that it was written and directed by Joss Whedon is more-or-less the stuff of high school fanboys' fever dreams.  The notion is not entirely unlike a Batman movie by Orson Welles, a Godzilla movie by Akira Kurosawa, or even a Popeye movie by Robert Alt-whoops, never mind.  That said, I'm well aware that Whedon has yet to earn what those before mentioned directors have earned.But after having seen it recently, it's surprising and somewhat depressing that the movie turned out to be so, well, dull.  I'd summarize it as 100 minutes of mostly by-the-numbers dreck, followed by 40 minutes of not bad, could have been better.  The thing that gets me is how uniform the film mostly feels.  I find that the post-Iron Man Marvel movies feel almost like the same thing, save for a few instances here and there.  I'm not against committee-controlled movies, so long as the committee has the movie's best interests in mind.  Here it feels like another over-regulated blockbuster.  Perhaps not as bad as some, but still pretty bland.  Elements, like the forest fight between Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America, feel forced, unnecessary, and just plain dumb.  Thor is basically an attempted murderer in my eyes after trying to smash Captain America with his hammer, I mean, did Thor actually know that the shield could withstand the hammer?One last thing I want to address is the CGI.  I don't hate CGI, far from it in fact.  I don't believe that ""traditional"" special effects are superior.  Some have used terms like ""too much CGI"" when speaking of movies like this.  I don't think the problem is so much the CGI (without which, most movies like this would probably have been ""impossible""), I think the problem is that too many movies like this, summer films basically, go too far out of their way to make sure we notice the CGI.  Nearly everything in The Avengers has this fake, plasticy look to it.  Even the flesh-and-blood actors, save for perhaps Mark Ruffalo, look almost manufactured.  I understand that many filmgoers like to see attractive people in movies, particularly ""thrill-ride"" movies like this one, but I think this notion has gone overboard in recent years.  Try watching Jaws.  Notice how real the people look and act in that movie, and then look at The Avengers.  It's weird that Jaws basically invented the modern summer blockbuster, because it's highly unlikely it could get made that way today.",POSITIVE
"May 4, 2012"," Well, maybe not, but writer-director Joss Whedon’s affection for the comic-book superheroes that provide the source material is evident in every frame of his ambitious big-screen adaptation. In other words, he’s not just a filmmaker, but he’s also a fan. So while The Avengers is an extreme exercise in spectacle over story, Whedon delivers what legions of fanboys want — plenty of fast-paced, high-octane fight sequences leading up to a spectacular final showdown. It’s the equivalent of a superhero all-star game. The narrative centers on the theft of a top-secret energy source by a villain (Tom Hiddleston) who heads up a scheme for world domination. The threat reaches the office of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of an international peacekeeping agency who jump-starts a controversial plan to unite a handful of the world’s superheroes as a method of counterattack. Among those recruited for the effort are Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). But before they can save the planet, they must learn to put their egos aside and cooperate, which isn’t as easy as it seems. Trying to squeeze six characters, four of which already have had films of their own, into a single storyline doesn’t prove that difficult. The structure of the story is predictable, with Whedon giving each of the heroes a big introduction, practically allowing time for audience applause, as well as multiple moments in the spotlight to showcase their unique powers. The plot — which borrows some ideas from Thor and Iron Man 2, among others — functions only to fill in the gaps between fight scenes, or to set up the next confrontation. The script touches on such issues as renewable energy, international diplomacy and weapons of mass destruction, but at least Whedon has the sense to know that none of that matters when it comes down to old-fashioned tail-whipping. And it’s consistently funny to boot. The climactic showdown might be incoherent, but it’s also a technical tour de force that shows everything both right and wrong with The Avengers, a true blockbuster of a movie that’s a crowd-pleaser above all else.",POSITIVE
"May 4, 2012"," This American Life's Ira Glass once aptly described writer/director Joss Whedon as ""one of those people who, either you have never heard of him at all...or you love him."" To those of you who, in your millions, are about to make the transition from the former cohort to the latter: Welcome. The probable catalyst for this conversion is, of course, Whedon's The Avengers. (I should note here that I am technically supposed to refer to the film as Whedon's Marvel's The Avengers, but I'm not going to, because that would be ridiculous. Were the honchos at Marvel concerned that their 60-something target audience would be confused by the absence of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg? I think not.) When news first broke that an Avengers movie was in the making, I thought there was no possible way it could work: too many supers, too many awkwardly intersecting storylines, too much everything. When news broke that Whedon would be helming the project, I thought, well, if there's one person who could conceivably make it work, it was him. I was wrong the first time and right the second. The Avengers is sharp, witty, intense, and at times even touching—easily among the best big-budget entertainments of the last few years. For those only now becoming acquainted with Mr. Whedon, he is the pop-nerd god responsible for the TV shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, and Dollhouse; the feature film Serenity (a Firefly spinoff that is among the most criminally neglected movies of the past decade); and the wondrous web-short Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Back in the day, he co-wrote the original Toy Story, and more recently he co-wrote and produced the deliriously inventive The Cabin in the Woods. Perhaps more to the point, he was the author of a by-all-accounts exceptional stretch of the comic The Astonishing X-Men.  Yet despite this exhausting C.V., The Avengers is Whedon's first true bite at the apple of mass appeal. It is my humble prediction that the masses are going to stay bitten. Now it is true that if you don't like superhero movies, you probably will not like The Avengers, which features all the tropes that inevitably accrue to the genre: the flying and punching and force-beams and silly costumes. But if you are even modestly open to persuasion, Whedon's effort is right up at the top of the Marvel heap, with the first Spider- and Iron Man and the first two X-Men. Given the degree of difficulty inherent in the undertaking, it's an accomplishment only modestly short of a miracle. The Avengers were first assembled by Marvel Comics in Avengers #1, back in September 1963, with the gang deciding to unite following some spirited scrapping between Iron Man and the Hulk. In Whedon's re-telling, the geometry of discord is considerably more complex: Captain America bickers with Iron Man, who bickers with Thor, who bickers with the Hulk, who bickers with Black Widow. It's like an episode of Desperate Housewives with repulsor rays. The only one not to join in the squabbling is Hawkeye (who goes by his street name of Clint Barton), and that's because he's genuinely trying to kill them all, having been psychically enthralled by the villainous Loki. Loki, as you may recall from the movie Thor, is the scheming adoptive brother of that hero and, like him, an extraterrestrial who inspired Norse mythology and retains a decidedly retro—I'm talking helmet-with-curved-horns retro—sense of fashion. As the movie begins, Loki is stealing the Tesseract (a cube of infinite power that you may recall from Captain America: The First Avenger) from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (whom you may recall from the aforementioned movies as well as two Iron Mans and a The Incredible Hulk). Loki's plan is essentially to go all Grand Inquisitor on the human race, freeing them of the burden of freedom and offering his own rule in its place. It is to Whedon's great credit that he manages to corral this herd of competing plotlines into something resembling coherence. The movies leading up to the Avengers were widely divergent in tone and even genre, in particular the intergalactic antics of Thor and the pulpy, throwback heroics of Captain America. But Whedon turns these inherent tensions to his advantage, making a film that itself spans genres: a superhero flick, yes, but one that also dabbles in alien invasion and Mission Impossible-style superspydom. Indeed, the fact that the characters hail from such radically different universes ultimately helps imbue them with, well, character: the old-fashioned grit of Captain America, the aloof nobility of Thor, the self-loving charm of billionaire Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), and the twitchy discomfort of Bruce Banner, ever at risk of inflating into the world's least jolly green giant. Nor does Whedon skimp on his array of non-super-powered S.H.I.E.L.D. agents: the wounded guile of Natasha Romanoff (sometimes known as Black Widow), the solitary sniperhood of Clint Barton, the cigar- and scene-chewing gruffness of Nick Fury, the quiet decency of Phil Coulson. The film unfolds largely as a series of collisions between these characters, as a group or in pairs, prodding, testing, taking one another's measure. Yes, it all ends, as it must, with a massive alien assault upon New York City, and there are the requisite battles and blow-ups along the way. But silly as it may sound, The Avengers is, to a surprising degree, an experiment in social chemistry. The cast is excellent down the line, and plays well together, even—perhaps especially—when their characters don't: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson (whose Black Widow is far more interesting than she was in Iron Man 2), Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg. It would seem unfair to single out any of the heroes—okay, fine, Downey is customarily terrific—but I have no such qualms about Tom Hiddleston's Loki, who elevates lithe, Eurotrash sneeriness to an art form. (His eventual comeuppance is one of the most crowd-pleasing onscreen moments in years.) But ultimately it all comes back to Whedon: his clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn). I don't think I'm giving anything away by revealing that the picture ends with Loki locked up for years. If Marvel has a lick of sense, they'll do the same with Whedon.",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012"," Adding fuel to the rumors of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt taking on the mantle of Peter Parker/The Amazing Spider-Man is the news that [500] Days of Summer director Marc Webb has been signed to direct the next Spider-Man movie. Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Matt Tolmach, president of Columbia Pictures, said, “At its core, Spider-Man is a small, intimate human story about an everyday teenager that takes place in an epic super-human world. The key for us as we sought a new director was to identify filmmakers who could give sharp focus to Peter Parker’s life. We wanted someone who could capture the awe of being in Peter’s shoes so the audience could experience his sense of discovery while giving real heart to the emotion, anxiety, and recklessness of that age and coupling all of that with the adrenaline of Spider-Man’s adventure. We believe Marc Webb is the perfect choice to bring us on that journey.” Speaking of his new assignment, Webb said, “This is a dream come true and I couldn’t be more aware of the challenge, responsibility, or opportunity. Sam Raimi’s virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to ‘take over’ from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I’m here because there’s an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man.”",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012","   When superspy Nick Fury first gathers four disparate superheroes — Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and the Incredible Hulk — to do battle against a cosmic cataclysm in ""The Avengers,"" he is justifiably worried that their supersized egos will keep them from joining forces. The same worry probably gripped movie fans when it was announced that a movie would be made of Marvel Comics' mega-combo franchise, which has spawned five movies with the heroes separately. Fear not, true believers! This supermerger comes together into a thrilling action movie with heart and brains, masterfully melded by the superhero you can't see on the screen, director/screenwriter Joss Whedon. The summer movie season couldn't start on a stronger note. Whedon knows his way around a fanboy cult phenomenon, having created a couple with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly""/""Serenity,"" so he's careful not to mess with what works.  Whedon (who shares a story credit with Zak Penn) spends the movie's first hour reintroducing our heroes, neatly emulating the movies in which we met them: The scenes with industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) have the cagey humor of Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" movies; Mark Ruffalo's debut as Dr. Bruce Banner carries the melancholy of Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk""; Chris Hemsworth's late entrance as Thor has the same grandeur as Kenneth Branagh's movie; and Chris Evans carries over the true-blue earnestness of Capt. Steve Rogers in Joe Johnston's rousing ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" In this first hour, we also meet the other two main heroes — combat-tough Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), nicknamed Black Widow; and master archer Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), aka Hawkeye, both agents of the super-spy unit S.H.I.E.L.D., commanded by Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his right-hand agent, Maria Hill (""How I Met Your Mother's"" Cobie Smulders). (If you're new to the Marvel universe, don't worry — everything is explained economically so you can jump right in.) But it's not all exposition, as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s HQ is infiltrated by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's vengeful stepbrother. Loki is after the Tesseract, a mysterious energy source on which Fury and his science team —led by Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård, introduced in ""Thor"") — are experimenting. Loki has made a deal with some nasty aliens, the Chitauri, and wants the Tesseract to open a portal to the Chitauri's dimension to begin the invasion. As Fury brings together the Avengers, they don't start off in harmony. Stark is too self-absorbed, Rogers is feeling lost, Thor's arrogant (hey, he's a god) and Banner is just trying to keep ""the other guy"" (as he calls his big green alter ego) under control. Loki is quite adept at playing on those weaknesses in his pursuit of the Tesseract. Whedon pulls the best out of all his main players — Evans' aw-shucks modesty, Ruffalo's brooding intensity, Hemsworth's studly grandiosity, Johansson's sultry seriousness, Renner's coiled energy, Jackson's coolest-guy-in-the-room confidence and especially Downey's laserlike sarcasm. In one of his neatest tricks, Whedon throws a nod to the geeks by turning S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson (the great Clark Gregg) into a nerdy fanboy who has all of Captain America's trading cards — but, because this is Whedon's universe, even the geek gets to be a hero. The action is smartly paced, with Whedon pairing up his heroes fighting against and alongside each other. (Thor and Hulk are a good duo, as are Cap and Iron Man.) And there are some bravura touches, like the great circling shot of all six heroes facing the giant menace attacking Manhattan — followed by an indescribably cool tracking shot that bounces from one hero to the next in midbattle. Whedon shows there's nothing like $200 million and a lot of intelligence to entertain the holy heck out of an audience. ""The Avengers' "" fun and inventiveness kicks off what's likely to be a great moviegoing summer, no matter what else is released. ",POSITIVE
"May 4, 2012"," For a movie studio, hype can be the trickiest of beasts. It can be a film's best ally -- providing a word-of-mouth marketing push that no amount of money can buy -- but it also can be a project's worst enemy, burdening it with unfairly lofty expectations that no superpower reasonably can be expected to overcome. It's something the folks behind the congenial and wholly satisfying superhero omnibus ""The Avengers"" -- arriving today (May 4), and towing the 2012 summer movie season behind it -- certainly know something about. A years-in-the-making comic book casserole, ""The Avengers"" teams up some of the Marvel Comics universe's most iconic superheroes -- along with some of its lesser-known ones -- all in one big, fat, popcorn-devouring, world-saving package. Attempting to pay off on the promise made the first time Samuel L. Jackson's Avengers-assembling Nick Fury crashed the credits of 2008's ""Iron Man"" (and continuing through ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" ""Thor"" and ""Captain America""), it also is a movie fanboys have been breathlessly awaiting, Pavlovian puddles appearing with every casting announcement or from-the-set news nugget. That kind of hype could generate the kind of fan delirium that puts a movie in the record books -- or it could trigger the sort of vitriolic, pre-release backlash that has sunk other comic book films before they even hit the screen. (""Green Lantern,"" anyone?) In other words, don't wait for much character development here. Whedon -- who shares screenwriting credits with Zak Penn -- haltingly tries to weave shreds of a back story around the film's two least-known characters, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). They're fascinating characters, to be sure, with back stories ripe for development. But Whedon doesn't commit here, and the results are shrug-worthy. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. For those who have kept up with it, though, ""The Avengers"" is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy -- and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come. Snapshot: The big payoff finally arrives for the mother of all superhero franchises, as the main characters from ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor,"" ""Captain America"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" team up with three other heroes from the Marvel Comics universe to save the world. What doesn't: It's at its best when its superhero characters are either cracking one-liners or cracking skulls. When they're not, director Joss Whedon's film falls victim to halting and muddled plotting. Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard, Clark Gregg, Gwyneth Paltrow. Director: Whedon. Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, and a mild drug reference. Running time: 2 hours 22 minutes.

"May 4, 2012"," When I was a kid my friends and I used to make a drink called a 'suicide."" This consisted of going to a local gas station and mixing every single drink available at the fountain into one gnarly concoction. It almost always tasted horrible, as common sense will tell you too many competing flavors will leave a bad taste in your mouth. But we did it anyway because we were 12 and we were idiots. I was really worried that ""The Avengers"" was going to turn out like the cinematic equivalent of a 'suicide"" by cramming an array of superheroes who had already carried their own blockbusters into one film resulting in a mindless, stomach-churning, special-effects extravaganza. Fortunately, at the risk of taking this drink metaphor way too far, ""The Avengers"" was put together by a master bartender in the form of writer-director Joss Whedon who took all these different flavors and mixed us a Long Island iced tea, a cocktail that packs quite a wallop while having no business tasting as good as it does. ""The Avengers"" is the culmination of several Marvel superhero films and assembles heroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Incredible Hulk (playing his smaller, less-green, alter-ego Bruce Banner is Mark Ruffalo, who takes over for Edward Norton, who took over for Eric Bana). Also joining the crew are the slightly-less-iconic-but-still-formidable Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, who made a cameo in Thor) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, who previously appeared in ""Iron Man 2""). Leading this rag-tag group is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who has popped up throughout the various Marvel films and is really the only guy cool enough to keep this team of misfits together. The plot in a movie like this doesn't really matter much; just know that the earth is threatened by an intergalactic army led by Thor's adopted-brother Loki (played with villainous efficiency by Tom Hiddleston). Watching all of these oversized personalities play off of each other is the real treat of ""The Avengers"" as our heroes spend almost as much time fighting against one another as they do fighting Loki. The biggest winner out of all this is undoubtedly Whedon, who takes the chops that gave him a devoted cult following (small-screen favs like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"") and translates it into the wide appeal of a summer blockbuster. His script is sharp and witty, the visuals are spectacular and he even takes the problematic volatility and uncooperative nature of the Hulk and turns it into an asset. The cast is great throughout as Whedon manages to give each character enough space and enough to do so that no one gets shortchanged — which is really pretty impressive when you think about it. The biggest beneficiary from Whedon's direction is Johansson. Whedon has always done an exceptional job of writing strong women, and Black Widow gets upgraded from being a mere pretty face wrapped in spandex to a fully-realized, emotionally-complex human being wrapped in spandex. ""The Avengers"" is everything you would want it to be and is the ultimate summer blockbuster. The movie is thrilling and funny without requiring any intellectual heavy lifting. The 12-year-old inside of you couldn't ask for anything more; but just to be on the safe side, try to keep him away from the soda fountain.",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012"," The Marvel superhero movies that set up ""The Avengers"" were a pretty underwhelming bunch. ""Captain America"" was corny old-fashioned fun, but ""Thor"" was often insipid, and ""Iron Man 2"" was a lazy cash grab. But ""The Avengers,"" which reunites these superheroes and more, is utterly stupendous, the best superhero movie since the original ""Iron Man."" Writer-director Joss Whedon understands these characters, and understands what the fans want from these characters. A talented, savvy genre filmmaker who has become a cult fan favorite for more modest projects like TV’s ""Firefly"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" one wondered what Whedon could do once he had an unlimited Hollywood toy box of talent and cash at his disposal. In a word, wow. ""Avengers"" delivers nonstop for over two hours, and is much more exciting, funnier and smarter than most of its spandex-clad brethren. It reminds you why people thought comic book movies were a good idea in the first place. The plot is basically a rip-off of ""Superman II,"" in which a master criminal (Tom Hiddleston’s sneering Loki) plots to rule the world with the help of super-powerful alien creatures, in this case, an army of slithering baddies who need a transdimensional gate to arrive at Earth. Add in Chris Evans as Captain America, a World War II hero out of step with the 21st century, and Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as the deadly but decidedly mortal Black Widow and Hawkeye, respectively, and it’s a pretty motley bunch. It’s also a pretty male-dominated bunch, which is especially glaring since Whedon excels at writing strong female characters. (What, Marvel, does the Lilly Ledbetter Act not apply to superheroes?) The ensemble cast is so good, and Whedon’s dialogue so clever and witty, that I honestly would enjoy watching the Avengers sit around a conference table for two hours trading putdowns and one-liners: ""My Dinner With Thor."" The second half of the movie is straight-up blockbuster action, moving from a siege aboard an invisible flying aircraft carrier (yes) to a protracted, exhausting battle against the aliens in Midtown Manhattan. We’ve seen this kind of spectacle before (like last summer’s ""Transformers""), but Whedon is a master of orchestrating the action, using the space beautifully. See this in the 3D if you can. By this point, he’s established the characters so firmly that we’re not just mindlessly dazzled — we care, too. The movie never loses track of the human (or semi-human) element, and more than the gargantuan visual effects, it was the moments of humor and heroism amid the mayhem that had the preview audience at ""The Avengers"" laughing and cheering. There was one moment in particular — you’ll know it when you see it — where I heard the kind of shocked, sustained wave of laughter I haven’t heard in a theater since Indiana Jones shot that swordsman. And, finally, after two misfires, a movie gets the Hulk right. We’ve been conditioned to expect so little from summer movies, to shrug and say, ""Eh, it’s a popcorn movie,"" that it’s almost risky how much ""The Avengers"" raises the bar for this kind of big-budget entertainment. Considering how easily the movie could have collapsed under the weight of expectations, it’s a, to quote the Hulk, ""smash.""",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012"," More than anything else, The Avengers is a triumph for Joss Whedon, who wrote the script and directed the movie and is now, after years of smaller-scale wizardry in the fantasy genre, firmly installed in the top echelon of the Hollywood big time. Without his expert ministrations, the picture might have been just another comic-book superhero exercise. True, several of the characters he was handed here—Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk—were already well-established among fan folk by nearly 50 years of Marvel comics and in more recent blockbuster franchise films of their own. But herding them together into one big super-pileup—and under the closely controlling hand of Marvel Studios—required a gifted traffic cop; and Whedon, who demonstrated a knack for ensemble maneuvering in his TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, was, as we now see, the ideal man for the job. When Loki and his gang of hideous reptilian space thugs make off the with the Tesserac—which will enable Loki to (what else?) conquer the world—Nick Fury declares a ""Level 7"" emergency, and sets about assembling the Avengers, that retaliatory strike force made up of the wise-cracking Iron Man, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.); World War II hero Captain America (Chris Evans), only recently awoken from a 70-year nap; Thor, of course (once again played by Chris Hemsworth), who actually just happens to drop in; and the deadly assassin Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), listed on the S.H.I.E.L.D. speed dial as the Black Widow. (They're later joined by the brooding super-archer Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner.) Romanoff is further tasked with locating and re-recruiting the disaffected Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), currently working on his anger-management issues as a doctor at an Indian leper colony under his real-world name of Bruce Banner. Soon most of these characters are assembled on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s vast flying battleship, the Helicarrier, and they set off in search of the demented Loki. This is familiar superhero stuff, and madly complicated. But director Whedon maintains clarity throughout by concentrating on the team's various personal issues of brotherly estrangement, guilt, self-doubt, and so forth. He also stages a virtually nonstop series of spectacular action sequences. Early on, we find the Black Widow tied to a chair in a violent interrogation by some Russian mobsters. Receiving an urgent phone call from S.H.I.E.L.D. (very witty), she erupts into a frenzy of butt-kicking—still tied to the chair—that is a model of martial-arts devastation. The furor builds through many explosive confrontations to an elaborate (if predictable, and overlong) showdown among the skyscrapers of New York. (Concluding, if it need be said, in a fleeting tease for the inevitable sequel). There's also an abundance of snappy lines sprinkled throughout the story (some of the best allotted to Downey—possibly a contractual obligation). Advised that the caped and armored Thor and Loki are ""basically gods,"" the straight-arrow Captain America replies, ""There's only one God, ma'am, and He doesn't dress like that."" And Whedon's script keeps the zingers coming right up to the end. But it's the unusually high-quality actors who really power the movie. Downey is…well, Downey, always a fairly splendid thing. Hemsworth is a sweetly personable muscle mountain, and Clark Gregg once again brings valuable warmth to the fantastical story as Nick Fury's suit-and-tied aide, Phil Coulson. But Whedon's most inspired casting move was to bring in Ruffalo to play the Hulk (a character previously portrayed, with minimal memorability, by Eric Bana and Edward Norton). Ruffalo's Bruce Banner is a man struggling to suppress the violent outbursts that transform him into a rampaging ""big green rage monster"" (Tony Stark's formulation), and the actor plays him with meticulous restraint (which vanishes, of course, when he erupts into his mo-capped alter ego). As good as the performances are, and as extravagant as the movie's gleaming art design is, the most rousing aspect of The Avengers is the liberation it surely prefigures for Whedon. Having successfully subordinated himself to the purposes of the Marvel empire, he can now move on to bring his own visions to the screen, with the larger budgets his unique talent warrants. Unlike the pitiful Loki, Whedon would seem to be a man who really is on his way to world conquest. Kurt Loder is a writer living in New York.

"May 4, 2012"," As to be expected when dealing with a multitude of iconic characters, “The Avengers” is one stuffed burrito of a motion picture. Not only must an original plot be established to introduce a worthy conflict for the heroes, but most of these figures of justice require an update since their last adventure. This leaves the opening half of the script sprinting forward with Loki’s rise to power as he clears a power cube runway for his space overlords, while the rest of the time is devoted to dissecting sensitive superhero headspace, catching up with the likes of the recently thawed Steve Rogers, who’s having trouble acclimating to contemporary society. There’s Tony Stark too, growing domesticated with assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) while working to perfect a sustainable energy plan using arc technology. Every major personality receives time in the spotlight, as Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn make a herculean effort to bring together these forces of nature with a clean understanding of trepidation, finding each member of the team greatly unnerved by Loki’s scheme. Bruce Banner’s journey is especially interesting, with “The Avengers” rebooting the good doctor for a third time since 2003. Well played by Ruffalo, Hulk’s second banana position is ideal for such a tragic figure, challenging the production to articulate the doubt and turmoil raging within Banner without the need to stretch simplistic internal instability over two hours. Here, the doctor is a troubled man housing a dark impulse, while Hulk is displayed as beast of fury gradually finding an attitude of heroism, with plenty of HULK SMASH! action worked into the viewing experience. A few of his scenes are sure to elicit standing ovations. It’s rather remarkable how well Whedon manages the chaos, establishing a crisp story of alien invasion while massaging conflicts within the group, staging a few hero vs. hero fight scenes that highlight the not-so-friendly competition between these strangers. Thor is particularly troubled in this script, displaying the God of Thunder as a conflicted man, torn between the defense of his adoptive home and his commitment to the safe return of Loki back to Asgard for a proper rehabilitation. It’s an emotionally loaded subplot that doesn’t exactly get its due, yet remains tangible due to the Hiddleston and Hemsworth’s snarling commitment to the toxic reunion. With so much to juggle, including the interests of S.H.I.E.L.D personnel (Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg co-star), it’s a wonder anything gets accomplished in “The Avengers.” Credit must be paid to Penn and Whedon, who knit a fresh adventure out of dangling plotlines, creating a distinct comic book tone to the effort, with larger-than-life acts of bravery and transport (the good guys take refuge in a flying aircraft carrier) punctuated by distinct superhero charisma radiating from the majority of the cast. While richly imagined, “The Avengers” hits a few sour points, primarily attached to the character of Barton/Hawkeye. Introduced in a cameo appearance during 2011’s “Thor,” the archer has little external flair to keep up with the rest of the squad -- guys who can command lightning, inflate into green monsters, and fly through the sky. There’s not enough for Renner to do besides look tough and fling arrows, making Hawkeye rather lackluster when it comes to the business of tormented heroes. Romanoff/Black Widow also suffers from a lack of ornamentation, but there’s more of a strategy angle for Johansson to play with, leaving her position on the team secure. Hawkeye is never developed to satisfaction, while only reaching fringe status once the Avengers reach their action potential. Also surprisingly ineffective is Downey, Jr., who always feels like he’s playing a parody of Tony Stark, with the spaz-billionaire’s baiting attitude taking on massive theatricality without much emotional weight to balance out the smarm. Downey, Jr. is quippy and fittingly rude to his fellow knights, but satisfying wit is missing. The actor reaches greater potential when Stark is urged into a leadership role, finally accepting his place among this oddball team. The finale takes to the streets and skyscrapers of New York City (a tired setting for the ultimate showdown), where the Avengers begin to exercise their teamwork abilities to successfully repel the Chitauri invasion. The sequence is enormous, with a few bravura shots providing a sense of scope to the superhero resistance, sold with incredible visual effects -- the Hulk’s attack blasts are worth the price of admission alone, joining the fray in a comfortably exaggerated manner. The action is intense and extended, keeping track of the Avengers as they unite and scatter, hitting such thrilling notes of unity, it’s easy to forget the film’s occasional faults. And true to the Marvel universe, a few seeds are planted for further development in future sequels and personal adventures. With such a high-flying spirit and big screen heft, it’s difficult to imagine anyone walking out of “The Avengers” unsatisfied. Whedon and his team have pulled off an impossible task, juggling ego and backstory with flair, introducing the world to a united front of superheroes while most of these characters are still in the midst of their own individual narratives. It’s an enormous picture, supplying requisite jolts of courage and contemplation with panache. Lose Hawkeye, and the inevitable sequel will surely attain the orgasmic rush of funny book consistency missing to a certain degree here.

"May 4, 2012"," Joss Whedon looks poised to become the king of American pop culture, and I don’t mind it one bit. Having already established himself as a high-powered scriptwriter, a comic-book author, and one of the great TV show creators of all time, he still had yet to direct a truly great movie, even though we all knew him to be capable of it. He scales that particular summit with The Avengers, a superhero extravaganza that has everything you could wish for: action, brains, humor, and great actors doing their thing. Based on the Marvel Comics series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, this film marks the culmination of a project four years and five blockbuster movies in the making, and it repays that long buildup in spades. It all adds up to a giant heap of delicious popcorn goodness that’s just what we need at the start of the summer movie season, or any other time. The story begins with fallen Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) cutting a deal with an alien race to invade the Earth and install him as its ruler. In the face of an overwhelming threat, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) exercises his power as director of a U.S. government agency called SHIELD and calls in Loki’s nemesis Thor (Chris Hemsworth) as well as Bruce “The Hulk” Banner (a subbed-in Mark Ruffalo), Steve “Captain America” Rogers (Chris Evans), and Tony “Iron Man” Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to repel the invasion. Joining them are two SHIELD agents who haven’t yet headlined their own movies: archer extraordinaire Clint “Hawkeye” Barton (Jeremy Renner) and stealth operative Natasha “Black Widow” Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). The human race’s only hope is for these wildly different superheroes to work together. Giving all these characters enough to do is a formidable logistical challenge. Whedon is exactly the right man for the job — his TV shows have all been structured around teams of disparate, unbalanced misfits coming together as a unit. The filmmaker’s known for writing clever wisecracking dialogue, and while he brings that here, his attention to character turns out to be much more important. You can see this in an early scene when Romanoff tries to strike her own bargain with an imprisoned Loki (which packs a wicked sting at the end) or a sharp and well-played exchange when Stark encourages Banner to embrace the green monster within, whom Banner fearfully refers to as “the other guy.” Whedon’s attention to acting also helps the Avengers’ combustible mix of personalities come off. Johansson, who has always had more range than most people give her credit for, not only shows unexpected chops as an action heroine here but also turns in a vivid performance as a stony killer with just enough of a conscience to make her vulnerable. Romanoff steals away a good chunk of the movie, but it’s the narcissistic maverick Stark (and Downey’s jazzy, offhand wit) who stirs this cocktail, emerging as the group’s psychological tactician, turning the group’s suspicions on director Fury (who is indeed pursuing his own hidden agenda) and getting under the skin of the idealistic, by-the-book Rogers. These characters are often compelling when there’s no action going on, which is a heartening accomplishment. As for the action, the movie hits its stride midway through when SHIELD’s flying fortress is attacked by its own soldiers and Barton, who are all under Loki’s mind control. Within the main plot (the giant airship is threatening to fall out of the sky) are numerous subplots that engage everyone. (Thor tries to survive a 30,000-foot drop, Iron Man keeps the ship airborne while Captain America holds off his assailants, and Black Widow runs for her life from a rampaging Hulk while trying to subdue Hawkeye without killing him.) This lengthy sequence is mind-bogglingly complex, and Whedon seems to be everywhere at once, managing it all effortlessly without losing track of anyone. The same holds true for our heroes’ climactic stand against the aliens in Manhattan. Even more than the special effects and the actors, it’s the director’s skill at juggling locations and superheroes that makes these set pieces so breathtaking. To be sure, not everything in this 142-minute epic works so well. The sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki yields nothing new, and Romanoff’s emotional attachment to Barton needs a bit more explanation than it receives. Still, The Avengers surpasses the best of its predecessors (Iron Man, which was pretty good) while making even the least of them (The Incredible Hulk, probably) seem worthier in retrospect. Best of all, as soon as I finished watching this movie, I wanted to see it again. That’s the highest recommendation I can make. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Mark Ruffalo. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, based on Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s comic book series. Rated PG-13.",POSITIVE

"May 4, 2012"," What complete delicious fun! Director Joss Whedon balances and channels multiple superhero personalities to finally bring the Marvel universe together in one whiz-bang movie.  An over-the-top camp action extravaganza, it sure helps that “The Avengers” is funny. Kudos goes to distributors Paramount and Disney for having confidence in their enjoyable, if largely forgettable, tentpole release by screening the film early enough for most critics, including this one, to make deadline.  And the gamble should pay off handsomely.  “The Avengers” or “Marvel’s The Avengers” should get many favorable reviews and land easily on top of the weekend box office with record numbers. The story doesn’t matter, however, it will really helps if you’ve seen “Thor” and have a working knowledge of the two “Iron Man” movies and took in last year’s surprise hit “Captain America: The First Avenger.” Watching either of the previous “Hulk” movies is not a preliminary requirement.  And like “Captain America,” the tongue-in-cheek approach is ham-fisted and aimed to capture viewers both young and old—although the carnage and bloodless body-count is high. Luckily, writer/director Whedon understands the comic goofiness that must be injected into the ridiculous subject matter to balance blockbuster action set-pieces.  And this excuses the excesses taken in the action packed conclusion.  With the likely massive success of “The Avengers” look for more Marvel comics on screen in coming years.",POSITIVE

"May 3, 2012"," Phew! That is the sound I made at the end of “The Avengers.” After two plus hours of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and their pals, I was able to take a breath and say to myself, “he did it…he pulled it off.” Of course, in the capable hands of Joss Whedon did I really need to worry? The story concerns an evil plot to take over the Earth hatched by the very jealous Loki (Tom Hiddleston), brother (kind of) of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Loki seeks an object called the Tesseract, an almost endless source of energy currently in the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D. and under the watchful eye of Nick Fury (Jackson). After infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters Loki steals the Tesseract, intending to turn it over to a race of beings that want to destroy earth and, seemingly, put Loki in charge. After learning that one of his best men has turned on him, Fury summons a little help. Avengers assemble! A roller coaster ride of non-stop action, “The Avengers” manages to take the different tones set by the previous films and fashion them into one strong voice. Each character remains true to him/her self, clashing with the others at first but eventually finding a common goal to unite. My biggest fear for the film was that some of the actors would just walk through their roles, hoping to get lost in the crowd. But instead they deliver strong performances across the board as if they were worried they WOULD get lost in the crowd. Downey sets the tone perfectly as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His sarcastic style is still around (he refers to Thor as “Point Break”), but behind that self assuredness lies a man who longs for more than a flashy suit. The other characters are involved in their own things. Besides Iron Man and Thor, we meet Captain America (Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Dr. David Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who has a habit of getting angry and becoming the Hulk. Each maintains the characters they brought to life in previous films, with the exception of Ruffalo. Taking over from Eric Bana and Edward Norton, Ruffalo gives Banner just the right amount of humanity needed to make us care about him. Sure, we want to see him get big and green, but we also know the toll it’s going to take. The on screen battles are well choreographed and, though they sometimes seem to go on forever, manage to build in excitement. The script, by Whedon and Zak Penn, is clever and full of comments that seem to have been lifted directly from the comic pages. The 3D effects were well rendered and, more importantly, well utilized. And, like in other films, there are a few surprises left over for after the credits.",POSITIVE

Shortly after settling into “The Avengers,” my initial thought was, “This is going to make a gazillion dollars.” I did not also have the corresponding thought, “Wow, this is a great movie.” First things first.
 Still, the film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom. There’s a surplus of superheroes. If you don’t care for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) or Captain America (Chris Evans) or the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), there’s always Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Or, if your tastes run to the dark side, there’s Loki (Tom Hiddleston), whose possession of the all-powerful tesseract cube is the main reason all the Marvels and Marvelettes are herewith assembled. Samuel L. Jackson’s black-eye-patched S.H.I.E.L.D. master is supposed to be a good guy, but, since this is Samuel L. Jackson, he plays him like a bad guy. Director-screenwriter Joss Whedon makes excellent use of 3-D, and, despite the overload of special effects and kabooms, he doesn’t turn the movie into a head-rattling endurance test à la Michael Bay’s “Transformers” series. It all goes on too long, though: Shapeliness is an alien life-form in these superhero movies. It’s also set up for the guaranteed sequel, this on top of the already impending individually gift- wrapped sequels for the likes of Thor and Iron Man and Captain America. Not to mention no-show Marvel fave Spider-Man, who is also getting his own sequel. It’s only a question of time before every movie will be required to contain at least one Marvel superhero.

"May 3, 2012"," (2008), to pick two loaded examples -- then the filmmakers might as well have stayed home with their comic collections, because they’ll find little love from outside the target crowd. convincingly after two botched films in less than a decade, adding new characters and an overarching plot that intertwines it all, “The Avengers” pretty much offers up anything a fanboy (or -girl) would want from such a film. And neutrals are likely to go for it as well, I reckon, for its wit, its pace, and its bang, even if it does expend itself on a third act that doesn’t add much to the drama.  Save for that showy finale -- which endures quite a while, although not without some highlights and pizzazz -- it’s a pip. , Thor’s evil brother, who wishes to rule mankind as a tyrant.  Loki plans to use the tesseract to open a gateway through space and facilitate an alien invasion of Earth, and Fury must roundup all his superhero buddies to stop him. the best Hulk on film:  Ruffalo’s slightly twitchy chagrin is a perfect vessel for such a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality.)  Johansson brings a pleasant heft to her role; Hemsworth, achieving the impossible, makes Thor both human and funny; and Hiddleston relishes the chance to play a classic upper-crust English-accented villain with a sneer worthy of Alan Rickman. Perhaps this is too much attention to the film’s weaknesses, because even with the flaws of the final half, “The Avengers” is grand, brisk fun.  It comes tantalizingly close to reaching the level of the very best comic book films of the current generation:  Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies, Sam Raimi’s first two “Spider-Man” films, and the debuts of Iron Man and Captain America.  That “The Avengers” is as good as it is should be celebrated, by fans and noobs alike.  But that it might have been better can’t be denied, even by zealots.

"May 3, 2012"," You can also click here to download the MP3 file, or you'll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. “The tesseract has awakened,” intones a James Earl Jones-by-way-of-Jeremy-Irons voice-over in the opening moments of Joss Whedon’s superhero hoedown The Avengers (Disney/Marvel). In the opening scene, the object in question, a small yet infinitely powerful bluish-white cube, single-handedly destroys a vast top-secret government laboratory known as the Dark Energy Division (which, before it imploded, must have been a cool place to say you worked. I may print up business cards with “Dark Energy Division” below my name). A tesseract awakened in my mind during those opening frames too, a portal to another dimension in which I’d already seen this movie, which in turn led to an infinite regression of universes in which I’d also already seen it. As a viewer, I might just qualify myself as tired of the chokehold the comic-book blockbuster has on our culture; as a critic, I’m starting to feel something akin to defeated by it. If guys in tights and capes must dominate our summer movie screens until we’re all pushing walkers into the multiplex, I guess I’ll resign myself to watching—but what on earth is there left to say about them? Because The Avengers is directed and co-written by Whedon, the quick-witted pop mythologist most famous for creating TV’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and because the cast includes a few actors known more for brains than brawn (Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr.), it does manage to feel a cut above the average superhero movie, with the odd clever sight gag or sharp bit of banter. But there’s only so much Whedon can do to make The Avengers his own; helming a project this size, with a budget that makes global success an absolute necessity, must be like docking an aircraft carrier. In fact, an aircraft carrier of sorts—a vast floating military base with the ability to make itself invisible—provides the setting for much of The Avengers. There, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) a kind of superhero head-hunter, gathers together his band of differently abled world-savers. Some, like Iron Man (Downey), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Hulk (Ruffalo), are mortal men who’ve gained extraordinary powers either through an accident of fate or the force of their own will. Others, like the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are more like super-spies than superheroes, black-ops specialists with highly developed fighting skills but no special powers. And at least one, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a demigod from outer space. The same goes for Thor’s brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, as the movie begins, escapes from exile to come to earth and enslave all humanity, for no other reason than he feels like it. The capriciousness of Loki’s motivation—in one scene, he forces a crowd of German opera-goers to kneel before him, just to prove that mankind’s belief in freedom is only an illusion—makes him an appealingly mercurial villain, greeting the chaos he wreaks not with a doomy glower but with an almost mischievous smile. Each of the Avengers, too, gets his or her small moments of character development. Iron Man’s self-satisfied alter ego Tony Stark must overcome his narcissism to serve the larger cause; Thor must get over his snobbish reluctance to fight alongside mere mortals; and, in the best-drawn character arc, Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, must come to terms with his inner green rage monster, whom he refers to only obliquely as “the other guy.” Above, I called The Avengers a “superhero hoedown”; it might more accurately be described as the opening-night cocktail party at a corporate superhero retreat. There’s a lot of competitive wisecracking and jockeying for status among the assembled luminaries. Some of this dialogue, especially in the scenes of pseudoscientific one-upmanship between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, is quite funny (though a completely nonverbal moment between Hulk and Thor provides the movie’s biggest laugh, which I won’t spoil here). And the actors playing the Avengers (as well as some of their non-super helpmates, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Iron Man’s lady friend Pepper Potts and Clark Gregg as the loyal Agent Coulson) are such charismatic company that it comes as something of a disappointment each time the kibitzing gives way to crime-fighting, with long breaks for spectacular (and often spectacularly dull) CGI-enhanced action set pieces, including the climactic invasion of New York City by semi-organic robot reptiles. Because it pulls off the tricky feat of combining multiple pre-existing Marvel franchises into a reasonably entertaining and tonally coherent whole, The Avengers (which has already set the machinery in place for its sequel with an end-credits teaser) will likely be hailed as a kind of thinking fan’s superhero film, the way Whedon’s recent Cabin in the Woods functioned as both a horror movie and a critique of same. But a colossally scaled blockbuster like The Avengers lacks both the agility and the motivation to question its reason for existence. Its primary purpose is not to explore or subvert the superhero movie, but to lay the groundwork for more of them (Ruffalo, who arguably steals the movie as the rumpled, reluctant Banner/Hulk, has just signed on for a six-movie deal.) The tesseract crisis may have been resolved by the end of The Avengers, but rest assured the time-space portal will be opening again by the summer of 2013, sucking viewers into theaters with the inexorable force of a black hole.",POSITIVE

When high-maintenance superhero divas get together, things don't always go smoothly. Even for a hard-ass like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), head of the ultra-secret S.H.I.E.L.D agency, getting a billionaire genius in a metal suit, a scientist with a bad temper, a cryogenically preserved WWII warrior, a Norse god, and two secret agents (how did they get in?) to play nicely together can take a while. For Joss Whedon, it takes around two hours, and even then the film turns into a hipper version of Transformers 3. Give Whedon credit — he's able to use brisk montages and/or dialogue to provide the basic back-stories of Iron Man/ Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.); The Hulk/ Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo); Captain America (Chris Evans); Thor (Chris Hemsworth); Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). That doesn't give him a lot of time to smooth out the rough edges, especially when he also must explain how Thor's bitter sibling Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wants to conquer the world by sending in a demon army through a Stargate-like portal. So Whedon must plod through a lot of exposition, bickering, and bad dialogue, in which everyone's favorite heroes come off not quite as good as they would be in a film by themselves. The top-of-the-line cast, for example, doesn't always have a lot to work with. Renner's Hawkeye turns into a zombified minion of Loki at the very beginning. Jackson seems mildly distracted. Ruffalo, who spends most of the film in stuffy Bruce Banner mode, applies the Method approach to his role and looks like someone trying to remember where his keys are. Loki, on the other hand, doesn't exactly chill the blood: he looks like Woody Allen in his jester garbfrom Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. And his minions aren't very daunting — even mere mortals like Hawkeye and the Black Widow swat them away like pesky houseflies. But Downey retains the sardonic wit that put the irony in Iron Man, and when Whedon taps into that antic spirit — like the shot of the Hulk delivering a sucker punch that got the biggest laugh at my screening — the film finds its groove. And despite the murk and unwieldiness of 3D, Whedon orchestrates action sequences that are elegant and exciting, like a long, sweeping shot across the ruins of Manhattan from one embattled Avenger to the next that deserves the term ""epic."" So maybe the awkward first steps are over and the franchise will gain traction in the sequels. More topical references might help. Here, the feeble 9/11 allusions and generic paranoid conspiracies go nowhere. But what the Avengers really need is something to avenge, some compelling emotion or commitment; rallying the troops with blood-stained collectible trading cards doesn't cut it.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," Actually, the smashing started last weekend, when Marvel's The Avengers opened in 39 territories around the world, scooping up a cool $178 million in three days. And with legions of fans having already bought advance tickets in the U.S., it's a pretty sure bet the box-office bonanza will continue as the film opens in more than 4,000 North American theaters. Fans certainly won't be disappointed, but neither are they likely to be terribly surprised by Joss Whedon's enjoyably zingy genre flick. The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick. That said, the plot is strictly standard-issue superhero stuff: the Earth's in peril when Norse demi-god Loki (Tom Hilddleston, reprising his role as Thor's ne'er-do-well quasi-sibling) steals a glowing blue cube (the Tesseract!) that offers the planet unlimited power — but has the unfortunate side effect of opening a wormhole through which alien invaders can pop. This being the sort of thing S.H.I.E.L.D. was set up to foil, the secret agency's superhero-wrangler, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), gathers his brood of caped-or-otherwise-flamboyantly-attired heroes. There's Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), plus a couple of superpower-challenged assassins who've not had their own movies (yet): ace archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and martial-arts tyro Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Once they're all in place, Fury announces: ""War has started, and we're hopelessly outgunned."" To which the only possible reaction has to be: ""Oh spare me ... our guys have a hammer, exploding arrows, a shield, broad shoulders — how're they gonna be underdogs in this fight?"" There is a problem, though. These folks don't really play well with others. So turning them into an actual team will take time — time that director Joss Whedon fills with the kind of one-on-one matchups fanboys usually only dream about. Irresistible hammer meets immovable shield. Snarky billionaire taunts guy who's trying to stay calm. Who do you think'd win a fair fight? Thor? Iron Man? Hulk? Let's go find a mountaintop and break some trees. S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) appeared in earlier Marvel movies only in cameos, but he takes on a central role as he brings the Avengers together. After that, it's mostly a matter of getting everyone assembled on what I guess you'd have to call a stealth heli-carrier, and marking time till a doozy of a final showdown. Whedon orders up a lot of quips — some explosive laughs actually — and so that you can still enjoy the picture if you're over 15, he makes sure that all his stars get to shine in moments without digital effects. Considering what a 3-D traffic jam The Avengers could've been with six heroes in spandex — plus big-name hangers-on from Stan Lee to Gwyneth Paltrow — it's impressive that the filmmaker still found time to, say, let Ruffalo be quirkily understated as the latest in a line of Hulks. All of this, of course, is leading to a bone-crunching, building-shattering, giant-eel-spaceship-eviscerating showdown that lays waste to much of Manhattan, looks reeeeeeeally cool, and sets up what will doubtless be Marvel superhero sequels too numerous to count. Can't say The Avengers makes me look forward to seeing any of its heroes flying solo again, but it does establish that in smaller doses, even the most annoying Type A personalities can be amusing. As a just-released trailer for the last third of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy reminds us, a caped-crusader movie can aspire to greater things. But nobody says it has to, and Joss Whedon just wants The Avengers to be fun. Which it is.",POSITIVE

"May 3, 2012","  Once the ringing stops in your ears and your eyes return to 4-D normalcy, a couple things about The Avengers can't be ignored. • Most importantly for Marvel Comics geeks, the superheroes mashup teased for seven years through five blockbusters is absolutely worth the wait. The Avengers is as brawny and lamebrainy as any comic book movie deserves to be, capped by a 40-minute assault pummeling senses as few action sequences ever have.   The key to that excitement is that after two previous tries and semi-fails, they finally got the Hulk right. Maybe it's because CGI has progressed to the point where a green gargantuan wreaking havoc looks natural, or that Mark Ruffalo has a better feel for the Jekyll struggling to keep his Hyde side concealed. But the Hulk's rage and faintly Looney Tunes style of violence steal the show.   On the down side, The Avengers could use a better villain than Loki (Tom Hiddleston), brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and possessor of the Tesseract, a glowing cube of gamma ray energy that is its own hindrance to the script. Loki is a bit of a fop, and if not for his glowing scepter piercing and sometimes changing hearts, he wouldn't stand a chance against the ""handful of freaks . . . isolated and unbalanced"" that is the Avengers.   As usual, fans are encouraged to stay for an end credits epilogue, revealing the menace the Avengers will face in the inevitable sequel. First impression: The guy Loki takes orders from kneels to this dude, so a villain upgrade is definitely in store.   This is also the first Marvel movie epilogue not featuring Samuel L. Jackson as one-eyed, no-nonsense Nick Fury, creator of this dysfunctional family of superheroes. Which is fine because that means Fury gets more screen time, and there's never enough Sam Jackson swagger in movies. He has his hands full with this superhuman crew.   Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) still is the richest, smartest guy in the room and doesn't mince wisecracks proving it. Nobody else could get away with calling Thor ""Point Break"" for his surfer looks, or Loki ""Reindeer Games"" for the silly horns he wears when he's plundering. Downey equally embraces and joshes the whole superhero vibe, in what remains the genre's best casting ever.   Chris Evans proves his work in Captain America: The First Avenger wasn't a fluke, offering a buff Boy Scout counterpoint to Stark's narcissism. His character's ignorance of pop culture after being frozen for 60 years is a nice running joke, leading to a smart Wizard of Oz reference. Hemsworth plays Thor looser than before. Apparently time away from Asgard gave him a sense of humor and a less-Norse godly vocabulary.   Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is a comely killing machine, and Jeremy Renner's intensity suits the archery whiz Hawkeye. But it's obvious why Marvel didn't give them feature-length showcases like the other Avengers; they're not super, just driven, like any other Bourne on the block.   After talky beginnings — hey, we saw the previous movies — director Joss Whedon serves up eye candy at every turn: an aircraft carrier doubling as an aircraft, giant metallic alien eels, and Hulk punching out a fighter jet. You almost don't notice the scattershot plot, or the bloated running time. The Avengers isn't The Dark Knight when it comes to cinematic art, but it's undeniably fun.

"May 3, 2012"," PLOT:  When Loki (Tom Hiddleston) escapes his exile, and steals the phenomenally powerful tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D, it’s up to Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to get it back before he unleashes an alien invasion that will enslave mankind.  REVIEW:  I’m not going to be the lone voice of dissent on THE AVENGERS. While I’m a tougher sell than many on Superhero flicks (although I’ve liked all the Marvel Studios films outside IRON MAN 2), I have to admit that I had an absolute blast with THE AVENGERS. From the first frame, to the very end of the closing credits, THE AVENGERS is a 142 minute roller-coaster ride that’s sure to please even the most die-hard fans, and just about everyone else- judging from the screening I saw this at. I’m really taken aback that THE AVENGERS works as well as it does, as I honestly thought grouping up all these heroes in one film was a bad idea. Sure- it works in the comics, but as a film- where would any of the franchises be able to go after this point? While that remains to be seen, mastermind Joss Whedon has proven himself to be the ideal choice to bring THE AVENGERS to the screen, with him having directed a Marvel film that surely ranks up there with the best (X2, and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS for me) they’ve done. What’s most impressive about Whedon’s work here is that he’s managed to give each character plenty to do, without making the film feel overwrought or episodic. For my money, that’s an almost Herculean feat, as this could have easily just been a series of bombastic action scenes. And while yes, there’s oodles of action, Whedon doesn’t skimp on character development for any of them- with each having something to overcome- not to mention the fact that he provides the audience with a couple of really good belly-laughs now and then to keep things from getting too melodramatic. Most significant are the arcs for The Hulk- with Banner being forced to confront his fear of the Hulk in order to do what he must, and Black Widow’s anguish over past misdeeds- with her having lots of “red ink” to make up for. Johannson and Ruffalo really are the standouts here- and both should get spinoff flicks of their own (provided the material is a high-calliber as what Whedon gives them here). While Norton was quite good in the surprisingly strong INCREDIBLE HULK, I was really taken with Ruffalo’s approach, and hopefully third time will prove to be the charm and he’ll stick with it. On the CGI side of things, significantly, The Hulk- for the first time really, looks 100% convincing, as the technology seems to have finally caught up with him. Meanwhile, all the other favourites get plenty to do, with Stark clashing badly with goody-two-shoes Captain America- and Thor battling with his own guilt over Loki’s decent into madness. As for Hawkeye- Whedon does something fantastic with him early on, but I won’t spoil it here. Even the lesser characters get some nice scenes, including a standout bit for Clark Gregg as the hapless Agent Coulson. I especially liked his fanboy man-crush on Captain America. Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury is probably the only one of the gang who comes off a bit one-dimensional, but then again- he’s pretty much used as The Avengers’ version of M, so that’s not a deal breaker. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER fans will also enjoy the fantastic Cobie Smulders as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill. Franchise stalwarts Stellan Skarsgaard, Gwyneth Paltrow, also turn up here and there, with Natalie Portman and Don Cheadle being the only two who seem to have been sidelined. On the villainous side, we get Tom Hiddleston as Loki- with him coming off almost as a super-powered Hannibal Lecter. Despite the fact that he’s already been defeated- single-handedly at that, by Thor in the last film- he’s still a credible villain, and Hiddleston is even better in the part than he was in the last go-round. As far as menace goes, it helps that he’s backed up by an army of aliens- and the last half-hour ramps up the pyrotechnics to near-TRANFORMERS level, albeit a cleverer, better-written iteration. Of course, if one were to nitpick, there are a few things about THE AVENGERS that aren’t perfect. The biggest thing for me is the fact that Whedon decided to shoot this flat, in 1:85:1. Considering the epic scale, it feels like a bit of a cheat not to have it in 2:35:1 (as all the other Marvel films have been)- but at least it looks different, so I’ll give him that. Perhaps in IMAX the 1:85:1 will come off better than it does on conventional screens. Also- the 3D, at least in the print I saw, is really nothing special, and if I see it again, you can bet it’ll be in 2D (3D really is a gimmick that needs to go away). I also thought the score by Alan Silvestri was essentially wallpaper, which is too bad, as none of the Marvel movies thus far have had really good scores (unlike the Nolan Batman’s). Then again, this is all nitpicking, and I really did have a great time with THE AVENGERS. It really is the best possible case scenario as far as this premise goes, and an amazing (almost too good) kick off to the summer of 2012. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel. ",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," This is it, oh true believers: the moment monumental Marvel Comics morphs â for real, for reel â from a scattered array of four-color offshoots and prequels to the biggest of the big leagues. And â ka-pow! â director Joss Whedon knocks it out of the universe with the aid of the mighty Thor's trusty Louisville Slugger hammer, MjÃ¶lnir. Whedon's script is true to Stan Lee's original vision: fast, furious action; layered characters with surprising arcs and surprisingly humanistic nuances; and a villain who's not only memorable (we've seen Tom Hiddleston's Loki before, though he provides so much more haughty fun here) but downright Shakespearean in his emerald-green vestments and seething, sibling bitterness. Fans of all that has come before (excluding Roger Corman's premature-ejaculation version of The Fantastic Four, natch) will weep tears of giddy joy at how crowd-pleasingly cohesive â and ridiculously fun â this film is. Without Whedon's guiding hand, it could easily have been otherwise. Amid a litany of subplots and an alien-invasion background (that pretty much stays where it belongs â in the background), what binds these characters together is what has kept them apart for so long: six superegos, fighting individually, often at odds with one another, sniping and taking verbal and superphysical potshots at one another. Chief asshat-in-residence is, as ever, Robert Downey Jr.'s billionaire/playboy/genius/philanthropist Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, but he's rivaled by the recently defrosted World War II supersoldier Captain America. Evans gives Cap a decidedly winning streak of white-bread, nonjingoistic patriotism; he's the fledgling superteam's decidedly old-school conscience. Superhero newcomer Ruffalo makes a serious impression as scientist Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, and while he lacks the same kind of time-bomb intensity Edward Norton brought to the role in 2008, he's nonetheless a smart casting choice and a great foil for Iron Man. Equal time and character development is (finally!) given to the assassins played by Johansson and Renner, Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury comes fully into his cunning, duplicitous own this time out. I'm hard-pressed to find any fault with Whedon's direction and story, although it should probably be noted that he still has a thing for weird alien monsters that don't quite live up to what you were expecting. In some alternate universe somewhere, Marvel monster master Steve Ditko is doing the CGI for this and all forthcoming Marvel Studios productions, and boy, would I like to see that. As it is, Marvel's The Avengers makes canny use (but not overuse) of its 3-D; Cap's star-spangled shield nearly takes the viewersâ heads off at several points. This is, in the end, the best of all possible Marvel Comics adaptations/iterations (so far). It's going to own the summer all the way to August and then some.

"May 3, 2012"," This middling movie is the zero sum of overwhelming expectations divided by underwhelming execution. ""The Avengers"" isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is it especially good, because, well, it doesn't have any stretch of the imagination. From the opening voice-over about dark forces gathering in the universe to the final smackdown in Manhattan, we've seen it all a dozen times before, including in the movies from which this Marvel Comics all-star team was assembled. The dark forces are from Asgard, the home planet of crash-landed demigod Thor (Chris Hemsworth). His evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals a cube of limitless energy called the Tesseract from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who rounds up a group of superheroes to retrieve it. The team includes playboy industrialist Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); time-traveling supersoldier Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans); and anger-impaired professor Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, new to the role), who is lured from his Calcutta hideaway by seductress Natalia Romanova, aka the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). That's a lot of subplots to juggle, and director Joss Whedon gives almost everyone (sorry, Hawkeye) a spotlight moment. Downey adds a welcome whiff of humanity to his tiresome hotshot routine, Evans gives the movie a moral center and Ruffalo is the best of the three recent Hulks. A machine this proficient is guaranteed to reap about a gazillion dollars, yet even fanboys will be hard-pressed to cite a memorable scene or even a line of dialogue from the table-setting first hour of this overlong movie. Weak wisecracks hide the lack of real chemistry between the characters, and this is yet another summer movie where pseudo 3-D effects were added after the fact. It's also another superhero movie in which a major city gets leveled, but we don't see a single civilian casualty. Granted, the fiery finale is good enough to leave the legions smiling. But when a movie is expected to lift an entire industry, ""good enough"" shouldn't be good enough.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," When Thor's adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleton, ""Thor"") opens a space portal to procure the Tesseract, a cube containing unlimited energy, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets into motion an initiative to gather together a team of super heroes collectively known as ""The Avengers."" Cowriter (with Zak Penn (""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" ""The Incredible Hulk"")/director Joss Whedon (TV's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') may not have made the most cinematic of the Marvel Super Hero films, but it may be the most fun. Marvel Studios' cunning strategy has paid off - by introducing each major player still directly in their control, not only did they fare surprisingly well with such characters as Thor and Captain America, but pulling them all into one movie was completely in their control. And with ""The Avengers,"" the whole proves even better than the sum of its parts. After a doomsday style beginning which sees a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility destroyed and its lead scientist, Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård, ""Thor"") and Avenger Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, ""Thor"") enslaved by Loki's mind control, S.H.I.E.L.D. begins to call in its Avengers in a humorous series of global retrievals. Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow, (Scarlett Johansson, coming into her own here), is humoring a bunch of Russian thugs who think they're torturing her when she gets her call to travel to India where Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, (Mark Ruffalo, taking over for Edward Norton and becoming MVP in the process), is doing charitable work as a medical doctor. Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor"") disrupts Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr., ""Iron Man"") play with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, ""Iron Man"") at his new Manhattan high rise to pick up where Selvig left off and Fury engages Captain America (Chris Evans, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") to get back the Tesseract. The former Steve Rogers is joined by the Black Widow and Iron Man and travels to Stuttgart where Loki has begun his plan to dominate Earth (only a Holocaust survivor stands up to him before he's captured). Loki is held in a Hulk-proof chamber on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, but he has a secret plan to use the Avengers against themselves. And it is this that makes the film so enjoyable - conflict. Penn and Whedon's script is peppered with put downs, as each Avenger has reason to dislike or be jealous of another. Layer over that the entire group's distrust of S.H.I.E.L.D. when they discover the agency plans to use the Tesseract for WMDs after it learned about other worlds (in ""Thor"") and there's a whole lot of finger pointing going on. There's also a lot of head bashing, which, with The Avengers, is like an elaborate game of rock-paper-scissors. Once they are under attack - first with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier being damaged, later when Loki calls forth an alien attack on Manhattan, the Avengers all prove themselves to each other stepping up to the plate and working as a team. In the latter going, the movie weakens, however. It is inevitable that comparison between the final attack on Manhattan and the destruction of Chicago in the third ""Transformers"" movie will be made because there are too many similarities, right down to the mechanical flying 'creatures' from Chitauri vs. ""Fallen's"" giant drill bit. If it weren't for all the wisecracking, Bay's last act would trump Whedon's. By far, Whedon's funniest effect is The Hulk, whose fist here is the equivalent of that city bus which so often takes someone out in a nanosecond edit. Ruffalo downplays the torment and gives a quiet, thoughtful performance. It remains unexplained, however, why The Hulk becomes a team player after his first appearance is anything but. Downey Jr.'s still the quickest on his feet in the quipping department, but Tony Stark does get to prove Steve Rogers wrong when his inorganic heart grows three sizes. Chris Evans doesn't mire Rogers in earnestness, a slippery slope, and has some fun reacting to a future he's barely gotten to know. Johansson rocks her leather jumpsuit and is given some emotional heft in her interplay with both Loki and Hawkeye. Chris Hemsworth has the toughest job, part apologist for his wayward brother, part too-good-for-the-rest-of-you-humans, neither offering much room for jokes. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is like Richard E. Grant crossed with Klaus Nomi and his performance is a hoot. Gregg has been wry connective tissue among the Marvel movies and here, his agent has his biggest hand in the action yet. Paltrow, notably costumed barefoot in cutoffs, leaves one wanting more of her peppery playfulness. 'How I Met Your Mother's' Cobie Smulders joins the cast as Agent Maria Hill, Fury's right hand, but she's not given enough to do to leave much of an impression. Watch for plenty of cameos including Harry Dean Stanton as a startled security guard and Stan Lee himself as an interviewed skeptic. Paul Bettany resumes the voice of Iron Man's Jarvis and Lou Ferrigno 'articulates' The Hulk. This edition is in 3D, which, once again, doesn't really add much but does plunge the World Security Council into such deep shadow it's hard to tell who Fury's talking to (Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter among them). But despite all the action and costumes and super heroes and aliens, Joss Whedon's Marvel outing doesn't succeed so much on flying fists and hurled hammers as it does on how its words are wielded.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe, from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you're out or at home. he fanboys were positively deafening when Marvel announced  that Joss Whedon, creator of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Angel,” would be  directing “The Avengers.” One cartoonist even joked that Whedon would try to  shoehorn a “Buffy”-esque analogy about the movie’s villain being more  metaphorical than literal, and that the studio would fire him before he shot a  single frame. What those people overlooked is that Whedon excels at writing for  an ensemble cast, and that he has other voices in his dialogue bag besides  snarky teen. If anything, he was an inspired choice to write and direct “The  Avengers”; the only real strike against him getting the job was that his last  feature film effort, the 2005 space western “Serenity,” tanked at the box  office. And that movie did indeed tank, but it was also pretty awesome. Once  people see “The Avengers,” all will be forgiven.  The story picks up where “Thor” left off. The top-secret  government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. has come into possession of the Tesseract, a  glowing cube with a renewable energy force. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the vengeful  brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), pledges the Tesseract to another alien race  in exchange for the right to rule Earth as part of their empire. When Loki  succeeds in obtaining the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L.  Jackson) reaches out to every, um, uniquely skilled fighter on his radar to  re-launch the Avengers Initiative, a long-forgotten plan to create a small army  of superheroes to fight against the unthinkable. Some are more receptive to the  idea than others; Natasha “Black Widow” Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve  “Captain America” Rogers (Chris Evans) were easy recruits, but Bruce “The  Incredible Hulk” Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Tony “Iron Man” Stark (Robert Downey  Jr.) were a little more difficult to convince. Worse, even after they all  agree to work together, they quickly realized how difficult it will be to  actually work together.  It is those scenes of discord where “The Avengers” finally  begins to soar. The first 30 minutes or so are necessary for the plot – the  exposition, the heist, the subsequent chase – but unremarkable. Once Whedon  gets the cast in the same room and gives them the chance to interact as people  rather than superheroes, the movie blossoms in a strangely wonderful way, one  where it’s easy to wish that they would keep talking, rather than ramping up  for the butt-kicking that is just around the corner. Indeed, until the  climactic battle sequence, the action plays second fiddle to the talking, and as  odd as that sounds for a superhero movie, it’s the right call. There are some issues with the story construction, though,  that are hard to overlook. Whedon clearly had moments he wanted to include,  like the smackdown between Iron Man and Thor, and a scene where even the good  guys are scared of Hulk. Individually, these scenes are fun; as a whole, they  create some peaks and valleys in terms of tempo. The end result is a movie that  may not be as consistent as “Iron Man,” but contains several moments that are  without a doubt the most thrilling and funniest moments in Marvel movie history.  We will provide no spoilers, but we’ll say this: Hulk is responsible for two of  them. You expect good acting from a cast like this, and the leads  do not disappoint, but the most pleasant surprise is watching Tom Hiddleston  transform Loki from the meek schemer in “Thor” into a venomous powder keg of  ego run amok. Mark Ruffalo may not have tremendous range, but he’s very  likable, and with all due respect to the dedication to Method that is Edward  Norton, replacing Norton with Ruffalo was a smart move. If anyone is limited  here, it’s Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Nick Fury at low speed from start to  finish. Johansson and Jeremy Renner are clearly not on the same level as the other  Avengers, but they get a ‘B’ story as a means of bumping up their screen time. Whedon  knew that balance was the key to making the movie work, and wisely, he didn’t  achieve balance through marginalization in one area and overcompensation in  another. Everyone gets good lines, and everyone gets to kick ass.  It’s unfortunate that “The Avengers” doesn’t flow better as  a whole, because Whedon really did some extraordinary work here in spots. He may  have gotten the balance right, but he neglected the rhythm, and it costs him  here and there. Mind you, these lapses in timing will quickly be forgotten when  one of those bring-the-house-down moments arrives, but that doesn’t mean that  they didn’t happen. He may have nailed the hard parts and brought the funny by  the pound, but there is no denying that as entertaining as this movie is, it  could have been even better. The  bonus features to ""The Avengers"" are the typical stuff - audio  commentary, deleted and extended scenes, featurettes, gag reel - but every one  of them is excellent, and they even threw in a great short film (""Item  47,"" starring Lizzy Caplan) to boot. Joss Whedon does the audio commentary  by himself, but he's a writer, so he's never short of words. The most  interesting stuff is in the deleted/extended scenes, which include an alternate  opening and ending that beefs up Cobie Smulders' screen time considerably.  There is also an extended, pre-CGI fight scene where Black Widow and Hawkeye  take out what feels like 300 aliens.

"May 3, 2012"," You may occasionally encounter (as I have, a few times in the past months) a walking relic of an earlier era of pop-cultural fandom who wonders if they have, at last, made another movie out of that fondly recalled British spy series from the 1960s. “They” have not, and those poor souls who cherish old daydreams of Diana Rigg in leather will have to console themselves with images of Scarlett Johansson in a black bodysuit.  So “The Avengers,” which has been foreshadowed by post-credits teasers in (deep breath), “Captain America,” “Thor,” “The Incredible Hulk” (the one with Edward Norton) and both “Iron Man” pictures, is not without its pleasures. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, this movie revels in the individuality of its mighty, mythical characters, pinpointing insecurities that are amplified by superhuman power and catching sparks that fly when big, rough-edged egos (and alter egos) collide. The best scenes are not the overblown, skull-assaulting action sequences — which add remarkably little that will be fresh or surprising to devotees of the “Transformers” franchise — but the moments in between, when the assembled heroes have the opportunity to brag, banter, flirt and bicker.  The secret of “The Avengers” is that it is a snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else, that something else being a giant A.T.M. for Marvel and its new studio overlords, the Walt Disney Company. At times — when various members of a game and nimble cast amble in and out of the glassy, metallic chambers of a massive flying aircraft carrier, cracking wise, rolling eyes and occasionally throwing a punch — the movie has some of the easygoing charm of “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s great, late western in which John Wayne, Angie Dickinson, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson did a lot of talking on their way to a big and not-all-that-interesting shootout.

Directed by genre geek Joss Whedon, whose pulp sensibilities worked magic on TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Serenity, The Avengers is a slickly packaged, effects-driven smashup. Watch it in 3-D if you feel the need to see the Mighty Thor's hammer flyin' at ya (and if you want to suffer the dimming effects of those cumbersome tinted glasses), but everyday 2-D on a decent-size screen with surround sound is really good enough. Good enough to watch Robert Downey Jr. deliver his knee-jerk wiseguy one-liners, good enough to watch Scarlett Johansson clench her brow as she strides purposefully toward the camera in Ninja garb, good enough to catch Mark Ruffalo, the third actor in nine years to play the brainy Dr. Banner, talking with trepidation about ""the other guy"" he shares psych-space with. So Loki (""I am burdened with glorious purpose!"") gets hold of the Tesseract and hypnotizes SHIELD agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), while Loki's Asgardian sibling, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), joins up with the rest of the Marvel crew — including the ridiculously jut-jawed Captain America (Chris Evans) — to hash out a plan. It is the ""Avengers Initiative,"" and it is being run by espionage agency SHIELD's top gun, Nick Fury. Samuel L. Jackson — sporting an eye patch, a Vandyke beard, and an uncanny ability to deliver his lines as if they were straight from a comic book's word balloons — is Fury, charged with assembling the misfit gang of turbocharged neurotics to figure out how to thwart the Norse nemesis. The figuring-out part dissolves into name-calling — Downey's Ironic Man and Evans' Captain America don't hit it off, for one thing — and then into a gigantic Transformers-esque free-for-all in and around New York's Grand Central Station, where commuters are inconvenienced by Loki's legions. If these last 40 minutes or so of The Avengers evoke the real-life devastation of 9/11, this is probably inevitable, whether or not it's intentional: Shots of the NYPD and National Guard rushing here and there as blazing office towers collapse and citizens flee . It's kind of hard not to trigger that connection. But I don't think Whedon is really going there. The chaos and carnage here is just a pumped-up take on a tradition that harks back to Godzilla, and harks back, of course, to the Marvel comics from which all these heros originally sprang.",POSITIVE

"May 3, 2012"," Marvel’s The Avengers is awesomeness squared. It’s the apotheosis of the modern age of comic-book movies, the epitome of everything that the Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and Thor movies were and were trying to be. It is grand and geeky and rollicking good fun on an epic scale, and it gets practically everything right and very little wrong. It is, in a word, about the best Avengers movie that anyone could reasonably have hoped for or expected, which is all the more extraordinary when you think about how easily, almost inevitably, it could have been a failure, if not a disaster. There is nothing transcendent or revolutionary about it. It is not a new kind of superhero movie — not the Star Wars or Fellowship of the Ring or even the Avatar of its genre. Some of the moves are overly familiar, including a climactic gambit telegraphed halfway through the film, followed by a plot convenience that was tired when George Lucas trotted it out at the end of one of the Star Wars prequels. If The Avengers isn’t necessarily the best superhero movie ever made, it is unquestionably the most superhero movie ever made — and, in that capacity, it is more than well-made enough to take comic-book entertainment to unprecedented levels. We might possibly see a better film later this summer, but if there’s a more enjoyable popcorn action movie this year than The Avengers, I’ll eat my hat. Historically, movie superheroes have been sealed off from one another, as if they each lived in their own world, one hero per world. In the comics, popular heroes have always inhabited their own monthly titles, but they’ve also gotten together with one another (and with less heavy hitters) in group books for larger-scaled adventures: Justice League on the DC side, with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and so forth, and Avengers on the Marvel side, with Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and so forth. Even Spider-Man and Daredevil have occasionally been drawn into the Avengers’ orbit, though they haven't been joiners. There is logic to this. When the entire city — or the nation, or even the world — faces an existential crisis, how likely is it that Green Lantern or Iron Man will take a day off, leaving it to Superman or Thor to save the day? But these group efforts are easier to coordinate in the comics than on the big screen. What’s unprecedented about The Avengers is not only that Marvel managed to put all these heroes together on the screen, but that they pulled it off in continuity with existing franchises: this Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.); this Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans); this Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Through six coordinated films, Marvel Studios has crafted a cinematic universe of overlapping franchises, much like the comic books. Along with the familiar costumed heroes, Marvel’s big-screen universe is held together by Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury and Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson — the men behind S.H.I.E.L.D., the homeland security and espionage agency that worries about existential crises on a national and global scale, and has been working on leveraging the logic of a superhero team for the past several films. There’s also the treacherous Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), previously seen in Thor, and a cosmic MacGuffin called the Tesseract (known to comic fans as the Cosmic Cube), which powered the Nazis’ supertechnology in Captain America, and in the hands of someone like Loki could easily power a global existential crisis. Even the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) have been established, in Iron Man 2 and (just barely) Thor, respectively. Only Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is new to us: This is now the Hulk’s third big-screen appearance in the last decade, always played by a different actor. All of them have done a good job: Eric Bana in the 2003 Ang Lee film and Edward Norton in the 2008 film directed by Louis Leterrier. But Ruffalo makes the most of his wild-card status, combining self-deprecating wit and intimidating self-confidence in an unpredictable package. (The one element of Hulk continuity is small-screen Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who voices the computer-animated Hulk in the 2008 film and The Avengers.) This is a lot — an awful lot — for any filmmaker to juggle. So many characters, so many tones — Tony Stark’s quicksilver screwball banter; Thor’s pseudo-Shakespearean grandeur; Steve Rogers’ old-school uprightness, etc. Joss Whedon, best known as the creative force behind “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly,” as well as the big-screen “Firefly” spin-off Serenity, is probably as qualified as anyone to write and direct an ensemble like this, and he manages to capture the essences of each of the previous franchises in short bursts, then blends them together into something new. Gwyneth Paltrow is as delightful and down-to-earth as ever in her brief appearances as Pepper Potts opposite Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark. An elderly gentleman in a crowd in Stuttgart, Germany, with only two lines of dialogue, provides a stirring example of Greatest Generation-era dignity and courage in the face of tyrannical evil, providing the best possible context for Cap’s persona and worldview. Agent Coulson’s sweetly comic fanboy adoration of Cap also helps establish the supersoldier’s legendary historical milieu — as well as sending up the Comic-Con crowd thronging the theaters. I am not, need it be said, holding myself above it all. When Thor brings his hammer crashing down on Cap’s shield, I am sharing the pure geek bliss. Yes, the heroes square off against each other as well as against the bad guys. That’s a staple of Marvel storytelling going back to Marvel’s team-up titles, which seemingly invariably pitted the heroes against each other, often due to some forced misunderstanding, before joining forces to save the day. Of course, the heroes have to save the day. But, for devotees, the far more important question is the one of ranking: Who would win? Thor or Iron Man? Iron Man or the Hulk? Hulk or Thor? All of those scenarios play out in The Avengers, as the characters jostle against one another not only physically, but verbally and personally. In any verbal exchange, Tony obviously has an edge, and the movie has a lot of fun with his quick wit as he pegs nearly every other character with an apropos movie-reference nickname, and even goes toe-to-toe, sans armor, with Loki. Every character that matters gets a chance to shine, and if the movie doesn’t dig deeply into any of its characters the way one might hope for from Whedon, it points to the vagaries of politics and power in ways that few superhero films outside the Nolan Batman films seem interested in doing. When I first saw the film, I suspected the tension between Iron Man’s jadedness and Cap’s idealism might be unbalanced in favor of the former. Subsequent viewings, though, have confirmed for me that while the world may be a more cynical place than Cap is comfortable with, the story is as much about Tony’s ongoing redemption as Cap’s ongoing education. Tony’s smug Me Generation egocentrism and Cap’s Greatest Generation sense of duty and rectitude each get under each other’s skin — and while Tony almost always gets in the best licks, it’s Cap who cuts deepest: “The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.“ Tony bats this aside with a glib quip, but clearly the rebuke tells — and when a moment of truth comes when a sacrifice play may be necessary, Cap’s words give Tony the push he needs to be more than he is normally wont to be. On the other hand, Whedon — an unbeliever — allows Cap a throwaway one-liner about God that’s kind of wonderful, and that resonates nicely with that elderly gentleman’s response to Loki. Loki’s pitch is that human beings are cattle who are most comfortable simply submitting to someone who will offer them some semblance of peace. “In the end,” he says, “you will always kneel.” The answer he gets is not a repudiation of kneeling, but a repudiation of kneeling to the likes of Loki. In the annals of anonymous citizens confronting supervillains in comic-book movies, this brief, quiet moment in a noisily frenetic film is my new favorite.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," How will the retro patriotism of Captain America mesh with the flippant cynicism of Iron Man? Could the brooding Hulk bond with the regal brawn of Thor? How could anybody balance the inter-connection of back stories, the clash of personalities, the need for shared screen time, the utter necessity of building up a villain capable of putting fear in this fearsome foursome and then some? But it does work, because Joss Whedon (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer”) brought his A-game to “The Avengers.” It works because he never loses sight of the fragile humanity of the characters, even in their special effects brawls. It works because somebody finally got The Hulk’s blend of rage, guilt and bull-in-a-chandelier-shop fun right. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has created S.H.I.E.L.D., his super-secret superhero agency, mainly on paper. But when his minions recover the magical cube, the Tesseract, from where Captain America buried it last summer, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and The Other plot Loki’s vengeful conquest of the Earth. Fury has to get the band together, get them to work as a team. In an ensemble piece, Downey’s brilliant touch with the throw-away put-down is showcased to its best effect. He calls Thor “Point Break” (a surfer-Patrick Swayze look-alike joke) and “Shakespeare in the Park,” and asks “Does your mother know you weareth her drapes?” Loki turns a a couple of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents — the bow-and-arrow-wielding Hawk (Jeremy Renner) and Professor Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) into his flunkies, and sets about creating a means for an army of aliens to show up and enslave humanity. Hiddleston grows into the part that seemed like a weak link in “Thor,” and makes the most of this guy’s megalomania and bad guy bravado. “You are MADE to be ruled. Kneel before me,” he orders one and all. “It is your natural state.” The real fun here is in the fractious nature of the superhero team — Iron Man sniping at and brawling with Thor, Iron Man’s quarrels with Captain America, the “issues” between the assassins Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) and Hawk, and the “Serenity Now” ethos that Bruce Banner embraces lest “The Other Guy” (The Hulk) break out and make a mess of things. Ruffalo gives Banner/The Hulk a wonderful, almost passive “Nobody really should mess with me” pose, and he can trade wisecracks with the best of them. Whedon manages to give a staggering number of characters their “moments,” from Clark Gregg, the long-suffering agent whose thankless job it is to ride herd on the superheroes, to Gwyneth Paltrow’s sexy paramour/assistant to Tony Stark, Pepper Potts. She’s all cut-off jeans and come hither come-ons in their scenes together. As you might expect from a movie with this many characters and that many zingers, “Avengers” is entirely too long and entirely too chatty. The 3D adds nothing to it, and we lose the urgency every time we lose track of the menace and the villain. But Whedon has managed a feat akin to last summer’s “Thor,” finding the fun in what should, by any rights, be an exhausted genre. “Avengers” isn’t deep (Yes, we really should all work together.) and it doesn’t reinvent the comic book movie. But it is fun, and if it’s an indicator of the season of cinema to follow, this summer is going to be epic.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," One of the weapons Marvel used in its climb to comic-book dominance was a willingness to invent new characters at a dizzying speed. There are so many Marvel universes, indeed, that some superheroes do not even exist in one another's worlds, preventing gridlock. The Avengers however do share the same time and space continuum, although in recent years, they've been treated in separate, single-superhero movies. One assumes the idle Avengers follow the exploits of the employed ones on the news. ""The Avengers,"" much awaited by Marvel comics fans, assembles all of the Avengers in one film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. This is like an all-star game, or the chef's sampling menu at a fancy restaurant. What always strikes me is how different their superpowers are. Iron Man (Robert Downey) is just an ordinary guy until he's wearing his super-suit. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) swings a mighty hammer. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) wields a bow with arrows so powerful they can bring down alien spacecraft. The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is a mild-mannered guy until he gets angry, and then he expands into a leaping, bounding green muscle man who can rip apart pretty much anything. Captain America (Chris Evans) has a powerful and versatile shield. Then there's Natasha (Scarlett Johansson), aka the Black Widow. After seeing the film, I discussed her with movie critics from Brazil and India, and we were unable to come up with a satisfactory explanation for her superpowers; it seems she is merely a martial artist with good aim with weapons. We decided maybe she and Hawkeye aren't technically superheroes, but just hang out in the same crowd. When I see these six together, I can't help thinking of the champions at the Westminster Dog Show. You have breeds that seem completely different from one another (Labradors, poodles, boxers, Dalmatians), and yet they're all champions.  The reason they're brought together in ""The Avengers"" is that the Earth is under threat by the smirking Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adopted brother, who controls the Tesseract, a pulsing cube of energy that opens a gateway to the universe; through it, he plans to attack Earth with his fleet of reptile-looking monster-machines. It goes completely unexplained where Loki now resides, how these dragon-machines are manufactured, and so on. Both Loki and Thor are obscurely related to the gods of Norse mythology, as we know from last year's ""Thor,"" but let's not drift into theology. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sends out a call to the Avengers to team up and meet this threat. He runs SHIELD, the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, which is all I know about it. He's headquartered on a gigantic aircraft carrier that's also a hovercraft and can become invisible. By bringing the Avengers together, he of course reopens ancient rivalries (i.e, my hammer can beat your shield), until they learn the benefits of Teamwork, which is discussed in speeches of noble banality. So you see this is sort of an educational film, teaching the Avengers to do what was so highly valued on my first-grade report card: the concept of Working Well With Others. These films are all more or less similar, and ""The Avengers"" gives us much, much more of the same. There must be a threat. The heroes must be enlisted. The villain must be dramatized. Some personality defects are probed. And then the last hour or so consists of special effects in which large mechanical objects engage in combat that results in deafening crashes and explosions and great balls of fire. Much of this battle takes place in midtown Manhattan, where the neatest sequences involve Loki's ginormous slithering, undulating snake-lizard-dragon machine, which seems almost to have a mind of its own and is backed up by countless snakelings. At one point, an Avenger flies into the mouth of this leviathan and penetrates its entire length, emerging at the business end. You won't see that in ""The Human Centipede."" ""Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms,"" predicts critic David Edelstein in New York magazine, confirming something I had vaguely suspected about them. If he is correct, it's time for desperately needed movies to re-educate nerds in the joys of sex. ""The Avengers"" is done well by Joss Whedon, with style and energy. It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism.",POSITIVE
"May 3, 2012"," It may not have a number in its title, but The Avengers is still the most anticipated sequel of the summer. Marvel has built its entire movie strategy on the idea that this will be the culmination of efforts going back to Iron Man in 2008, and movies like Thor and Iron Man 2 often seemed like they were working as hard at setting up The Avengers as they were at telling their own stories. If The Avengers failed to deliver, it could retroactively taint the movies that came before it. Luckily, then, The Avengers doesn’t fail. In terms of character, action, special effects, dialogue and humor, The Avengers delivers pretty handily. Writer-director Joss Whedon does such a good job of throwing together these various superheroes and supporting characters and having them interact with and/or punch each other that it takes a long time to notice that the plot is completely uninteresting. The movie’s villain is a familiar face, Asgardian trickster Loki (Tom Hiddleston), half-brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and main antagonist of last year’s Thor movie. Hiddleston is good at being devious, but having the villain who was bested by one hero show up to take on six heroes seems a little anticlimactic. Loki is the harbinger of an alien invasion that drives the movie’s big action climax, but the aliens are vaguely defined characters led by a shadowy figure who’s only revealed in the post-credits scene that sets up the next Avengers movie (the folks at Marvel are never content to let a story actually end). The plot may not be compelling, but as long as it puts the world in peril, it does its job, since that requires S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to gather the world’s greatest heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, ably stepping in for Edward Norton) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Thor doesn’t even show up until about 40 minutes into the movie, but he too ends up a member of the team, as does Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), although he spends more than half the movie as Loki’s mind-controlled slave. With all those big personalities in the mix, not to mention Iron Man’s secretary/love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and perpetually put-upon Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), it’d be easy for some of them to get lost, but Whedon manages to throw in significant character development for most of the main players, and characters like Thor and the Hulk, who had trouble carrying their own movies in the past, fare much better in an ensemble setting. Whedon understands that one of the core appeals of the Avengers is the way that the team members don’t quite fit together or get along, and the squabbling is as enjoyable to watch as the action (plus it allows for a variety of hero-on-hero beatdowns). Whedon has always been fond of genre deconstructionism, in works like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly and the recent The Cabin in the Woods, but here he plays things completely straight, and while he does it very well, it’s also a little disappointing. Whedon’s personal style shines through in the snappy dialogue, but otherwise he’s just another cog in the Marvel machine, directing with no more distinction than Jon Favreau or Joe Johnston. The Avengers is rousing blockbuster entertainment that goes down easy, but like all of Marvel’s recent efforts, its main function seems to be to string audiences along for the next episode. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ...",POSITIVE
"May 2, 2012","Creating a script that not only lives up to the hype, but fulfills and even exceeds the expectations of fans is no easy task, but Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn have done so - and in a manner that does not give short shrift to any of the major characters.",POSITIVE
"May 2, 2012","  Even if you’re frustrated by the relentless calculation of Marvel Studios’ plan for world cinema domination, fed up by the shameless way the studio used several of its earlier, at times pro forma superhero movies to promote this one, even if you don’t particularly like comic-book adaptations, this film just might make a believer of you.  That’s because, just like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the über-calculating director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who calls on the Avengers when the fate of the world is at stake, Marvel has gone to its own version of the A-team when the franchise needed it most. That would be Joss Whedon.  As screenwriter, sharer of story credit with Zak Penn and director, Whedon is the key reason why this $220-million behemoth of a movie is smartly thought out and executed with verve and precision. It may be overly long at two hours, 23 minutes, but so much is going on you might not even notice.  Whedon’s biggest success, creating TV’s “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” was nowhere near this scale. But he is a third-generation television writer who was nominated for an Oscar for co-writing”Toy Story,” and he’s got an innate gift for bringing stories like this to life with the energy and intelligence that should be popular entertainment’s birthright but rarely is.  For starters, the film’s numerous action set pieces, including a whopper of an alien invasion of Manhattan that was so enormous it had to be shot in Cleveland, are crisply done with minimal dead time and few perfunctory elements.  But what really makes the difference in “The Avengers” is the emphasis on character as the film’s storytelling core. Many of the superheroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), have had features of their own, but both what they say and how they say it is a step up here.  Because Whedon’s dialogue is less glib than the Marvel norm, with lines written as if they meant something, not to mention often being genuinely funny, the total effect brings the film closer to the tone of the original 1960s books, which revolutionized the comic world by presenting superheroes who were deeply involving, troubled individuals.  It is part of Whedon’s style here to throw the audience into the middle of the action, then backtrack to bring viewers up to speed. “The Avengers” begins with some nefarious aliens gleefully writing Earth’s obituary (“The humans, what can they do but burn?”), and the bad news that the Tesseract, a tiny but enormously powerful extraterrestrial energy source, has started to act up.  That acting up opens a portal to the other side of space, and who should arrive on our planet but the Norse god Loki (the exemplary Tom Hiddleston), up to no good. “I am Loki of Asgard, burdened with glorious purpose,” he says by way of introduction before killing everyone in sight and using his scepter to turn ace S.H.I.E.L.D. archer Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), into his brainwashed tool.  Loki’s goal, as it turns out, is to make a deal with those shadowy aliens and end up ruling we feeble earthlings, a species he feels is ripe for the picking. “The unspoken truth is that you yearn for subjugation, you are made to be ruled,” is the way he puts it. What a diplomat.  Talk like this causes Fury (whose organization is not called Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division for nothing) to declare that a state of war exists and mobilize agents like the deadly Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) into full combat mode.  To save Earth, Fury is fully aware, his S.H.I.E.L.D. troops will have to be supplemented by a handful of superheroes he hopes will coalesce into a fighting machine called the Avengers. Which allows Whedon to enliven the film with some”Seven Samurai”-inspired sequences where legendary fighting heroes are importuned to join the cause.  First asked is mild-mannered Bruce Banner, now occupied doing good deeds in the slums of Calcutta but once known and feared as the Incredible Hulk. The doc is willing to help, but is understandably worried about “what happens if ‘the other guy’ says no.” The talented Mark Ruffalo is the latest in a long line of Hulk portrayers, and perhaps the best.  Captain America, asleep for 70 years and wondering why anyone bothered to wake him, is also asked, as is Loki’s brother Thor and the ever-acerbic Tony Stark/Iron Man. He wears a Black Sabbath T-shirt and has a sarcastic attitude toward his would-be colleagues, nicknaming Thor “Point Break” and noting that Banner has “breathtaking anger management issues.”  Stark cracking wise is just one example of the problem confronting S.H.I.E.L.D.: As creatures of supreme ego, the superheroes don’t work and play well with others. More than that, they genuinely don’t like one another, and hearing Captain America and Iron Man verbally rip into each other is pleasantly convincing and helps makes the hero-on-hero battles that periodically erupt all the more involving.  If, as “The Avengers” depressingly underlines, comic-book movies are the ultimate expression of today’s Hollywood zeitgeist the way, say, “Gone With the Wind” or”Casablanca”epitomized an earlier time, it’s good to at least have them done this well. If you have to watch “a handful of freaks, isolated and unbalanced” saving the planet for the umpteenth time, you could do a whole lot worse.",POSITIVE

"May 2, 2012"," Geek boys and girls, you can start rejoicing. The Avengers delivers the goods in a big, unforgettable way. It's exhilarating action moviemaking at its best. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow come together in director Joss Whedon's damn near miraculous The Avengers to kick off the summer movie season on a high note that is going to be tough to beat. When people speak in the future of the ultimate blockbuster movies, The Avengers will be atop many a list, as will—unfortunately—The Smurfs (I have little faith in the future of humanity). There's a major balancing act going on here, and Whedon somehow manages to pull it off. None of the superheroes get shortchanged. Heck, even Nick Fury gets a significant story arc. Everybody gets screen time worthy of their cinematic greatness and, ultimately, their teaming together against the powerfully bad forces of the universe has true substance and soul. The last thing I was expecting in this Marvel hero summit meeting was soul, but there is plenty of it. The baddie who winds up bringing these forces together would be Loki (Tom Hiddleston), last seen making his brother's life a living hell in last year's Thor. Loki has gotten his hands on a crazy energy orb that can also provide a gateway from another universe. All means of bad guys plan to use the gateway to come down and conquer Earth, with Loki, still furious over what Thor and his daddy did to him, as the ringmaster. This pisses off Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to no end, so he decides to bring the planet's super-entities together for a cage match to end all cage matches. Captain America (Chris Evans), having just awakened from a mega-sleep, is hanging out at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters doing severe damage to punching bags. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is working on his Stark headquarters building in Manhattan, concentrating on stuff that makes his life better rather than saving the world. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton, who replaced Eric Bana), is roaming the Earth trying to keep his bad boy in check, while Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns from Asgard because he has unfinished business with that troublemaking sibling, Loki. The individual films that have been released in the last few years wind up providing a nice backdrop for what happens in this one, although viewing all of them is probably not necessary to enjoy The Avengers. The movie stands on its own. I will say, having enjoyed both previous Hulk efforts (Ang Lee's misunderstood and underappreciated first try, Hulk, and the more streamlined second effort, The Incredible Hulk), I think the Hulk in this film will certainly emerge as the favorite. Ruffalo takes a great approach to the role, and the CGI creation does a nice job incorporating his image. Hulk action is among the film's best offerings, especially when he squares off against space eels that look like squirmy cousins of H.R. Giger's aliens. While the film's ultimate cage match finale (the cage being Manhattan) is certainly its high point, the intergroup squabbling between the Avengers is top-notch entertainment. Before they join forces, they all have bones to pick with each other, most notably when Thor and Hulk have a smackdown. Apparently, Hulk holds a grudge after their little dust-up. Whedon, whose sole cinematic directorial effort had been the enjoyable sci-fi Serenity, certainly knows how to mix together great action effects with solid humor. There are major laugh-out-loud moments in this movie. Let it also be said that he, his screenwriters and his editor have pulled off a major feat in making all of these characters register with strong senses of purpose and depth. Downey Jr. has great fun expanding upon Stark's wiseass image, taunting and lampooning all of his cohorts (I especially liked his attempts to get all up in Banner's business). Evans provides a nice, old school moralistic anchor, and Hemsworth's Thor brings that otherworldly, godlike element. And Hulk ... well, you're just going to love him (Hey, fans of the Green One ... Lou Ferrigno, TV's original Hulk, does, once again, provide the screen incarnation's voice). In the midst of all this, the story affords quality time to Scarlett Johansson's leather-clad badass Black Widow and Jeremy Renner's arrow-slinging Hawkeye. I came into the viewing with little interest in their characters, but emerged from the screening liking them a lot. As for the 3-D, it's surprisingly good, considering that it is retrofitted. The decision to make this 3-D apparently came during postproduction, but it comes off as something always intended for 3-D. There are a couple of blurry moments but, overall, the 3-D enhances rather than distracts. As usual with these Marvel films, stay for the credits because a big hint is dropped regarding further adventures. All of the major heroes, with the exception of Hulk, are currently slated for individual films before the next Avengers. Actually, that could wind up being a problem, because The Avengers is better than any of the individual Marvel hero films. (It's even better than the Spider-Man films.) They need to turn out the solo movies fast, because I'm ready for the next Avengers chapter right now. I'm spoiled!",POSITIVE

It's what the world needs most. When the chips are down - when times are tough. When there's no one we can turn to and all hope seems lost. No, I'm not talking about an elite team of superheroes brought together by an ultra-secret intelligence agency to fight a common enemy. I'm talking about comfort food. We all need it sometimes. And if there were a film version of comfort food, ""The Avengers"" - Joss Whedon's glossy, super-budgeted realization of the Marvel heroes - would certainly be it. When asked about ""comfort food movies"", I tend to say ""it's as good as you could hope for"". And that's what ""The Avengers"" is. It's not a ""Superman"", a ""Dark Knight"", a ""Spider-man 2"". Ironically, it's not even as revelatory as ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". It's not something that's going to change your view of superhero movies. Or even something that might stick with you past the closing credits. In fact, perhaps most ironically, for a movie about superheroes, this ""Avengers"" is not about taking risks. It's about delivering. And Joss Whedon knows how to deliver - possibly better than anyone else could have. The world's luckiest fanboy knows his audience because he is one of them. And he's packed enough nerd-tastic moments into the film to keep a smile on any fan's face. ""The Tesseract has awoken"", the film begins. Those of you paying attention during last year's ""Thor"" will remember the Tesseract as a magical blue cube that tends to open portals between worlds (usually Earth and Thor's Asgard). In ""Avengers"", Thor's evil brother Loki (did you really think he died at the end of ""Thor""?) intends to use the Tesseract to unleash an alien army to destroy Earth - which he then intends to rule...I think. The full extent of his plan is not quite clear. But Tom Hiddleston gives just enough of a crazy-behind-the-eyes performance as Loki to keep things interesting. Less interesting is the amount of exposition it takes for Mr. Whedon (who co-wrote the script with Zak Penn) to get the plot going. In order to defeat Loki, Mr. Whedon must ""get the band together"". And he has just the man to do it: yes, after being relegated to post-credits teasers in each previous film, Samuel L. Jackson finally gets to unleash his Fury. His Nick Fury, that is. As the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. - the super-secret agency, led by a cloaked-in-shadows Council, that started The Avengers Initiative - Fury rounds up some familiar faces (Iron Man, Captain America), some not so familiar faces (Black Widow, Hawkeye) and one face that's slightly updated (Mark Ruffalo, taking the reins of Bruce Banner/The Hulk). As is typical, the Hulk is a big, fake-ish CGI spectacle, but Mr. Ruffalo succeeds where Eric Bana and Edward Norton floundered. His Banner is a tortured soul with the weight of his secret firmly entrenched behind his every line. You believe that he has lived with the Hulk inside him, and that he could be an asset to the team. I wouldn't want to see another ""Hulk"" movie, but I would give Mr. Ruffalo the job of updating the old Bill Bixby TV show. And that's high praise. As ninja assassin Black Widow (and Mr. Whedon's ""Buffy"" surrogate), Scarlett Johansson is given little to do except fill out a catsuit and perform martial arts. Likewise, Jeremy Renner is underutilized as super-marksman Hawkeye. The film has the most fun with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans). Naturally, Mr. Downey hogs all the good lines, and wastes none of them, while Mr. Evans' Captain proves to be the grounding force in the film. He projects just the right amount of noblilty without lapsing into camp or caricature. As Mr. Whedon has proven, he excels with ensembles (""Buffy"", ""Firefly""), and he manages to give each character some small arc to go through. But ""The Avengers"" is less about character development than it is about the face-offs: Iron Man vs. Thor; Captain America vs. Iron Man; The Hulk vs. pretty much everyone. It's all here. And it all ends in an extended climactic battle over the streets of Manhattan that, like the film, is as good as you could hope for, even if that's a bit ho-hum. In a post-9/11 world, a building can be hit, but it can't fall. And New Yorkers can be in peril, but they can't be seen running from plumes of smoke. This is an ""Avengers"" movie, after all. It's not meant to provoke. It can be loud, snarky, even serious, but above all, it must be comfortable.",POSITIVE

The Avengers kicks ass. It's a loud, brash spectacle that blows up as many things as a Transformers outing but without the same grinding sense of soulless robotic monotony. For years, Marvel has been building to this movie, painstakingly introducing many of The Avengers' key players in what has amounted to five prequels: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America. If some of those chapters seemed a little thin when viewed as stand-alones, The Avengers has redeemed their existence. This movie has the potential to revitalize the superhero movie genre... or kill it. The Avengers has raised the bar to a level where the more ""traditional"" approach of having a single superhero tangle with a supervillain or two may no longer be enough. Once characters like Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye have become involved in an epic story of this sort, how can they go back to being regular superheroes? When something has been dialed up to an ""11,"" isn't there an inherent letdown to turning it back to a ""7""?
 
I doubt there's a comic book fan alive who won't be walking on Cloud Nine when exiting a theater playing The Avengers. In Joss Whedon, the producers found the perfect director: a man who knows the material and his audience in equal measure. For Avengers fans, this is a home run. For the ""average"" movie-goer, who may not know the difference between the superhero group and the spy ring featuring Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg, this is at worst a triple. Finding faults is a little like picking nits, although they are there. The first hour can at times seem sluggish as there's a fair amount of setup and exposition that needs to be endured. And there are times during the final battle when the special effects take over and things edge toward Bay's fetishistic fascination with hardware over everything else. Yet those are isolated moments in a jaw-droppingly intense 50-minute battle royale (with cheese). Every hero gets his/her time to shine, although some shine more brightly than others.
 
The threat that brings six superheroes together is posed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the adopted brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has broken into SHIELD headquarters, brainwashed Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and stolen the Tesseract, an uber-powerful glowing blue cube. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to stop the Norse diety, but fails. Under threat of a planetary catastrophe, Fury recruits Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans), and sends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to bring in Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). Thor makes his appearance when he learns that his brother is up to no good. After a major battle, Loki is captured, but he appears perfectly content to be held in close confinement on SHIELD's hovercraft. He's biding his time while his underlings work to open a wormhole that will allow an alien race to attack Earth. Poor Manhattan is to be Ground Zero for this interplanetary apocalypse.
 
The core appeal of The Avengers has been (and always will be) the gathering of heroes. The comic book was initially created in the early '60s as Marvel's answer to DC's Justice League (which banded together Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, and others). The movie fulfills fans' wet dreams of having a handful of major Marvel superheroes come together in one forum. Whedon provides one of the time-honored occurrences of ""crossover"" comic books: before the heroes band together to take on the bad guys, they fight each other. So we have Iron Man going at it against Thor, with a little Captain America thrown in for good measure. Hulk and Thor have smackdown. And so forth. Until Nick Fury gives a little pep talk, egos trump heroism. One of the most interesting themes of The Avengers relates to how individuals comfortable with being the biggest and baddest kids on the block learn to work with others with similar capabilities. It's like when a high school valedictorian finds himself in a class full of valedictorians at Harvard.
 
Ultimately, The Avengers is all about action. The main storyline is pretty basic. The most impressive thing Whedon does with the screenplay is to provide all the characters sufficient screen time and keep the movie from becoming a runaway special effects extravaganza. The explosive, high octane finale - a massive battle that runs for more than 45 minutes and in which half of New York is leveled - works so much better than anything in Transformers because we care about the heroes and because attention is paid to the little details. While Iron Man and Hulk are up in the sky smashing big, ugly flying monsters, Captain America is saving people trapped on a bus.
 
Whedon avoids getting too serious, although he avoids full-on campiness. Admittedly, the end of the Earth is grim stuff but, in keeping with the comic book tone of the movie, there's plenty of humor, including at least a couple of laugh-out-loud moments (one with a literal ""punch line""). The filmmakers ensure we're laughing with them to avoid the unenviable possibility of laughing at them. This is, after all, pretty silly stuff when you get down to it; Whedon's approach is perfect for the material. One senses the only prequel director who might have been able to pull this off as well is Jon Favreau, who is on board as an executive producer.
 
Most of the ""original"" actors signed on to recreate their characters. The most valuable of these is Robert Downey Jr., who has the most screen time of all The Avengers. It's not quite Iron Man 3, but there are times when it's close. No one is likely to argue with this decision. Downey is terrific whether he's sharing a quiet moment with Gwyneth Paltrow or trading barbs with one of the other actors. Scarlett Johansson reprises her secondary role from Iron Man 2. Chris Hemsworth, Tim Hiddleston, and Stellan Skarsgard are back from Thor (without Natalie Portman, although her character's absence is explained). Chris Evans reprises the title role from Captain America. And Samuel L. Jackson finally gets a chance to appear in more than a random scene or two; he's The Avengers' glue. Newcomers include Mark Ruffalo, taking over for Edward Norton (who in turn replaced Eric Bana) as The Hulk (Lou Ferrigno provides the UnJolly Green Giant's voice), and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (although he had a cameo in Thor).
 
It's no secret that The Avengers was converted from 2-D to 3-D in postproduction (although some reports indicate that Whedon composed shots with an awareness that the movie's primary platform would be 3-D). That, in and of itself, argues that 2-D is a perfectly valid way to see this movie. However, this may be one of those occasions when it's worth paying the surcharge, especially if there's an IMAX option available. The Avengers boasts what is easily the best post-production conversion to-date. It's not Avatar immersive, but it is close. Problems are few and far between. I failed to notice any motion blur, the brightness levels were okay, and I didn't suffer from eye fatigue (even though the movie clocks in at nearly 2 1/2 hours). The Avengers is more about pop and sizzle than substance, and the 3-D delivers. Put this in the admittedly small club of titles for which putting on the glasses is not an unwarranted burden.
 
For those who like Easter Eggs, there are a couple of reasons to stay through the end credits. One-third of the way through, there's a short scene with a surprise that will delight comic book fans and mean absolutely nothing to those not steeped in Avengers lore. Then, after all the credits have rolled, there's an amusing moment that adds nothing to the story but is likely to provoke a smile and a chuckle. For those who feel like leaving the moment the movie proper is finished, nothing critical will be missed.
 
By swinging for the fences, The Avengers opens the 2012 summer movie season with an explosive bang that will reverberate through the superhero genre for years. Some superhero movies, like Christopher Nolan's Batman outings, play on a different field and won't be impacted. But many comic book translations will find themselves chasing The Avengers and more than a few will be found wanting. This is a game changer. By giving audiences everything they could possibly want and more, Whedon has ushered in a new era of bigger, louder, and more spectacular. Future entries into this genre will either have to rise to the challenge or disappoint. The Avengers will likely not be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar but it mayl be one of the most important movies to arrive in theaters during 2012.

"May 2, 2012"," If you're new around here, this is how the script goes: I damn ""The Avengers"" with faint praise, observing that the (supposed) culmination of the long, laborious Marvel Comics movie franchise is a competent but pointless popcorn entertainment that's being wildly overpraised simply for existing without being incoherent and terrible. Some readers sniff from behind their digital copies of the Atlantic: Why did you even bother? Others lament that, once again, a non-fan of comic-book movies was sent to review something whose true significance, as with a sacred scroll written in Tocharian B, is yielded only to a coterie of gnostics and believers. (An enormous coterie, in this case.) Someone will invoke the ghost of Pauline Kael to instruct us that movies are meant to entertain, and someone else will suggest that the editors send me back to covering films about lesbian sheepherders made in Azerbaijan. Well, there just isn't enough output from Azeri lesbian cinema to keep me busy, so here we all are again. Cutting to the chase: ""The Avengers"" does what it needs to do, absolutely. In my conversation with writer and director Joss Whedon a couple of weeks ago, he promised Marvel fans that this movie would ""deliver unto them,"" and that it does, with two and a half hours of increasingly frenetic action and a swarm of characters who crack wise in Whedon fashion but feel strongly connected to the mish-mash Marvel mythology. If you're not much of a Marvel Comics person but just want to get an early start on your mindless summer moviegoing, well, I guess this picture is no stupider than anything else. (As you can see, I possess a certain knack for writing irresistible blurb copy.) If you belong to the significant quadrant of the population that feels a powerful, tidal impulse to belong to this pop-culture moment, and hence yearn to believe that ""The Avengers"" is terrific, explosive, awesome fun (or other language of your choosing), please don't let me harsh your vibe. I mean that seriously; what kind of person would I be if I begrudged others a good time at the movies? But it's my job -- and, I guess, my inclination -- to stand outside those tidal currents and view these big spectacles dispassionately, as far as I can. What I see in ""The Avengers,"" unfortunately, is a diminished film despite its huge scale, and kind of a bore. It's a diminishment of Whedon's talents, as he squeezes himself into an ill-fitting narrative straitjacket, and it's a diminished form that has become formula, that depends entirely on minor technical innovations and leaves virtually no room for drama or tragedy or anything else that might make the story actually interesting. To praise the movie lavishly, as so many people have done and will continue to do, basically requires making endless allowances. It's really good (for being a comic-book movie). It's really good (for being almost exactly like dozens of other things). It's really good (for being utterly inconsequential). I saw ""The Avengers"" less than a week ago, and already much of it's a blur; if it weren't so easy to find plot synopses widely available, I'd probably forget key details. In another month, all that will stick with me is a few striking scenes and images: Tom Hiddleston, as the sneering Norse god Loki, compelling a crowd of Stuttgart civilians to kneel before him, until one older man, no doubt remembering the last time the Germans did that, rises to confront him. Or Robert Downey Jr., as playboy zillionaire Tony Stark cum Iron Man, delivering oh-snap comebacks one after another to Chris Evans' ultra-square Captain America. (Have Downey and John Malkovich ever been in a movie together, doing their dueling ""I'm so gay but I'm actually straight"" routines? I think not.) Or Scarlett Johansson in a catsuit, as superspy Natasha Romanoff, cocking her head just so as if to acknowledge that she's the idealized fetish object of the 11-year-old boy within every so-called adult male. Is there any point in discussing the plot of ""The Avengers,"" anyway? If you've read this far, the odds are strong that you either A) already know the whole story, B) don't want me to issue clueless spoilers or C) simply don't care. For those who may choose ""none of the above,"" I can explain that one-eyed, super-secret government honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to reassemble the superhero team known as the Avengers after Loki -- last seen in Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor,"" getting evicted from Asgard, home of the Norse gods -- comes to Earth in search of a mystical energy source called the Tesseract, with a force of insect-like space aliens following him. So Iron Man, Captain America, Natasha, Thor the Thunder God (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Bruce Banner aka the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, in a nicely understated, embittered performance) all gather on a flying aircraft-carrier/command-center thingy, along with the imprisoned Loki, who plans to sow discord and dissension before his super-disappointing aliens -- rejected by Michael Bay for insufficient gnarlitude, I think -- show up to wreck the place. Got all that? You don't, believe me. There's also quite a bit of eye candy in ""The Avengers,"" not all of it Johansson-related, and a few glimmers of genuine narrative weight, as in that moment with Loki and the Germans. But in trying to cram in enough plot and back story and increasingly incoherent action sequences for at least three summer movies, Whedon never finds a confident or relaxed narrative pace, and the results are exhausting, a picture that pushes three hours and feels like five. Obviously Whedon is one of the most experienced storytellers of our time, and I have to assume this is a deliberate attempt to satisfy the core young-dude demographic with an experience that will be physically draining, like an extended amusement-park ride. I felt tired at the end of ""Avengers,"" for sure, but even more bored and irritated, probably because the pretense of mythic grandeur can't stand up to the fundamental teenage-boy, men-in-tights silliness of the whole enterprise. I know, I know. I'm profaning sacred ground here. Once upon a time, and a very long time ago it was, the teenage boys (and occasional girls) who grew into adults and kept on reading superhero comics were viewed as oddballs or outcasts. When Hollywood began to rediscover the pioneering DC and Marvel superheroes of the 20th century, it was refreshing and delightful at first, and for a while: the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, the X-Men series. All were lots of fun, all descended into fatal decadence -- as exemplified by Joel Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin,"" quite possibly the worst film ever made in any language or tradition -- all have since been zombified and ripped from the grave for another go-round, with emphatically mixed results. There's nothing new about any of that, arguably. One of the defining characteristics of Batman and Superman and all their kind is their malleability, their immortality, their apparently endless recyclability. But for the love of Christ, at what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient? Those one-time comic-book pariahs are now the dominant force in pop-culture entertainment, and their works are deemed to be not just big but also relevant and important, much the way that Cecil B. DeMille's crap-history spectacles were in another day. This latest series of Marvel adaptations, mounted on a scale that would make Richard Wagner blush, has attained baroque heights of meaninglessness that make the James Bond movies seem like Strindberg by comparison. I would agree, by the way, that Stan Lee and his many acolytes and followers have created a kind of modern syncretic mythology, and that over the long, long haul both the Marvel and DC universes have incorporated some narrative complexity and some sense of mortality. That's not possible in two or three hours of mass-market entertainment, so we get these movies with zero dramatic arc, where the protagonists' fates are never in doubt and the central issues are all technical: Iron Man's ass-kicking fight scene with Thor; soulful Bruce Banner's transformation into The Hulk; the precise nature of the alien-invasion force; Scarlett Johansson, hubba-hubba, catsuit. There's no point getting exercised about public taste: Millions of people out there are eager for the visceral vacation from everyday life that ""The Avengers"" will provide, and given the difficult task of packing all these superheroes into one story, Whedon succeeds pretty well. (I'd rank ""Avengers"" above ""Iron Man 2"" but below the first ""Iron Man,"" roughly on the same level as ""Thor."") My problem is less with the movie or its audience or Joss Whedon -- although I honestly don't think being an A-list Hollywood director serves his talents appropriately -- than with the penumbra of bratty, entitled coolness that surrounds the whole project. It's a neat little postmodern trick, actually, to simultaneously position this movie as the most central pop-culture event of 2012 and insist on some kind of edgy, outsider status that renders any and all detractors as pipe-smoking William F. Buckley squares, defending a nonexistent Establishment. Right up to the end of ""The Avengers,"" I carried with me the faint hope that this really would mark the conclusion of this particular epoch-spanning series of hyperinflated comic-book spectacles. For good or ill, it is not to be: As Marvel fans surely know already, the usual ""stinger"" follows the closing credits, revealing that behind Loki and the insectoid aliens lurks ... well, somebody or something who will propel us into ""Thor 2"" or ""Iron Man 3"" or whatever else is coming. This mimics the way comic books have long worked, of course, and there's something wistful about it: As the transitory ersatz awesomeness of this particular spectacle fades away, like the cinematic equivalent of SweeTarts on the tongue, true Platonic awesomeness is waiting out there somewhere, in the next chapter.

"May 2, 2012","     Marvel Studios has been preparing audiences for this thrilling, collaborative action-adventure for the past few years, beginning with “Iron Man” and continuing with its sequel, plus “The Incredible Hulk,” “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger.”     Global annihilation is imminent when Thor’s brazen, bitter brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), arrives on Earth from Asgard and swipes the energy-packed Tesseract, an all-powerful Cosmic Cube, discovered on the ocean’s bottom in “Captain America,” through which he can summon intergalactic alien invaders. That’s why eye-patched Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) overrules his colleagues in the international peace-keeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D, and summons the disparate yet similarly egocentric, spandex-clad superheroes to a summit aboard his enormous airship.     Snarky playboy billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) immediately spars with the earnest, no-nonsense W.W. II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), along with the straight-laced, imperious, hammer-wielding Nordic god Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Fury’s sultry, covert operative Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has a vested interest in breaking Loki’s spell on her archer/assassin ally, Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), while world-weary scientist Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), tracking the Cube’s radiation, struggles to control the curse of his terrible temper.     Based on series created by Stan Lee (who does a cameo in the climactic chaos) and Jack Kelly, it was scripted by Zak Penn and re-written by director Joss Whedon (“The Cabin in the Woods,” TV’s “Buffy: The Vampire Slayer”), combining sly, snappy dialogue with an awesome special-effects, particularly in the massive battle in midtown Manhattan. Seamus McGarvey’s cinematography is superb, along with Alan Silvestri’s score. Plus there’s Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Erik Selvig, Paul Bettany as Jarvis with Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders as Agents Phil Colson and Maria Hill. In post-production, it was digitally converted to 3D and re-mastered for IMAX 3D.     On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Marvel’s The Avengers” is an amusing, entertaining 9 – for those who have been eagerly anticipating the familiarly iconic, comic-book-based superstar line-up. And remember to stay through the credits.",POSITIVE
"May 2, 2012"," Marvel’s The Avengers straddles the line between an earnest, gung-ho, corny superhero flick and a cynical movie about surrendering individuality and whether or not power inevitably leads to fascism. What wins out, of course, are the classic superhero themes of fighting for the greater good and teamwork—and even if you know exactly how it’s going to get there, The Avengers believes wholeheartedly in its pure superhero aesthetic. Better than any film since Sam Raimi’s excellent Spider-Man 2, The Avengers gets what makes comic books a thrill for young readers—that feeling of fantasy and family. Reading comics as a kid, I felt protected by the larger-than-life heroes but I related to them at the same time. My imagination was stoked by both the never-ending conflict and the way the characters were constantly being tested. The Avengers benefits from five Marvel movies before it that were full of backstory and origin. With that out of the way and certain character traits already firmly established, it puts extraordinary people in extraordinary situations and lets them play out in spectacularly entertaining fashion. I’ll make this quick: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to fight off an alien invasion led by Thor’s spiteful adopted brother from Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who wants to “free the world from freedom.” S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), the star of many connect-the-dots sequences in the other Marvel films, is part gatekeeper and part “biggest fan.” The Tesseract is the movie’s macguffin, a glowing energy cube from space that could either save our environment or destroy the planet, depending on whose hands it falls into. Things start out in a pretty ponderous fashion, with faceless alien voices full of doom explaining the film’s setup. But once the team is called together, they immediately clash and the verbal and physical fireworks start to fly. In a shrewd move by writer/director Joss Whedon (no stranger to a directing an ensemble), each superhero is given his or her moment of inner turmoil, a moment of doubt and serious danger, and a moment to shine that spotlights their own unique talent. The Avengers also makes the time-honored tradition of heroes trading quips as they fight seem fun and inspired. It isn’t surprising to find out that Whedon—the king of quirk and dramatic metaphor behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly/Serenity—has excellent Hollywood instincts. Whedon can suggest a lot with a small moment—the trademark of a blockbuster movie director who knows he has little time before the next explosion, but is smart enough to fill it with character rather than plot. Whedon displays his considerable knack for poking fun at characters while simultaneously taking their situation dead seriously. Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark is the obvious example to trumpet here, but the fact that all the characters have a certain self-deprecating charm is essential in keeping the movie from being an all-out rah-rah cheesefest. Keeping all the moving parts of The Avengers together is a balancing act that starts off a bit rough. Thankfully, this uncomfortable feeling is gradually overcome by the same giddy sentiment that turns adults into children again instantly. For good measure (there’s always a counter-balance in The Avengers–one of its strengths), some of the heroes question the motives of the government and work multiple angles even was they tow the company line. It’s not WWII after all; not even for Captain America. That said, The Avengers is pure formula. Besides the clunky opening, there are other too-familiar issues. Loki is a little too similar to Superman II’s General Zod at times but duller—without Terence Stamp’s mix of menace and oblivious humor. Scenes that allude to the painful past of Hawkeye and Black Widow are cut short in favor of more action. The giant snake aliens seem like they came out of a wormhole from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and Whedon even uses a 360-degree Michael Bay camera move. But here’s the rub: The circular Bay camera trick works. It comes at a moment where the audience is clamoring for the group to unite as a team, and I’ll be damned if it didn’t well me up with emotion. The Avengers may be pure formula, but its formula done in a way that makes you remember why formulas were created in the first place: They were successful. Whedon has the good sense to end the movie with one amazingly extended action sequence instead of the usual quick showdown where the hero faces his demons and wins through being clever or finding some sort of loophole. (Or worse—in the Harry Potter movies, it’s just point your wand and shoot until someone wins.) No, this is an all-out, full-scale alien vs. superhero war with every teammate mustering courage they didn’t know they had and kicking ass the old-fashioned way against seemingly insurmountable odds. When the X-Men fight, here are a couple of astounding moments. In The Avengers’ final battle, there’s one every couple minutes. The action is spectacular and coherent, with Whedon utilizing long effects takes and a depth of field that is thrilling. Seeing all those superheroes in one shot fighting together is nothing short of remarkable. I’m surprised no one’s brought this up yet, but this film feels a lot like Star Trek (2009) in terms of pacing, how they introduce characters, the sense of urgency, etc. Hell, even the title card sequence looks similar and has the same emotional impact.   This is a good thing if you ask me.  I don’t think it felt too formula at all. Sure it had some typical superhero movie tropes (bad guy ruling the world).  But I feel that this is structured like a war movie, rather than a typical superhero movie.  Also, I love how the film used different takes than what is shown on the trailers. This makes the movie feel fresh for people who’ve practically memorized the trailer, like me. It does have a lot in common with  Abrams’ ‘Star Trek,’ you’re right–great call! It’s total mainstream entertainment with a winking sense of humor and it knows how to create memorable moments with familiar characters.  Certainly the ending was one big war scene, and I think it forced the characters to use their wits and brawn to the best of their ability, which was a really smart move.  A lot of the Marvel films up to this point have kind of fallen apart a little at the end, but this movie was one big buildup with a satisfying climax. I’ll have to see it again, but ‘Spider-Man 2’ really is the high-water mark, I think, for superhero films so far. I think it ‘controlled’ is a good word for it, too. Thematically, its definitely more sound–and more personal. But I’ll be damned if Whedon didn’t include great personal touches here (the scene with Hawkeye and BW, Stark trying to call Pepper, etc).",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2012"," After five movies set in the incestuous Marvel
Comic universe establishing the origin of four characters and their individual
fights against some great foe, we get The Avengers, which establishes the
origin of a team of superheroes and then follows their collective fight against
a great foe. Yes, the generic
structure that led to the downfall of the heroes' separate cinematic adventures
is still present here. In fact, it
takes about half of the film's running time before the team assembles and works
togetherif begrudgingly so. The
Avengers works, though, and a major part of that success is the time
writer/director Joss Whedon takes to establish the dynamic of the team, in which
some characters admire and respect a few, others cannot stand a single thing for
which another stands, and the big green ""rage monster"" doesn't have an
opinion of any of them. He'd just
as soon come to the rescue of one of his teammates as randomly punch one of them
in the face during an otherwise victorious hero shot. The film's action sequences are all about chaos, and the presence of the
Hulk as an agent of pure chaos amidst Whedon's admirably organized pandemonium
is the figurative punch in the face the film needs. That's
not to say some of the other characters aren't worthwhile. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the billionaire with a heart made of a
clean energy reactor, is still the snarky, mostly selfish antihero from his two
previous outings. Quick with a joke
and ready to pour a villain a drink before commencing with a beat-down, Stark is
far more interesting than his alter ego Iron Man (The major reason why  the
second movie is better than its predecessor), and Iron Man has an arsenal hidden
in the shoulders and arms of his suit. He's
the de facto leader of the nascent Avengers team because underneath that tough
shellnot the suit, mind youis someone who wants to make a difference in
the world. Of top
priority for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), agent of the top-secret military
organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D., is obtaining Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), a
doctor who experimented with gamma radiation and was cursed for his folly with
the problem of becoming a massive, green beast with no super-ego when he gets
mad. See, there's a cube called the
Tesseract from another world that could open a portal to that faraway place and
cause the destruction of mankind. It
emits gamma radiation, and, since Banner is the expert in that field, it's vital
that he tag along on the search for the MacGuffin. Banner
starts off in Kolkata, where he manages to keep his id at bay by treating the
poor, unfortunate ill there. The
good doctor is fascinating in the way cursed people of Greek tragedies are. It's a gift to an extent, since it saved his
life. He'd rather be dead than have it, though. Banner tried that route once, he tells the team; the ""other
guy"" spit out the bullet he shot into his mouth. Even
Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a former Russian spy named Natasha Romanoff
who turned to fight for the United States, has a neat talent. She puts herself in dangerous situations and winds up interrogating the
people who think they are interrogating her. In the big, climactic fight for New York City, she pulls out a pair of
pistols, which seems anticlimactic given what the folks around her can do. These
are the Avengers that count; the rest are superfluous. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an expert archer, isn't even himself for half
the story, so his character is reduced to the fact that he has a quiver that
attaches various accessories to the heads of his arrows. Steve
Rogers (Chris Evans), aka Captain America, has been revived from his long sleep,
has a line of punching bags he can take his aggression out on, and still has an
indestructible shield. He's the
tactician of the group, because the character's sole noteworthy hookthat he's
a relic who has lost everyone he ever cared about (his curse)is missing here.
He was more interesting as a scrawny kid and a propaganda tool anyway. Thor
(Chris Hemsworth) returns, as well. His
solo cinematic expedition is the best of the setup films, and, sadly, he's just
a god with a big hammer and the ability to control lightning again. His brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is the one behind the plan to open the
portal, bringing an army of hideous creatures to Earth so that he may take up a
throne. The brothers debate the
plan, and Stark calls it ""Shakespeare in the park."" Whedon
downplays a lot of these characters' niches, and that is the way it should be. For all the arguments between the heroes about whether or not
old-fashioned heroics are still relevant in this day and age, the movies leading
up to this one have made it clear that the more straightforward the hero (We're
looking at you, Captain America), the less substantial he or she actually is. The way these characters dissect each other's flaws in the verbal barbs
is only a reminder of what appeals to us about them.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2012","The Avengers lives up to all the hype, embracing the geek in all of us and taking the audience on an incredibly wild ride.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2012","Se sai melhor ao retratar a interação de seus personagens do que a ação por estes protagonizada, apresentando-se como uma brincadeira inofensiva e inconsequente. Não é uma decepção, é verdade, mas um pouco mais de ambição não lhe teria feito mal.",NEUTRAL
"May 1, 2012","Thrilling when it wants to be, it's got star power to spare, and the action and effects are top-notch.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2012"," The words “Written and directed by Joss Whedon” appear before 35 episodes of Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Dollhouse, and they suggest the promise—almost always kept—that the episode will be better than the rest—truly written and really directed. In them, there was a level of confident control in terms of image and rhythm that made the surrounding episodes pale in comparison. It would be cause for celebration if The Avengers, which similarly credits Whedon as writer-director (with story credit split between Whedon and Zak Penn), turned out to be the most exemplary demonstration of the Buffy auteur’s powers, a final destination for him, just as the movie is a point of convergence for the four Marvel blockbusters that preceded it. The stamp of his personality is practically unquestionable: There’s a certain indirectness in many special-effects shots, a respect for capturing motion in an unbroken take, or—rarity among rarities—gluing together shots in a way that makes sense in terms of good, old-fashioned montage. He also demonstrates a strong understanding of depth of field. In an industry that systematically alienates everything that doesn’t contribute to “impressive effects” and “an easy-to-understand, primitive story,” what Whedon brings to the table is practically a miracle in and of itself. Whedon trademarks also abound in visuals and dialogue. There’s the “everyone arguing” scene, the “friends and confederates sitting around a table” scene, the “one in a cage, one out” interrogation/intimidation scene, and the scene where a hero and a foe have a palaver in the dark woods. There’s the semi-likable supporting character who’s killed in a supremely unfair manner, and the Hail Mary pass for redemption and self-sacrifice on the edge of an inter-dimensional breach. Some of the more peculiar, Whedon-esque dialogue trademarks are missing, but the characters’ voices still seem to have been channeled through his control board. He also exerts a softening effect on many actors who’ve otherwise tended toward self-caricature; for example, it’s been years since Samuel L. Jackson actually showed up for work, and it’s a pleasure to see it here. But while The Avengers exhibits exemplary craftsmanship, Whedon hasn’t made a great film. The story seems unwieldy in scale, broken as it is into two parts: an entertaining Rio Bravo variation aboard an airborne aircraft carrier (!), and an epic “good few versus evil horde” showdown set in and above midtown Manhattan. Longish dialogue scenes, a Whedon specialty, are hobbled by an overall air of impatience (Loki and Thor’s nighttime stroll and the Loki-Natasha face-off, in particular), as if the sequences of large-scale mayhem somehow mattered more. The second half, as some critics have already pointed out, is a more coherent do-over of Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Michael Bay’s bizarro train wreck uses an astonishingly similar inter-dimensional battle as its primary crisis, but while Whedon is a better director, in a strange way he doesn’t seem to have the hubris to lie to our faces that the big CGI circus is supposed to amount to anything, or to sociopathic bad taste—arguably Bay’s redeeming quality. Whedon—to some, the standard-bearer for fanboy culture—is a strong, classical stylist in the tradition of Joe Dante, John Landis, and Steven Spielberg, and while it’s well-documented that his heart belongs to Marvel, and he’s certainly a better director than Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, and Joe Johnston, it seems debatable whether a good film can be made of Marvel’s billion-dollar properties. Whedon has impeccable crowd-pleasing instincts (he can score a laugh like nobody’s business), but in his best work, pleasure and pain are never far apart. Part of what makes him unique is the fact that he’s never been one for uncomplicated emotion of any kind. You can see some of this bilateral emotional intelligence, the urge to de-amplify things, peeking through in The Avengers when Tony tries to reach Pepper Potts on the phone toward the end of the film, or when Thor tries to hide a painful injury as he lands in the street, steadying himself for half a second against an overturned car. Whedon’s instincts to complicate, to mix it up, to vary the texture with half-seen moments, are fundamentally at odds with the blockbuster enterprise, the guiding—and dominant, even here—principle of which is to make sure the audience is safe in the knowledge of what they’re supposed to think, at all times. For all of Whedon’s creative and/or logistical empowerment, the boring blockbuster—sick with pixels and building-shuddering bass—gets the better of him.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2012"," Truly, the geeks have inherited the Earth. And with apologies to The Lord of the Rings saga, cinematic geek-outs don't get any more monumental than The Avengers, the long-awaited culmination of the new age of Marvel movies. Under the leadership of eyepatch-sporting Nick Fury Samuel L. Jackson), the Avengers assemble, most of them the erstwhile stars of their own self-titled movies: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking the baton from Edward Norton). Superheroics, sure, but more importantly, synergy, as Marvel primes the next wave of sequels and spin-offs. ""Am I the only one who did the reading?"" asks Downey's Tony Stark. Clearly not, and screenwriter-director Joss Whedon counts on it. The Avengers is some serious comic-book ""inside baseball."" While it's more than possible to come to The Avengers cold and grasp the basic idea (good vs. evil: not exactly rocket science—though there's that too when Iron Man's around), intimate knowledge of the sequels and the comic books will keep you from feeling left out as the fanboys to your right and left laugh and squeal in recognition of the ""easter eggs"" Whedon's hidden in the margins (including the patented Marvel ""bonus scene""). SPOILER ALERT: the research work being done by Fury's secret agency S.H.I.E.L.D. on a glowing cube called ""the Tesseract"" goes south when Thor's nasty Norse-god brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, cutting his menace with comic brio) reappears, precipitating the threatening arrival of ""an army, from outer space"" (the Tesseract, dear readers, was last seen as the Macguffin of Captain America). It's quite possible that The Avengers has more action than any movie ever made. Outstanding special effects and stuntwork contribute to an exhilaration so constant it risks the kind of exhaustion, if not monotony, inspired by the Transformers pictures. As these sorts of films go, The Avengers comes off as relatively smart (at least until the next Christopher Nolan film opens). Genre wit Whedon—running with a plot first developed by Zak Penn—orchestrates for this uber-comic-book-movie a merry clash of attitudes and styles complementing the many heroes and villains. Whedon writes particularly well for Bruce Banner/The Hulk and Tony ""the Snark"" Stark, and his actors oblige. Ruffalo conveys smarts, soul, and self-knowledge (""That's my secret...I'm always angry""); Downey happily bogarts the best wisecracks (nailing Thor as ""Shakespeare in the Park""), while also giving good gravitas in a pinch. The site of the film's climax, Grand Central Station, serves as Whedon's knowing metaphor for his movie. Proving it's from the ""more is more"" school of superhero follow-ups, The Avengers piles on Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow (introduced in Iron Man 2) and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye (who made a cameo appearance in Thor), Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, Stellan Skarsgard's researcher Erik Selvig (also from Thor), a raspy alien identified as ""The Other"" (Alexis Denisof), and a shadowy World Security Council peopled by Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter, among others. Like a winking street juggler with confident patter, Whedon keeps his color-coded balls in the air while taking advantage of the production value afforded by his urban backdrop (seeing Manhattan destroyed just never gets old—and now in 3D!). Undercutting gags notwithstanding, The Avengers comes full up with posturing and amusingly self-serious clunkers (like Jackson, shot to appear ten feet tall, introducing his badass character to the tune of ""How bad is it?""). Ultimately, for all its thrill-ride clutter, The Avengers is just about as simplistic as them fightin'-robot pictures, and even more jingoistically blinkered: though Captain America himself asks, ""Aren't the stars and stripes a little old-fashioned?"" the thought quickly perishes. If the picture is about anything, it's about the need to come together in a crisis, regardless of competing viewpoints—seemingly genteel common sense on the face of it. But the post-Patriot Act message of sacrificing personal freedom and giving carte blanche to the ""War on Terror,"" more text than subtext here, will give pause to some (while the weight the movie implicitly throws behind God and Uncle Sam no doubt has the Tea Party booking group-rate tickets). Don't get me wrong: kids' brains will explode at the superhero theatrics, and if they deserve a break today, treat them to a movie expressly constructed for them and those with Peter Pan Syndrome (the school-age me would've loved it, I'm sure). But some adults may find they agree less with the secret-trafficking heroes and more with the god of mischief, who avers, ""Freedom is life's great lie"" and later asks, pointedly, a crowd of German citizens, ""Is this not your natural state?...Don't you crave subjugation?"" Loki gets a superhero spanking for that subversive suggestion, but last I checked, money talks and people listen, at the voting booth and the ticket counter. It doesn't take a crystal ball to guess which movie will be number-one at the box office this weekend, whether we adults deserve a break or not.",POSITIVE

"May 1, 2012"," Since the first of the Marvel Studios pictures - 2008's 'Iron Man' - part of the fun has been following the breadcrumbs leading to a potential team-up that, by all rights, seemed impossible. The Avengers would assemble, they told us, and we all said, “sure, I'll believe it when I see it.” I can give you a full summary of the film in seconds. Loki beams down from Asgard and steals the Tessaract (or Cosmic Cube, to those in the know.) S.H.I.E.L.D. collects Earth's Mightiest Heroes and they get Loki (but not the Tessaract) on the Helicarriar. Then an attack happens followed by a major action sequence. There's some talking (but not much!) after a setback, then Loki's army (from space!) attacks New York. Then roughly forty-five minutes of one of the best action movie slugfests commences. The lead-up to the action is a decent bit of fun, partially because we've all put so much work into these characters. Like Nick Fury, we want the Avengers Initiative to work. Thanks to the tremendous casting and Joss Whedon's economic use of dialogue, it does. By the time we get to the beatdowns it is just pure visceral joy. The Hulk does this one thing that inspired me to shout “Holy Crap!” but I was so dumbstruck I couldn't even make those words come out. I think I said “Herr Ca! Hoo!” When was the last time you said “Herr Ca! Hoo!” at a movie? I liked Eric Bana and Edward Norton, but Mark Ruffalo is the perfect Bruce Banner. He's awkward and nervous and wears his pants pulled up too high. Chris Evans is once again fantastic as Steve Rogers. He's got biceps a yard thick but still pulls off the mom & apple pie bit. For me, though, the real breakout is Scarlett Johansson. In a way, it's her film – she's the most “normal” character and she's given a fantastic introduction that fits right in with the canon of great women in the Whedonverse. Now that all the marquis names are sharing the stage, the shoehorning of an eventual team-up takes a respite. I think we'll all agree that the Marvel films perhaps that overdid the “shared universe” concept, 'Iron Man 2' and 'Thor,' are the weakest of the bunch. With this no longer necessary, what we get instead are some terrific bits of weirdness. The cutaways to Loki's army of Chitauri have a B movie sci-fi quality that I loved, and while they aren't anything other than canon fodder they make great faces and noises. There are some unexpected cameos far odder than Stan Lee (they're not secret, but I won't spoil them – they include favorites of some of the great arthouse directors of the 70s and 80s,) but the most curious moment is when Loki calls Black Widow a “mewling quim.” If that isn't this year's “I drink your milkshake,” I give up on our pop culture echo chamber. 'The Avengers' isn't flawless. While the rewatch value of the second half is extremely high, the first half is definitely more for the fans than, you know, normal moviegoers. In its defense, the “hurry up and wait” style of plotting, where everything is presented as really important but nothing is actually happening, is very much of a piece with reading a monthly comic. The other thing that bugged me is that while the real landmarks of New York get smashed real good (or used by Thor to. . .well. . .that'd be a spoiler,) Whedon does almost nothing to exploit New York as a character. This is not Donner's 'Superman: The Movie' or Raimi's 'Spider-Man.' This is a movie that coulda been set, not just filmed, in Albuquerque. Overall, the picture is tremendous fun and it looks great. The action is smartly shot/rendered such that each of our heroes is always doing something that makes sense for their skills. The camera zips around in impossible directions, checking in as each star does some ridiculous move right out of a comic panel. You can practically see the word KRA-KOOM! on the screen. The big win, ultimately, is the team. For the most part each character has a unique relationship to one another, and Whedon's penchant for comedy shines through. The writing even supports Cap wearing that goofy blue suit the whole time. We've got more Marvel movies on deck and no sign of the team slowing up. It'll be hard to top 'The Avengers,' but they've already done the impossible. Can't wait to see what comes next.

"May 1, 2012"," The Avengers is less a movie than a novelization of itself, an oversized, self-aware picture designed mostly for effect: That of reliving the experience of a movie youâve seen before and just canât get enough of. The picture is broken down into narrative chunks that ultimately donât tell much of a story â what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters. The idea, maybe, is that people already love Captain America, Iron Man, the Hulk and Thor so much — like, so, so much — that all a filmmaker really needs to do is put them all into a big stock pot filled with elaborate set pieces and some knowing dialogue and heâs golden. And maybe, given the heightened-lowered expectations of movie audiences, that really is all he has to do: It's possible to have looked forward to a movie all year, to enjoy watching it, and then to have completely forgotten about it the following week.

The Avengers isnât terrible. It has a welcoming, communal spirit, especially for a big-budget, early-summer picture. But its director, Joss Whedon — who also cowrote the script, with Zak Penn, based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby — seems to have gotten lost in mythology on his way to the story. Itâs odd that last year, the arrival (and popularity) of The Artist and Midnight in Paris elicited dozens of cranky essays — or at least Tweets — about how lame it was that these movies traded in ânostalgia,â a sentimental longing for an old-timey world of bowler hats and flapper dresses (or, at least, moviemaking with less green screen). But movies built around comic books never get the same treatment, even though they wouldnât exist if not for a past kept in boxes under countless beds, a past that you get really mad at your mother for throwing out. We have to carry some of the past along with us. How else do you shape the future? But The Avengers isnât so much a movie as a kind of G-8 summit for action figures who have finally been allowed out of their cellophane boxes. They do action stuff, then they talk a little, then they do more action stuff. Itâs a movie that, for all its dazzle, has forgotten that the whole point of reading comic books is for story and character development. The Avengers certainly doesnât lack for characters, most of which will be familiar even if youâve never read a Marvel comic book in your life, provided youâve been to the movies at least a couple of times in the past few years. As the picture opens, Samuel L. Jacksonâs Nick Fury, the godfather of the military law-enforcement outfit known as S.H.I.E.L.D., is just about to put a shiny cube known as the Tesseract away for safe-keeping when out of the sky drops pissed-off alien Viking Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston, who has a fantastic anemic-schoolboy look). Loki possesses a mysterious staff that can steal the hearts of men, even superhuman ones, and he uses this dastardly magical doohickey to take a number of Nick Furyâs employees hostage, among them Jeremy Rennerâs Clint Barton, AKA Hawkeye, a bow-and-arrow guy. He also takes possession of the Tesseract, which has the power to destroy worlds and to remove that pesky ring-around-the-collar — seriously, this rock can do anything. Nick needs to get the rock back, and fast, so he summons the most awesome assemblage of superhuman superheroes ever, in the form of Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Later, Lokiâs linebacker-sized half-brother Thor (the casually appealing Chris Hemsworth, a collegiate, big galoot of a guy) joins the fray, as Hawkeye does once heâs freed from Lokiâs spell. Heâs got that right. The Avengers suffers from the thing that mars so many movies peopled with outsize characters: Everyone is jostling for our attention, and naturally, some are going to grab more than others. Ruffalo is characteristically understated as Bruce Banner, which makes his transformation into, as Stark puts it, âan enormous green rage monsterâ quietly satisfying. Rennerâs Hawkeye is a little lost — it canât be easy, being the bow-and-arrow guy. Similarly, even though Johanssonâs sultry Natasha gets a smashing opening — she vanquishes a bunch of thugs even as sheâs tied to a chair, a magnificent feat of bondage combat — sheâs quickly relegated to the superhero back burner. And Downeyâs Stark, strutting around in his off-hours in a Black Sabbath T-shirt, is amusing until his self-important wisecracks begin to wear ruts in the movie. One thing The Avengers doesnât have going for it — which is hardly the movieâs fault — is that it can never be the sneak attack Jon Favreauâs first Iron Man movie was. That picture stands as the best in a wayward series of Avengers movies that include Kenneth Branaghâs crazy-Wagnerian Thor and Joe Johnstonâs well-intentioned but wobbly Captain America: The First Avenger. Of all the characters here, Chris Evans's Captain America best acquits himself, partly because Evans never looks as if heâs trying too hard and partly, maybe, because his character's suit — an old-fashioned padded red-white-and-blue number, with matching helmet mask — is so old-school that you never lose sight of the superhuman human being inside it. Maybe thatâs also why Gwyneth Paltrow, who appears in only a few scenes as Tony Starkâs main squeeze Pepper Potts, is such a blessed vision: She pads around Tony Starkâs space-age Manhattan headquarters in her bare feet, dressed in a white shirt and cutoff shorts, a sexy vision of down-to-earth braininess — she also happens to be coordinating the technology that makes Stark and his Stark Enterprises such a success. But maybe you donât really need a Pepper Potts when youâve got a crashing, galloping extended climax in which a portion of New York City is destroyed by massive flying metal beasties before the Avengers can restore order. Whedon does a pretty valiant job of orchestrating set pieces like these. And yet — is that what we really want from Whedon? In my book, Whedon will always be a genius for creating and shaping Buffy the Vampire Slayer — a show that addressed not just the major traumas of teenagerhood but of this goddamned thing we call life — and shepherding it through seven remarkably sustained seasons. The Avengers is far less intimate than Buffy — a show whose proportions reached majestic heights — ever was. And Whedonâs 2005 feature directing debut Serenity, based on his ill-fated but marvelous television series Firefly, offers the kind of satisfying, bare-bones storytelling thatâs lacking in The Avengers. (I also think itâs time for Whedon to retire the idea of the hole in the sky that suddenly breaks open, unleashing horrors upon an unsuspecting world, a device that also features in the smug, tricky, meta-horror movie Cabin in the Woods, which Whedon cowrote and produced. He never met a portal he didnât like.) The Avengers is at its best when Whedon takes the time to shape small moments between the characters, as when tight-ass Agent Phil Coulson (played by the likeably noodgy Clark Gregg) goes all stammering and tongue-tied in the presence of Captain America, his childhood idol. Coulsonâs awkward hero worship is a gentle metaphor for The Avengersâ whole reason for existence — these are characters people love, for understandable reasons. But the movieâs scale and size does little to serve those characters, and thereâs something self-congratulatory about Whedonâs whole approach, as if he were making a movie only for people who are already in on the in-joke. Comic-book aficionados who have always loved the Avengers may very well love The Avengers; those who wouldnât know a Tesseract from a Rubikâs Cube may feel differently. Thatâs the thing about other peopleâs nostalgia: Itâs always a bitch. Exactly what I feel about the movie. Thanks Stephanie. As a Joss Whedon fan, I have to say that this is not Whedon at his best. It's understandable as this is more of a Marvel movie than Joss movie. The post-credit scene (the one after the mid-credit scene), on the other hand, is hilariously Joss. So those of you in the US, make sure to stay for the full credits. In my fully-booked theatre (an advanced screening), there's less than 20 people who stayed and saw it. I read the whole review twice and I never understood what was wrong with the movie or what was exactly that Stephanie didn't like. I am not a fan of the Marvel universe, yet I've already seen the Avengers three times (here in Mexico), just because it's so entertaining and it is really amusing to see how the superheroes interact with each! It's not The Dark Knight, or Spiderman 2, or Burton's Batman, but it's so entertaining to see how Stark keeps pulling Thor's leg and other stuff. I think The Avengers was never meant to be The Black Swan or Winter's Bone or Dead Poets Society. It's a popcorn movie with a lot of popcorn! And thank God it doesn't have terrible lines like Transformers or terrible acting like in other movies! I am not a fan of Whedon because I didn't even know who he was before the movie was released, but still loved the movie because it was ENTERTAINING, and that was what I was expecting. The movie is very, very entertaining, and fun, and amusing, and exciting. No, I don't think it deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Picture just as I think The Dark Knight and Wall-E did, or Oscar nominations to best Screenplay, but the movie is not as dull as Stephanie somehow makes it sound. I believe that maybe she was expecting something completely different, built her own expectations of how the movie should be or look like, and now she is disappointed. Just look out at her opening statement: ""The Avengers is less a movie than a novelization of itself, an oversized, self-aware picture designed mostly for effect: That of reliving the experience of a movie youâve seen before and just canât get enough of."" What? Come on, it's The Avengers, there's no need to go so sophisticated. The Avengers is targeted to regular people, so talk normal: Is it good, bad or so-so??? Don't tell me it's a ""novelization of itself"" because you lose me and I don't understand what are you tring to say: What are you talking about? I want to know if I will be entertained by the movie, yes or no. The Avengers' creators accomplished exactly what they wanted to accomplish. Any more character development and the movie would not have been able to keep the pace it was intended to keep and probably would have approached three hours. The team managed to squeeze every ounce of entertainment from every second of footage and I think if one is to commend a particular actor for not ""trying too hard"" it would undoubtedly have to be Mark Ruffalo. Bruce Banner was never done just right before but He managed to pull it off flawlessly and make it look effortless. I went in with high expectations and came out with larger-than-life satisfaction. The theatre erupted in applause after. Keeping on the same wavelength as Jorge, I think critics should always remember to answer the important question readers want answered (especially for a film like this): ""Will I enjoy it?"". There is a 95% chance any person who watches The Avengers will have a blast. Failure to mention this is an injustice to the reader. Re:  I think critics should always remember to answer the important question readers want answered (especially for a film like this): ""Will I enjoy it?"". There is a 95% chance any person who watches The Avengers will have a blast. Failure to mention this is an injustice to the reader. I don't want critics to tell me I'm going to enjoy or hate a film.  Anyone I know to possess powerful acuity, reaches of perception and sensitivity that drive me hard to rival or excel, is assisting me best just by letting me know how it all went with them.  You get to know which critic you tend to be in co-sympathy with, and if he or she loved it, you're likely to do so as well -- but when we're at our best, we're still collecting from all sorts:  who knows? maybe who we are now won't sit well with who all we might yet become, perhaps, if for the better, with the help of the testing of intelligent people, who currently see things frustratingly differently from ourselves. Avengers wasn't very good. The individual Marvel movies (Thor, Iron Man, Hulk) were better than Avengers. Avengers felt like the series finale of a television season, where they tie up all the loose ends and have a payoff (usually disappointing).  ACT 1
The movie opened with an great conflict; Loki stole the ""Tessaract"" and blew up the SHIELD base. The Avengers are gathered together by Black Widow (her power is seduction?). And Hulk becomes the attraction we're all waiting for. ACT 2 ""We're a time-bomb""
Once the team is assembled, the team sits on a hovering aircraft carrier for an hour doing...nothing. This is were the movie stalls, because they don't learn anything about Loki or the Cube or even the Chitauri. The individual superheroes never really discuss their personal lives except for a few comments here and there. Hulk is the only compelling character at all on the hovercraft, as he tries not to transform. The fight in the woods? Great and entertaining. They don't get along, we get it, Thor needs a hug. Let's take Loki back to the ship and talk. Why doesn't anyone talk or reference the previous films? Captain America lost his love, Thor lost Natalie Portman, The Hulk: no mention of Betsy. Aren't these guys horny? Is no one checking out Black Widow? Or does her constant dumb look wipe their libidos? Why does Tony Stark and Cap spend 15 minutes trying to get the turbine spinning to save the ship? Really Joss, that's the best conflict you could come up with for these two? ACT 3 ""I'm bringing the party to you!""/""How's that a party?""
What does every movie resort to Private Ryan style warfare in a city with a mindless enemy? How about a page from Lord Of the Rings: they're born, walk, talk and fight. Robots from another world that fight? Lame. Where are they from? Does no one care about that? I'm sorry folks, but I'm really looking forward to Dark Knight Rises now. Avengers was a mess of a movie (and I was really amped). No story and thin characters (the solo movies were better). The payoff? Stay after the credits, there's more Avengers coming. Awesome. What makes DK bittersweet is that it's a grounded story and it's ending. Some say Dark Knight and Avengers are so different, that they're not from the same genre. Not so. The Batman movies/X-Men First Class/Kick-Ass prove that comic book films can be smart stories from the comic book domain. Avengers just isn't one of them, but the first about the Avengers; it was the best presentation of the summer popcorn movies since Spiderman (which was better) but before than Transformers and Battle Los Angeles. Joss Whedon (I loved Firefly/Serenity and even appreciated Dollhouse) is merely doing a Michael Bay impression. I was looking forward to Wonder Woman from Whedon before it was canned (the first time). But this? Bryan Singer made this movie, twice, and a lot quieter and better. Re:  What does every movie resort to Private Ryan style warfare in a city with a mindless enemy? How about a page from Lord Of the Rings: they're born, walk, talk and fight. Robots from another world that fight? Lame. Where are they from? Does no one care about that? Spares the mind some while you focus on how the team is working / coming together, explored some of the varietals of how they'll function.  Now that we've got a sense of it, it's time to branch out and particularize the opponent. The Avengers may have accomplished everything the creators wanted to accomplish, but that's totally different than saying that it's a great movie. Most people may have a good time watching this movie (I did), but that doesn't change the fact that it's just a popcorn movie, albeit a good one. I didn't expect much character development. Like many people have said, that's the job for the individual franchises. But the plot feels thin and too straight forward to me. Like Stephanie wrote, ""The picture ... donât tell much of a story â what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters."" And ""it's possible to ... enjoy watching it, and then to have completely forgotten about it the following week."" This is exactly what I feel. The Avengers is a popcorn movie, but The Dark Knight is something else. Actually, it's a lot of things. A score of 6 for The Avengers may be a bit harsh. I'd give it a 7 while The Dark Knight is more like a 9 or 10. This sounds like lots of fun!  It must be the new thing to let kids deactore their own treats at birthday parties.  We went to one last month where the kids got to spread icing and sprinkles on Elmo cookies.  It was so cute and the kids had a blast. Not to say that Loki doesn't have presence, but the story proved to be about the team settling together in a very satisfying fashion, with everything else but interjections to this realization. Personally, the agent getting tongue-tied before an American legend, perhaps because it was presaged by his being highlighted, playfully, certainly not sincerely, but still a bit oddly as a romantic rival, kind of felt like he was being set up for something -- the over-reaching, exposed ""kid,"" due to die for being likened to things he'll never be -- a great hero; a rival lover -- and for never being able to subsequently quite pull himself tightly together again thereafter.  But you let that momentary consideration dissolve because its purpose of helping limit the sense of Captain America as anachronistic, now irrelevant, a joke, that nobody really too much wants while we're all becoming entranced to bond with Eastwood, old American virtues, locales and industry, is effectively lessened here.  Anyhow, the moment felt too functional and too much like it was spotting one guy out, to be affecting.  To me, the moments that worked best were when the heroes have had a fair estimation of one-another and have begun to see how'll they'll be settling in. Thor standing alone with Hulk for the first time as mates -- which, other than Hulk's Indiana Jones-like humiliation of the gloating opponent, might be the film's most satisfying moment -- worked for this reason first, and then secondly for the terrific, perfectly appropriate follow-up humor it spawned.  I'm not sure Black Widow's best moment was the one you mentioned.  I was more struck with her encounter with Loki, another plausible instance where something human -- they're just no denying it! --  could catch short even the likes of ""magic and gods""; and so much more satisfying than when an F -18 or a nuke are used to do the same.  It was a terrific surprise; Loki blanched and guffawed, as we did.  And we were pleased that Weldon didn't let a talent she'd after all shown she had simply surrender itself because before someone ostensibly way out of her countenancing; and I thought good on you Weldon for giving something pronounced to the more simply human characters -- with Captain America of course getting undaunted leadership, as well as emblemmanship of the times -- to help settle them in experientially amongst their powerhouse teammates as legitimate peers.  Hawkeye didn't get a standout trait; but they did make his arrows something sorta akin to Iron Man's arsenal.  And with him more or less the one exception, and with him being played by a movie star actor ... good enough. ""the hole in the sky that suddenly breaks open, unleashing horrors upon an unsuspecting world, a device that also features in the smug, tricky, meta-horror movie Cabin in the Woods"" No it didn't. Just one of the things that baffled me about this review, as well as ""a way that can easily fool you into thinking itâs exciting"" and ""the whole point of reading comic books is for story and character development"". I suppose by the latter she's talking about the kind of development that can happen over 7 seasons of Buffy? Then it's pretty silly to critique the first movie for that.  She is right that this isn't whedon at his most unleashed, and I was conscious of all the constraints he was working under: it has to be PG 13, it has to fit with all the other movies, it has to have a videogame, a soundtrack, 27 trailer spots, and a million billion tie ins. Given that assignment, I thought it was amazing how he made it into a real movie, the story of how this ridiculous group of people became a team.  Good grief, Stephanie, you're taking this WAY to seriously. This was just pure popcorn chomping campy fun. And I thought it held together just fine, oddly enough because I thought there WAS some character development. And this thing about the point of comics being story and character development, um, really? My husband, who knows all about all these comic heros, loves comics (learned to speak and read English because of them as a child) and thought the movie was very entertaining. Can't remember when I've beento a movie where people laughed and clapped and cheered. Entertainment, even ""mindless"", is good for the soul once in awhile. Lighten up. We had to return our tickets for a later show because theater for the first one we went too, while not sold out when we bought the tickets, was so crowded thirty minutes before the show that we couldn't find two seats together except way down in front. Relax... I would like to note that this movie was given the same score as the really horrible ""The Raven.""  The so-so (yet, I concede, gorgeously cast and costumed, as I would expect from Tarsem Singh) ""Mirror, Mirror"" was given an 8.5. I stopped reading MovieLine months ago because of Ms. Zacharek's reviews.  Critics are entitled to their opinions, but I have found the tenor of her reviews to be extremely off-putting.  It's as if she goes into movies determined to love or hate them, and reviews from that standpoint.   Perhaps a hiatus for the lady is in order, or at least less exposure to the pre-marketing campaigns and industry gossip.  Go in with a cleaner palate, as it were. I thought maybe I'd come back to MovieLine with the summer movie season ramping up again.  But this review confirms I made the right decision.  Back to other sites with other reviewers who seem to offer more consistent reviews. I agree completely, Chasm. I did however enjoy ""The Raven"" as my daughter has been studying Edgar Allen Poe recently and we both sat on the edge of our seats the second half of the movie.  I grow tiresome of many ad-campaigns when it comes to movies, but I never let them sway my opinion BEFORE I go see a movie. Ms. Zacharek was truly a victim of ""The Avengers"" ad-campaigning... What did she give ""John Carter""? I'm also curious to see what she gives to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""The Amazing Spider-man""...both of which will surely receive their share of mass ad-campaigning. Stephanie Zacharek seems to think EVERY movie made should be up to her standards apparently. Her standards seem to be like that of an ancient Roman Emperor who watches gladiators duel in front of her... Each wondering if they will get the infamous ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"". A ""C"" for this movie? Rarely do I care what self-absorbed and self-righteous movie critics think about movies, but this rating is..well, temporary insanity at it's best. Perhaps the millions who went to see this (and the hundreds of thousands who paid to see it several times over) watched a different movie than Stephanie. Perhaps Stephanie was just having a bad day, but after seeing her scores in EW, she seems to have many bad days. (Except for the Three Stooges Movie which she gave a ""B""...perhaps she received a refill on her Prozac that day?) It's a good thing the masses don't seem to care about what movie critics think these days, or millions of people would have missed the funnest movie of this young century. Perhaps rethink your career, Stephanie? I hear TMZ needs more fodder material. ""The idea, maybe, is that people already love Captain America, Iron Man, the Hulk and Thor so much â like, so, so much â that all a filmmaker really needs to do is put them all into a big stock pot"" -Well no duh if people didn't love these characters it wouldn't have had such a good as turnout as it did. ""Filled with elaborate set pieces and some knowing dialogue and heâs golden."" Now your just ripping into Josh Whedon. I like this post, enjoyed this one appreciate it for putting up. âIt is well to give when asked but it is better to give unasked, through understanding.â by Kahlil Gibran.",NEUTRAL
"May 1, 2012"," Not all superhero movies scale great heights. Despite the hype, last year’s “Green Lantern” couldn’t hold a candle to much of anything, let alone Christopher Nolan’s Batman series.  “Wolverine” was an outright dog, “Spider-Man 3” a tangled mess. Joss Whedon’s take on the Marvel collection of good guys is about as great as a superhero movie can get. It’s bursting with imaginative action, jacked up on clever dialogue, directed with fanboy exuberance and teeming with well-drawn Marvel comic-book icons — Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury.  Most remarkable is its pacing and how smoothly this mammoth, potentially unwieldy production runs … and runs … and runs until it finishes with a smashing special effects smackdown on the streets of Manhattan. Assembling such a massive cast of larger-than-life characters and actors, some of whom we know can wield superhero egos of their own making, is a risky proposition, ripe with potential for spotlight-hogging. But “Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s” Whedon, who directs and co-wrote the hip, frequently laugh-out-loud funny screenplay with Zak Penn, respectfully grants equal playing time to each character. Moreover, the move allows the actors to not only impress us with their lean torsos but demonstrate their acting muscle. The result is one of the most winning displays of teamwork since the San Francisco Giants captured the World Series in 2010.  After a fast-paced opening, the film does take some time to find its legs, and the exposition seems unavoidable, since the superheroes need to be reintroduced. But once it hits the highway, the action moves like a Lamborghini.  The plot is fondly and appropriately rooted in comic book tradition — there’s a power-mad villain with a sinister plan. That part falls on the antlers of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced last year in the Kenneth Branagh-directed “Thor.” Loki, the bad-boy brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), plunks down on Earth so he can steal an all-powerful energy source called the Tesseract, which is a big, glowing cube.  None of that sits well with the crafty Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) from the covert S.H.I.E.L.D. organization. He summons a team of superheroes — dubbed the Avengers — to save the world, and maybe set up a sequel — or three. As you’d expect, getting everyone on the same superhero page isn’t easy, but it’s that tension between their dissimilar personalities that gives the story a compelling dramatic arc. It also allows the stars a chance to do some real acting, delineating their character’s strengths and weaknesses in a way you can’t see when the story’s all about just one of them. The friction is particularly evident in the exchanges between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans). As the sharply focused script probes the psyches of both men, the cocky, wisecracking Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) clashes mightily with the by-the-book sincerity of Steve Rogers (aka Captain America).  The rest in the cast all hold their own. Scarlett Johansson is sexy and tough as the cunning and acrobatic Black Widow. Jeremy Renner further cements his new action star status as he slings his arrows as Hawkeye. Hemsworth, as Thor, shows why he’s one of our more promising talents. And Jackson — relegated to tiny teaser roles in previous Marvel films — gets a chance to do more with the crucial Nick Fury part. The most pleasant surprise, though, is Mark Ruffalo, who is the best Hulk on film to date (sorry, Eric Bana and Edward Norton). As the brilliant, seemingly mild-mannered scientist with Jekyll and Hyde issues, Ruffalo makes Bruce Banner an eccentric loner living in fear of himself.  While everyone in the cast suits up like a pro, the person responsible for making “Avengers” such a smashing success is Whedon. He loads this blockbuster with clever, unexpected touches — like the guy who plays a video game aboard the airborne headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Even those who don’t know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. That’s because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.

"May 1, 2012"," CHICAGO – When I was a kid, summer movies were an event. They weren’t just marketing tricks, young adult adaptations, or unnecessary sequels. They were blockbusters that you put on the calendar and counted the days until their arrival. Something of that summer movie magic has been lost in recent years – the sense that you weren’t just seeing a movie, you were experiencing something special. I felt that again watching “The Avengers,” a high quality, incredibly entertaining, joyous summer event. If I was 12, it would be my favorite movie ever made.  If you liked “Iron Man,” “Captain America,” or “Thor,” I would be baffled if you didn’t love “The Avengers.” It’s really that simple. It’s, by far, the best movie involving these characters and rivals for placement on the list of the best superheroes movies ever made. The first half is a bit talky and the film is naturally crowded but all criticism falls away during the final hour, which is quite simply one of the most impressive and entertaining hours of action in movie history. Writer/director Joss Whedon eschews the typical rollercoaster action formula of peaks and valleys for what is essentially one giant hill. He takes you up slowly for about ninety minutes and then plunges you through some of the most well-choreographed, well-written, and riveting action in years for the last sixty. Overall, Whedon has gotten so much right here where other Marvel directors did not. Kenneth Branagh, Jon Favreau, and Joe Johnson should take notes. Naturally, the first act of “The Avengers” has two goals – set up the villain and get the band together, something that good Marvel movie fans know has been in the works for years. Where the villains have been weak in most of the Marvel films, Whedon is not about to give short shrift to his bad guy, giving Tom Hiddleston’s Loki some of the best dialogue and most remarkable scenes in the film. This is a great superhero villain and Hiddleston completely delivers, playing Loki as both charismatic and remarkably weak. He is a villain who feels he is born to rule but knows deep in his character that he is unable to do so. It’s a great big bad and a stellar performance. But you don’t go to “The Avengers” for the bad guy. You go for the heroes. And you know most of them by now. Robert Downey Jr. returns as Iron Man/Tony Stark (with a cameo by Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts), Chris Evans does the most charismatic work of his career as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth appears as Thor, Scarlett Johansson really delivers as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson moves from cameo player to regular as Nick Fury’s role is notably beefed up here. Mark Ruffalo steps into the oversized shoes of Bruce Banner as the third actor to play The Hulk on film and is fantastic, better than Eric Bana or Edward Norton. “The Avengers” stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Stellan Skarsgard, Cobie Smulders, Clark Gregg, and Tom Hiddleston. It was written and directed by Joss Whedon. It is rated PG-13 and opens on May 4, 2012.

"May 1, 2012"," It was not that long ago that more of the world’s people had too little to eat than ate too much. Now the scales have tipped. A recent study in the Lancet describes how more than ONE BILLION  people were classified as obese in 2022 -  the latest year for which data are available.  It found obesity rates have doubled among adults since 1990,  just three decades ago, and more worryingly, they’ve quadrupled among children and adolescents. Phil Clark will discuss obesity and measures to counter it, on and individual and community level, with Professor Luigi Fontana of the Charles Perkins ""Health for Life program"". Luigi has great expertise in longevity - and certainly being obese isn’t such a good thing if you want a long life.  What goes into making a commuter rail system safe, efficient, clean and appealing?  We look at the considerations that go into making commuter transit rail systems work well. Phil Clark will speak to a panel of experts in this field, including Catherine Rinaldi,  President of MTA Metro-North Railroad which is the commuter railroad that serves the suburbs north of New York City. The federal government is embarking on an ambitious quest to have more manufacturing in Australia, with its 'Future Made in Australia Act', using  government intervention to try to attract investment in clean energy and advanced manufacturing projects.. One area which offers promise is decarbonisation of steel. That is, instead of using coal to heat iron ore in furnaces to make steel, other forms of energy are used. Australia is the world’s foremost exporter of iron ore, accounting for as much as 53 per cent of global exports annually. The process of decarbonising the iron and steel value chain stands to deliver a substantial contribution to global efforts aimed at reducing emissions. A team of University of Wollongong researchers has secured $4.2 million funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and industry partner BlueScope Steel to investigate ways to utilise low and medium grade iron ore in low emission steelmaking and further decarbonise domestic steel production.  Phil Clark will discuss the future of steelmaking with a range of informed voices. What is it about the romance of wooden boats that draws us to them? Wood has been the consistent and reliable fabric of boats throughout history and for many, wooden boats have a soul – they move through the water differently from today’s fibreglass, aluminium and steel boats. Wooden boats flex, groan and creak. They each have unique characters. Indigenous Australians have long built wooden craft – canoes – to navigate the continent’s waterways. Then boat building became an important colonial industry. And wooden boats for sport, leisure, yachting and racing became part of the nation’s maritime traditions. Phil Clark speaks to wooden boat historians and enthusiasts about Australia's wooden boats – past and present.

"Apr 30, 2012"," Marvel’s The Avengers, Whedon’s massive ensemble summation of the Marvel Studios superhero films of the past few years, works well enough on the big screen: the action breathes, the frame is cleverly filled, the 3-D is negligible – well, unless you want to see anything that happens in the darkness of space, but let’s not get too picky. Still, The Avengers never owns the big screen the way it’s owned by, say, Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. What The Avengers does best – capture the nuances of relationships among a rich set of characters – could be done even better as part of an episodic series (Whedon’s own “Firefly” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” are often cited as prime examples). Sure, the action in an “Avengers” series would look smaller on TV, but they could always save the bangs and booms for a theatrically released series finale. Which, in a weird way, is where we are at with The Avengers. With separate lead-in films centered on Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, The Avengers is meant to be something of a culmination. The result – an extravaganza that’s a cross between Whedon’s Serenity and an onscreen Comic-Con – isn’t less than the sum of its parts as much as it is better than some parts (The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man 2) and less than others (Iron Man, Thor). S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) disagrees, so he assembles his motley crew of superheroes. Once we get past the requisite tough-guy posturing (the Thor vs. Iron Man, Hulk vs. Thor and Captain America vs. Iron Man beat-downs grow a bit tiresome), this group turns into an entertaining collection of grumbling, hubristic, competitive and disordered personalities. With Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) spitballing insults, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) booming pronouncements, Captain America (Chris Evans) trying to keep the peace and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) grimacing in the corner, the best scenes play like a prickly family reunion. Only instead of your crabby aunt sniping at you, she turns into a giant green beast.  The most engaging of this group is, interestingly, the newest. Ruffalo, stepping into the role of Bruce Banner/the Hulk, brings something vital to the part: fearful resignation. It’s not only that Banner has a gamma-powered temper; he’s both afraid and mournful over it. Disheveled and downcast, Ruffalo gives Banner a fatalism that makes him the most human of the bunch. (As for whether or not the animators have finally given us a believable CGI Hulk, I’d say we’re closer now – maybe only 10 years away.) The Hulk’s appearances coincide with the film’s two major action set pieces: an attack on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s gargantuan airship and the climactic battle in New York City. The first felt a bit obligatory – as if Whedon was working from a checklist so that he made sure each Avenger had something crucial to do – but that finale is effortlessly thrilling. Especially impressive is an uninterrupted “shot” – I’m sure computer stitching came into play – that swoops from one feat of derring-do to another so we get a sense of the teamwork at play. Ultimately The Avengers is light stuff, though I did appreciate how it picks up a thematic thread found in both Iron Man and Thor (and many of the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics that inspired them). With their geniuses and superheroes and aliens, these Marvel narratives center on figures with godlike powers, yet their emphasis is always on the human. What makes a hero in this Marvelous universe isn’t the awesomeness of their unearthly abilities, but their restraint in putting those abilities to use. If the Avengers of the 1960s were something of an in-house word of caution to a United States flexing its Cold-War muscles, then this Avengers is no less instructive to a U.S. that stands as the lone superpower of today. As for Whedon, here’s hoping he turns down that inevitable Avengers sequel offer and manages to sell Marvel – and these stars – on a TV spinoff instead.",POSITIVE

	Everything that works in “The Avengers” really works, but not everything works in “The Avengers.” A virtuoso collection of action set pieces framed by an uninspiring “getting the team together” narrative which should have been accomplished in all of those post-credits sequences in earlier Marvel movies, Joss Whedon’s stab at superheroes delivers plenty of what makes both him and his subject matter appealing, as well as an abundance of mythological set-up that’s somehow simultaneously redundant and contradictory. But as the best (or perhaps most consistently engaging) Marvel movie since the original “Iron Man,” “The Avengers” is a winning piece of popcorn entertainment that does better with characters in an ensemble setting than many ever did when they starred in their own vehicles. 	The film stars a depressingly inactive Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who tracks down Earth’s mightiest heroes after Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) attacks a government facility, steals an extraterrestrial artifact called the Tesseract, and enslaves a handful of folks we think of as “the good guys,” including Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Fury enlists Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to approach fugitive physician Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and then contacts Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to join the team. But when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) shows up to shepherd Loki back to Asgard without regard for his mortal counterparts’ plans, Fury finds the superheroes at odds with one another. Boarding S.H.I.E.L.D.’s airship, the members of the burgeoning supergroup strike a tenuous truce, but each faces his own moral quandary even as they’re forced to band together and fight off a literal army of extraterrestrial attackers Loki unleashes upon the planet. First and foremost, “The Avengers” is unequivocally the best “Hulk” movie ever made; as much as I admire Ang Lee’s artsy take on the character, Whedon gets both Hulk and Banner in a way that no one else has, lending a light touch to the doctor’s melancholy, and a serious, scary edge to the monster’s rambunctious destruction. (It certainly helps that Ruffalo offers a performance as Banner that’s the most sympathetic and endearing since Bill Bixby.) But Whedon gets the superhero stuff right across the board, creating versions of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor that are faithful to their origins (much less previous film appearances) but which are also adeptly contextualized in a new environment where those personalities would create terrific, interesting conflicts. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers seem like natural opposites, but their animosity comes from Rogers’ line-towing loyalty and Stark’s self-serving bravado, and Whedon maximizes that as both a subplot and one of the film’s prime directives: to assemble a team from some unwieldy candidates. 	That said, the movie’s first hour is devoted to rounding up these characters, telling us where they’ve been, and giving us a sense of how well (or poorly) they might jell with the rest of the team. And that would be fine, if (1) every Marvel movie since 2008 hadn’t featured an easter-egg sequence where Nick Fury said, “come join the Avengers initiative,” and (2) there was any consistent or sensible reason for everyone to be doing what they are, where they are. In particular, Thor and Loki’s respective introductions are the most problematic from a canon standpoint, since at the end of his film, Thor was stranded on Asgard and Loki was banished to some galactic abyss; while Whedon isn’t to blame for the poor choices of his predecessors, the decision to abandon that film’s ending – not to mention a coda that indicated Loki was controlling Dr. Erik Brevig (Stellan Skarsgård), who’s pointedly free at the beginning of “The Avengers” – comes as a disappointment to fans who were expecting all of these individual films to merge together in some seamless, intricate tapestry. This film more or less abandons any detail about the characters that isn’t generally well-known or accepted, begging the question why other filmmakers bothered to throw in those final-scene idiosyncrasies in the first place. The other, perhaps more significant problem is that Loki simply isn’t a formidable villain, not the least of which because his plans are pretty stupid. Hiddleston is a terrific actor, and he certainly makes Loki an interesting adversary for any one or two of the superheroes, but there’s almost nothing about him except for an entitled sense of superiority that indicates he couldn’t be taken out fairly easily if just a couple of the good guys teamed up. The beginning of the film reveals that one of his powers is controlling other people’s minds, but that’s largely abandoned by the time he’s essentially allowed himself to be taken prisoner; consequently, his plan to bring his enemies together and have them destroy one another feels unmotivated on their part and half-considered on his. It’s not even clear where S.H.I.E.L.D.’s airship is going in the first place, but that Loki has the presence of mind to unite his foes on it and then somehow manipulating them – without actually talking to them – into fighting one another is farfetched and illogical, even for the god of trickery. 	But the truth is that little of this matters once the third act kicks in, in which the Avengers arrive in New York just in time to see an alien army pour out of a wormhole in the sky and start attacking civilians. Better than any filmmaker of a Marvel movie thus far, Whedon understands and executes large-scale action that utilizes all of the characters involved and creates palpable drama, even when our heroes’ victory is all but completely assured. And those scenes are funny, scary and exciting – true epic storytelling – without undermining the seriousness of the possibility of the world ending, or more identifiably, the deaths of thousands of New York citizens. Again, Hulk manages to be the movie’s biggest surprise as Whedon perfectly captures his irreverent rage, in one moment destroying a giant alien beast and in the next bashing a single adversary to a pulp with delicious glee. Each hero’s skill set is thoroughly well-utilized, both from a strategic standpoint and a narrative one, and Whedon effectively makes even the less flashy characters – Black Widow and Hawkeye – feel essential to the team’s overall efforts.

"Apr 30, 2012"," What is surprising is the film’s wobbly structure. From its oddly static opening sequence — set in a featureless military complex not much removed from the similar nerve center of writer-director Joss Whedon’s other mélange “The Cabin in the Woods” — you get the sense that the screenwriters were low on ideas before they ever began.  Model-turned-actress Cobie Smulders doesn’t help matters with one of the worst supporting character performances of the past five years as Agent Maria Hill. Talk about scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. For all the breathless hoopla over putting together Marvel’s dream-team of action stars, insufficient attention has been given to tracking down a modern-day Robert Altman capable of weaving together the manifold characters into a cohesive story that fires on all spark plugs.  Samuel L. Jackson is one such casualty as Nick Fury, the eye-patch-wearing head of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), a shadow government agency conjectured to be as corrupt as, well, every other arm of America’s corporate-controlled industrial military complex. Fury gets his posterior anatomy handed to him by Thor’s megalomaniac [adopted] brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who pops down from Asgard to steal away the hugely volatile Tesseract cube that Captain America pulled from the ocean in his plan to destroy the earth faster than you can say ""Fukushima squared."" Buzzing around the globe in his invisible airship — à la George W. Bush in Air Force One on 9/11 — Agent Fury assembles the Avengers, who includes Iron Man, Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Naturally, there’s some mutual respect to be earned among the profoundly disparate superheroes via some sharp verbal sniping and a few bouts of obligatory physical combat. For all the film’s many battles, none approach the pure dynamism that Sam Raimi pumped into “Spider-Man 2’s” brilliant action sequences. The film’s boisterous climax mêlée in the airspace over Manhattan has all the drama of a fixed fight.  Most egregious is the film’s failure of the CGI department to make The Hulk look like a real character. Every shot of the giant green wrath machine makes you say, “Why is this cartoon character pretending like he’s one of the gang?” Don’t hold your breath waiting for the next solo Hulk movie to go into production. It’s a sad state of affairs when Lou Ferrigno of the Hulk television series from thirty years ago still looks better than what state-of-the-art CGI can deliver in 2012. Despite its $220 million dollar price tag, “Marvel’s The Avengers” is sure to make its money back.

"Apr 30, 2012"," Let me sprint  right to the point: The Avengers has it all. And then some. Six superheroes for the price of one ticket: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow and the Hulk. It’s also the blockbuster I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It’s Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor. Suck on that, Michael Bay. All hail the warrior king of this dizzying, dazzling 3D action epic. That would be writer-director Joss Whedon, enjoying the afterglow of stellar reviews for deconstructing horror in The Cabin in the Woods. Here, in his second directing feature (after Serenity), Whedon stages the most exultantly good-humored, head-on, rousing series of traps and escapes since Spielberg was a pup. It’s Citizen Kane for Citizen Geek. The plot is merely functional. The world will end if Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the banished demigod, has his way. Loki hates his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and lusts to destroy Earth with help from an alien army. As head of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has one recourse: Bring in the Avengers, a group of paragons with a rep for not playing well with others. That’s the conflict, and the signal to unleash the FX. But Whedon is exploring richer ground. He sees the Avengers as the ultimate dysfunctional family. Their powers have estranged them from the normal world. As a result, they’re lonely, cranky, emotional fuck-ups, which the actors have a ball playing. Robert Downey Jr. still seems blissfully right as Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man  (there’s a disarming tickle in his portrayal). He mocks the costume of Captain America (a canny Chris Evans) and calls the World War II hero an “old man.” The captain wonders what’s under that iron suit, sparking a priceless Downey deadpan: “Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.” There’s no doubt that the two Iron Man hits overshadowed Thor, Captain America and two Hulk movies at the box office. But Downey doesn’t hog the spotlight. Hemsworth’s giant-size Thor gets big laughs dismissing his comrades in arms (“You’re all so tiny”). And everyone gets to show their skill sets, including Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the expert arch­er, and Natasha, a.k.a. the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a killer in gymnastics and martial arts. Johansson has a terrific bit dispatching some Russian goons with her hands literally tied behind her back. And wait till you see the funny and touching stuff the sly Clark Gregg does as Agent Phil Coulson. Mark Ruffalo is the newcomer to the team, replacing Edward Norton and Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the nuclear physicist with anger issues that turn him into a hulking green rage machine. Ruffalo brings a scruffy warmth and humor to the role that’s revelatory. His verbal sparring with Downey – two pros at the top of their games – is a pleasure to watch. And, wonder of wonders, the tech­ies finally get the scale of the Hulk right. The computerized unjolly green giant is a jumbo scene-stealer. And it’s hard not to cheer when Hulk wipes up the floor with Loki. Speaking of Loki, and it’s hard not to, bring on a shower of praise for Hiddleston. A superhero movie is only as good as its villain, and Hiddleston is dynamite. The role of Loki demands intuition, wit and crazy daring, and Hiddleston brings it. The British actor (War Horse, The Deep Blue Sea) is a force to reckon with. Loki claims early in the film that his heart “burns with glorious purpose.” He’s got nothing on Whedon, a filmmaker who knows that even the roaringest action sequences won’t resonate without audience investment in the characters. Whedon is not afraid to slow down to let feelings sink in. Fanboy heresy, perhaps, but the key to the film’s super­smart, supercool triumph. In the final third, when Whedon lets it rip and turns the battle intensity up to 11, all your senses will be blown. I have one word for The Avengers: Wowza!",POSITIVE

"Apr 30, 2012"," Apart from being supersmart, Joss Whedon has the perfect credentials to write and direct a colossal commercial construct like Marvel’s The ­Avengers: He plainly loves the opportunity to put these comic-book icons—Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth)—in one room and let them hang out, spar (with words as well as hammers, shields, etc.), and weigh the merits of individualism versus teamwork. Really—debate is as important to him as “Hulk, smash!” The movie would be all over the place if not for Whedon’s centrifugal seriousness. And it would be overbearingly pompous if not for his nifty ability to spoof his subjects without devaluing them.

I also, as I watched, thought, Wow, that must have cost a lot of money … money … money … waves of money. There aren’t many shots without fancy CGI or mighty sets occupied by dreamy men and women with finely sculpted bottoms. Even if scenes of superheroes whooshing around Manhattan and battling an armada from the realm of Asgard look like video games, you have to admire a hot-dog shot like the one in which the camera zigs and zags to catch every single Avenger in midair, bashing and crashing and hammering for all they’re worth (plenty). The frames have the thrust of good comic-book illustrations without overdoing it, and Whedon picks his moments to come at ya with 3-D: Here and there, a spear will tickle your nostril hairs. On the human front, the stunt doubles—especially ­Scarlett Johansson’s, whose name is, I swear, Heidi Moneymaker—are gratifyingly elastic. You might as well revel in this thing. It’s like all-day room service at the Ritz. The villain, introduced in Thor, is called Loki and played by Tom Hiddleston, whose name invokes dyslexia—I always type, “Tim Huddleston.” By any name, he’s a magnificently theatrical presence. He’s after a tesseract that will open a portal to Asgard. The larger point is that he wants to “free the world from freedom.” He thinks that, deep down, humans long to follow orders, reminding Captain America—transformed from a puny dork to fight the ­Nazis—of another mad Fascist. The Avengers have a hard time focusing on Loki, though, since they drive one another loco. We all like to play the game, “Who would win in a fight, Dracula or Frankenstein? King Kong or Godzilla? Palin or Bachmann?” Here, you get shield versus hammer. Hammer versus iron suit. Shield versus Hulk. Nobody wins, but a lot of trees, windows, and expensive-looking control panels lose. Samuel L. Jackson’s S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury lectures his wayward charges like the world’s dullest headmaster. (Jackson brings nothing to the part.) For some reason, Whedon has the obnoxious Tony Stark (Downey) work on Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), who’s diligently practicing anger management, to let out his inner Hulk, as if their flying battleship is some kind of est seminar. Shambling, attractively mussed Ruffalo ignores him and steals every scene. Whedon gives some sweet moments to Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, now part government liaison, part fanboy. He gets especially moony around Evans’s rather colorless Captain, whose most expressive feature is his muscular torso. Multiple protagonists means that by the time you’ve had your fill of snotty Iron Man you get the wooden Captain, and when you’re bored with the Captain, you get the Norse hottie. Or Johansson, who comes into her own. Over the years, Johansson’s once-refreshing self-confidence has become an irritant (the vibe is now snobbish), but her Natasha Romanoff–Black Widow is a treat, her deadpan prickling with rage and hurt. The Avengers is full of terrific comebacks (Captain: “We need a plan of attack.” Iron Man: “I have a plan—attack!”), and Whedon never lets us forget that, in the words of one bureaucrat, the fate of the human race has been left to “a handful of freaks.” The problem is, what now? Can we watch another Iron Man flick without thinking, “Why doesn’t he get on the phone to Banner? Natasha is rested and ready. Thor is just a portal away.” We’re spoiled. We’ll always be thinking, “Show me the money!” A charming, funny, reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory, The Five-Year Engagement is about a rising San Francisco chef, Tom (Jason Segel), who sets aside his career to relocate to a less-desirable city (Ann Arbor) when his fiancée, Violet (Emily Blunt), gets into a prestigious academic program—and feels his manhood slipping away. That’s what a fella can expect when he puts his woman first. An unfair reading? No, it’s pretty explicit. Directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script he wrote with Segel, The Five-Year Engagement has a tidy scenario. Tom and Violet get engaged as fireworks erupt over San Francisco Bay. Their families celebrate. Then Violet gets accepted into the University of Michigan’s social-psychology department. She explains to Tom that her mother gave up a promising career for her father, and that she won’t make that mistake. Better to put off the wedding and pull up stakes. But once Tom hits the Midwest, this onetime culinary star is reduced to making sandwiches at Zingerman’s Deli. His new best friend, Bill (Chris Parnell), is a househusband who takes care of the kid, hunts, and knits puffy sweaters. It should be said that Violet is not a stereo­typical emasculating female, but her fate is out of her hands. There’s a subordinate couple for contrast, adorable Alison Brie as Violet’s ditzy sister, Suzie, and Chris Pratt as Tom’s immature San Francisco assistant, Alex. They drunkenly hook up, she gets pregnant, and, like the protagonists of Apatow’s Knocked Up, they end up married, with Alex taking Tom’s place as San Francisco’s new star chef. Suzie took the plunge that her sister couldn’t take, made babies, and is now snug and happy. If you overlook its message, The Five-Year Engagement is enjoyable. It’s long—over two hours—but mainly because Stoller loves his actors and gives them room to play. Blunt blurts her lines and pulls funny faces, and what a funny, gorgeous face she has to pull. Segel’s lumbering body fits his character, who can’t keep pace with his own emotions. But that message: Do Stoller, ­Segel, and Apatow believe that women should be more like Suzie, for whom a drunken one-night stand and accidental pregnancy prove a blessing? As a capper, Violet’s social-psychology experiments turn out to be ridiculous and lead her, in a roundabout way, to conclude that Tom, her obvious soul mate, is all wrong for her. Those five years teach Violet and Tom nothing except that waiting—and planning and thinking—is for dumb schmucks.",POSITIVE

"Apr 29, 2012"," Seven years after the idea that the remaining heroes of the Marvel universe should finally have their time to shine on the big screen, in steps one of the world's biggest comic-book nerds to maintain order, in an otherwise unruly and overly competitive arena. Joss Whedon, a seasoned scribe (of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel fame) with only one previous directorial outing to his name, marshals matters effectively throughout, without losing sight of that other key demographic: those who dispensed with their comic books long ago. For what he lacks in flair - particularly compared with Kenneth Branagh (who directed Thor) - he makes up for in due diligence. In Whedon's world, every superhero gets a fair go: none is allowed to outshine the other. The story does, however, derive from the type of geek gathering one expects to find in a comic store. Indeed, as evil deity Loki (Hiddleston) arrives on planet Earth via a mysterious portal called the Tesseract, with global domination uppermost in his mind (and some fairly standard space monsters behind), you might be hard-pressed to fathom what they're actually wittering on about, and longing for Iron Man, Thor or even Captain America to resume control. But fear not, Earthlings: for once S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Nick Fury (Jackson) begins his governmental Avenger Initiative, the familiar return swiftly for a gag-soaked ride of near-epic proportions. Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Downey jnr), is soon firing wisecracks at WWII hero Captain America (Evans) for his overly serious patriotism, while Thor (Australia's Hemsworth, back speaking like a Shakespearean druid) and the Hulk (Ruffalo) rile one another throughout. Only sharpshooter Hawkeye (Renner) and super-spy Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Johansson), are relatively unknown. Screen time is divided up in suitably democratic fashion. What's most gratifying about this super-size superhero-fest, though, is its ability to pull back, to infuse a degree of subtlety in an exercise that at any moment could appear bloated. The return of the Hulk - Ruffalo being the third actor in modern times to try his hand at the troubled green giant - is indicative of this. When the beast within does emerge, he's pure, unadulterated Hulk: handy when fighting an alien army. When inside S.H.I.E.L.D.'s rather nifty underwater cum invisible flying machine, the Hulk - or, rather, his tortured human version, Bruce Banner - is awkward, withdrawn and largely silent, donning ill-fitting clothes with a quiet sense of foreboding. Ruffalo's take on this is one of the film's unexpected delights: after Eric Bana's and Ed Norton's ill-fated outings on screen, we finally have a new Hulk that's just the right shade of green. Even creator Stan Lee, in his customary cameo, seems to be nodding his approval. Indeed, the only real gripe to be had with this latest Marvel offering is its running time. At almost 2½ hours, it - like many big-budget affairs - doesn't appear to know when to wrap. Why is it so hard for studios to keep matters feeling both urgent and concise? A tightly wound 110 minutes would have sufficed. Similarly, Jackson still appears surplus to requirements in these films: a scenario once unthinkable. Although given more to do here, his take on Nick Fury feels too, well, cartoony, given the urgency of what's about to unfold. That aside, Whedon's dream ticket as a writer-director looks set to clean up, ahead of other mammoth comic-book blockbusters (The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises) due in the coming months. A third Iron Man outing is also under way, with return visits for Thor and Captain America both due to kick off later this year. The Marvel universe has never felt busier, nor more lucrative. And, Iron Man 2 aside, the tone remains all but pitch-perfect. Certainly, to get geeks and non-geeks sitting side by side in a theatre takes some doing. The challenge now is to retain - or even better - that, with the various, colossal outings that lie ahead. As Thor himself might say, ""Marvel, will you make them so?""",POSITIVE

"Apr 27, 2012"," Well, the gang's all here. I imagine that the contractual negotiations and script wrangles behind the filming of the classic Marvel Comics series The Avengers would add up to the plot for a mini-series but they certainly did the trick. Writer-director Joss Whedon has come up with a screenplay that not only accords equal time to all members of Marvel's stable of super-egos, it squeezes in a liberal shot of wit, as well. Naturally enough, most of the jokes are about status anxiety. Only mild-mannered Bruce Banner is immune to the condition. He's so worried about the risk of arousing his alter-ego, the Hulk - or ''the other guy'', as he calls him - that he's happy to leave the grandstanding to the rest of the team. Big things are resting on The Avengers' performance. It cost $US220 million ($214 million) and Disney is hoping desperately that it will compensate for recent disappointments, the most serious of which was John Carter, the studio's last excursion into the big-budget fantasy market. Its price was about $US250 million and its failure to fire has helped force the studio's chairman, Rich Ross, out of his job. The success of Robert Downey jnr in Iron Man in 2008 brought Marvel's fractious family of superheroes together. The producer, Kevin Feige, discovered that the rights to Iron Man's stablemates hadn't been snapped up by the competition and he made his move. In preparation, Thor, the Hulk and Captain America were all re-introduced to the box office as stars of their own movies. Then came the delicate business of reuniting them to save the world in general and Disney's production slate in particular. Tantalising gossip emerged from the set. Downey jnr, the group's biggest moneymaker, initially thought the script should reflect Iron Man's status as Head Boy, before graciously coming round to Whedon's view that he should settle for being an especially alpha member of the team. After that, we're led to believe, all went swimmingly and the only sulks were the ones seen on screen. The team is recruited by Samuel L. Jackson, wearing a piratical black eyepatch. He's reprising his role as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., a world peacekeeping agency facing an interplanetary emergency. The Tesseract, a mysterious energy source that is able to supply the Earth with unlimited power, has been hijacked by alien forces - or rather, one particularly ornery example of the breed. On Thor's planet, Asgard, his delinquent adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has run amok, deciding he wants to rule Earth simply because his more privileged sibling is very fond of the place. And before Fury can get his superheroes assembled, Loki has landed, running off with the Tesseract and kidnapping two of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s key people - a physicist, Professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an agent whose archery skills make him a semi-superhero. Whedon has been surprisingly artful in persuading us to take this stuff with something more positive than a hoot of derision. He hasn't camped it up. If anything, he's dressed it down. Iron Man's alter ego, Tony Stark, favours a Black Sabbath T-shirt, while Banner - an engagingly self-deprecating Mark Ruffalo - is in rumpled linen, having come straight from doing good works in an Indian leper colony. Captain America (Chris Evans) is the only one who spends much time in his suit. Strictly speaking, he's the senior member of the team but he's hardly in a commanding position since he's spent the past 67 years suspended in an ice block in the Arctic tundra. When it comes to modern manners and morals, he's still feeling a bit frigid, and Stark's quips at his expense do nothing to thaw him out. Stark also likes to bait Thor (Chris Hemsworth), picking on his archaic turn of phrase with taunts about him being perfect casting for Shakespeare in the Park. On the other hand, Stark and Banner bond instantly over their shared mastery of scientific jargon. It's not a Boys' Own club. Fury has a fearless female deputy (Cobie Smulders) and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, with her acrobatic martial arts repertoire, is another S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the semi-superhero class. She also scores the most eye-catching introductory sequence, with a program of stunts that should be seen rather than described. Against such a team, the forces of evil could seem woefully understaffed with only Loki to control them but the British Hiddleston employs a patrician manner and an upper-class drawl to produce a performance so arrogant it even transcends his funny hat. And, finally, Whedon really does know how to handle 3D, combining it with a fluid camera style to lend scale, perspective and drama enough to keep disbelief at bay for astonishingly lengthy stretches of time. The whole thing is too long but with all those jostling egos to accommodate, that was inevitable. At least we're in entertaining company all the way.",POSITIVE
"Apr 27, 2012"," A never before seen grouping of Marvel superheroes comes together in this mega blockbuster that Disney surely hopes will recoup the losses made on John Carter. The villain here is the would-be tyrant Loki (Tom Hiddleston), God of mischief, who has stolen the Tesseract power cube to summon an army of alien nasties from another dimension and invade Earth. It’s serious business, undercut with the wry irreverence of director Joss Whedon, who skilfully mixes comedy and violence, irony and patriotism. The confrontations between Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark, the droll alter ego of Iron Man often found speaking in inverted commas, and Chris Evans's irony- free, unreconstructed World War 2 hero Captain America sum up the film’s twin thematic motors. This dual sensibility often makes the violence double the fun, too.  Late in the movie, when the Hulk cuts short an evil monologue with a sudden, outrageously violent slap-down, it’s enough to make you recoil and laugh at once. Fanboys and girls at my preview were hollering with delight, which gives you some indication that Whedon is on to a winning formula. Now some of these superheroes are dated. Captain America (Chris Evans), for instance, superpatriot and supersoldier, can only play to modern audiences with a big dash of irony. Whedon has him slumbering beneath the ice, awakening to a different world. Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, solid and stolid, is dealt with equally gently, and allowed one or two timely ripostes with his hammer. He melds nicely here, and plays much better in a gang than he did in his solo movie outing. His pre-school teacher should be pleased. It’s Robert Downey Jr’s billionaire playboy/inventor Tony Stark aka Iron Man who provides relief and presents healthy dashes of adult wit. For me, the film lifts every time he appears as Stark. And I wanted way, way more of Miss Pepper Potts! The big surprise is that the Hulk finally finds his feet. Whedon has used motion capture to provide Mark Ruffalo’s gently murmuring scientist Bruce Banner into a credible, and extremely useful Hulk. The balance is sweet here: Downey Jr and Ruffalo are allowed to give the only two adult performances in the movie. Every comic book needs a good villain: Tom Hiddelston’s Loki, let loose from Asgard, is not only better shot here than in solo outings but, given Whedon’s script, given much better lines to work with. He really pulls off a portrait of a silky, plausible, envious escaped villain. Whedon has given fans a nice balance of polished, but not infinitely protracted action, warring egos, and just enough wit to make it work—if superheroes are your go, that is.I confess I’m a bit picky about mine. Pedantic footnote: the plot all hinges on the battle for the power source called the Tesseract. Now the tesseract is a four-dimensional geometrical formation: it is to the cube, as the cube is to the square. Not even 3D can make this one work visually: it looks like a big white glowing, electrically charged icecube.",POSITIVE

"Apr 27, 2012"," There’s a clear presumption audiences will have seen the pictures that inspire this battle royal, accounting for a lack of fresh character development which undermines the relationship between the two heroes without a franchise. However, while psychological substance may be thin, exhilarating action-packed sequences abound, choreographed at breakneck pace by writer-director Joss Whedon, who knows how to seamlessly meld live action with digital trickery for maximum impact. Interestingly, he keeps the Avengers disjointed for most of the film, only bringing everyone together in the same location for the final showdown to decide mankind’s fate. Aided by an army of aliens, Loki steals it from the underground headquarters of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D, and enslaves scientist Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and ace marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to do his bidding. Desperate times call for innovative measures and Fury scours the globe for the ultimate team of superheroes, uniting the inflated egos and rippling muscles of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Avengers Assemble doesn’t quite scale the dizzy heights of the original Iron Man but for almost two-and-a-half hours we’re entertained and energised by Whedon’s distinctive vision of the Marvel universe. The writer-director gifts many of the best lines to Downey Jr. But there is also a lovely moment when Thor attempts to defend the actions of Loki, only to learn his scheming sibling has killed 80 people in two days.",POSITIVE
"Apr 27, 2012"," ‘The Avengers” is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is, is whelming. Iron Man shooting through the gastrointestinal tract of a giant space lizard like atomic vindaloo? WHELM! Hulk and Thor going at it on a ripped-up plane à la Itchy and Scratchy? WHELM!! Hordes of alien supertroopers hurtling into town at Grand Central Terminal with a singularity of purpose suggesting Long Island boys getting off the train on St. Patrick’s Day? WHELM!!! All of this blockbustery business is pleasing enough, but the surprising secret of Joss Whedon’s film is this: It’s best when the finally gathered Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America are just sitting around ragging on each other as though lounging in Central Perk. Yes, this is at heart super-“Friends,” a surprisingly witty comedy with a comic book wrapped around it. I won’t bore you with the details — mainly because the details bored me, and I can’t explain them anyway. There’s this little crystal cube called the Tesseract from the world of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). “I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose,” he declares, in a line of glorious awesomeness. Everyone wants the Tesseract because it’s a portal to the other world and/or a potential source of limitless power.  It’s being guarded by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the shop steward of the superheroes’ union, S.H.I.E.L.D., but Loki slips onto Earth to steal it while using a mind trick to persuade S.H.I.E.L.D.’s birdlike chief archer, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to turn evil. Now it’s time to gather the good guys. Round up the usual spandex!  Once gathered, along with Chris Evans’ Captain America (who seems to bore Whedon and isn’t given enough to do), the gang imprison Loki on their airship.  He gets to messing with everyone’s minds, Hannibal Lecter-style, and though this scene is slightly forced (if not as forced as a silly fight between Iron Man and Thor), it’s amusing to see the teammates’ personalities clash. Captain America’s un-ironic loyalty, honesty and respect for chain of command, for instance, grate on the self-centered, cynical and iconoclastic Tony Stark, while Thor and Hulk are as wary of one another as any other ’roid ragers.  Such is Whedon’s skilled playfulness that, without the movie getting too self-referential, everyone gets plenty of sharp lines, even the pilot trying to shoot down Hulk, who says, “Target engaged . . . Target angry!” Reaching for a bit of the underlying seriousness of “The Dark Knight,” though, Whedon can’t quite grasp it. He raises an interesting point by Loki that man loves to be subjugated, but doesn’t flesh it out (though he does bring in an awkward reference to Hitler’s spell over Germany).  Then it’s time for the booming and crashing to begin, with a gigantic climax centered on Tony Stark’s (imaginary) new Manhattan HQ near Grand Central, over which the alien portal to a nasty universe busts open.  There’s far too much merry chaos going on for any of it to really thrill, and working in all of these characters is inherently about as graceful as cat juggling. Still, Whedon keeps up the energy and keeps it good-humored. I’d rather watch Tony quip than Hulk smash or Thor hammer, but then again, the ripping mayhem of the finale illustrates an ancient truth: We all know that family reunions have a way of getting out of hand.",POSITIVE

Για να αντιμετωπίσει τη κακουργία του Loki που έκλεψε τον υπερκύβο για να υποδουλώσει τη Γη, ο Nick Fury καλεί τον Iron Man, τον Thor, τον Captain America, τον Hulk, και την υπόλοιπη παλιοπαρέα, μπας και φιλοτιμηθούν να γίνουν ομάδα.





Στα μέσα των 80s οι Keith Giffen και JM DeMatteis είχανε μετατρέψει με επιτυχία την αρμάδα υπερηρώων της DC --τη Justice League-- σε πάτο αστείων, σημειώνοντας έτσι καθοριστικά πως όλες αυτές οι φανταστικές ομάδες κυρίως για ανώριμο υπερβολικό δράμα είναι κατάλληλες, για fan fiction με άλλα λόγια. Καμιά εικοσπενταριά χρόνια αργότερα, ο Joss Whedon έκανε ουσιαστικά την ίδια παραδοχή για τη κινηματογραφική αρμάδα της Marvel, η ""πρώτη"" υπερηρωική ομάδα της βιομηχανίας είναι αναγκαστικά --σαν αρχετυπική, ανομοιογενής ως αλλοπρόσαλλη-- και η μπαλαφαρότερη, και στη πραγματικότητα η σημαντικότερη αποστολή των κουστουμαρισμένων τύπων με τις υπερδυνάμεις στους Avengers (2012) είναι να φτύνουν χιουμοριστικές ατάκες ενάντια στην υπερβολή, με ηγέτη φυσικά τον Tony Stark του Robert Downey Jr που το κάνει σα να μην υπάρχει αύριο για το σύμπαν ολόκληρο. Ο Whedon παρολαυτά και από την άλλη, σέβεται το pulp του υλικού του (που προέρχεται κατά κύριο λόγο από την ημι-υποψιασμένη αργυρή εποχή των κόμικς), συμπεριλαμβάνει μόνιμα πασπαλίσματα τύπου σφυρί του Thor να κοπανάει την ασπίδα του Captain America και να λείπουν μόνο τα WHAM! BANG! να γεμίζουν το δισέλιδο, ταΐζει απλόχερα τη φαντασία των μικρότερων θεατών θα 'λεγες, και το κάνει συνήθως με άψογα εφέ και στήσιμο των σκηνών, ακόμα και για τους ενήλικους ο σκεπτικισμός είναι δύσκολος τις περισσότερες φορές.


Εκεί βοηθάει και ο βασικός τεχνικός προσανατολισμός του σκηνοθέτη σε 16:9 και ""καθαρή"" ψηφιακή κινηματογράφηση, αυτή η τηλεοπτικούρα της φωτογραφίας φέρνει σβούρες στη πυξίδα των ορίων του θεατή, το υλικό τη μια μοιάζει με δημοσιογραφικό footage την άλλη με καμιά από τις σειρές του Whedon και σπάνια με κινηματογραφικό πλάνο, έτσι κάθε απομάκρυνση από τα στερεότυπα --και είναι πολλές αυτές-- αιφνιδιάζει ευχάριστα, και κάθε ολική επαναφορά γίνεται ομαλά. Ο σκηνοθέτης μοιράζει θαυμάσια ως θαυματουργά και τον χρόνο στο προσκήνιο όλων των χαρακτήρων, κάνει να φαίνεται εύκολη συνταγή αυτή η σούπα σύγχρονης ποπ κουλτούρας που αποτελεί την υπογραφή του, αλλά δε καταφέρνει να ξεφύγει τελικά από τη.. σούπα (με τη κακή έννοια) στο θέμα των κακών της ιστορίας, αυτοί καταλήγουνε σε ορδές απρόσωπων σκοτεινών τύπων πάνω σε ιπτάμενους ματρακάδες, που δε σε ενδιαφέρει αν οι Εκδικητές θα ξοδέψουνε μισή ή μια ώρα να τους κοπανάνε με μπουνιές κλωτσιές και ενίοτε σφυριές. Επιπλέον, είναι πολλές οι ατάκες Χάρη, και ο προϋπολογισμός είναι.. γήινος (αρκετά πάνω από $200M πάντως), έτσι τα δυο βασικά sets, το υπερσκάφος του SHIELD και η υπό επίθεση Νέα Υόρκη, μοιάζουνε περιορισμένα από κάποιο σημείο και μετά, αν όχι θεματικό πάρκο, παρότι γιγαντιαία. Το σενάριο έχει και σκοτεινούς τόνους, έχει επικαλύμματα με αλληγορίες για την εξουσία και την κατάχρησή της, και ο Whedon προσέχει να μη παίρνει τοις μετρητοίς τους μύθους για αστερόεσσες απέναντι στην υποχρεωτική Hitler-metaphor, αλλά φυσικά όλη η ιστορία είναι απλά φόντο για να καρφιτσώσει πάνω του τα πορτραίτα των ηρώων του ο σκηνοθέτης. Το πραγματικά νέο και πραγματικά σημαντικό που έχει να προσθέσει η παραγωγή στο Marvel-ικό σύμπαν, είναι μια ακόμα προσέγγιση στον Hulk που αυτή τη φορά φαίνεται και η οριστική· σε αντίθεση με τους υπόλοιπους ο Bruce Banner είναι ο κόμικ χαρακτήρας του 21ου αιώνα λίγο πολύ, ο Mark Ruffalo του δίνει μια μελαγχολική αλλοκοτιά με υποκριτική οσκαρικών αξιώσεων σε σχέση με τους άλλους στο καστ, και τα μάτια του μένουν να δίνουν ψυχή και στον πράσινο γίγαντα που έχει και με διαφορά τις πιο εκπληκτικές σκηνές στη διάρκεια.

"Apr 26, 2012"," In fact, if you take the shiny hardware of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Helicarrier headquarters and Downey Jr’s hipster wise-assery out of the mix for a moment, Whedon’s world conjures images of a 1960’s Hanna-Barbera TV-cartoon version – had there ever been one (a small-screen friendly 1.85:1 screen ratio bolsters the notion). His camera feels static, even when it is not; there is a simplicity to his shot composition and editing that subverts even the panels-per-page literary origins of Marvel’s super-group. Whedon has utilised a visual style that honours key team members antiquated beginnings lovingly yet captures the action with a contemporary precision. It is a simplicity that echoes the heart of The Avengers team, as well. These are heroes for whom there are no grey shadings in the fight against evil – Captain America (cast standout Chris Evans) is a mountain of 1940s stoicism; the bond that sleek operative Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) shares with assassin Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is unshakably honourable; Thor (Chris Hemsworth)...well, he’s Mr Perfect. Even Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who gets dragged from India against his substantial will, is clear as to his purpose in life – stay in control. Which means that their nemesis has to be black-as-night and powerful enough to pose a threat to all six of our protectors and the world in which we live. As Loki, wayward brother of Thor and commander of a legion bent on Earth’s domination, Tom Hiddleston emerges as arguably the film’s greatest asset. The scene in which he convinces Black Widow just how evil he can be is a cracking bit of screen villainy; he has many of Whedon’s best lines (in a film full of expertly-written, well-timed humour) and the actor, lean but entirely commanding on screen, chews them with maniacal glee. Not everything about The Avengers completely satisfies. The first act works over a lot of origin exposition that will play well to the fanbase but was a plod to non-comic types (like me); the first big-bang action sequence delivers though it felt like a while coming. Samuel L Jackson’s posturing remains all-wrong as S.H.I.E.L.D. boss Nick Fury (watching Clark Gregg, as the much-loved Agent Coulson, cower to Fury feels wrong). Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark/Iron Man continues his slide into douche-baggery; his smugness has gotten less charming with each screen outing. And, unless I missed some co-ordinates-relevant plotpoint, I can’t figure why Loki would choose the skies over Manhattan to land his army rather than, say, a paddock in Russia. But The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble or Marvel’s The Avengers – I’ve seen them all used) gets it wonderfully right where it needed to the most. Each hero has ample time in their own spotlight (Ruffalo’s Hulk shining brightest) yet Whedon constructs the enveloping sense of camaraderie seamlessly, all set against top-tier FX and a compelling narrative. Great review, but I have no idea where you get 3.5 stars out of that.  Ive seen many similarly raving (with a few caveats) reviews and its 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars.  Exactly how mindblowing, how life altering does a film have to be to get 4+ stars?  Does this have to do with Rotten Tomatoes or something.  Just curious. ""And, unless I missed some co-ordinates-relevant plotpoint, I can’t figure why Loki would choose the skies over Manhattan to land his army rather than, say, a paddock in Russia."" Arrogance, basically. As Stark said, the man ""needs an audience"". So I suppose you did miss the co-ordinates-relevant plotpoint, but I won't hold it against you - good review. I think you're not paying enough attention to the dialogues. You've missed a major point as OhJohnNo pointed out. To have missed this is like Ebert denouncing Star Trek 2009 as a failed movie because he missed the part about Nemo's ship jamming all communications and transporter. It seems there are other things you don't get as well, base on your review, but they could be understandable since you said you're not a comic book fan, even in the slightest I would think so as well since I'm in that category and know. There's a reason for the enemy, there's a reason why it's on top of Stark building, there's a reason why Loki just doesn't outright destroy as much as he could already, etc. All the answers are in the dialogues to be honest. I suggest that you watch it again and pay much more attention to the dialogues. Can it be that the action sequences might have thrown you off? Just curious.",POSITIVE
"Apr 26, 2012"," COMIC-BOOK fans everywhere can relax. Cult TV wordsmith Joss Whedon may have relatively little experience as a feature filmmaker, but he proves a perfect choice to write and direct The Avengers, the long-awaited mega-blockbuster from Marvel Studios, in which evil is vanquished by the all-star line-up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - both pictured - some guy who shoots arrows (Jeremy Renner), and Scarlett Johansson in a leather catsuit. Overseeing this particular dollhouse is international spy chief and Whedon stand-in Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), whose plan to assemble a superhero dream team is put back in action once Thor's smirkingly villainous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) zaps across the cosmos to Earth and starts wreaking his well-spoken brand of havoc. Whedon is presumably contractually bound to deliver the rote shock and awe of the climax - and the Hulk effects are admittedly terrific, though there are only so many times you can destroy Manhattan before the law of diminishing returns sets in. Underrated as a visual storyteller, he remains less interested in spectacle as such than in orchestrating abrupt shifts in tone and perspective, a skill-set well suited to ensemble drama (and to 3D). Above all, Whedon loves actors, especially actors delivering snappy put-downs. Most of the best and funniest scenes consist of verbal grudge matches between surrogate siblings with contrasting dictions - from Downey's rapid-fire snark to Ruffalo's affably menacing mumble, the Captain's gee-whiz sincerity and the faux-Elizabethan bombast of Loki and Thor. Conscious that the superhero genre tends to downgrade regular folk in relation to the glorious few, Whedon finesses the political problem partly by making Loki an explicit fascist, partly by rendering the Avengers clubhouse as a mini-democracy where the currency is ridicule. That said, not many viewers will go away thinking anybody but Downey is the star - and whatever Whedon's claims to feminism, the fetchingly posed Johansson never transcends her status as ''The Chick''. Whedon can deconstruct the myth of heroism in his sleep, and probably does, but on this occasion he's here to redeem the cliches, not to bury them. Don't forget, we're dealing with a guy who asked to direct an episode of Glee. Somehow these crazy rag-tag misfits not only manage to save the planet but in the process put on quite a show.",POSITIVE
"Apr 26, 2012"," How many superheroes spoil the broth? More than six, apparently, at least when Joss Whedon is wrangling them. Because there’s an awful lot of stuff crammed into Marvel’s The Avengers. Not just six superheroes — and that’s being conservative in the counting of who deserves to be called a superhero, and there could be even more than that, to my mind, because the title change in the U.K. to Avengers Assemble was done under the seeming belief that British audiences would expect to see secret agent John Steed here otherwise… and that makes me think, you know, why not? (Not that John Steed had superpowers, but that’s a debate for another geekout.) That could only make this supercool, superfun movie all the more entertaining. But anyway, not just six superheroes but a real geek’s brew — that’s like a witch’s brew, but more awesome — of premises and possibilities. All of which somehow work together, don’t feel underdone, and leave us feeling like, for all its absurdity, everything we see is happening in a real space to real people. It’s damn near the sort of science fiction I was complaining only recently we don’t see much of, ever, at the movies: one crammed with big ideas, not necessarily the answers to life, the universe, and everything but at a minimum something that get us off this planet. For the bad guy here is Loki (Tom Hiddleston [Midnight in Paris, Thor], who just might steal the film), who looks like a god to us, though that’s just because of his sufficiently advanced science, and maybe he’s not even the real bad guy, cuz he’s working with some Skeletor-looking aliens from who-knows-where, and in Loki’s brief interactions with them (I think Whedon is saving more about them for the sequel), it doesn’t really look like Loki is the boss of them — more the other way around. And even before Loki Brings It to Earth with the Skeletor-aliens’ weapons, Nick Fury is already whipping up his Avengers’ enthusiasm for the fight by pointing out that our little planet is “hilariously outgunned.” That’s something I long to see more of in science fiction, too: Earth not being the biggest swinging dick in the galaxy. Cuz if and when we meet aliens, we probably won’t be. Sure, the typical alien invasion movie usually does feature more technologically advanced ETs… and then they get defeated by a nerd with computer virus or a naval officer who doesn’t even know The Art of War, which is preposterous. (You’d think the aliens, being not only more technologically but more culturally advanced than us would have their own Art of War, which would be more insightful and more applicable, certainly against a puny human who doesn’t even understand our pathetic excuse for the height of military philosophy.) Here, at least, extraordinary mutant humans — plus one of Loki’s godlike fellows — are required to even begin to think about Earth taking on aliens. So that’s something. But Avengers doesn’t stop there: it has barely even begun. This is a movie that is fantasy, science fantasy, and science fiction all at the same time. There’s ancient gods and magic-seeming technology and stuff that feels like science fiction but is probably more like fantasy (I’m thinking of a thing I won’t spoil, but I saw it on Doctor Who before it was here!) and stuff that feels like science fantasy but is probably closer to reality than we expect (I’m thinking of the Iron Man armor). It’s crammed with the sweet earnestness of Chris Evans’ (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Losers) man-out-of-time Steve Rogers/Captain America, and of he’s-not-human-so-he-doesn’t-get-our-jokes Thor (Chris Hemsworth: The Cabin in the Woods, A Perfect Getaway) — and that’s countered by the steely black humor of Samuel L. Jackson’s (The Samaritan (aka Fury), The Other Guys) Nick Fury and the snark of Robert Downey Jr.’s (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Due Date) Tony Stark/Iron Man; honestly, whenever the movie is verging close to taking itself too seriously, Stark is ready with a snide comment about the ridiculousness of it all. It’s not all silly, though. One quietly spectacular scene has Stark and Mark Ruffalo’s (Date Night, The Kids Are All Right) Bruce Banner — when he’s not being the Hulk — comparing the nightmares of their lives as their own scientific guinea pigs; it’s riveting moment in which two fascinating actors make authentically human what could easily be no more than cartoon characters. Whedon (The Cabin in the Woods, Serenity) and fellow screenwriter Zak Penn (The Incredible Hulk, X-Men: The Last Stand) have created an expansive sense that all of these people have lives apart from what we see here… and they’re not all dark moments, either. It goes beyond just showing us from where all these superheroes must be gathered — as when Scarlett Johansson’s (We Bought a Zoo, Iron Man 2) Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow goes to India to collect Bruce Banner, where he’s been hiding from himself by doctoring to poor people — or filling in their backgrounds, as when Natasha reveals, to Loki, her past (in an amazing moment of sly drama) with Jeremy Renner’s (Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, The Town) Clint Barton/Hawkeye. That’s standard narrative stuff, if done well here. It comes, too, in small moments that could easily have been cut, if action were all the movie was concerned about, as in one brief exchange between Stark’s nonsuperpowered assistant/lover Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow: Contagion, Country Strong) and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s nonsuperpowered Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), which is just delightful in all that it hints about what happens offscreen when everyone isn’t saving the world. I haven’t read the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comics this is all drawn from. I have no idea how faithful it is to anything. All I know is what I see here: when you pull in a terrifyingly talented cast of serious actors to play superheroes in spandex and capes and powered armor and green skin, something magical happens, and it becomes so exciting and so involving that you never want it to end. When you put it all in the hands of someone like Joss Whedon, who respects the material but not so much that he can’t have fun with it, it becomes something witty and wonderful and uniquely itself. This is pure nonsense in the best sense, in that it feels no need to be “topical” or “relevant” in order to render itself “important.” (Whedon stages the final climactic battle in New York City, and manages to evoke not one single hint of 9/11. I cannot tell you what a relief that is.) The Avengers knows that it is significant enough merely as its own comfortable, amusing, engaging self. Black Widow is the best character in the avengers for me. She is just awesome, All the characters were quite strong here but no comparison of her charm.",POSITIVE

"Apr 26, 2012"," For me, no superhero crew without Kick-Ass's Hit-Girl could ever be truly awesome, but this one is registering strongly on the awesome-o-meter nonetheless. It's an enjoyably absurd and absurdly enjoyable extravaganza, both delirious and surrealist. Six gifted protagonists – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) – have to conquer that wounded solitariness normally so essential to the superhero identity, and team up, forming a magnificent seven because Banner/Hulk counts twice. Painfully, therapeutically, they work out their intra-heroic tensions to battle a supervillain who has stolen a throbbing translucent blue object called the Tesseract. It's an energy source that could destroy Earth. So this is an anti-fracking parable, obviously, or possibly pro-fracking, but in any case a mightily enjoyable adventure, due to the sparkling script from director and co-writer Joss Whedon and in no small part to a tremendous performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the loathsome Norse deity, embarrassing his wholesome sibling Thor with Earth-domination plans and general uncalled-for evilness, at one stage actually making a whole crowd of people kneel to him – in Germany. That is an aspirational move for any bad guy. Hiddleston's Loki is breathy, petulant and long-haired in a bad way: often baring his teeth like a 12-year-old Jeremy Irons on Ritalin. He is a terrifically entertaining Brit-thesp villain in the traditional mode, and whatever actually happens to that Tesseract, the awful truth is that Loki steals the film. At one stage, the Avengers lock him in a Perspex cage, and Hiddleston gives it the full Dr Lecter, while Black Widow shows up, channelling Clarice a little. Convulsed with contempt, Loki spits at her: ""You mewling quim!"" Oh no you didn't, Loki. You did not just use the Q-word. Now you're for it. In theory, Dr Banner is on the team because of his brainy knowledge of gamma radiation. But, of course, he will be called on to lose his temper in the cause of righteousness and to that end he appears to be wearing the decency-preserving stretchy trousers that fray quaintly around the knees. Ruffalo actually makes Bruce and Hulk interesting, even droll characters (he also plays the monster in mo-cap), superior to the Eric Bana and Edward Norton incarnations, and his version ingeniously locates the big green monster's secret not in the over-rehearsed subject of ""anger management"" but depression and self-hate. Johansson has a nice interrogation scene at the very beginning, although she doesn't get much action in the rest of the film, and perhaps looks the tiniest bit self-conscious in the outfit. Downey Jr's Iron Man is an interesting member of the team in that he comes alive when he is in civilian mode: the haughty, competitive, Black Sabbath T-shirt-wearing plutocrat and self-appointed smartest guy in the room who snipes and backtalks compulsively, like an Aaron Sorkin character. He reprises the eyeball-swivelling ""in-helmet"" face shots that were a feature of earlier Iron Man films. The effect is to appear to give each Avenger a kind of rotating, recurring cameo in someone else's movie – Loki's, probably. The cameo effect reached a high point with the reappearance of Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's demure amanuensis Pepper Potts. It's all great stuff, although the final showdown is drawn out. There is arguably now nothing to stop the mega-villains of the world forming their own Traveling Wilburys' supergroup of evilness; perhaps the point is that it is precisely their innate wickedness and selfishness that prevents them doing this, yet if each could be persuaded that their interests were served by going into Molotov-Ribbentrop mode, it might create a kind of evolutionary crisis in the world of superhero battles; the Avengers would bring in more team members, and any film about the ensuing contest could last for days. Who is first among equals in the Avengers' assembly is a moot point. Hulk has the edge in brute strength, Captain America in bravery, Stark in brains, Black Widow in forensic psychology and smoking-hot sexiness, and Hawkeye in charisma – but Thor would appear to have the greatest emotional investment, as the brother of Loki and the one member of the team who is always vulnerable to accusations of going easy on their opponent or even letting him get away. Fortunately, Hemsworth keeps what can only be described as the acting lid on Thor's inner turmoil. The Avengers are about action, not agony.",POSITIVE
"Apr 26, 2012"," The superhero movie to end all superhero movies, The Avengers is some five films in the making and the culmination of Marvel’s ambitious plan to bring a handful of their biggest names together on the silver screen. To date the Avengers’ own films have been a mixed bag. Iron Man was the great success that kicked this whole thing off, with fans falling in love with Downey Jr.’s cocky Tony Stark and Jon Favreau’s glossy, bombastic visuals, but since then it’s been nearly all down hill. With the unsatisfactory taste of The Incredible Hulk still in our mouths, Iron Man 2 proved hollow fun two years later before another mixed bag in 2011. Captain America: The First Avenger’s WWII setting offered great potential though meant he had to be literally frozen into the modern day, final piece of the puzzle Thor, however, was our biggest worry for the overarching franchise. A languid, misdirected, badly written adventure, our negative review caused quite the uproar online, and I’m sorry fanboys, we hated this one too. With scientist Erik Selvig (Skarsgård) performing purportedly secret experiments on an all-powerful object known as the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s defences are breached as controlled by Loki, he opens a portal to Asgard before they make off with the cube. With an object of limitless power now in the hands of the most dangerous man on or off the planet, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Jackson) is left with no option but to put together a ragtag team of superheroes to try and save our world from total and utter destruction. Much of the talk surrounding The Avengers was how the crew and their stars would handle being on set together, sharing the limelight with so many other big names and egos, and not taking the lead in a franchise like they’re used to. But on the whole, they all perform well. Downey Jr. is slick as Iron Man/Tony Stark, packing a bunch of new toys on his suit and in a new home, Chris Evans is calm and collected as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth improves on his performance in Thor and Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Cobie Smulders all provide able backing away from the fore. Mark Ruffalo struggles as the recast Bruce Banner(/Hulk) – his timid approach never really works – though let out on a much longer leash, a confident Tom Hiddleston shows real chops as the fearsome Loki, not the tallest in stature, but there’s real anger behind his eyes and he isn’t afraid to show it. That people were worried about the actors bickering on-set was a massive red herring, in fact the thing that brings down The Avengers, is how their characters all interact on-screen. In a movie where most of the characters have a film in their pockets, the on-screen identities have egos of their own too. It was right the Avengers shouldn’t gel right at once, but how that get-to-know-you period is played out in the script gets massively out of hand. In each other’s faces non-stop, while disagreements very rarely came to blows, the constant tussle for control carries on and on, all at the narrative’s expense. The minute the movie starts to pick up any sort of momentum someone else butts in and we have to follow their train of thought for 30 seconds before they’re interrupted yet again. This isn’t the fault of the actors, they do of all what they’re asked, but Joss Whedon’s script is found severely lacking. It’s a pity because elsewhere on the screenplay, the Buffy creator has done sterling work. If you enjoyed the snippets of comedy in the two Iron Mans to date, you’ll have a field day with the sense of humour on show here. A couple of Tourette’s-esque physical outbursts from Hulk and a scene where Stark mocks the “Shakespeare” dialogue of brothers Loki and Thor will have you in tears. Whedon handles the action set-pieces well too, the (very) extended closing face-off has you on the edge of your seat with CGI detail reminiscent of Transformers 3. It’s a pity that by then it never build up an emotional involvement and you won’t really care who comes out on top. FAN THE FIRE is a digital magazine about lifestyle and creative culture.

"Apr 25, 2012"," A man turns to watch the climactic chaos that has Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America battling an alien invasion near Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal. “Superheroes in New York?” he sneers. “Gimme a break.” The man is Stan Lee, chief dreamer-upper of those muscular dudes a half-century ago in the pages of Marvel comics, making a cameo appearance in Marvel’s The Avengers. The movie — which opens this week in most of the world, and May 4 in North America — marks a slam-bang convention of superheroes, a ComicCon nerd’s multiple orgasm and the first, maybe the biggest, blockbuster of summer 2012. Gimme a break? A hundred million fans will shout: Gimme more! Marvel has been planning this soirée for ages. It salted the ground and whetted audiences’ appetites with the Iron Man movies (Robert Downey, Jr., as arms-merchant-turned-flying-guy Tony Stark) in 2008 and 2010, the Incredible Hulk reboot (Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, the physicist with anger-management issues) in 2008, and last year’s Thor (Chris Hemsworth as the hammer-happy Nordic god) and Captain America: The First Avenger (Chris Evans as the 97-pound-weakling given heroic bulk by World War II scientists). Joining this quartet are two prime Avengers who somehow never got their own movies: femme fatale Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), the Black Widow who abetted Stark in Iron Man 2, and, from Thor, the brooding Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), whose archery skills earned him the name Hawkeye. Those not familiar with the comic-book company’s pantheon may need to be told that Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Blade and dozens of other studs occupy different corners of the Marvel universe. The Greeks didn’t have this many deities. For the ultimate union-reunion, the Lee team called on writer-director Joss Whedon, whose inspired toying with genre tropes gave birth or at least new life to TV’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Dollhouse, plus the recent smarty-pants horror comedy The Cabin in the Woods and the Internet miniseries Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog, a musical comedy whose self-reflexive ingenuity was topped only by its all-sung DVD commentary. Reworking Zak Penn’s original Avengers script, Whedon sat on his usual impulse to go meta; instead he served as expert mixologist for this all-star cocktail party. The movie guarantees fast-paced fun without forcing anyone to think about what it all means, which is nothing. “A poem should not mean / but be,” Archibald MacLeish wrote. A pop-culture smash should not mean but do: break stuff, agitate the senses, keep the customer satisfied. The Avengers doesn’t aim for transcendence, only for the juggler’s skill of keeping the balls smoothly airborne, and in 3-D too (converted after production). At that it succeeds. In essence a sequel to Thor, the movie posits that the blond muscleman’s dark, anemic adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), after plunging into a wormhole at the end of last year’s film, has gained possession of the Tesseract, a cosmic cube that contains not only the secret of infinitely replenishable energy but a two-way door to the cosmos. Recognizing this imminent threat to the world, nay, the solar system, S.H.I.E.L.D. lord Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles the far-flung Avengers to face down Loki and his robot army. A floating aircraft carrier — the film’s coolest visual effect — serves as the temporary barracks for this all-star crew until the big climactic battle. Whedon has said that what drew him to the movie is the disparity of the various Avengers: “These people shouldn’t be in the same room, let alone on the same team — and that is the definition of family.” For a while, The Avengers becomes a $200-million mass-market version of one of those indie films about a dysfunctional family whose members come home for the holidays and rip off all the old scabs. And with six superheroes fighting for screen time, the combat sure is as strenuous among them as between them and Loki. Each has a powerful personality, and four of them have starred in their own movies; so a good chunk of The Avengers involves the collision of star egos, as if the aircraft carrier were a benefit-concert green room stuffed with celebrities bickering over billing. Thor, for example, spits darts at Loki in iambic heptameter (“You take the world as recompense for your imagined slight”), an antique flossiness that immediately exasperates Stark’s Iron Man. “Now there’s this guy,” he sneers. “Shakespeare in the Park.” They have a fight, strength against strength, ending in Thor’s WWE head butt; when Captain America arrives to call a truce, he gets rocked as well. This clash of the titans is also a mashup of acting styles — Hemsworth’s grandiloquence vs. Evans’s naïveté vs. the Method questing of Mark Ruffalo, who replaced Norton as Bruce Banner — while Downey’s snarky Stark provides the movie’s internal joking DVD commentary, but spoken, not sung. Ruffalo, who’s done many a Sundance drama, has called Banner/The Hulk “my generation’s Hamlet” — though anger, not indecision, is his character’s tragic flaw. The actor performs as if taking direction in improv theater from the late John Cassavetes. And the funny thing is, it works here, since Banner is supposed to be a creature apart, reining in his Hulk impulses until they’re useful in the group effort. He gets the best line when he asks, “What are we, a team? No, a time bomb.” Indeed, the Avengers are so busy arguing that they miss Loki’s first major onslaught. Defense of the planet: delayed, on account of infighting. OK, so it’s tough being a superhero. Stark refers to his Iron Man powers as “a terrible privilege,” and Banner says the Hulkamania roiling inside him is not a gift, “it’s a nightmare.” The supervillain also claims to have problems. “I am burdened with a glorious purpose,” Loki says, as if wreaking holocaustal havoc were a solemn duty, not a giddy treat. But he has fun nonetheless, more than any of his good-guy adversaries; after all, there are six of them and just one of him. And just as World War II hero Captain America was thawed out a couple of generations later to help fight some intergalactic Axis powers, so Loki has the vibe of an ’80’s heavy-metal star of Druidic bent, pried from his crypt and ready to give the universe a final Spinal Tap. As Stark aptly opines about medieval demon-god, “He’s a full-tilt diva.” When Loki isn’t pulverizing midtown Manhattan, he’s preening like a Ziegfeld showgirl and disgorging contemptuous aphorisms in the manner of an Oscar Wilde dandy with Tourette’s. He uncoils a string of lurid threats Natasha’s way, capping the torrent by calling her, “You mewling quim!” (That may be the first joking yoking of those two words in a century or so of pop culture.) Loki needs a good Asgard-kicking, and will get one from the Avengers, but his definitive putdown comes when, just to flex his nastiness, he materializes in front of the Stuttgart Opera House to send a thousand Germans quivering in fear. “In the end,” Loki says, “you will always kneel.” An old man (Kenneth Tigar), possibly a survivor of Hitler’s ovens, pipes up, “Not to men like you.” His grandeur enraged, Loki spumes, “There are no men like me!” And the old German whispers, perhaps from memory, “There are always men like you.” In Marvel-land, there are always, and almost only, men. A cosmos created and illustrated by comic-book guys for comic-book boys, and brought to the screen by later platoons of males, is by definition homoheroic if not homoerotic. The movie’s tenderest relationship is between Captain America and his No. 1 fan, S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), who asks nothing more than that the good Captain autograph the Agent’s superhero card set. There’s little room for women, except of the cartoon variety: the nasty spy Natasha, first seen in Madonna bustier and high heels, manacled to a chair in a sadistic interrogation. That she uses all these elements to secure her freedom is a nice Whedon touch, but also a tribute to the seductive gravity Johansson lends to her character. At the end Natasha shows she’s a good soldier, vanquishing a regiment of cyborg grunts and fighting off Loki’s biggest weapon: a monstrosaurus that flies through Manhattan like the Japanese turtle-lizard Gamera and crashes becomingly into the Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal. The movie’s climactic inspiration is to use the gleaming Deco spire of the Chrysler Building, just a block away, to conduct electricity back to the Tesseract. By then Whedon has given all the stars their closeups, on the way to restoring order to the universe — the Marvel universe, that is. Sequels to Iron Man and Thor are due next year, with the whole gang coming a bit after that, in an endless separating and recombination of the central team. The new enterprise is just one lavish element in the grand design. With plenty of incident, but limited glimpses into each superhero’s soul, the picture falls short of the finest Marvel film, the original Iron Man. For all the entertainment value of Whedon’s film, the question lingers: Is The Avengers too much for one movie, or not enough?",POSITIVE

"Apr 24, 2012"," I admit  to being to having doubts before seeing The Avengers.  I liked the idea  of bringing all these superheroes together but how was writer-director Joss  Whedon (Serenity) going to pull this off with so many leading  characters?  Would they all get enough screen time?  Would there be any room for  a plot?  Would the action sequences take precedence over character development? I guess  you could say I went through some kind of metamorphosis at the Brisbane premiere  last Friday night.  My scepticism was gone within half-an-hour and had been  replaced with a serious dose of enthusiasm.  As the closing credits started to  roll, I couldn’t wait to collect my mobile phone from security and spread the  word – The Avengers is f%#$ing awesome! Those new  to these characters should check out the earlier Marvel films before seeing  The Avengers.  I still think you’ll be entertained but you may struggle with  the backstory.  For example, the film doesn’t go into the torrid past between  Thor and his malicious brother, Loki.  Nor does it detail Captain America and  his whereabouts for the past 70 years. Those  that recall last year’s Captain America: The First Avenger will remember  a glowing blue cube known as the “Tesseract” that everyone wanted to get their  hands on.  The Avengers begins in the underground headquarters of the  Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforecement and Logistics Division (SHIELD)  with director Nick Fury (Jackson) trying to unlock the Tesseract’s secrets.  He  believes it has the capability to create a limitless source of energy for the  planet. That in  itself throws up a few interesting discussion points.  SHIELD appears to be a  well-intentioned organisation but can those in charge handle the responsibility  of such a powerful object?  How will they ensure that it is used for good  instead of evil?  The line between these two extremes is often very blurry, a  fact confirmed by a series of unexpected plot developments. These  questions soon become secondary to something far more important.  For those that  remember, last year’s Thor concluded with the hateful Loki (Hiddleston)  becoming trapped on Earth following a fight with his brother.  Loki is unable to  return home but he his intent to on quenching his thirst for power.  He steals  the Tesseract and through a series of well-articulated monologues, reveals his  plans on harnessing its force and giving the humans what they truly desire – to  be controlled. Our four  familiar superheroes, collectively known as The Avengers, will have to team up  for the first time to stop Loki before it’s too late.  Can they work together  though?  Iron Man (Downey Jr) is accustomed to being centre stage and doesn’t  like sharing the spotlight.  Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) is now trying to live a  normal life and would rather not reinvigorate his Hulk persona.  Captain America  (Evans) is still trying to come to grips with the 21st Century and  isn’t sure of his place.  Thor (Hemsworth) faces a conflict in that he would  rather try to talk sense into his brother than fight him once again. Robert  Downey Jr is at his comedic best as Iron Man (as expected) but I was surprised  by the number of genuine laugh-out-loud moments provided by the remainder of the  cast.  It’s Chris Hemsworth who gets the best line in the film – a reference to  his relationship with his brother.  I generally gravitate more towards darker  superhero flicks (such as Batman Begins) but the light-hearted style  adopted by writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn suits this situation and these  characters. The story  culminates with an exciting action finale that has been skilfully directed by  Whedon.  Loki is a great villain (part of me kind of liked him) and he puts  everyone to the test.  Oh, make sure you hang around for the end credits.  In  true Marvel style, there’s a quick peek at what’s in store for the next  instalment. Bring. It. On.",POSITIVE

"Apr 22, 2012"," The idea of bringing together a group of widely different superhero characters from what on the surface appears to be different fictional universes with their own sets of internal logic is ambitious to say the least. When it is done in comic books the multi-layered narratives, near infinite storylines and ever-evolving characterisations facilitate such a complex and potentially confusing experiment. Even with the benefit of having established the principal characters and their diverse origins in five preceding films – Iron Man (Jon Favreau, 2008), The Incredible Hulk (Louis Leterrier, 2008), Iron Man 2 (Jon Favreau, 2010), Thor (Kenneth Branagh, 2010) and Captain America: The First Avenger (Joe Johnston, 2011) – The Avengers film could have been a disastrous combination of fan-fiction, over hype and intense silliness. In fact, it does feel a bit like fan-fiction, but when the writer and director is a fan of the calibre of Joss Whedon that works in its favour. Who better to make something that is not only coherent, but exhilarating and fun from the teaming up of a loveably arrogant billionaire, a super soldier from World War II, a god from Viking mythology, a modern day Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde and a pair of elite spies? When Whedon spoke at the Melbourne Writers Festival in 2010 he mentioned his admiration yet frustration at films such as The Dark Knight, Watchmen and Kick-Ass for deconstructing and subverting superhero mythology. He felt that this post-modern approach to superheros was premature and in modern cinema the superhero hadn’t had a chance to be ‘constructed’ yet. So The Avengers is his attempt at making a film that more traditionally reflects superheros and their values, and throughout The Avengers the various characters express that sometimes there is a need to be a little old-fashioned. This translates into a film that may not contain the complexity of other superhero films in terms of ideas and characterisation, but is cynicism free. Old-fashioned doesn’t mean simplistic and the six characters are distinctive individuals who need to resolve their personal turmoils in order to work together collectively as a group for the common good. For good reason they don’t fully trust the covert organisation SHIELD, which has recruited them, and yet they are united by their opposition to the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who originally appeared in Thor. Politically The Avengers is a story of social cohesion where the extraordinary individuals work together for the good of society, or in this case to save the world. There is also an idea running throughout the film perpetrated by Loki who believes that humans prefer submission and that desiring freedom is a myth. His status as a god from another world and being compared to Adolf Hitler in one scene, presents these attitudes as belonging to organised religion and political oppression at their worst. The refusal to accept the subservient demands of a god is expressed in the film as a triumph for humanity to rise above such rhetoric, which is bluntly yet effectively expressed by a brilliantly computer-animated Hulk in a spin on his trademark ‘puny human’ line. While Whedon does an admirable job at giving every character equal screen time to demonstrate how crucial they all are, he does seem to refreshingly favour the characters who contribute with brains rather than brawn. Indeed, the more cheesy and pompous characters such as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) are far more enjoyable in The Avengers than they were in their original films as this time they have Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to ridicule them. Many of the film’s classic Whedon moments come in the form of witticism from Stark towards the others, although Captain America gets a great line about cultural references and a sight gag involving Thor and Hulk is the comedic highlight of the film. Whedon also favours tormented characters or characters with a shady past so Dr Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) gets the most sympathy throughout the subplot concerning his battle to reconcile that he harbours the Hulk deep inside him. The best individual action scenes are given to Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who has a shady past not to mention being the Smurfette of the film since the only other female characters are minor roles. Romanoff is also a classic Whedon strong-female character who uses the expectation that she is vulnerable to her advantage. Visually The Avengers adopts the same glossy look as the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the exception of The Incredible Hulk, which had a grittier and far more interesting aesthetic. Whedon works well within the limited visual style and while the first half of The Avengers cruises along with the same level of good-but-not-remarkable level of competency that the previous films had, the final prolonged battle sequence at the end is extremely impressive. Spectacle and action cinema that involves mass destruction has too recently been characterised by an over-reliance on disorientating rapid editing and random scenes of carnage to create the illusion of excitement. In The Avengers Whedon delivers a large-scale battle sequence in a metropolitan environment, but makes it genuinely engaging. There is a continual effort to present the effect that the over-the-top destruction has on the characters and the innocents caught up in it all, giving the spectacle a much-needed human element. Whedon also includes moments where the characters plan their strategy so that the scope of the spectacle is defined and the action the audience sees then played out has a context. Michael Bay and those who attempt to mimic his soulless approach to spectacle cinema could learn a lot from The Avengers. The Avengers is a good Joss Whedon film and an excellent Marvel film. It tonally fits into the previous films and plausibly integrates all the various characters and plotlines. It is another example of how much more enjoyable superhero narratives are once the origin story has been dispensed with so that the characters can properly start being explored. Whedon’s influence cannot be overstated, as without his flair for dialogue and ability to manage a diverse ensemble of characters, the film could have been a disaster. Instead The Avengers gets the combination of humour and sincerity right, pulls off a sensational sequence of spectacle as its finale and manages to keep the serious and not so serious fans more than entertained. Also, stay tuned as I’m working on a piece where I compareThe Avengers characters (the way Whedon writes them) to Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters. Great review…that does not give plot details away and unlike other reviews of this film gives some context to The Avengers and what motivated Joss Whedon to make the film.",POSITIVE

"Apr 20, 2012"," here is a highly enjoyable and entertaining ensemble-driven epic, whose greatest merit is maintaining an effective balance between the individual heroes (and their stories) and a tale in which they function as a group motivated by collective goal. Serving as closing night of the 2012 Tribeca Film Fest (April 28), “The Avengers” opens theatrically in some foreign markets prior to its U.S. release on May 4.  As the first feature of the upcoming summer season, this buoyantly upbeat picture should become a mega-blockbuster both domestically and internationally. “Marvel’s The Avengers” is based on the popular Marvel comic book series “The Avengers,” created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first published in September 1963. Shortly thereafter, it went on to become an institution in both the organizational and sociological senses of this term. The team originally consisted of Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Ant-Man and Wasp. Captain America joined the team in Issue 4, after being revived from a trap in a block of ice. “The Avengers” lacks visual coherence and thematic unity—how could it be with so many separate pieces in the big puzzle. The film is directed by Joss Whedon (mostly known for his TV work, creator of “Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,” “Serenity,” “Firefly”), a self-avowed fan and connoisseur of the series, who functions, among other things, as traffic controller (sometimes literally). But in the hands of another director, the picture could have been much worse. Based on Marvel’s famous (and notorious) superhero team, “The Avengers” brings together the main casts of the previous franchises: Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Surprisingly, the four men work well together, and in many moments, they project the impression that they actually fit into a bigger pattern and are members of one large unit. Four iconic characters, each boasting specific personalities, particular skills, and different social backgrounds, join forces under the leadership of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, well cast), director of the international peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D., who initiates a daring act to defeat an unexpected enemy threatening global safety and security. Added to the already glorious ensemble are Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the only significant female in the feature, but in toughness and smartness she’s on the level, right up there with the boys.. Despite pulling together the ultimate dream team, Fury and reliable confidant Agent Coulson must find a way to convince the Super Heroes to work with–not against–each other, when the powerful, greedy, and dangerous Loki gains access to the Cosmic Cube and its limitless power. It was Jackson’s enthusiasm about the project that led the producers to shoot that promising end credit scene and what he says to Tony Stark in the scene, “You’re part of a bigger universe. You just don’t know it yet.” Neither the director nor the actors take themselves too seriously, and they are all united with the goal of having fun and offering fun to their varies viewers in a calculated package that combines heroism and humor, action set pieces and joy, and occasionally even some witty bits and smart one-liners. “The Avengers” is an effective balancing act. Each and every character in ‘The Avengers’ is flawed in a dramatically interesting way and also has an intriguingly dynamic personal story–in addition to the collective goal of “saving the world.” The director and his writing partner will not be offended if I describe “The Avengers” as a well-oiled machine (or toy box), in which no less than eight characters are interfaced, each maintaining his/hers personal arc and yet make sense. There is another juggling act that Whedon pulls off successfully: He has made a picture broad enough to satisfy the expectations of the fans of the previous movies, while honoring the wishes of the fans of the comic books. (There is, of course, overlap between the two groups, but they are not the same, nor are their desires). When the experience is over, you are left with some joyous memorable moments, or thrilling bits of action, which derive directly from the writing and high-caliber performances. Whedon has said that his visual style as a director comes from comic books, and that his whole strategy of storytelling derives from panel art. In this specific respect, the movie’s visual scheme represents his approach, turning “The Avengers” into a spectacle, which is pleasing to the eyes.",POSITIVE
"Apr 20, 2012",It's phenomenally awesome. No review for the film really matters anyway because you'd be mental to miss the biggest superhero film event since we were pooped out from the big bang.,POSITIVE
"Apr 20, 2012"," Bringing superheroes together might have been a bad idea. All that chest puffing and portentous bluster could suck the oxygen out of the Earth's atmosphere. Thankfully writer-director Joss Whedon keeps things wonderfully bright and breezy, making a long film whizz by faster than a speeding bullet. This is a Marvel-only party, of course, which is why Superman is a no-show. Iron Man is their biggest hitter - at least in box office terms - and that means Robert Downey Jr is the star of the show. His greatest weapon is his sharp tongue, which he uses to steal scenes like there's no tomorrow. And there mightn't be, because an invasion of Earth is imminent. Naturally, the egomaniac butts heads with the oh-so-noble Captain America (Chris Evans reprising his 2011 role) who's still a bit stiff after being kept on ice since World War II. Mark Ruffalo is the most subdued of the gang, but he has to be, or else he turns green and smashes stuff up (replacing Ed Norton as Hulk). Chris Hemsworth returns as that other loveable lunk Thor, a year after his debut outing. It's his bad egg of a brother Loki who is the cause of this little get-together - again played by Tom Hiddleston, who manages the incredible feat of being scary and silly all at the same time. The action is almost non-stop. Hand-to-hand skirmishes are slotted in between the major set-pieces; the first aboard the Avengers' floating fortress and the last in New York where they band together like the most audacious WWF tag team ever, pouncing upon an army of flying lizard things. The end of the world may loom but Whedon creates a good time atmosphere, seeming to take inspiration from old WWII capers like The Dirty Dozen where the fun is as much derived from the rat-a-tat banter between the guys as it is from the big explosions and the butt-kicking. Scarlett Johansson is drafted in from the Iron Man series to keep the boys in line and Jeremy Renner plays back-up for Loki as the archer Hawkeye (after a brief turn in Thor). She and he have a history in service, but otherwise there isn't too much backstory to slow things down. Samuel L Jackson is the common denominator in all the above franchises, playing head of the planetary defence league SHIELD. Clearly, this film is part of a bigger campaign by Marvel (it's no accident that Thor and Captain America have closely preceded it), but the superheroes are affectionately portrayed, outweighing any cynicism in the venture. Pernickety comic book fans may take issue with the light-hearted approach, gaps in logic and a clash of mythologies, but Whedon doesn't patronise viewers. He strikes just the right tone and where there are rough edges, he uses Iron Man's wry humour to smooth them out. The effect is totally disarming. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ. Registered in England.

"Apr 20, 2012"," Avengers Assemble may be a $220 million blockbuster, but it is not as revolutionary as the last feature director Joss Whedon was involved in, The Cabin In The Woods, made for a mere $30 million. All the same, Whedon has delivered a highly commercial Hollywood product that’s funny and builds to a stirring climax. Not only fanboys will love it. The biggest weakness is its premise, which is that the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is plotting the downfall of the human race, yet we never really know why.  Moreover, until the special-effects finale, Hiddleston — even teamed with sidekicks Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) and Stellan Skarsgard (as Professor Erik Selvig) — isn’t scary enough.  Still, the Loki threat is enough to make top security boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) mobilise an impressive array of superheroes to defeat him.  They are Loki’s sibling rival Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Tony Stark alias Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner alias The Hulk — played by Mark Ruffalo far more sympathetically than in the two Hulk movies. Less reliable is Tony Stark, proud to be a loose cannon: ‘Apparently, I’m — what is it? — volatile, self-obsessed and don’t play well with others.’ Captain America tries to take Stark down a peg or two by telling him: ‘Big man in a suit of armour. Take that away and what are you?’ Downey replies coolly: ‘A genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist.’ But this is a superior example of its kind, with sequences on a par with the best Spiderman and Batman movies. And technically, it’s a real marvel.",POSITIVE
"Apr 20, 2012"," When the playground scuffle over whose turn it was to play Captain America started, you can picture the young Joss Whedon arriving with a homemade shield. A Marvel fan since childhood, the writer-director's confident take on the Avengers series carries the mark of a piece of expensively assembled fan fiction, albeit stitched together with a lightness and wit that will just about carry the casual viewer through two-and-a-half-hours of comic geek nirvana. That said, those unfamiliar with the Avengers universe should ride out the opening act with a glossary to hand. The nefarious demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has teamed up with alien race the Chitauri and stolen the Tesseract – a powerful energy source that could potentially destroy the world. In response Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), director of shady government agency SHIELD calls on Iron Man, Thor, the Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America to whack the god of mischief into submission. Drawing together the meaty backstories of a half-dozen iconic heroes is no easy task – even with the help of the blockbuster Iron Man, Thor and Captain America movies that set up this showcase – but Whedon proves himself a master plate-spinner. Each hero is given a convincing story arc, even if – as in the case of Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye – it's as shallow as revoking his lone wolf status to allow him to team up. Crucially, the wise-cracking id of Robert Downey Jnr's Iron Man is balanced out by instilling a hearty dose of fear in one of the team's central figures, thanks to a beautifully honed performance by Mark Ruffalo. He plays Bruce Banner – the brilliant scientist who turns into the uncontrollable colossus Hulk when angered – as a man afraid of himself. Banner, dressed in clothes that hang off him (as if preparing for the worst) is an exhausted presence, a man so tortured by his divided-self condition that he once put a bullet in his mouth, but ""the other guy spat it out"". Unfortunately, this being a comic-book movie, the need for biff-bang-pow tends to prevail. The hero-against-hero slugfest that the comics have been trading on for decades is entertaining at first, but the various combinations of Hulk v Thor v Iron Man quickly blow themselves out. Perhaps it would have helped if they had a properly combative adversary. Hiddleston's Loki, while a gloriously over-boiled caricature of the emotionally crippled boy-man we met in Thor, is backed by a horde of faceless, disposable allies, and it's hard to see how they put up much of a threat. So the biggest challenge The Avengers face is each other. The greatest conflict is between themselves. There's not much to see after they've sorted out the pecking order, but until then it's fun to watch Whedon pitch his heroes against each other. Child's play, maybe, but entertaining all the same.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 20, 2012","Big, brash and very funny, Joss Whedon's Avengers is equal to the sum of its parts - and for once, that's no faint praise. Suit up.",POSITIVE
"Apr 20, 2012"," Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man is going to get the best zingers, but don't underestimate Chris Evans' spot-on portrayal of the Star-Spangled Avenger to win fans. The All-Star Game of modern superhero extravaganzas, The Avengers is humongous — the film Marvel and its legions of fans have been waiting for. It’s hard to imagine that anyone with an appetite for the trademark’s patented brand of fantasy, effects, mayhem and strangely dressed he-men will be disappointed; not only does this eye-popping 3D display of visual effects fireworks feature an enormously high proportion of action scenes, but director Joss Whedon has adroitly balanced the celebrity circus to give every single one of the superstar characters his or her due. Worldwide box-office returns will be, in a word, Marvelous. During the past several years, Marvel has, with accelerated speed, expanded its cinematic repertoire of over-muscled, generally double-identitied heroes not otherwise encumbered by exclusive contracts with other studios — most notably The Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America — to arrive at the point where this summit meeting of superhuman good guys could be assembled. (A prominent relative, Spider-Man, has his own reboot coming up this summer.) After this, the characters will go their separate ways — Iron Man 3 starts shooting next month, with second chapters of Thor and Captain America set to roll within the year — before gathering again before too many movie summers pass. With the bundle this one will make, the pressure will be on make it happen sooner rather than later. As creatively variable and predictably formulaic as the Marvel films have been, this one will not only make the core geek audience feel like it’s died and gone to Asgard but has so much going for it that many nonfans will be disarmed and charmed. This is effects-driven, mass-appeal summer fare par excellence, that sought-after rare bird that hits all the quadrants, as marketing mavens like to say. As enormous as the production is, though, the appeal of the ensemble cast makes a crucial difference; you get enough but not too much of each of them, and they all get multiple scenes to themselves to shine. To boil down the particulars of this latest attempt to bring ruin to all we hold dear, sinister Thor villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston, looking like Richard E. Grant’s effete younger brother) has gained possession of the tesseract, an all-powerful substance contained in an opaque cube that not only provides unlimited sustainable energy but a portal to outer space. “I am burdened with glorious purpose,” Loki purrs while taunting eye-patched S.H.I.E.L.D. master Samuel L. Jackson (finally with something to do in a Marvel film) with the promised arrival of his army of outer-space warriors. Down but not out, the good guys begin assembling on board one of the cooler modes of transport seen anywhere in a while, a giant (and beautifully rendered) aircraft carrier that can rise out of the water to become an invisible space ship — hence, a helicarrier — and serve as a first-rate staging area for operations against Loki. Among those arriving on board are Bruce Banner, otherwise known as The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, the third actor, after Eric Bana and Edward Norton, to give the green giant a big-screen go); Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), a sultry, scarlet-haired assassin first seen turning the tables on nasty interrogators despite being strapped to a chair; Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Loki’s long-locked brother and bearer of the universe’s mightiest hammer; and Mr. Old School himself, Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans), a World War II hero who’s not quite up to speed on all the latest super-technology but carries an impenetrable shield. For his part, Robert Downey Jr.‘s Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man, joins incipient girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) for a brief tete-a-tete before deigning to lend his special expertise to the cause. Although they really should be saving their energy for the battle against Loki and his minions, the Avengers team can’t resist getting into it with each other from time to time. One could say that this is just gratuitous time-killing, but it could as persuasively be argued that watching The Hulk duke it out with Thor for bragging rights as to who’s tougher is what such a film is all about; at least there’s nothing perfunctory about it, as there is when superheroes routinely dispatch aliens and enemies who exist just to get blown away. The friction between Iron Man and Captain America, for example, is all about style and attitude; the former is far too irreverent and glib for the latter, for whom patriotism and coming to the rescue are not laughing matters. With only one feature directorial credit to his name, the middling 2005 sci-fier Serenity, Whedon of Buffy fame would not have been the first name on most people’s lists to tame a potentially unwieldy project. But from a logistical point of view alone, he imposes a grip on the material that feels like that of a benevolent general, marshaling myriad technical resources (including an excellent use of 3D) while, even more impressively, juggling eight major characters, giving them all cool and important things to do. Never, though, does the film stall to dwell on individual characters just to give them screen time; the heroes are almost always doing something that relates to the challenge at hand. Even when the impudent Loki is held prisoner in seemingly inescapable circumstances, there is still forward movement, which crests and then crashes with tsunami force near Grand Central Station in Manhattan; uncountable numbers of alien warriors arrive from the skies, accompanied by strikingly designed metal leviathans that undulate like skeletal monsters of the deep as they cruise over New York seeking targets. In this titanic battle, which occupies most of the film’s final half-hour, all the Marvel heroes’ talents are put to the test. In addition to Iron Man making a quick trip to outer space to deal with an incoming missile, special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), is so good with a high-tech bow and arrow that you imagine they’ll have to dragoon Katniss Everdeen into the sequel as a guest star just to see who’s better. For his part, Jackson’s Nick Fury has his hands full restraining army generals from nuking the Big Apple in order to off the aliens. It’s clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone’s seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again. A quick coda reveals, to well-versed fans at least, who the new adversary in the next installment will be, underlining a reality as absolute as the turning of Earth: Especially after this, Marvel movies will go on and on and on.",POSITIVE

"Apr 19, 2012"," After years of setup in the form of individual hero-centric films, The Avengers had a hell of a lot to live up to. Not because the films that precede it are all awesome (they’re a mix of the good, the bad and the okay), but because this ambitious effort needed to transcend what preceded it and move beyond origin stories to immerse the audience completely in the Marvel Universe. Whilst visual flair may not be Joss Whedon’s strongest suit, the decision to offer him the director’s chair proves inspired as he goes about demonstrating the innate understanding of how to make an ensemble tick that we’ve seen in his TV work (Buffy, Firefly, Dollhouse), depicting a believable world populated by larger-than-life superheroes and striking a balance in the screen time they’re given that doesn’t diminish their individual stature. The Avengers suffers from some of the plausibility problems that plague the genre, but when it’s doing either of the two things it does best (making its farfetched characters as believable as you can without going down the gritty Dark Knight route, and breaking into some great action sequences), it lives up to its immense potential. It’s also the first Marvel film to capture the epic scale, excitement and humour of its source material, best captured in the Rampage-style carnage of the film’s huge final conflagration in which the audience is dazzled rather than bewildered by the way Whedon stages his action and uses CGI and alternately teased into bouts of laughter and applause.

Several  years in the making, The Avengers concludes a drawn out journey that Marvel Studios first began with Iron  Man, where their tent pole characters (Captain America, Thor, Iron  Man, Hulk) would team up in one massive film to the giddy delight of  superhero fans everywhere. With such  a well-orchestrated tease, the question remained whether the hype of such an  undertaking could be met. Answer to that is a gamma radiated, super serum  filled âyesâ, for Marvel had the foresight to bring in fanboy favourite Joss Whedon  (creator of cult TV series Buffy and Firefly) who had the  brains, balls and credibility to make not only the best superhero movie thus  far, but one of the best action films seen in some time. Yet  there is trouble in superhero paradise with egos clashing from the get go. With  these characters already established in their own films, Whedon  (who shares a screen story credit X-Men scribe Zac Penn) side-steps any origin  story distractions and focus on other character elements, namely the vanity and  trust issues these superheroes have. The  cast complies with strong performances. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, and  Chris Hemsworth once again prove their mettle as the power trio of Iron Man/  Captain America / Thor. Tom Hiddleston brings the evil as deceptive immortal  Loki. Then there are the new kids on the block, with special mention to a  wonderfully cast Mark Ruffalo who brings wit, intelligence and pain to the hot  potato role of Bruce Banner / Hulk (previously played by Eric Bana and Edward  Norton). Yet the  biggest star in The Avengers is  Whedon, who pulls off a magnificent balancing act not only between the  different personalities on screen (who all have their time to shine), but also  between drama, wit and action. And  boy does Whedon especially deliver on the action front, with spectacular action  sequences featured throughout culminating in the best kind of down-town smash âem  up, alien invaders vs superheroes, action set piece one could ever wish for. The Avengers proves that blockbuster  filmmaking doesnât have to be dumbed down to provide popcorn munching escapism.  It is also proves that a superhero movie can obtain conviction without resorting  to darkening its image (ala Batman). ",POSITIVE
